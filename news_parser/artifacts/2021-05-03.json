      "title": "Covid: Packed pilot festival brings the good times back - for one night",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Live music,The Lathums,Music festivals,Liverpool,Coronavirus pandemic,Music",
      "text": "A pilot concert in Liverpool on Sunday saw the largest number of people to have legally crammed into such a small space in the UK since the start of the pandemic. They had a euphoric night - but a lot is riding on its success.\nIt's a sight that has existed only in fond, fading memories for the past 13 months, and has sometimes seemed destined to be consigned to the carefree pre-Covid age - 5,000 closely-packed music fans dancing and jumping, and singing in unison at the top of their lungs.\nNo masks. No social distancing. No rule of six. No risk of fines.\nJust having a good time with your mates, drinking beer from cardboard pint pots, queuing up for Portaloos, getting rained on - and listening to live music in a melee of strangers who are hearing, seeing and feeling the same things as you.\nJust like old times. And hopefully like times still to come.\nSunday's mini-festival in Liverpool's Sefton Park was one of the government's official trial events to research how large gatherings can safely take place again.\nAll ticket holders had to take a supervised lateral flow test at one of four testing centres in the city the day before, and were only allowed in if the test was negative.\nThey were also strongly encouraged to take more sensitive PCR tests on the day of the show and to do so again five days later, on Friday. That will be crucial to working out whether there was any spread of the virus.\nScientists are also studying other factors like audience movement and interaction, ventilation, duration, catering and alcohol consumption. Mysterious people with clipboards wandered around making notes.\nIt's all with the aim of working out how summer music festivals can go ahead after 21 June, when stage four of the government reopening roadmap will, in theory, see the end of restrictions on social contact.\nWhen the gates to the Sefton Park site opened at 4:30pm on Sunday, the first fans came in - ripping off their face masks with \"a sigh of relief\", as one put it.\nAt 5.30, before any of the bands had started, an already sizeable crowd was in front of the stage, where a DJ was spinning indie anthems. They weren't just shoulder to shoulder, but on each other's shoulders, arms aloft, cardboard pints flying as the chorus to Common People kicked in.\nBy 6:30, a girl was being sick on the grass next to the Filthy Vegan food van.\nIn the big top, the first act was on stage - Liverpool singer-songwriter Zuzu. \"Hello!\" she said, and the stimulation-starved crowd roared as if she had scored the winning goal in the Merseyside derby.\n\"It was just unreal,\" she said of the experience afterwards. \"It felt like jumping out of an aeroplane. My heart was going in a big way. \n\"It was incredibly emotional. I tried to keep it together on stage. But during the last song I choked up, and when I came off stage, I'm not even ashamed to admit that I cried. I fully cried. It was amazing.\"\nThe crowd was even more pumped up by the time the headliners, chart-topping indie band Blossoms, arrived two hours later.\nThe pilot was supposed to test a \"normal\" gig, but the amount of pent-up energy that was released, and steam that was let off, meant the atmosphere was more heightened than was ever normal in previous years.\n\"It was way better than normal,\" said one fan, Aneesa Habib, 19, afterwards.\n\"It was so crazy being back surrounded by people,\" said her friend Joby Mathew, 20. \"It was incredible. To be in the middle of everyone, just moving around, you feel like you're part of something bigger than yourself.\"\nFestivalgoer Jack Young, 21, said being at an event with no restrictions was \"like a weight had been lifted off everyone's shoulders\".\nAnother called Chloe said: \"It was nice to be in the moment. You felt alive again. We need more. I've missed it a lot.\"\nAlex Druce, 26, said it was like having \"a flashback to two years ago\". He added: \"It was like reverting back to the way things used to be. We've basically been like a caged animal for about two years, haven't we?\"\nSome concertgoers did admit they had been anxious about being in a crowd again after so long. The testing process largely proved reassuring, and its success will help determine whether we see scenes like this again soon.\nSunday's six-hour show followed two nightclub pilot events, which were attended by 3,000 people per night in the city on Friday and Saturday.\nThe live music trial was staged by Reading, Leeds and Latitude promoters Festival Republic. \n\"We've worked really hard to do everything right behind the scenes - all the testing - to create an atmosphere that didn't feel sterile and didn't feel as though you were in a test or a pilot show or an experiment,\" managing director Melvin Benn said.\n\"And we've created an atmosphere that people will remember from 2019. People will think, this is what they have been missing.\"\nSome festivals, such as Glastonbury, have already been cancelled for this summer, while others are hanging in the balance. \"There's an awful lot of festivals riding on the success of this,\" Benn said.\n\"That's huge economically, but it's huge from an emotional point of view, from a human wellbeing point of view. I've seen people break down here with the emotion of seeing people again, and I fear that if we don't bring that back, that isolation that a lot of people are living through will just become unbearable.\"\nThe fate of the forthcoming festival season does not just hinge on being able to prove that individual events can be safe.\nOrganisers are also calling on the government to provide insurance in case there's another Covid spike and festivals have to be cancelled at short notice, after spending large sums on preparations.\n\"The truth is, unless the government provide it, there's real vulnerability for the rest of the summer,\" Benn said. \nHe invited arts minister Caroline Dinenage to see the set-up of the Sefton Park pilot for herself. Speaking on site, she said the insurance idea was \"still on the table\" and was \"with the Treasury\", adding: \"If we can do it, we'd like to.\"\nReading and Leeds, the biggest events left in this summer's calendar, are sold out. Asked whether they could happen without government insurance, Benn shrugged and gave no comment.\nOn stage, as Blossoms struck the opening chords of their final song Charlemagne, someone in the crowd lit a flare, more people climbed onto friends' shoulders, and more arms were raised in the air.\n\"We'll see you again soon,\" singer Tom Ogden promised as the tune finished, leaving the crowd to file out of the tent, and back to reality."

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Holidays,Travel,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. \nWhat are the current rules?\nYou can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unless you have to self-isolate because you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. \nAll holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. \nIf you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. \nAnyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before.\nPeople travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law.\nSome UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding. Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

      "text": "Singer Billie Eilish has spoken about the pervasiveness of sexual misconduct, describing it as being \"everywhere\".\nIn an interview with Vogue, she said she doesn't \"know one girl or woman who hasn't had a weird experience, or a really bad experience\".\n\"And men, too - young boys are taken advantage of constantly,\" she said.\nVogue interviewer Laura Snapes wrote that it also \"happened to Eilish when she was younger\", but added \"the details are hers.\"\nThe Grammy award-winning, American singer-songwriter, 19, was discussing her new single Your Power, which is about an abuser taking advantage of a minor.\n\"It's an open letter to people who take advantage - mostly men,\" she said. \nShe also unveiled a new look in her photoshoot for the magazine, using it as an opportunity to hit back at those who discuss what she wears.\nDescribing the look as \"classic, old-timey pin-up\", the star's signature black and green hair is now platinum blonde (although the blonde colour first appeared a few weeks ago).\nShe said the colour change made her feel \"more like a woman, somehow\".\nEilish's previous baggy style of dress has often been hailed as refreshing when compared with that of other famous women who wear tighter, more revealing clothing, but Eilish told the magazine her dress sense was more about the onlookers' issues than her.\n\"Don't make me not a role model because you're turned on by me,\" she told Vogue, adding that her body \"was the initial reason for my depression when I was younger\".\n\"Suddenly you're a hypocrite if you want to show your skin, and you're easy and you're a slut and you're a whore. If I am, then I'm proud. Me and all the girls are hoes. Let's turn it around and be empowered in that. Showing your body and showing your skin - or not - should not take any respect away from you.\"\nShe said it was a male problem, not a female one.\n\"I really think the bottom line is, men are very weak,\" she says. \"I think it's just so easy for them to lose it. 'You expect a dude not to grab you if you're wearing that dress?' Seriously, you're that weak? Come on!\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Taliban,Hillary Clinton,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has warned of \"huge consequences\" of President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan.\nMrs Clinton told CNN there was a risk the Taliban - the Islamist group ousted in 2001 by the US-led invasion - could retake control.\nThe US aims to complete the withdrawal by 11 September. \nHowever, the Taliban have been carrying out more attacks. \n\"This is what we call a wicked problem,\" Mrs Clinton told CNN. \"There are consequences both foreseen and unintended of staying and of leaving,\" she said.\nMrs Clinton, like Mr Biden a Democrat, was a strong supporter of the US intervention in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. \nMr Biden wants to complete the withdrawal by the 20th anniversary of the attacks later this year. \nAt least 2,500 US troops are currently deployed as part of the 9,600-strong Nato Afghan mission. \nThe president said the US pull-out was justified as American forces had ensured that the country could no longer be a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West.\nAsked about the president's decision by CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday, Mrs Clinton said, \"Our government has to focus on two huge consequences\", notably the resumption of activities by extremist groups and a subsequent outpouring of refugees from Afghanistan.\nShe said the potential collapse of the Afghan government and a possible takeover by the Taliban could result in a new civil war. \nMrs Clinton said it was also important to protect the \"many thousands of Afghans\" who had worked with the US and Nato during the conflict, and said a large visa programme should be set up to provide for any refugees.\nThe remaining US troops in Afghanistan began formally withdrawing on 1 May, amid escalating violence.\nAfghan security forces are on high alert for reprisal attacks.\nOn Monday, Afghan officials said at least seven soldiers had been killed in a Taliban attack on a military outpost in the south-western Farah province. \nThey said militants had blown up the post after digging a tunnel for about 400m (1312ft) to access it from a nearby house. One soldier had been captured by the insurgents, they said. Other reports put the Afghan army casualties much higher. \nSpeaking at a press conference in London on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration was \"very focused on a deliberate, safe and orderly\" withdrawal of troops, but that the US would continue to assist the Afghan government. \n\"Even as our forces are pulling out of Afghanistan, we are not withdrawing - we are not disengaging,\" he said, adding that if US troops were attacked before leaving the country, \"decisive action\" would be taken. \nHillary Clinton represents the view of foreign-policy experts: The US should show its strength and deploy its military. Her criticism of Biden's plan reflects this sensibility. \nHer criticism matters, in part because so many in the foreign-policy establishment, both Democrats and Republicans, agree with her. Condoleezza Rice, who served as secretary of state under President George W Bush, has also warned about the risks of withdrawing troops, and the threat of terrorism. \nYet liberals, such as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, do not think the troops should be there. Nor do many Americans. A 2019 Gallup poll showed 58% of Democrats think the war in Afghanistan has made the US less safe from terrorism. \nClinton's views are important, but Biden has the support of many Americans. Plus, he's the president, and has made his decision. His views are the ones that matter now, not hers.\nAs vice-president to Barack Obama, Mr Biden frequently opposed a large US presence in Afghanistan. \nHe has said that the US will continue to support Afghan government forces - and encourage peace negotiations with the rebel Taliban leaders. However, correspondents say that may not be enough to ensure stability in the region.\nLast year, then-President Donald Trump - who was keen for US troops to return home and criticised US military interventions for being costly and ineffective - set in motion a full US withdrawal from Afghanistan by 1 May this year.\nThe US then started withdrawing troops after the Taliban promised to stop carrying out attacks on international forces and \"soft targets\", and said it would not allow al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controls.\nOctober 2001: US-led bombing of Afghanistan begins following the 11 September attacks on the United States\nFebruary 2009: Nato countries pledge to increase military and other commitments in Afghanistan after US announces dispatch of 17,000 extra troops\nDecember 2009: US President Barack Obama decides to boost US troop numbers in Afghanistan by 30,000, bringing total to 100,000. He says US will begin withdrawing its forces by 2011\nOctober 2014: The US and UK end their combat operations in Afghanistan\nMarch 2015: President Obama announces his country will delay its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, following a request from President Ashraf Ghani\nAugust 2017: US President Donald Trump says he's sending more troops to fight a resurgent Taliban\nSeptember 2019: Protracted peace talks between the Taliban and the US break down\nFebruary 2020: After months of on-off talks, the US signs a troop withdrawal agreement in Doha with the Taliban"

      "title": "Apple faces Epic Games in court",
      "tags": "Fortnite,Apple",
      "text": "After months of hype and warring words, Epic Games is finally getting its day in court with Apple.\nThe trial began on Monday - and is one of the most important in Apple's history. \nApple boss Tim Cook will be giving evidence, the first time he's given testimony at a trial. \nAt stake is the future of the App Store and the amount it charges developers - a wildly lucrative money spinner for the company. \nThe trial got off to a slightly chaotic start. The public hearing failed at first to mute those who were listening in via phone call, meaning calls from fans for the return of Fortnite to mobiles were accidentally broadcast.\nThe storm began in August last year, when Epic Games laid a trap for Apple. \nIts hit game Fortnite implemented its own in-app payment - bypassing Apple's 30% charges. \nApple promptly kicked Epic Games off the App Store.\nBut Epic Games was waiting for just that.\nIt slapped Apple with a 65-page lawsuit - and had even prepared a high production video, a spoof of Apple's iconic 1984 advert for the Apple Mac.\nEpic Games has for years claimed the charges imposed on it by Apple are extortionate. \nTheir argument is simple: that Apple's control over the App Store is anti-competitive. \nIt believes that developers should be able to make apps for smartphones without having to pay large sums to Apple (and to Google for Google Play purchases). \nSpotify, Match and Tile are just a few of the many companies that have also claimed Apple's charges are unfair. \nApple is estimated to have made hundreds of millions of dollars from Fortnite alone in charges. \nEpic Games' big argument is: if they don't want to pay, then where else do they go to sell their products? \nApple's App Store and Google's Google Play are the dominant global app stores, outside China. \nEpic Games has tried to sell Fortnite away from these two stores. It tried to \"sideload\" the app on Android phones - to try and avoid Google's own 30% charge. However, not enough people downloaded it away from Google Play. \nEpic Games' reluctant conclusion: if you want to make games for smartphones you have to be on either the App Store or Google Play. \nBut unwilling to lie down and accept the charges - which it calls an \"Apple Tax\" - Epic Games decided to sue Apple instead. \nWorryingly for Apple, many of its App Store critics come from across the political divide.\nIn a Senate hearing two weeks ago, Apple's Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer was grilled by lawmakers. Politicians of all stripes - usually so divided on policy - were united in their attacks on Apple. \nDemocrats Amy Klobuchar and Richard Blumenthal and Republicans Mike Lee and Josh Hawley all took up similar lines of questioning. \nSenator Klobuchar said that Apple's App Store was a \"literal monopoly\".\nAnd on Friday the European Union announced that it was charging Apple for its behaviour on the App Store. \nEpic Games has timed the lawsuit perfectly.  \nThe key question the judge will have to answer is whether Apple's App Store is an \"essential facility\", a sort of public utility that no one company should control. \nMatt Stoller, an anti-monopoly campaigner, believes so.\n\"Everybody knows that Apple is in charge of what should be public rights of way. It would be easiest if the judge just rules in favour of Epic [Games], that would fix it,\" he says. \nApple can afford good lawyers though. So what's Apple's defence? \nFirstly, Apple says it invented the App Store and as a private company it can charge what it wants. \nIt also says the 30% charge to developers is the industry standard for gaming, and competes not just with Google Play but with Microsoft, Steam, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo.\nInfluential tech blogger John Gruber says Apple has a point. \n\"In terms of the actual split, 70/30 is pretty standard across the board. One of the things that really stands out about Epic Games' argument is that they have no complaint whatsoever. It's all very hand wavy, and very much a PR argument, not a legal one.\"\nApple also says that its payment system is fair to smaller developers. It says 83% of apps and 76% of games on the App Store are free - developers pay no commission. \nAnd they say that although their top rate charge is 30%, most developers pay no more than 15% in charges. \nApple argues it also oversees an App Store vetting process, making sure the Apple ecosystem isn't compromised by dodgy apps. That costs money. \nHowever it's thought the amount that Apple spends on this process is a tiny fraction of the amount it receives from developers. Critics like Matt Stoller also question how effective Apple's vetting procedures are.\n\"There are all sorts of apps that have scams that Apple doesn't catch. So their arguments about safety and security are sort of nonsense,\" he says. \nSo what are Apple's chances? John Gruber thinks they're good. \n\"I do think that on legal grounds, Apple is in a very good position. But the risk is very high because [if they lost] it would disrupt the whole business model of the app store\". \nMatt Stoller says that antitrust cases are notoriously hard to predict.\n\"Antitrust law, as it's practiced in the US, is a complete mess. So we have no idea. The law basically depends on what the judge had for breakfast.\"\nThe trial is expected to conclude in the last week of May. However, even if Apple wins, the fight over how Apple runs its App Store will rage on. \nJames Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

      "tags": "Dominic Raab,West Hampstead,Iran,Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case",
      "text": "Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said Iran's treatment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe \"amounts to torture\" - the strongest language the UK government has used to date.\nIn a BBC interview, Mr Raab said Tehran was using her in \"a cat-and-mouse game\" for diplomatic leverage, after she was sentenced to prison again.\nHe also said he believed she was being held illegally under international law.\nThe 42-year-old British-Iranian mother has been held in Iran since 2016.\nFollowing the foreign secretary's interview, an anonymous official cited on Iranian state TV suggested the UK had paid a \u00a3400m debt to free her - but the Foreign Office insisted its position was unchanged.\nIt said Iran has made the claim before, without Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe having been released. A Foreign Office spokesman said it continued \"to explore options to resolve\" the case and would not comment further while \"legal discussions\" were ongoing.\nHer husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said the family had not been updated but welcomed the signals from Tehran over the long-running dispute as \"a good sign\".\n\"My instinct is that it is actually a sign we are in the middle of negotiations rather than at the end of them,\" he told the BBC. \n\"But we will keep our fingers crossed - for ourselves, and all the other families caught up in this.\"\nThe wife of Anoosheh Ashoori, another British-Iranian serving a 10-year sentence in Iran, said she feared her husband had been forgotten. Sherry Izadi says he is being held in a prison cell with 15 other people and is suffering from Covid symptoms.  \n\"We sincerely hope any deal includes all dual nationals, who deserve the same treatment,\" she said. \"This is a window of opportunity for the government to make a deal and, if they miss this opportunity, I'm worried he's going to rot in jail.\"\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a charity worker from West Hampstead, served a five-year sentence for spying charges, which she has always denied, before being convicted of propaganda against the regime and sentenced to a further year in jail and one-year travel ban last month.\nHer husband maintains she is being used as a bargaining chip by Tehran in a dispute with the UK over an unpaid debt from the 1970s related to a military contract, and as leverage in talks over the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Raab said: \"Nazanin is held unlawfully, in my view, as a matter of international law. I think she's being treated in the most abusive, tortuous way. \n\"I think it amounts to torture the way she's being treated.\"\nHe said there was an \"obligation on Iran to release her immediately and without condition\".\nAsked if she was being held hostage, Mr Raab said it was difficult to argue against that characterisation.\n\"It is clear that she is subjected to a cat-and-mouse game that the Iranians, or certainly part of the Iranian system, engage with and they try and use her for leverage on the UK.\"\nThe foreign secretary said her imprisonment was \"not solely\" about the debt owed by the UK for failing to deliver tanks to Iran. \n\"We've said that debt is something we want to have resolved,\" he said.\nBut he said the wider context of the forthcoming elections in Iran, which will vote in a successor to President Hassan Rouhani, and the talks in Vienna over the nuclear deal were more significant issues.\nMr Ratcliffe, who has not seen his wife since 2016, welcomed the foreign secretary's remarks about torture, saying they set down a \"rhetorical and legal red line\".\n\"This has weight in international law. All states, including Iran, have an obligation to prohibit torture,\" he told the BBC.\n\"You can't un-torture Nazanin but the government can make sure this is not happening to others.\"\nA medical assessment carried out for the human rights charity Redress found Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had post-traumatic stress disorder from her treatment in Iranian prisons and the uncertainty about her fate.\nShe was released in March due to the coronavirus crisis and has been living under house arrest. She has not yet been taken back to prison and plans to appeal against the latest conviction. \nHer daughter, Gabriella, was with her mother when she was arrested and returned to the UK in 2019 to begin school.\nThe six-year-old has not yet been told about her mother's latest prison sentence, with Mr Ratcliffe saying he felt it would be better to wait until she has to return to jail before breaking the news."

      "text": "Four people died and some two dozen people were injured after a boat got into trouble off the coast of San Diego in a suspected smuggling operation.\nThe overcrowded 40-foot (12m) cabin cruiser broke up on a reef near Point Loma on Sunday morning, tipping some 30 people into the water, officials said.\nA major rescue operation was launched to help the injured on shore and retrieve seven people from the sea. \nOfficials said the boat captain was in custody on suspicion of smuggling.\n\"Every indication from our perspective is that this was a smuggling vessel used to smuggle migrants into the United States illegally,\" Jeff Stephenson, Supervisory Border Patrol Agent, said. \n\"We haven't confirmed the nationality of the people involved, but our agents are with many of them at the hospital and the man who we believe was the operator... The investigation's still unfolding.\"\nRescuers were alerted to the incident near the Cabrillo National Monument, at about 10:30 local time (17:30 GMT).\nRick Romero, of the San Diego Fire Rescue Lifeguard, said first reports indicated three or four people needed help but they quickly realised it was \"going to be a bigger situation with more people\".\n\"Once we arrived on scene, the boat had basically been broken apart,\" he said. \"Conditions were pretty rough: five to six feet of surf, windy, cold.\"\nHe said people were in the water being taken out to sea by the rip current, while people on shore needed CPR and treatment for hypothermia and other injuries.\nIn a statement, the US Coast Guard said 29 people had been accounted for, of which 24 people were alive, four people had died and one was in a critical condition.\nFootage from the scene showed large pieces of debris washing up on the beach. Jet skis, three more rescue boats and specialist rescue equipment including cranes were brought in to help with the rescue. \nAt the same news conference, Mr Stephenson said it was not yet known where the boat had come from but many smuggling boats come from Mexico's Baja coastline.\n\"The smugglers, they don't care about the people they're exploiting. All they care about is profit to them,\" he said. \"These people are just commodities. So you can see that in the way they treat them, inadequate safety equipment, really poorly equipped vessels and giving them minimal.\"\nMr Stephenson said there had been a 92% increase in the number of apprehensions linked to smuggling by sea in 2020, compared with the previous year.\nUS Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had announced on Friday that it was beefing up its patrols of the coastline over the weekend to try and deter smugglers.\nBorder patrol agents detained 21 people - 15 men and six women - found on a small open boat, a panga, off the coast of San Diego early on Thursday. They were Mexican nationals with no legal status to enter the US, the CBP said. Two suspected smugglers who were on board the boat will face federal charges."

      "text": "German police have arrested three men and a fourth is being held in Paraguay for allegedly running one of the world's biggest online networks for sharing images of child sex abuse.\nThe international operation, involving several police forces, targeted a dark net platform called Boystown, which has now been taken down.\nOfficials say Boystown had more than 400,000 registered users.\nThey say some images showed the most serious sexual abuse of young children.\nThe dark net is an internet area beyond the reach of mainstream search engines. \nThe German-led investigation involved law enforcement agencies in the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, the US and Canada. \nThe EU police agency Europol says it will also examine intelligence gained from the operation, and \"more arrests and rescues are to be expected globally\" on that basis.\nSeveral related paedophile chat sites on the dark net were also dismantled, Europol says.\nGerman police say three men detained since mid-April are believed to have run the paedophile network: one aged 40 from Paderborn, one aged 49 from the Munich area and a 58-year-old from north Germany who has been living in South America for several years. He was detained in Paraguay's Concepci\u00f3n region under an international arrest warrant, and German authorities have asked for his extradition. \nThe fourth suspect is a 64-year-old from Hamburg who was allegedly one of the most active members, responsible for more than 3,500 posts.\nThe dark web is a notorious layer of the web that many people never see. \nYou won't find its pages on mainstream search engines such as Google - you'll need a specialised web browser like Tor to access it at all.\nOnce you're in, if you know how to look, you'll find all sorts of activity. \nThe dark web itself is not illegal and neither is being on it. Indeed it is used by some for whistleblowing and activism in parts of the world where censorship is rife and such behaviour is heavily punished. \nBut there is plenty of material on it that is absolutely outside of the law.\nThere are forums where harrowing images of child sexual abuse and other extreme explicit content is shared or traded. In the many illegal marketplaces you'll also find banned drugs and weapons for sale. \nAnonymous sellers spring up as quickly as they disappear. Payment is generally in cryptocurrency and there are no consumer rights or customer support here if the merchant - or indeed the entire store - suddenly vanishes.\nIt happens, and it's not unusual. That's in part because law enforcement is getting better targeting at these operations. I've met several experts who specialise in tracking illegal traders across the dark web - and, much like all criminals, cyber criminals also make mistakes.\nRead more on related topics:"

      "text": "India has recorded its highest daily coronavirus death toll since the pandemic began - a day after it became the first country to register more than 400,000 new cases in a 24-hour period.\nIts health ministry said 3,689 people had died within the past 24 hours.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi met the health minister on Sunday morning to review the crisis.\nHospitals are battling to treat patients amid a chronic shortage of beds and medical oxygen. \nAmid the surge, results came in from elections in several Indian states. They have been closely watched to see if voters would punish Mr Modi's handling of the crisis. \nHis BJP party suffered a setback in West Bengal, a state the party had hoped to capture. The state was instead comfortably held by the incumbent.\nIndia has recorded more than 19 million cases of coronavirus - second only to the US. It has also confirmed more than 215,000 deaths, though the real toll is thought to be far higher.  \nExperts have cited low testing rates and the number of people dying at home, especially in rural areas, as contributing factors to under-reported figures.\nThe country's previous highest daily death toll, also reported this week, was 3,645. \nBrazil and the US have both registered daily tolls of more than 4,000 during the course of the pandemic.\nIn India, distressing images of families begging for hospital beds and life-saving supplies have been emerging for more than 10 days, while morgues and crematoriums remain overwhelmed.\nTwelve people died on Saturday at Delhi's Batra Hospital after it ran out of oxygen - for the second time in a week. \nThe Times of India newspaper reported 16 deaths in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh due to oxygen shortages in two hospitals, and six in the Delhi suburb of Gurgaon.\nDelhi High Court has now declared it will start punishing officials if life-saving supplies don't make it to hospitals.\n\"Water has gone above the head. Enough is enough,\" said Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Patil.\nAll adults in India are now eligible for a coronavirus vaccine. But the planned launch of a nationwide drive on Saturday faltered as several states said they did not have enough doses to start vaccinating those aged 18-44.\nDespite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, the country is suffering an internal shortage and has placed a temporary hold on all exports of AstraZeneca to meet domestic demand.\nThe Health Ministry said on Sunday that 84,599 people in the age bracket had been given a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. \nIndia has been using two vaccines - the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab (known locally as Covishield) and another made by Indian firm Bharat Biotech (Covaxin). The Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine has also been approved for use, and the first 150,000 doses arrived on Saturday. \nCountries worldwide have sent a flood of emergency medical supplies. As of Thursday, 40 nations had sent shipments.\nThe first of several planes from the US carrying oxygen cylinders, masks and rapid diagnostic tests arrived in Delhi on Friday.\n\"The bond between the oldest democracy & the largest one keeps getting fortified,\" India's health ministry tweeted.\nThe US had previously been criticised for imposing a ban on sending raw materials for vaccines abroad, which limited India's ability to make more of the AstraZeneca jab. The measure was lifted last week.\nA German military aircraft with 120 ventilators reached India on Saturday, while the UK has also sent hundreds of pieces of medical equipment.\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that he would \"always look very carefully at any request\" to help as India deals with its record surge of Covid cases.\nBut asked if the UK should pause the vaccination of younger, less vulnerable people to send doses abroad, Mr Raab said he had not received any request from India \"on that specific issue\".\nThe central government is reluctant to impose a national lockdown, which the prime minister has called a \"last resort\". Senior leaders fear the economic impact, after last year's lockdown saw India's output fall by a record 24% in April-June compared to a year earlier.\nThe human cost could also be severe. Last year's 68-day national lockdown saw millions of India's migrant workers make arduous journeys back to their home villages after they found themselves unemployed and running out of money. \nThe poor, especially undernourished children and pregnant women who rely on government programmes, found it difficult to access benefits. Immunisation programs were halted, and those suffering from serious illnesses struggled to access crucial health services.\nBut several states and union territories do have restrictions in place.\nOdisha was the latest to announce a two-week lockdown, joining hard-hit Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka and West Bengal. \nOther states, including populous Uttar Pradesh, have either night curfews or weekend lockdowns.\nThe Indian Express newspaper reports that India's Covid-19 taskforce, which advises the government, is pushing hard for a nationwide lockdown to help subdue the devastating second wave.\nDr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said on Saturday that an \"immediate\" shutdown for a \"few weeks\" could break the chain of transmission in India."

Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

In Northern Ireland, hospitality may reopen on 24 May. \nThe hospitality bosses pointed to recent findings by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which suggested that the hospitality sector was associated with a relatively low risk of Covid-19 transmission, although it was slightly higher than leisure and retail.\nIn statement, the two men also expressed disappointment that the call for faster reopening dates was described as \"academic\".\nMr Osmond, a former director of Pizza Express, said: \"This case is not 'academic' for an industry that is losing \u00a3200m every day it remains closed, for the over three million people who work in our industry, or for the tens of thousands of businesses, suppliers, landlords and contractors forced into bankruptcy by Government measures.\"\nThe sector has been one of the worst-affected by coronavirus shutdowns.\nTrade body UK Hospitality warned recently that about that \u00a32bn in rent is owed by hospitality businesses with 40% of premises still currently negotiating over unpaid rent with landlords.\nAbout 20 to 30% are still in talks over how to settle debts from 2020 lockdowns, it said, calling for the government to step in as a ban on evictions for commercial tenants and business rates holidays end.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"Our roadmap sets out a cautious approach to easing restrictions, based on the best scientific evidence available at the time. We published a full range of scientific papers alongside it, on 22 February.\"\n\"It is widely acknowledged that the risk of transmission outdoors is significantly less than indoors, which is why businesses have already been able to open in some outdoor settings, ahead of indoor hospitality later this month,\" they said.\nThey added that the government has provided support to the sector through schemes such as the Restart Grant scheme, the furlough scheme and VAT cuts.\nAbout 750,000 business in \"hospitality and other sectors\" had benefitted from business rates relief, they said."

On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nCampaigners want this to be built on further, leading to a law change to remove barriers so anyone facing homelessness in Wales can access support.\nBBC Wales asked each political party whether they support the campaign, and what they would do to tackle homelessness if elected.\nWelsh Labour said it had a \"proud track record\" of tackling homelessness and has housed more than 7,000 people into temporary accommodation during the pandemic and made additional funding available to local authorities.\nIt has promised to build 20,000 low-carbon homes for social rent and introduce a scheme restricting rent for anyone at risk of homelessness.\nA Plaid Cymru spokesperson said the party would change the law to ensure everyone in Wales who needs housing and homeless services can access it, abolishing the priority need system and delivering 50,000 social and affordable homes.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said they would introduce a \"housing first\" model and commit to tackling rough sleeping in Wales by 2026 by appointing a Homelessness Commissioner, as well as bringing 150 empty social housing properties back into use for people at risk of homelessness.\nPropel said it would being in a new law to end \"injustices\" in Welsh housing, \"meaning a person will simply be housed, no ifs, no buts\", including compulsory targets for local authorities to bring empty properties back into use.\nReform UK said it supported the campaign, and would make it a statutory duty for councils to put a roof over everyone's head every night of the year. \nUKIP said it would reduce demand and pressure on housing stock by implementing \"firm and fair\" immigration controls\", and has pledged to end homelessness amongst veterans in the next Senedd term.\nThe Green Party said it wants to ring-fence funding for councils to provide shelter to every rough sleeper who wants it, and they should be given more guidance and power to control local rents.\nThe Liberal Democrats and Abolish the Welsh Assembly did not respond."

This is not some small family foundation that's going to fall apart because a marriage is falling apart,\" he said.\n\"Bill and I are equal partners,\" she told the Associated Press in an interview in 2019. \"Men and women should be equal at work.\"\nIn her recent memoir The Moment of Lift, she wrote about her childhood, life and private struggles as the wife of a famous figure and and stay-at-home mother with three kids. \nWorking together at the foundation had made their relationship better, she argued. \"He's had to learn how to be an equal, and I've had to learn how to step up and be an equal,\" she wrote.\nApart from her work with the foundation she founded Pivotal Ventures, an investment company focused on women and families, in 2015.\n\"The world is finally waking up to the fact that none of us can move forward when half of us are held back,\" she said at the time. \"The data is clear: empowered women transform societies.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson has accused Welsh Labour of \"separatism\" on a Bank Holiday Monday visit to Wales.\nThe UK prime minister was campaigning in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, as parties began the last week of the Welsh Parliament election campaign.\nMr Johnson said voters wanted to see politicians working together to beat the pandemic.\nBut Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford it was Mr Johnson who was encouraging support for Welsh independence.\nOn a visit to Swansea, Wales' first minister said there would be a mandate for more powers in Cardiff if voters backed a majority supporting more devolution.\nMeanwhile, Plaid Cymru said a pro-independence government in Wales would have more leverage over Westminster.\nVoters go to the polls in the Senedd elections on Thursday.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nMr Drakeford, who has been Welsh Labour leader since 2018, is opposed to independence, unlike Plaid Cymru's Adam Price who has made it a key part of his campaign.\nBoth parties also argue for more issues in Wales to be in the control of ministers in Cardiff rather than London, such as policing and justice.\n\"I don't think the people of this country are obsessing right now about further constitutional change,\" Mr Johnson, who was visiting the Conservative party office in Barry town centre, told BBC Wales.\n\"I think what they want to see is politicians working together to beat the pandemic.\"\nThe prime minister said he was a \"believer in devolution\" but he wanted to see \"people using their powers effectively\".\nBut he added that both Plaid Cymru and Labour \"are obsessed with the constitutional issues, trying to go for more separatism. I don't think that's the right way forward.\"\n\"I think we should be working together,\" he said.\n\"I think we should have a situation which people can be proudly emphatically Welsh, but also see the merits and the beauty of doing things together.\"\nMr Drakeford said there could be a mandate for further powers to come to Cardiff if a pro-devolution majority is returned to the Senedd after the election.\n\"It could well be that they will be a majority of voters in Wales supporting parties who want to see devolution strengthened and entrenched,\" he said.\n\"And that's a message that the UK government really will need to heed.\n\"I often think that the prime minister is the greatest recruiting sergeant for people who believe that Wales will be better off outside the United Kingdom. \n\"I hope the prime minister would act in ways that reinforce those of us who make the positive case for the union rather than undermining us\".\nAsked about his remarks captured in a S4C documentary when he called the PM \"awful\" after a Cobra meeting, Mr Drakeford said: \"My views of the prime minister are a good deal kinder than many people who have worked in Downing Street with him\".\nMeanwhile, Mr Price, Plaid's leader since 2018, said the Welsh government would have \"greater leverage\" in London if it was led by a pro-independence party.\n\"That's exactly what we will get from the election of a Plaid Cymru government,\" he said.\n\"A strong Welsh Government with a strong voice able to negotiate a far better deal than anything we've seen under a Labour government over the last 22 years.\"\nMr Price, who was campaigning in Ystrad Mynach in the constituency of Caerphilly, said there had been \"one economic plan\" from Welsh Labour. \n\"It's all been about just looking to salvation from companies coming in from outside, that's not going to build the economic foundation for the future. \n\"We've got to shift the focus from just relying on foreign-owned companies coming in for a while - we've got to invest in our own homegrown businesses.\nWelsh Labour said this was a \"false choice\".\nMr Drakeford added: \"I absolutely think that we need to invest in indigenous companies and to grow indigenous companies that then stay rooted here in Wales.\n\"But a Labour government is never going to turn our back on people who want to come and invest in Wales from elsewhere.\"\nJane Dodds, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, spent the day campaigning in the Wrexham area of north Wales.  \nShe said her party had a \"big message\" on Covid recovery in the final few days of the campaign and that was putting the economy, mental health and the planet \"first\".  \nThe Liberal Democrats had one Senedd seat at the last election. Its former occupant, Brecon and Radnorshire's Kirsty Williams, is quitting the Welsh Parliament after 22 years.\nMs Dodds denied that her party was facing a fight for survival in mid-Wales. \"Every single vote important,\" she said, \"it doesn't matter where it is.\" \nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said they were focusing on the \"health recovery\".\nLeader Jane Dodds, who is in Llanidloes and Wrexham on Monday, said: \"We owe the NHS so much, we are pledging a proper pay rise for front-line nurses as well as a commitment to pay all social care staff the real living wage. \n\"Welsh Lib Dems understand the stress and pressure that our NHS heroes are under and we want to support put healthcare staff, not just through a pay rise but by investing in new staff and new technology to benefit both staff and patents,\" she said."

      "title": "Coronavirus: Why some mosques are closed to women during Ramadan",
      "tags": "Ramadan,Muslims,Islam,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Millions of Muslims around the world are currently observing Ramadan. But some mosques in the UK are not allowing women inside to pray. \nThe BBC contacted 29 of Britain's largest capacity mosques to find out their policy for the month of Ramadan. \nFive do not have a women's area, while six mosques responded to say they cannot accommodate women due to Covid-19 health and safety reasons. Twelve were open for women, while seven didn't respond. \nWhile many families pray together at home, worship in mosques tends to be gender segregated, with many people believing that allows people time to focus on prayer.\nSometimes women will pray behind men in the same space. More often, mosques will have two separate rooms for each gender to pray in, with the men in the main prayer hall and the women in an alternative space.\nBut not all mosques make room for women. More than a quarter of British mosques don't have a space for women at all. In the mosques that do cater for both men and women, the spaces aren't always the same size. \nAnita Nayyar, who co-runs Open My Mosque, to campaign for more inclusive mosques, says women often get \"second class\" areas. She says they can be smaller than the men's section, in basements, behind locked doors and up flights of stairs, or sometimes only open sporadically.\nAnd the pandemic has exacerbated the problems. \n\"We have received reports that during the pandemic, mosques who used to accommodate women pushed women out either to create socially distanced space for men or because they felt they could not organise stewardship to ensure the women's facilities adhered to guidelines,\" she says.\nAmong those found by the BBC to not be admitting women, were the Greenwich Islamic Centre and Baitul Futuh mosques, in London, as well as the Jamia Al-Akbaria, in Luton, and the Lanarkshire Mosque, in Scotland.\nJulie Siddiqi, a women's rights campaigner who wants to make British mosques more accessible for women, published an Instagram video talking about how her mosque, the Jamia Masjid and Islamic Centre, in Slough, was not open for women this month. \nShe received hundreds of messages from other British women with similar experiences.\n\"I understand about health and safety,\" she says. \"Our mosque has lots of space, it's totally doable in this mosque. So let's just be clear - this is way beyond Covid. This is a mindset, a mindset that tells men they can decide whether women can go to pray in a mosque.\"\nHer mosque told the BBC the decision had been made after consulting its female volunteers who were \"concerned about the lack of female resources\". It said it could not put volunteers at risk.\nSome believe that while daily prayer in congregation is compulsory for men, it is a voluntary option for women, who can worship at home.\nLondon's Baitul Futuh mosque - another to restrict access to women - said it was \"not a requirement in Islam for women to offer congregational prayers at the mosque, whereas it is for men\". \n\"As soon as restrictions ease, women will be able to use the mosque for prayers once again,\" the mosque added in a statement.\nSheikh Ibrahim Mogra, an imam in Leicester, says \"men and women should both be equally accommodated in mosques\", but added: \"Some traditions state it is better for women to pray at home than congregate at mosques, so the Muslim position is divided.\"\nOther mosques have changed their stance. The Hounslow Jamia Masjid and Islamic Centre had originally planned to be men-only - but changed its policy after a conversation around women's access to mosques began to emerge online at the start of Ramadan.\nZara Mohammed, president of the Muslim Council of Britain, said its guidance for mosques calls for fair access for both men and women - \"during Ramadan or other times in the year\". \n\"Women must be involved in the development and role of mosque life and we encourage more constructive dialogue and solution-focused approaches to ensuring increased access and opportunities for Muslim women.\"\nCorrection 7 May 2021: A previous version of this story reported a worshipper's account of being told by the Milton Keynes Islamic Centre that it was closed to women during Ramadan. In fact this was referring to a note carried on the centre's website which was out-of-date and has since been removed. Milton Keynes Islamic Centre confirms that the mosque was closed to women for a short time in December and March and has since been open, with limited capacity, to both and men and women. As a result we have removed this section of the article."

It was removed by archaeologists in the 19th Century, exposing the underground network of tunnels where gladiators and animals were held before the Roman blood sports began.\nMr Franceschini said the \"extraordinary\" new floor would allow visitors to \"see the majesty of the Colosseum\" from its centre.\n\"It's another step forward toward rebuilding the arena, an ambitious project that will aid the conservation of the archaeological structures while getting back to the original image of the Colosseum,\" Mr Franceschini said.\nThe minister said cultural events could be held in the Colosseum once the floor had been restored to its former glory.\nMilan Ingegneria was one of 10 competitors who answered the Italian government's 2020 call for bids to design a new floor for the Colosseum.\nThe winning design involves installing hundreds of wooden slats that can be rotated to allow natural light and air into the underground chambers.\nItaly's culture ministry said the new 3,000-sq-m (32,300-sq-ft) floor would be entirely reversible, should plans for a new design be made in the future.\nThe Colosseum was the biggest amphitheatre in the Roman Empire. \nGladiatorial fights and other public spectacles were hosted in front of crowds of at least 50,000 people. \nWhile the coronavirus pandemic has limited tourism, the Colosseum remains one of Italy's most famous landmarks. Before the pandemic struck, the monument attracted about 7.6 million people in 2019."

      "text": "The Covid pandemic has led to the loss of about 660,000 jobs in the UK's hospitality sector this year, the industry's trade body has told MPs. \nUK Hospitality chief Kate Nicholls said that at the end of 2019, the sector was the third-largest employer in the UK. \nThe industry was forecast to generate one-in-six net new jobs this year, she said, but instead some 20% of the sector's 3.2 million jobs had gone.\nHospitality sector revenue is down 40% compared with last year, she said.\nMs Nicholls said businesses should be enjoying a \"golden\" time of year, since more than a third of annual revenue is usually earned between Halloween and New Year's Eve.\nBut instead she said the sector was in \"intensive care\" and called for pubs and restaurants to be able to open with as few restrictions as safely possible in December. \nBusiness leaders from a range of industries were giving evidence to the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee of MPs. \nThe boss of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson OBE, said there had been job losses across big and small retailers, particularly in clothing and footwear stores.\n\"I spoke to one business yesterday who has seen their turnover fall from $200m to $160m. They are on their third round of redundancies,\" she said. \nEarlier, the chair of the BEIS Committee, Darren Jones, said it was unfair that some big retailers were able to keep trading during lockdown, while many small shops were closed.\nSpeaking to BBC 5 Live's Wake Up To Money programme, Mr Jones said: \"It's evidently unfair that some retailers can sell everything and others cannot sell anything at all.\"\nHe said it was \"unfortunate\" ministers had been unable to set out a mechanism for retailers to continue to operate in a Covid-secure way during lockdown, while other countries such as Germany had done so. \nThe Labour MP also called for more financial support to go to businesses forced to close, and criticised some supermarkets - which have stayed open during lockdowns - for accepting public money for help with business rates. \n\"Christmas is the most important time of the year for retailers and we don't just want them to survive the Christmas shopping period but to be able to survive into the new year,\" he said.  \n\"Ministers need to quickly be able to get to a position where they can allow retailers to operate in a Covid-secure way.\""

      "text": "Warning: This article contains spoilers for season six of Line of Duty, including Sunday's finale\nThe final episode of BBC One's Line of Duty was watched by an average of 12.8 million viewers on Sunday night, a record for the hit show.\nThe BBC said it was the most watched episode of any drama since modern records began in 2002, although that does not include soaps. \nViewers tuned in to find out the identity of criminal mastermind, H.\nThe finale commanded 56.2% of the UK's TV audience, according to overnight figures.\nThe five-minute peak audience was 13.1 million, between 21:45 and 21:50, which was the end of the interrogation of the \"fourth man/woman\", and its aftermath.\nThe last time a TV drama got higher overnight viewing figures was an episode of ITV's long-running police drama Heartbeat in February 2001, which had an overnight audience of 13.2 million.\nOvernight viewing figures are generally not considered as relevant as they used to be, given the increase in on-demand services and changing viewer habits but Line of Duty has bucked the trend, with fans keen to watch live to find out the latest plot twists and avoid spoilers.\nAlmost four million more people tuned in to Sunday's episode compared with the previous series' finale, which was seen by 9.07m in 2019.\nThe show - which first aired in 2012 - was created by British writer Jed Mercurio, and stars Martin Compston as DI Steve Arnott, Vicky McClure as DI Kate Fleming. and Adrian Dunbar as Superintendent Ted Hastings and Kelly Macdonald as DS Joanne Davidson.\nCharlotte Moore, BBC's chief content officer said: \"Addictive event television, Line of Duty has kept the nation guessing for the last seven weeks, so it's no surprise that last night's jaw dropping finale set a ratings record.  \n\"Jed Mercurio is a master of his craft, and I would like to congratulate him and the entire cast and crew for delivering such an incredible drama series. I'm looking forward to having a conversation with the team about where we go next and what the future of the series might be.\" \nBut despite high interest in the finale, reviews for the series finale were decidedly mixed.\nThe episode saw the much-anticipated unveiling of mysterious criminal mastermind H as DCI Ian Buckells, played by actor Nigel Boyle.\nThe future of anti-corruption unit AC-12 was also left hanging in the balance. But the ending left some disappointed.\nMetro's Harry Fletcher said Line of Duty's \"frustrating\" series six ended in a \"whimper\". \n\"Its usual complexity seemed to go out of the window during the pivotal interrogation scene with Ian Buckells (Nigel Boyle), which saw him unmasked as the Fourth Man [also known as H],\" he wrote in his three-star review.\nThere were \"flashes of [the show's] usual brilliance\" in the finale, he said, but it \"left plenty of questions, with narrative arcs tossed aside with abandon\".\n\"Sunday's instalment felt like an ending of sorts, despite the fact there may well be more episodes in future,\" he said. \n\"But will anyone be talking about the Line of Duty series six finale in a decade's time, or even remember how the dullest cop in the service was revealed as the big bad?\"\nIn another three-star review,  for the Guardian, Lucy Mangan cited the unveiling of H as evidence that series six of Line of Duty has \"superficially at least, delivered\". \nBut she still suspects that the big reveal, for many, will have been an anti-climax. And, looking back on the series as a whole, Mangan wanted more.\nThere were plot holes throughout the season, she wrote, adding that show had lost key elements along the way - including the connection between Kate and Steve.\n\"It was all fine,\" she wrote. \"But, oh my, you should have seen it when it was good.\"\nIn the New Statesman, Rachel Cooke's review ended with a similar thought. \n\"It was, for a while, the greatest cop show ever made - and then, suddenly, it wasn't any more,\" she wrote. \"Whimpers all round. Especially from me.\"\nOn a more positive note, The Times' Ben Dowell gave the finale four out of five stars - saying it gave viewers \"a greatest hits compilation: a prison van interception, pistols drawn, plus a faint whiff of political parable\".\nWhile he admitted the reveal of H as Buckells was \"hugely disappointing on one level\", he argued \"at least this felt plausible\". \n\"Of course, it was staring us in the face all along,\" he wrote. \"We knew H couldn't spell, and it was this lapse which 'definately' nailed him, thanks largely to a forensic search of police records that AC-12 could have done ten episodes ago.\n\"We wouldn't have had as much fun, though.\"\nAnita Singh, writing in The Telegraph, gave the episode four stars: \"I'd have been less surprised if it turned out to be Ted's wee donkey. Dept Supt Ian Buckells, the blundering fool, had conned us all.\"\nBut she felt another series would be \"a series too far\".\n\"The BBC will be desperate for Mercurio to come back with a seventh series - the show has enjoyed the kind of monster ratings that broadcasters rarely see these days - but this felt like the right place to end it.\"\nIn the Daily Mail, Jan Moir said the conclusion did not let her down - describing the show as \"a richly satisfying final episode, one that made up for the longeurs of previous weeks\". \n\"Many loose ends were tied up,\" she said. \"Although one big question remains: Will there be another series?\"\nBoyle revealed he was shocked when Mercurio told him he was the \"fourth man\".\n\"I was buzzing with excitement! I never suspected it because I know how Jed leads people down the garden path with really good red herrings, so I didn't really pay too much attention to things like Buckells' golf clubs etc., but clearly I should have done! \n\"I'd fully bought into the idea that Buckells was low on competence levels but looking back it all makes sense.\"\nHe added: \"I've been sitting on it for a long time. The only person I told was my wife, nobody else, I know how much is at stake!\"\nOn Twitter, however, most viewers seemed disappointed.\nOne fan, Louis Molyneux, wrote: \"We waited a decade for Buckles to be H?\" TV presenter Piers Morgan labelled the ending \"a tad underwhelming\". Chef Michael O'Hare called the ending \"horrendous\".\nAt one point on Sunday night, #fuming was trending in the UK - seemingly as a response to the reveal of H. \"Think we need a public inquiry into the systemic failings of the finale... #fuming\", wrote one poster.\nMeanwhile, unimpressed Times Radio presenter Matt Chorley linked the audience's reaction to the protests at Manchester United's ground on Sunday. \n\"BREAKING: Thousands of angry fans gather outside the Line of Duty stadium,\" he wrote.\nJournalist Simon McCoy was another disappointed viewer.\nBut there were some who were satisfied with the ending.\nHistorian Tom Holland said it was the \"perfect 2021 conclusion\".\nAnd broadcaster and fellow historian Greg Jenner argued that it \"wasn't a bungled ending\".\n\"That's one of the greatest plot-writers in modern TV deliberately choosing to frustrate you in the hope it makes a bigger point.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The authorities in the Indian capital Delhi have called for help from the army as the city grapples with a brutal second wave of Covid-19 cases.\nHospitals in the city are in crisis, with intensive care beds full and an acute shortage of medical oxygen.\nDelhi's government wants the army to run Covid care facilities and intensive care units.\nAcross India, case numbers since the start of the outbreak are closing in on 20 million.\nThe country has seen more than 300,000 new cases a day for nearly two weeks straight while deaths stand at 220,000.\nExperts say total Covid cases and deaths in India are likely to be much higher, citing lack of testing and patients dying at home without being seen by doctors. \nDelhi, which this weekend reported record daily deaths at more than 400, wants the army to run medical care with oxygen facilities for around 10,000 patients, and a further 1,000 intensive care units.\nDeputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that with healthcare \"overwhelmed... it will be a timely help to the people of Delhi if the Ministry of Defence, with the considerable resources at its command, is tasked with the responsibility to provide and man the additional Covid health facilities\".\nHe also asked for \"urgent\" help transporting much-needed oxygen.\nIndia has already ordered its army to send its oxygen from army reserves to hospital while retired military medical personnel have been called up to help. \nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has repeatedly said that the city is not getting enough oxygen from the federal government, which allocates oxygen quotas to states.\nBut federal officials deny there are shortages, saying the challenge has come from transportation.\nIndia produces thousands of tonnes of oxygen a day, but some experts say the supply crunch comes from a lack of investment in distribution networks.\nDelhi hospitals have resorted to sending SOS messages on social media to secure supplies. For residents, hours spent in queues to top up portable canisters have become part of daily life.\n\"It's a battle we are fighting every day,\" said Dr Gautam Singh, who runs the Shri Ram Singh hospital.\n\"Half of my hospital staff are on the road with cylinders to get them filled every day, going from one place to another.\"\nThere are severe strains outside of the capital too. In the southern state of Karnataka, 24 people died in one hospital, but the government there has denied reports that all of them died due to a shortage of oxygen.\nIndia's Covid crisis has been compounded by a sluggish vaccination campaign.\nDespite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, there is a shortage of supplies. Since January, just over 10% of India's 1.4 billion people have had one dose and only about 2% two doses.\nThe chief executive of India's Serum Institute, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, has warned shortages will last for months. \nAdar Poonawalla told the Financial Times the institute had been unfairly maligned over the lack of supplies. \nHe had not boosted capacity earlier, he said, because \"there were no orders, we did not think we needed to make more than 1bn doses a year\"."

      "text": "As time goes on, more countries are considering turning to Covid passports as a way of opening up and letting people travel. \nThese passports are usually accessed via an app on your phone or in some cases, paper versions are available. \nSome nations have already installed their own versions of a Covid passport which has allowed people to attend large scale events. But with some countries lagging behind with vaccinations, there is concern that some could be left behind. \nHere's how a range of countries have adapted vaccine passports and what they involve. \nAt the moment, \"higher risk\" settings such as nightclubs don't have to ask for proof of vaccination. \nHowever, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced plans \"to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather\" by the end of September. \nUnder these new measures, people would show proof of vaccination by using the NHS Covid Pass app in England. \nThe NHS Covid Pass - or equivalents in other parts of the UK - will also allow fully vaccinated adults to avoid quarantine when they return from most amber-list countries. But even if they have the pass, they will have to self-isolate on arrival in the UK from France. \nAccording to the government, more than 30 countries, including Greece and Spain now accept the pass but holders must check their destination's entry rules before booking and keep checking before travelling. \nAn EU vaccine \"passport\" is being introduced across all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. \nCitizens of these nations can download it or obtain a paper copy - at no cost. It is also available to non-EU nationals living legally in member states who have the right to travel to other member states. \nBecause the UK is no longer in the EU, the certificate is not available to most Britons. \nThe certificate can be issued if someone has been vaccinated, recently had a negative Covid test or recently recovered from the virus. \nAnyone holding the certificate should be exempt from testing or quarantining when crossing a border within the EU. \nOther EU nations also have their own certificate or vaccine passport. \nAuthorities have set up a health pass that will allow people to access restaurants, bars, planes and trains. \nAt present, venues that accommodate more than 50 people already require proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test.\nThe pass will be required by all adults from the beginning of August and include children over the age of 12 from 30 September. \nIn order to obtain the pass, people must have proof they are fully vaccinated, recently tested negative or recently recovered from the virus. \nOn 24 July, about 160,000 people protested across the country against the Covid pass and mandatory vaccinations for health workers. \nIsrael introduced a vaccine pass earlier this year. It required people to show proof of either vaccination or having recently had the virus. The pass helped increase uptake of the vaccine, especially among younger people. \nAfter infection rates declined, authorities decided to end the scheme. \nBut the government has now announced plans to reinstate the system amid a recent surge in cases. \nThe green pass system will only allow those over the age of 12 who are vaccinated, recovered from Covid-19 or who present a negative test result to attend large events and enter certain public spaces, the Times of Israel reports. The new pass will come into effect from 29 July. \nThe pass will apply to cultural and sporting events, gyms, restaurants and dining halls, conferences, tourist attractions and places of worship. \nChina introduced a QR code system last year which categorised people into different colours. A green colour allows people to move around without restrictions while someone with a yellow code may be asked to stay at home for seven days. \nThe codes are a combination of big data and information submitted by the users themselves. \nMany public spaces in China require people to show their QR code in order to gain entry. \nIn March, China launched a digital health certificate that shows the holder's vaccine status and test results. The certificate is available to foreigners in China as well as Chinese nationals. It is hoped that Chinese citizens will be able to use the certificate as a vaccine passport in other countries in future.  \nIt's not yet clear which countries China is in discussions with to get its certificate recognised. \nMany countries have opted not to have a vaccine passport. \nIn April, the White House ruled out introducing mandatory federal Covid vaccination passports, saying citizens' privacy and rights should be protected. However four states have active vaccination apps, according to MIT Technology Review. \nBut some states have also opted to introduce their own measures to try to increase vaccination rates. \nCalifornia will require all state employees and health care workers to show proof of vaccination or be tested weekly from next month. New York City will adopt a similar measure from mid-September requiring its municipal workers - including police officers and teachers - to be vaccinated or face weekly tests. \nAt present, inoculated Australians have a digital certificate on their phones but it has no rights attached to it. \nThe country's tourism minister Dan Tehan has said that a vaccine passport could give people \"the right to be able to travel across borders when there are lockdowns, or if there are parts of a state which have been locked down, because of an outbreak\". \nHe also said that giving more freedoms to people who are vaccinated would encourage more to get the jab.

      "title": "Covid-19 in the UK: How many coronavirus cases are there in my area?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

She recalled her visit with Prince Philip to Ireland ten years ago.\nSending her warmest good wishes, she said: \"Across generations, the people of Northern Ireland are choosing to build an inclusive, prosperous, and hopeful society, strengthened by the gains of the peace process. \n\"May this be our guiding thread in the coming years.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson called it a \"very significant national anniversary\".\nThroughout this centenary year, the government would highlight all that is brilliant about Northern Ireland, he said on Twitter.\nFrom its \"world class fintech industry and research capabilities\" to its \"inspiring young people and its vibrant culture of arts and sport\".\nBut he added that it was important to reflect on Northern Ireland's \"complex history\".\n\"People from all parts of Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and across the globe will approach this anniversary in different ways with differing perspectives,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Irish President Michael D Higgins has urged caution about how the events on the island a century ago are interpreted.\n\"We have much, much more information. Take advantage of the new material that we have,\" he said in an interview for BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. \n\"There are events that took place and, I think, they should be recalled in their factual setting as much as possible.\"\nBrandon Lewis, who is the Northern Ireland Secretary, also said it was a time for reflection.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, Mr Lewis ruled out calling a border poll on Irish reunification in the near future.\nLooking back on what happened on 3 May 1921, he said: \"It's not just the start of Northern Ireland as we know it, it's the start of the United Kingdom as we know it.\"\nMr Lewis said he recognised that there had been \"difficult periods\" in the past, and that people disagreed over the future.\nHowever, he added: \"A hundred years on, Northern Ireland is a beacon around the world with the Good Friday Agreement for how to reconcile, and have peace and prosperity and grow from what has been a troubled past in some part.\n\"I think there is a lot to be hugely proud of, not least of all when you look at the innovation and enterprise that's across Northern Ireland.\"\nThe BBC News NI website has a dedicated section marking the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland and partition of the island.\nThere are special reports on the major figures of the time and the events that shaped modern Ireland available at bbc.co.uk/ni100.\nYear '21: You can also explore how Northern Ireland was created a hundred years ago in the company of Tara Mills and Declan Harvey.\nListen to the latest Year '21 podcast on BBC Sounds or catch-up on previous episodes.\nMr Lewis said at the moment people want the focus to be on \"getting the economy back into a position where it can grow and develop and deliver jobs\" as we come out of the pandemic.\nAsked if he believed Northern Ireland would still exist in another 100 years, he said: \"I think there will be a Northern Ireland in the years ahead.\n\"Northern Ireland's story is still in the making and what it has to offer the world is a phenomenal place to live, to work, to grow and spend time,\" he added.\nIn a detailed statement, Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democrat and Labour Party (SDLP) called for an \"open and generous\" conversation about the constitutional future.\n\"I recognise and respect that for many people, Northern Ireland is a critical part of their identity and I absolutely want them to have the space to celebrate that,\" said the SDLP leader.\n\"But for many, partition was an act of immense constitutional trauma that severed relationships, economic opportunities and created a new state where sectarian discrimination was hardwired into the institutions of government.\n\"That's also why the experience of communities like mine, and of people like me, are critical to this story and should be heard.\"\nThe Northern Ireland Economy Minister, Diane Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said the centenary presented an opportunity to celebrate past achievements but also look to the future.\n\"From having a reputation as leaders in shipbuilding, rope works and linen mills over the past century, Northern Ireland is now established as a global leader in cyber security, fintech and advanced manufacturing,\" she said.\nThe Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said the centenary was \"a time of pride, commemoration and hope for the future\".\n\"The achievements in science, industry, sport, the arts and so much more, has shown that our greatest asset, our people, have not only been influential in our nation of the United Kingdom but across all of these islands and across the globe.\"\nHe said the \"very real impact of terrorism must never be forgotten\" as it has driven many people away from Northern Ireland.\n\"That the scourge of sectarianism, of hatred and bigotry has blighted generations of our people, is a sad reflection,\" Mr Aiken said.\n\"I want to live in a Northern Ireland where our diaspora want to come back, to visit, to rekindle their links, to invest in, and to be proud of.\"\nOfficial events to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland will include a special post-mark, an inter-denominational church service and a plan to plant a tree at every school.\nThe programme of events also includes an investment conference, a concert and a centenary rose.\nThe interview with President Higgins on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme can be accessed on BBC Sounds."

The brand would be damaged forever and we don't want that,\" he said.\nWhile Munich's official events were cancelled last year, many locals attended the city's breweries in traditional clothes.\nThis year marks the 26th time the festival has been cancelled in more than 200 years.\nAccording to its official website, Oktoberfest was first called off in 1813 - just four years after it began - due to fighting with Napoleon. Since then, it has been halted by wars, inflation and cholera.\nLast month, Germany introduced a controversial new lockdown law in response to a third wave of infections. \nThe rules, which allow the federal government to impose an overnight curfew and shut schools wherever infection rates rise too high, have already been put in place in a number of cities.\nGermany has reported around 3.4 million cases and more than 83,000 deaths since the pandemic began."

      "text": "Frustrated at the impact of the pandemic on his studies, Jamie Cross took matters into his own hands.\nThe Penarth film student has launched a campaign with friends to secure compensation for university students.\nWith the value of tuition fees being questioned, some parties are promising to cut fees for certain students if they win the Welsh Parliament election.\nBut this would put the viability of universities in doubt, a former vice-chancellor has warned.\nJamie, 22, and fellow students in Bristol, launched Write Off Write Now (WORN) after what they say is an unfair decision to charge full fees for those studying remotely during lockdown, when in-person classes have been limited.\n\"If you're paying an awful lot of money for a service and they're not able to deliver it, people are going to start complaining,\" he said.\n\"If you're paying for wi-fi and the service you're getting is rubbish, you phone your provider and ask either for money back or for them to drastically improve the way they're performing, otherwise chances are you're going to leave that provider. I see universities exactly the same.\"\nIn England, students pay up to \u00a39,250 a year. In Wales it's \u00a39,000 though most students take up loans which are only repaid once their earnings reach a certain level.\nThe UK and Welsh governments have previously rejected calls for blanket fee rebates.\nHistorically a contentious political issue, tuition fees are in the spotlight again in this week's Senedd election due to the pandemic.\nThe Welsh Conservatives would introduce a compensation scheme for students whose courses have been disrupted over the past year.\nBeyond the pandemic, they would also halve fees for Welsh students studying science, technology, engineering or maths (STEM) and modern foreign languages at Welsh universities. \nThey would also refund tuition fees for those who choose to work for at least five years in Wales as doctors, nurses or teachers after their studies.\nPlaid Cymru pledges to lower the maximum fee for students living in Wales and who study at Welsh universities to \u00a37,500 - a step towards the long-term goal of making university education free.\nNeither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats are offering to cut tuition fees.\nHowever, Welsh Labour says Wales has the most generous student support system anywhere in the UK, based on evidence that up-front living costs was the biggest barrier to young people going to university.\nThe Lib Dems say plans to reduce tuition fees risk underfunding universities and that a system based on support for living costs, introduced by their education minister Kirsty Williams, has seen record numbers of disadvantaged pupils applying to university.\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nFormer university vice-chancellor Professor Sir Deian Hopkin, a member of the Higher Education Commission, said those people calling for a cut in fees must consider how universities will be funded.\n\"Any discussion of reducing the income of universities, raises fundamental questions about their sustainability,\" he said.\n\"There has been concern about the level of debt that students incur and that's stimulated a debate about the level of fees in the future.\"\nBut he added there was \"no real evidence\" that the level of fees deter students from applying.\n\"So you have to ask, if students are quite content to accept this, what kind of provision do you make for them? What kind of support do you give them to justify those fees rather than reducing the fees themselves?\"\nElain Gwynedd, from Anglesey, is in her first year studying Welsh at Aberystwyth University - and the 18-year-old said lowering tuition fees would be attractive.\n\"It would definitely make more students want to stay in Wales if it was cheaper, but I know I wanted to come to Aberystwyth right from the start,\" she said.\n\"If someone told me, if you go to Liverpool it would be \u00a37,500, I'd still want to go to Aber.\n\"It's a lot of money, but I would rather be happy somewhere I wanted to be, rather than somewhere that I didn't really want to go because it was cheaper.\"\nRhydian Cleaver, 21, from Swansea, is a third-year politics student at London School of Economics. \nAs a low-income student, he said fees were \"one of the key priorities\" for him, while also selecting a course with the best job prospects.\nBut he felt many students faced a \"trade off\" between costs and the quality of education.\n\"I was able to get the security that I was at a university that was a little more tailored to what I wanted to do, maybe more competitive and offered things that weren't available in Wales,\" he said.\nThe president of the National Union of Students in Wales welcomed any discussion about tuition fees in this week's election.\n\"There is no reason why Wales can't take the lead on this, why Wales can't stand up and have a discussion around tuition fees and around the marketization of our education system,\" said Becky Ricketts.\nBut she agreed that cuts to fees must go hand-in-hand with additional funding for institutions.\n\"There has to be a discussion around making sure universities don't lose out - making sure they are able to offer those courses to students\".\nJamie said he could see the benefits of incentives to stay in Wales but felt STEM subjects should not be favoured over creative paths.\n\"We need to hold parties responsible for their promises and make sure no party creates empty incentives that try to win over the student vote then don't get delivered,\" he said."

We will have another update for you tomorrow. \nThe limit to the number of people able to mourn their loved ones at funerals in England is to be lifted at the next stage of lockdown easing - which is due on 17 May. At the moment only 30 can be present. Capacity will be determined instead by how many people a venue can accommodate while maintaining social distancing. Weddings will be limited to 30 from 17 May, and an unlimited number from June. The limit for weddings in England is currently 15 people. Here are the UK's lockdown rules in detail.\nLockdown rules are easing in Wales. From now, gyms and swimming pools can reopen and two households, plus another person living on their own, are able to form a \"bubble\" to meet indoors. It means some families and friends will be able to hug for the first time in months. Organised children's indoor activities - like sports classes, scouts, guides and parent and baby classes - will also be able to restart after for the first time since the December lockdown. Wales' case rate has fallen to its lowest point in eight months. \nMillions of Muslims around the world are currently observing Ramadan. But some mosques in the UK not allowing women inside to pray this month. Most say it is because of coronavirus restrictions. \"We have received reports that during the pandemic, mosques who used to accommodate women pushed women out either to create socially distanced space for men or because they felt they could not organise stewardship to ensure the women's facilities adhered to guidelines,\" a campaigner says. What are the rules for places of worship during the pandemic?\nNHS workers at Wales' largest hospital are creating a woodland to offset the carbon emissions and waste that came from the machines needed to treat patients with Covid-19. Staff on the critical care unit at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff say they hope their woodland in Crickhowell inspires other hospital trusts and industries to do the same. The woodland will be given a Welsh name and should be open to the public later this year. Watch how they got on with planting the trees below.\nIt's a sight that has existed only in fond, fading memories for the past 13 months, and has sometimes seemed destined to be consigned to the carefree pre-Covid age - 5,000 closely-packed music fans dancing and jumping, and singing in unison at the top of their lungs.

Mr Romney urged people to \"come together in strength and unity\" before leaving the stage.\nA moderate Republican, Mr Romney is not facing re-election to the Senate in 2022.\nThis incident is seen as an example of how, despite his election loss last year, Mr Trump continues to be popular within the party.\nA CNN poll released this week suggested 70% of Republicans still believe Mr Trump's allegations that President Joe Biden did not legitimately win the election - despite the claims being repeatedly proven to be false.\nMr Trump is the only president in US history to have been impeached twice.\nThe first time, in December 2019, was for asking Ukraine for dirt on his political opponents. \nThe second was for inciting a deadly storming of the Capitol on 6 January this year, after repeating his claim of electoral fraud. Before the riot, he told a crowd of supporters to \"fight like hell\".\nHe was acquitted at both impeachment trials."

It was so hard.\"\nBut that's all changed as the pub has just been connected to the new ultrafast Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) broadband.\n\"Now you can come along and download the whole Star Wars trilogy in three minutes,\" laughed Ben.\nThey all have Dave Schofield to thank for dragging the village into the 21st Century.\nHe and a team of about 30 volunteers - all local villagers - decided that because nobody else was sorting out their problem, they would do it themselves.\nHe mentioned the idea at a village meeting, not thinking anybody would be enthusiastic, but he said everyone jumped on board.\nThey set up their own not for profit Community Interest Company and raised \u00a3150,000 by asking local people to buy shares in the project. \nThey then went about applying for every grant they could, including to the Welsh Government and Access Broadband Cymru, which offers vouchers to homes in areas that are not set to benefit from BT's Superfast Cymru project.\nSimilar schemes have been undertaken in England, but for Wales it was a first.\nFarmers and landowners readily gave permission for trenches to be dug to lay the fibre optic cables - that are thinner than a human hair - from a hub to people's homes and businesses.\nAnd residents swotted up on the technology, pooled their skills and received training on how to lay the infrastructure.\nLocal contractors use machinery to dig across farmland to people's driveways. It's then up to each home owner to dig trenches to carry the fibres into their own homes, with others stepping in to help those who can't manage the work.\nIt has become a full time job for many of the volunteers.\n\"We started digging on 21 February this year when the ground was frozen solid,\" said Dave, 52, who's lived in the village for eight years.\n\"A few weeks later we were snowed in for three days and then we had torrential rain.\n\"So it's not been easy but we were all determined. And it's brought the whole community together.\"\nDavid Walford, 21, stepped up to do the groundwork, digging trenches in the many fields that surround Michaelston-y-Fedw.\n\"I've got a drone and I take loads of videos but I've never been able to upload them. There'd be no hope of doing anything like that,\" he said.\n\"For the last three days I've been coming down to the village hall to finally upload all my videos to YouTube. It's amazing - you don't realise how painful it was before.\"\nFor many of the villagers, the project has not just been about improving internet access - it's also been about improving community relationships.\nJim Dunk, 71, has had a home in the village for 41 years but because he was in the Merchant Navy, he travelled the world and used it only as a base.\n\"This is why the project meant so much to me,\" he said.\n\"It's the place I came back to - but apart from the village pub, I didn't know many other people. Now, I've met just about everybody as I'm one of the people who's put the routers into all the houses.\"\nHis wife Carina, who does the fibre splicing, added: \"In a very short space of time we've got to know a lot of people very well.\n\"Sometimes we're spending eight hours a day together. Before this, Jim was playing golf four times a week - now he's lucky if he gets there once. But he loves it.\"\nThey still have much work to do. The popular Cefn Mably Farm Park will also be connected as part of the project - but first the team will have to get the wires across a river.\nThat doesn't daunt them.\n\"We'll just use a directional drill to do it,\" added Dave - a phrase he no doubt didn't think he'd be using this time last year.\nThe people power behind the project has impressed many of the locals.\n\"They're all so clever doing it,\" said Saskia Barnett, 22, who has lived in the village all her life.\n\"It's such a great idea and will really make a difference for people living here.\n\"When you're a teenager growing up here it's really hard... My brother and I would have to time when we'd go online - when he was playing on his Xbox I wouldn't be able to watch Netflix on my laptop.\"\n\"Our house has just gone over to the new router. It's not up and running yet but it will be so much better. It will be so good.\""

There are definitely queues.\nOn our walk through the area our cameraman and I stopped to talk to those who had managed to secure a table.\nThey were in great spirits - delighted to be back in Belfast with a pint and friends, something they felt they had missed and deserved after what has felt like a long year.\nThe queues didn't move much while we were there but there was an air of excitement back in the city on this chilly Friday evening.\nChris Nelmes, the manager of the Boulevard shopping centre in Banbridge, County Down, said there had been an \"encouraging start\" to business.\n\"There's been queues since well before the shops have opened,\" he said.\n\"\"It feels a bit like Christmas Day today and with it being a bank holiday weekend it will be very, very busy.\"\nFor retail staff there was an \"excitement, a buzz to get back into store, back into what we do best\", said shop manager Laura Mawhinney.\n\"It definitely feels busier than our previous reopening last June,\" she said.\n\"This year customers have a level of expectation - they're a lot more confident, they know what the rules are this time, they know what to expect in their shopping.\n\"The mood just seems great, I think everyone's just excited.\"\nThere was almost a party atmosphere in the centre of Belfast on Friday.\nThe sun was shining, the buskers were back and people were keen to shop.\nPrimark, which famously doesn't sell online, was particularly busy and its queues were well marshalled.\n\"People are glad to get out - it's been a long four months,\" one of those Primark shoppers told me.\nIn Portrush, County Antrim, Camilla Long from the Causeway Chamber of Commerce described an \"amazing sense of optimism\" in the town. \n\"I was walking around here last night and there were trucks delivering, windows being washed, doors open for the first time in 18 weeks,\" she said.\n\"People [were] getting ready to do what we do best in the north coast and that's to welcome visitors back.\"\nBut she also said it was important to acknowledge people whose businesses had collapsed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"For each and every business owner and family who relies on that business, that is a tragedy.\"\nAdrian Walker of GLL, which runs Belfast City Council's gyms and leisure centres, said that he expected May to be a busy month.\n\"People are really keen to get back and get back into some form of exercise,\" he said.\nThe \"trickle-flow programme\" the leisure centres had implemented meant there was reduced capacity at gyms, he said, but that allowed people more time to use different machines.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann has warned the hospitality industry not to seek or promote cross-border business while there is a big difference between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the proportion of people who have received a Covid-19 vaccine.\nOn Thursday the Irish government announced a phased relaxation of its highest level of Covid-19 lockdown rules over the coming weeks and months.\nFrom 10 May, people can travel outside their county and close contact services and click-and-collect retail can resume.\nThe Stormont executive's advice remains that people in Northern Ireland should \"stay local\".\nMinisters have given an indicative date of 24 May for hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland to be allowed to resume trading indoors but that will have to be assessed on 13 May, the next review of the coronavirus restrictions.\nThe executive has also earmarked 24 May for the reopening of tourist accommodation such as hotels and bed-and-breakfasts.\nThere had been some confusion about the implementation of Covid-19 regulations for outdoor hospitality venues in the run-up to Friday.\nSome venues have been told they could not reopen because their outdoor seating areas did not adhere to regulations from the executive.\nOn Thursday the industry body Hospitality Ulster said the majority of hospitality businesses had failed last-minute inspections.\nThe Department of Health had said the general rule of thumb was that outdoor premises should not be more than 50% enclosed.\nThe legislation states that a premises is substantially enclosed if it has a ceiling or roof but there is \"an opening in the walls\".\nResponsibility for enforcing the regulations on outdoor areas rests with the 11 councils in Northern Ireland.\nSean McLaughlin, who owns a fish and chip restaurant in Portrush, was frustrated that the outdoor area he had invested in was deemed unsuitable on Thursday.\nHe was told that its because its partial coverage did not comply with the rules.\n\"There's more than adequate ventilation to sit there as one family but you can go to big stores today and brush hands with people and there's nothing,\" he said.\n\"We've put this in and we're left stuck with it.\n\"Restaurateurs who are using the exact same space that they used last year are now being told they can't use it - it's nonsensical.\"\nMany bars that are only licensed to sell alcohol indoors but had thought that if they provided a safe outdoor area they would be permitted to open.\nThis week three bars in Belleek, County Fermanagh, which had planned to reopen were contacted by the police who said they would not be allowed to trade.\nBridie Gormley, the owner of Black Cat Cove, said it was another blow for a \"small rural town that has suffered terribly during Covid\".\n\"On Monday we found out that our outdoor area is not licensed for outdoor serving,\" she said.\n\"We had spent thousands of pounds on outdoor furniture, we bought in our stock and we had given our staff a starting date.\n\"Now all of that has had to be cancelled.\""

      "text": "More than 30 people will be able to mourn their loved ones at funerals in England from 17 May, under plans announced by the government.\nAs part of the next step of easing lockdown restrictions, ministers are set to remove the 30-person legal limit a month earlier than planned.\nThis means any number of mourners will be able to gather as long as the venue can comply with social distancing.\nEngland's next lockdown easing, stage three, is due no earlier than 17 May.\nDuring the pandemic, many have been forced to watch funerals from home over live-streams, making grieving harder. And those able to attend have had to do without handshakes and hugs.\nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick said people have made \"huge sacrifices\" - nowhere more apparent than in the \"deeply painful\" restrictions on funerals.\nAt the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral service last month, the Queen had to sit alone in the chapel in Windsor. \nOnly 30 people, most of them the duke's closest family, were able to attend, in line with coronavirus restrictions.  \nDeborah Smith, from the National Association of Funeral Directors, said she was \"very pleased\" at the planned change.\nAlthough some venues may not have the space to increase numbers much because of social distancing, she said \"it does mean that those larger venues can now start welcoming more mourners\".\n\"It just gives that little bit of choice for families who do have lots of family members and lots of close friends, that they can choose a venue that is a little bit larger.\"\nMr Jenrick said he would work with faith leaders and funeral home managers to introduce new arrangements to continue to keep people safe once the limit has been lifted.\nIn Scotland, up to 50 people can go to a funeral, with plans to extend that to 100 from 7 June. Neither Wales nor Northern Ireland has a limit on numbers, but venues can set restrictions.\nIn other developments, MPs are warning that curbs on foreign holidays should be kept in place to protect the UK from Covid variants.\nThe ban on foreign holidays is expected to be lifted for people in England from 17 May, but a cross-party group of MPs say current restrictions should be continued beyond that date.\nThey want the government to \"discourage all international leisure travel\", saying new variants could lead to more lockdowns and further deaths.\nThe All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on coronavirus described airport arrival halls as \"a breeding ground for infection\".\nLib Dem MP Layla Moran, who chairs the APPG, said urgent measures were needed to better detect fake Covid test certificates, reduce overcrowding in arrival halls, and separate those arriving from countries classed as higher risk.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We introduced robust border controls to stop coronavirus variants in their tracks and every essential check we've introduced for arrivals has strengthened our defences against new mutations.\"\nThey said the new \"traffic-light\" system, where red is the riskiest for Covid and green the safest, would allow them to manage the risk from imported cases by varying restrictions depending on the risk of travel from a specific location.\nMeanwhile in Wales, two households who form a \"bubble\" are now able to meet and hug indoors. The bubble can also include someone who lives on their own.\nGyms, leisure centres and community centres have reopened, with exercise classes for up to 15 adults allowed. Children's indoor activities including scout groups can also meet again.\nThese changes had been timetabled for later in the year but were brought forward because the number of cases in Wales remains low.\nThe seven-day rolling case rate in Wales stands at 10.8 per 100,000 people, the lowest rate since 1 September last year.\nIn the UK as a whole, a further 1,671 cases were reported on Sunday, and there were 14 more deaths of people within 28 days of a positive Covid test."

You served and sacrificed, put yourselves in harm's way, and acted with bravery, knowing the costs. We owe you an incredible debt of gratitude. Thank you.\"\nIt was the duke's first public appearance since the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip on 17 April. His wife the Duchess of Sussex, who is pregnant, stayed at home.\nThe couple are campaign chairs of Vax Live, organised by anti-poverty group Global Citizen.\nUS President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden also appeared at the concert in a pre-recorded video.\nPresident Biden said he was \"working with leaders around the world to share more vaccines and boost production\".\nThe singer Selena Gomez hosted the event, calling for \"doses and dollars\" to go to the world's poorest countries.\nRock band Foo Fighters were joined by surprise guest Brian Johnson of AC/DC for a rendition of the Australian band's hit Back in Black.\nAnd actress and singer Jennifer Lopez was joined on stage by her mother to sing Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline.\nOther celebrity guests, including Ben Affleck, David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel and Sean Penn, all called for equal access to vaccines around the world, or vaccine equity.\nOther video messages came from Pope Francis, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nIn his address Prince Harry called on people to come together and commit to their \"shared humanity\". \n\"The vaccine must be distributed to everyone everywhere,\" the Duke said.\n\"We cannot rest or truly recover until there is fair distribution to every corner of the world. The mission in front of us is one we cannot afford to fail at and that's what tonight is about.\"\nPrince Harry also voiced support for India, which is in the midst of a Covid crisis which has overwhelmed hospitals.\n\"Tonight, we stand in solidarity with the millions of families across India, who are battling a devastating second wave,\" he said.\n\"The virus does not respect borders, and access to the vaccine cannot be determined by geography.\"\nVax Live is calling on governments to commit to vaccine equity by donating doses and resources.\nThe event raised $53.8 million (\u00a338.8 million) for Covax, which is working to to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor. Organisers said it was enough to help purchase almost 10.3 million vaccine doses.\nMore than one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have now been administered worldwide. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, with some countries having delivered doses to a large proportion of their population and others still waiting for their first shipments to arrive.\nThe concert will stream on YouTube, along with American television networks, on 8 May at midnight GMT.\nLast year, Global Citizen partnered with the World Health Organization  to put on a virtual concert to celebrate healthcare workers."

It is a barrier to them progressing,\" she added.\n\"I find it quite sad.\"\nShe has let relatives sit in her garden to log on to her wi-fi so they are not using up their limited phone data, and believes sharing passwords with family members and friends could be a way of helping those on budgets or who cannot afford their own connections. \nHelen said: \"Maybe we should consider letting neighbours have access to our password if they are people you trust. Everyone can play their part that way.\n\"Some have no data on their phones and that they do have quickly runs out. The cost is so problematic for so many people.\"\nHowever, some experts warn against the widespread sharing of wi-fi passwords due to the increased security risks.\nIssues Helen has seen people struggle with due to limited internet access include them not being to apply for a driver's licence online or accessing their finances through online banking. \n\"For some surgeries, you are seeing a system where you have to access appointments online,\" Helen added. \n\"If you can't get online, you can't get an appointment.\"\nAnother issue that became important as people shielded indoors during the pandemic was online shopping. \nHelen believes it is important all older people are able to book deliveries with supermarkets, and also, working-age people are able to browse, and apply for, jobs.\nShe said: \"Now we are seeing the impact on the poorest in society. \n\"I'm not sure how you can potentially fund it, but it's getting more and more important that we have equal access.\n\"The person who invented the world-wide web wanted it for everyone, with no barriers. This world we live in, everything is digitalised, so that needs to be the case now more than ever.\"\nBut Helen does not just see it as a problem dividing the better off and the poor, but also those in different parts of Wales, with it a geographical as well as digital divide. \nShe wants people in every county of Wales, from cities to rural, in the north and the south to have equal access. \n\"It's unfair if they don't,\" she said. \n\"As we have seen lately, if you're working remotely, it is so important.\"\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \nWho can vote?

This allows someone's acquired gender to be recorded on their birth and marriage certificates.\nThe existing process - which requires two medical reports - had been criticised as costly and bureaucratic. \nThe government estimates there are between 200,000 and 500,000 transgender people in the UK, although the actual figure is not known.\nA total of 5,871 full GRCs have been granted since 2005, according to the latest official figures.\nIn September 2020, following a highly charged debate about the potential impact of changing the law, the government announced it would not fundamentally reform the process. \nAt the time, Ms Truss said there were \"proper checks and balances in the system\" - but pledged to make applying \"kinder and more straightforward\", including reducing the fee.\nIn a statement after the reduction came into force, Ms Truss said: \"As we build back better, we want transgender people to be free to live and to prosper in modern Britain.\"\n\"In the National LGBT Survey, 34% of transgender people told us that the cost of applying for a certificate was holding them back from doing so,\" Ms Truss said.\n\"Today we have removed that barrier, and I am proud that we have made the process of getting a certificate fairer, simpler and much more affordable.\"\nGovernment sources have previously told BBC News that making the service completely free would take longer because it would require primary legislation.\nThe government has also said it is working \"at speed\" to move the application process online.\nHowever, some LGBT charities have called for more fundamental reform.\nLee Clatworthy, from national transgender charity Sparkle, said that the process remains \"overly long-winded\" and a reduction in cost \"won't compel more to apply\".\nNancy Kelley, chief executive of Stonewall, said reducing the cost and streamlining the application process were not substitutes for \"meaningful reform to the Gender Recognition Act\"."

      "tags": "India,Coronavirus pandemic,Australia",
      "text": "Australia's threat to jail citizens returning home from India has sparked condemnation, with critics labelling the Covid measure as \"racist\" and a breach of human rights.\nFrom Monday, any Australian arriving in the country from India faces fines and up to five years in prison. \nIt comes after Canberra banned all flights from the virus hotspot until 15 May. \nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has dismissed accusations of racism.\n\"The same accusations were made against the government over a year ago when we closed the borders to mainland China,\" he told Sydney radio station 2GB.\n\"There's no politics or ideology in a pandemic... It's got nothing to do with politics, this is a virus.\"\nThe policy marks the first time Australians have been criminalised for returning to their country, local media reported.\nThere are an estimated 9,000 Australians in India, 600 of whom are classed as vulnerable. \nThe government said the measures, which were announced on Saturday, are based on medical advice aimed at protecting the community. The virus is surging in India, with daily cases in the country topping 300,000 for 10 consecutive days.\nOfficials said an increase in infection rates seen in Indian arrivals over the past fortnight has raised concerns. Australia has pursued a Covid elimination strategy - partly through strict border controls and mandatory quarantine - which has seen it record 910 deaths, far fewer than many other countries. \nForeign Minister Marise Payne said India arrivals accounted for 57% of positive cases in quarantine, up from 10% in March. \nShe said this placed a \"very, very significant burden on health and medical services\". \nHowever critics - among them medical experts and legal groups - argue the government's move to criminalise Indian arrivals was extreme and disproportionate to the health risks. \nFederal Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi wrote on Twitter that the measures were \"absolutely horrific and racist\". \nProminent conservative media commentator Andrew Bolt said the policy was \"so mean and irrational that I must also blame racism\". \n\"I can't believe we would impose such a travel ban on white Australians fleeing, from, say England.\" \nAustralia's former Race Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane pointed out the \"inconsistency\" in the government's policy, noting bans and criminal penalties weren't imposed on Australians returning from other nations at the height of their Covid waves.\n\"We didn't see differential treatment being extended to... the United States, the UK, and any European country even though the rates of infection were very high and the danger of arrivals from those countries was very high,\" he told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.\n\"There are different standards at play here depending on which part of the world you're coming from.\"\nMembers of the Indian-Australian community, which makes up about 2.6% of the population, have expressed anger over the sudden ban. Some have told the BBC they feel they are being treated like criminals and \"second-class citizens\" for wishing to flee danger.\nLegal experts have also raised concerns that the temporary ban violates international law. That includes the right for citizens to not be arbitrarily deprived entry to their country - recognised in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is signatory.\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission said in a statement: \"The Government must show that these measures are not discriminatory and are the only suitable way of dealing with the threat to public health.\"\nThe situation in India has also put renewed focus on Australia's quarantine system, which has seen more than a dozen infection leaks since November.\nThe country has successfully operated a policy of mandatory, 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals - mostly conducted in hotels. \nBut the government said the spike in positive cases from India now threatened to overwhelm its quarantine system, which has capacity to handle a maximum limit of 2% of arrivals being infected.\nThe Australian Medical Association, the nation's peak medical group, said the need to pause Indian arrivals was an indication of the \"frailty\" of the quarantine system.\n\"We would rather our governments focus on fixing the quarantine system and bring Australians home, rather than extend this ban any longer than it needs to be.\" "

      "text": "Boris Johnson should resign if he is found to have broken government rules over his flat renovations, the Scottish Conservative leader has said.\nDouglas Ross told the BBC that people expected the highest standards of those in the highest office of the land.\nBut the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, insisted the prime minister had followed the rules and the newspaper stories were \"gossip\".\nLabour said people needed to know who the prime minister was beholden to.\nMr Johnson has insisted he paid for a refurbishment of the Downing Street flat himself, but there are still questions over whether the costs were initially covered by party donors.\nOn Wednesday, the Electoral Commission - the watchdog overseeing political finances - announced an investigation into the Conservative Party's compliance with laws on political donations, having said there were \"reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred\".\nThe government's top civil servant Simon Case and the prime minister's newly appointed adviser on ministers' interests Lord Geidt are also looking into the issue.\nAsked by the BBC's Andrew Marr whether Mr Johnson should resign if he was found to have broken the ministerial code, Mr Ross said \"of course\".\nBut he added he would wait for the answers from the three separate investigations that are taking place.\nMr Ross has previously called on Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister and leader of the SNP, to step down after a majority of MSPs on a committee accused her of misleading their inquiry into the Scottish government's handling of sexual harassment complaints made against former First Minister Alex Salmond.\nMr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr he would not \"speculate on what the outcome of the various different reviews are\".\n\"I think the right thing for me to do is respect the integrity of those reviews and let them run their course rather than commenting on what may or may not be found at the end of it,\" he added.\nHe added he trusted the Electoral Commission \"to look at these things in the right way\".\nMr Raab also told Sky's Sophy Ridge the prime minister would \"engage fully\" with inquiries into who initially paid for the Downing Street renovations.\nAnd he said he had \"no idea\" whether Conservative donors were asked to help pay for the prime minister's childcare costs.\nThe Sunday Times has reported that supporters of the party had been asked to foot the bill for a nanny for Mr Johnson's son.\nThe foreign secretary dismissed the report as \"tittle tattle\", telling Sky News: \"I can't comment on every little bit of gossip that's in the newspapers.\"\nResponding to the story, Downing Street said: \"The prime minister has covered the cost of all childcare.\"\nAlso appearing on Sky News, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"We need to know who the prime minister is beholden to, we need to know what he has promised in return.\" \n\"There's an arrogance at the heart of this that he seems to believe that we don't deserve to know the truth about what goes on in government.\"\nThe prime minister has also received criticism from the former Commons Speaker John Bercow.\nTalking to BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme, Mr Bercow said of the flat row: \"First of all we don't know who paid the initial bill because the prime minister and his acolytes persisted with the refrain that he ended up picking up the bill. \n\"That is both true and irrelevant - we know that, we've heard it, we've got it... the point is who initially did so creating either the fact or the appearance of indebtedness and an obligation on the prime minister in the future.\"\nHe also accused the prime minister of demonstrating \"an insouciant, a flippant, a casual disregard for the accuracy of what he says\". \nThe SNP's Westminster deputy leader Kirsten Oswald said Mr Johnson should publish his bank statements and all relevant documents relating to the flat renovations and donor-funded income and expenditure \"to ensure full transparency and assist inquiries and criminal investigations\". \nLorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, has said she believes the UK political system is \"broken\" and politicians should be held accountable for their decisions in the midst of the pandemic and the climate crisis. \nScottish Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine said the prime minister was being \"rightly scrutinised\" but the SNP was not in a position to criticise, following the inquiry into the Scottish government's handling of complaints made against Alex Salmond.

      "text": "A Puerto Rican boxer who fought in London's 2012 Olympics has been charged with abducting and killing his pregnant lover.\nF\u00e9lix Verdejo is accused of attacking Keishla Rodr\u00edguez and then throwing her body off a bridge near San Juan, the capital of the US island territory.\nHe turned himself in to police on Sunday after refusing to co-operate with investigators, police say.\nThe death has sparked protests against the murder of women in Puerto Rico.\nIn January, the island declared a state of emergency over violence against women. Puerto Rico has at least one femicide per week, according to local rights groups, with at least 60 such crimes last year.  \nThe 27-year-old married lightweight boxer is facing charges of kidnapping and carjacking resulting in the death and intentional killing of an unborn child. \nAccording to a federal complaint, Mr Verdejo punched his lover in the face before tying her up and throwing her off a bridge. \nHe also allegedly shot at her in the water with a pistol while standing atop the bridge.\nAn unnamed witness is also alleged to have helped Mr Verdejo.\nThe victim's mother told local media that her daughter was carrying Mr Verdejo's child and that he had wanted her not to have the baby for the sake of his family and career.\n\"I told her 'be careful' because he had threatened her not to have the baby, that he had his family, that he is a boxer, that he is a public figure,\" Keila Ortiz Rivera told El Nuevo D\u00eda newspaper, adding that she last spoke to her daughter on Thursday.\nMs Rodr\u00edguez, 27, knew Mr Verdejo since they were teenagers, she said, and had stayed in touch with him over the years.\nHer body was found in a lagoon on Saturday and was identified through dental records on Sunday, according to Puerto Rico's Institute of Forensic Science.\nAccording to Top Rank, a boxing promotion company that has worked with Mr Verdejo since 2012, his boxing record is 27-2, with 17 knockouts.\nThe company, which removed Mr Verdejo's page over the weekend, released a statement saying their \"thoughts and prayers are with Keishla Marlen Rodriguez Ortiz's family and friends, and with all those in mourning\".\n\"We are deeply disturbed by the news reports, and we will continue to monitor developments in the case as it progresses.\"\nHe is due to make a first court appearance on Monday.\nOn Sunday, hundreds of protesters gathered on a bridge nearby to where Ms Rodr\u00edguez's body was found to protest against the killing of women.\nMr Verdejo's arrest came just days after the body of another woman - Andrea Ruiz Costas - was found partially burned.\nThe victim had filed a gender violence case against her partner in March, but a judge dismissed the case, according to local media. Her partner has since been charged with murder.\nAfter years of pressure from activists, Puerto Rico's Governor Pedro Pierluisi declared the state of emergency over rising violence against women at the start of this year. \nThe order directs more resources to address the violence, including a mobile app to request emergency help and an educational campaign focused on gender based violence.

      "tags": "Hospitality industry",
      "text": "Bars and restaurants are struggling to recruit enough staff and some may not be able to fully reopen in May, after thousands of workers left the sector. \nVenue owners say they are expecting huge demand from customers, but staff shortages may mean they have to limit opening hours.\nFigures suggest more than one in ten UK hospitality workers left the industry in the last year.\nRecruitment site Caterer.com said the pandemic and Brexit were to blame.\nSome have managed to find alternative employment, but a high proportion may have left the UK altogether, the recruiter said. \nSo, although many hospitality workers were laid off during the last 12 months, restaurateurs are now finding it hard to fill places.\nCelebrity chef Michael Caines is one of those finding recruitment difficult. \nHe operates two restaurants on the Cornish coast and a hotel in Exmouth. A beach bar and restaurant in Exmouth is also due to open.\nHe is currently trying to hire 20 new staff members across the group.\n\"Without question, recruitment is a challenge,\" he said. \n\"All of the businesses are extremely busy. For the next three, four months our hotel is completely booked up, so we're desperately trying to recruit enough staff.\"\nMr Caines said Brexit and the pandemic have led European workers to leave and not return, but he said another problem is the number of workers still on furlough.\nWhile they are waiting to return to work they are less willing to switch employers.\n\"A lot of people feel very concerned about leaving a job where they qualify for furlough to take the new job where they wouldn't qualify for furlough if there was another lockdown,\" he explained.\n\"So there's a bit of nervousness from an employee's point of view.\"\nMr Caines is hoping roles will be more easily filled when students break up from college and university and start looking for summer work.\nRestaurants and bars have been allowed to serve food and drink outdoors since 12 April, while indoor dining is expected to restart from 17 May. And many UK hospitality venues are hoping pent-up demand and a more UK-focused holiday season to translate into a bumper summer.\nAs a result, recruitment was a \"growing issue\", said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. It was more acute in some areas, such as London, than others, she added, and could mean some venues struggle to reopen.\nThe trade association said chef vacancies are among the most difficult to fill. But restaurant owners have reported staff shortages across all types of roles.\nSpecialist recruiter, Caterer.com, said the number of vacancies on its website had grown by more than 85% in the last few weeks, with 22,000 roles now being advertised.\nBut it pointed to figures from the Office for National Statistics suggesting 355,000 fewer people were employed in hospitality than a year ago. Pre-pandemic around 3.2 million were employed in the sector including bars, restaurants and hotels. \n\"Many restaurants, pubs and bars have experienced a sudden surge in business due to built-up customer demand and an increase in consumer confidence which is great news for the hospitality industry,\" said Caterer.com director Neil Pattison.\n\"However, the impact of the pandemic, combined with Brexit has the potential to create a significant recruitment challenge for the sector and we are likely to see the skills shortage it once faced starting to return.\"\nOne person who turned his back on a full-time job in hospitality after work dried up due to Covid, is 42-year-old father-of-one Colum Maher.\nHe has 20 years of experience working in bars and restaurants, but last December he took up a full-time job in customer services with Sky. \nHe now says something very special would have to come along for him to go back into hospitality full-time. \n\"I've had 15 to 20 jobs in the hospitality sector over the years, from bartender to bar manager to chef, so it's an industry I love and know inside out.\n\"However, I found myself with no work during the pandemic and I needed to find some job security. Now I'm able to work every week, Monday to Friday, so I have no plans to change that now.\"\nBut he hasn't turned his back on the industry completely - he's registered with a speciality hospitality recruitment website Coople, to look for weekend work.  \n\"I personally think it's going to take the hospitality industry three to four years to get back on its feet,\" he says.\n\"I'm at a stage of life when I cannot afford to wait for opportunities to start appearing again - I don't think a lot of pubs will even reopen.\n\"However, if this doesn't work out, then I know I have something I can hopefully fall back on.\"\nBefore Brexit a lot of the UK's hospitality workforce was made up of workers from overseas, including from the EU, but hundreds of thousands of foreign workers have left the UK over the last year and it is unclear whether they will return.\nLuke Garnsworthy, who owns Crockers Henley, a hotel and fine dining restaurant in Oxfordshire, and Crockers Tring in Hertfordshire, said he is struggling to recruit enough staff for when his restaurants open fully next month.\nAs well as chefs, he is hoping to hire front-of-house staff and waiters.\n\"I've put adverts out and I thought I was putting the net out into a sea full of fish but it's not been like that at all.\"\nMr Garnsworthy would like to employ between 45 and 50 staff at his Henley venue where the headcount is currently only at 12.\nHe said senior team members will step in to fill roles where necessary, but the restaurant was only likely to be able to open five days a week instead of seven.\nRecruitment in hospitality has always been a challenge, even before the pandemic, but is \"definitely worse now\", according to Mr Garnsworthy.\n\"We are perceived as unskilled, so the country looks down their nose\u2026 and young people are not interested.\"\nHe wants them to know that although it is hard work \"the days of Gordon Ramsey shouting\" are over at least.\nRestaurant owner and Masterchef The Professionals finalist Sven-Hanson Britt also operates several venues.\nHe said staff turnover in hospitality is normally high, but he too said furloughed staff are sticking with their existing employer.\n\"There's not that ebb and flow with talent because people are staying put.\n\"It's very difficult at the moment and finding anyone for senior positions is hard.\"\nMr Britt is hoping to recruit pastry chefs, chocolatiers and a sommelier.\n\"We can't seem to find anyone in that arena,\" he added.\nThe business took on a number of staff in October but application rates this time around are far lower.\n\"Some businesses closed or went bust and people felt let down by their employer or the industry as a whole,\" he said.\n\"I know a lot of people who have moved on to something different.\""

      "text": "The EU Commission has recommended easing restrictions on non-essential travel from overseas.\nUnder the plans, anyone who has received the last dose of an EU-approved vaccine at least two weeks beforehand will be permitted to travel.\n\"Time to revive EU tourism industry and for cross-border friendships to rekindle - safely,\" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted.\nThe EU currently only allows non-essential travel from seven countries.\nBut the proposals will also contain an \"emergency brake\" allowing member states to limit travel quickly in response to new variants or a deteriorating health situation in non-EU countries. This would be reviewed every two weeks.\nDiscussions on the plans will begin on Tuesday.\nThe EU has already announced plans for a digital certificate, which would cover anyone who is either vaccinated against Covid-19, has a negative test or has recently recovered.\nMember states will be able to accept tourists from outside the EU if they have received an approved jab, the European Commission said on Monday, although this could be extended for vaccines that have completed the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency use listing process.\nIn addition, children who have not been able to receive a vaccine should be able to travel with their parents as long as they present a negative test, although further testing may be required on arrival.\nUntil the EU-wide pass, known as the digital green certificate, is launched, countries \"should be able to accept certificates from non-EU countries based on national law\", the European Commission added. This decision would include \"ability to verify the authenticity, validity and integrity of the certificate and whether it contains all relevant data\".\nThe plans will increase also the threshold number of cases in countries from which all travel is allowed - subject to quarantine or testing - from 25 infections per 100,000 people to 100.  This, the proposals note, is still far below the EU average of more than 420 per 100,000.\nThe measures will not affect current rules on essential travel or EU citizens and long-term residents and their families.\nThe recommendation will cover all EU member states, apart from Ireland, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. \nSo far, the EU has approved four vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen/Johnson & Johnson. All require two injections for maximum protection, except for the single-dose Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nThe same jabs have been authorised for emergency use by the WHO, with similar approvals for China's Sinopharm and Sinovac expected in the coming days and weeks.\nAll three vaccines used in the UK - Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna - would therefore be covered by the new EU plans.\nLast week, European lawmakers approved plans for an EU-wide digital pass to restart travel in time for the summer holidays.\nKey to the certificate is a QR code - a machine-readable graphic code made up of black and white squares - that contains personal data and the EU's Commission says it will be safe and secure. It is working with the WHO to ensure the certificate is recognised beyond Europe.\nThe 27 member states also want to include non-EU countries such as Norway, Iceland and Switzerland, with officials saying earlier this week that vaccinated travellers from the US may also be able to visit Europe this summer.\nHowever, a spokesman for the European Commission said last week that there had been \"no contacts\" with the UK over the issue. The UK government, which has indicated that foreign travel may resume from 17 May, is working on its own digital system for international travel that would prove travellers' vaccination status. \nBut practical concerns over the EU certificate remain, including questions over how long immunity lasts after an infection and whether further jabs will be needed amid the rapid spread of more contagious Covid variants.\nOther issues include what data would be used to prove an individual was not infected with coronavirus, privacy concerns and issues recognising information from different countries' health authorities.\nA number of countries have already begun unveiling their own passes as they reopen.\nIn Denmark, the Coronapas app is being used to allow customers who have been vaccinated or recovered from an infection to enter bars, restaurants and museums.\nA similar scheme in Israel, which has one of the highest levels of vaccinations in the world, permits users to access hotels, gyms and theatres. The \"Green pass\" has also created travel opportunities for Israeli citizens, following deals with Greece and Cyprus.\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA), meanwhile, has launched its own app, the IATA Travel Pass, which is being trialled by a number of airlines, including Emirates, Etihad and Qantas."

      "text": "The majority of hospitality businesses have failed last-minute inspections for reopening as the Covid-19 lockdown eases, an industry body has said.\nOutdoor restaurants, bars and pubs in Northern Ireland are set to reopen on Friday under the new regulations.\nBut Hospitality Ulster said there was \"chaos\" over the implementation of the rules for the sector.\nIt said many venues had been told their outdoor seating areas did not adhere to guidelines from the Stormont executive.\nThe Executive Office said there had been \"no change to the definition of indoor and outdoor areas which applied last year\".\nThe Department of Health said the general rule of thumb was that outdoor premises should not be more than 50% enclosed.\nThe legislation states that a premises is enclosed if it has a ceiling or roof or is substantially enclosed if it has a ceiling or roof but there is \"an opening in the walls\".\nCouncils are responsible for conducting the inspections of hospitality businesses in their area and enforcing the regulations in relation to them.\nBelfast City Council said that while the definition of an outdoor area had not changed since last summer, legislation about \"when and how hospitality can operate has been subject to significant and constant\" change.\n\"The key difference is that the focus of the previous regulations was on whether hospitality could be open at all and if so whether they could serve food and drink on their premises.\n\"Therefore we were not required to consider if any outdoor hospitality space met the outdoors criteria.\n\"In the latest regulations the focus now is on allowing hospitality to operate outdoors.\"\nThe council said it tried to advocate a \"different approach\" to the new regulations but that it was ultimately the decision of the Executive Office.\nHospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said the situation was a \"direct slap in the face\" for the industry on the eve of reopening.\nThe interpretation of regulations was \"far too stringent\", he said, and he called for a \"common sense\" approach.\n\"It's chaos right across the province as a result of the Executive Office refusing to engage for months,\" he said.\n\"This could have been avoided if rules had been communicated earlier - there is no excuse for no engagement.\"\nThe Beannchor Group has said 10 of its 12 venues faced significant reductions to the space they could use as a result of the inspections.\nThe venues will open on Friday but not to the capacity the company had intended.\nIt owns Belfast venues such as the Dirty Onion, the National, and the Ulster Sports Club.\nCouncil inspectors say they are working with businesses to help them to comply with the rules.\nBut the failed inspections have come as a shock to business owners who thought their premises were compliant.\nMany of them had put a lot of money into renovating their premises to make them Covid-safe.\nThey are now trying to make last-minute adaptations in order to be able to reopen on Friday.\nConnell Wolsey, a director of the group, said the inspection failures had \"hit us substantially\".\n\"In the last lockdown we were inspected 50 times and we passed every single time,\" he said.\n\"Even the chief medical officer and the chief constable were happy with the levels we had gone to.\"\nHe said that although the regulations for the sector had not changed, it appeared that Belfast City Council and the Stormont executive had \"decided to enforce them in a different way\".\nHis group spent \u00a340,000 to install a retractable awning at one venue before opening on Friday only to be told it could not be used as it created an enclosed space.\n\"They're treating a picnic parasol as a roof - it's just a nonsensical reading of the law,\" he said.\nHe said that without the use of parasols, many hospitality businesses \"will have to base their opening hours on the weather forecast\".\nJohn Leighton of Bennigans Bar in Londonderry said he has had to take the difficult decision not to reopen on Friday.\nHe said there were \"too many grey areas\" when it came to how the 50% of enclosed space was determined.\n\"It became clear in conversation with the licensing officer that it was just about impossible for us to reopen,\" he said.\n\"We were so excited, had done all the preparations but I am not prepared to risk a fine or losing my licence.\"\nHe said the bar would instead reopen on 24 May.\nMonika Rawson was told on Thursday that she could fully reopen her restaurant in east Belfast because part of her outdoor terrace is covered by a roof.\nShe said it was \"hard to keep going\" while the restaurant was closed and the business had already struggled to survive during lockdown.\nThe resulting stress has caused her to lose her hair, she said.\n\"I'm very upset - when I think about it I feel like crying.\""

      "text": "The prime minister has announced new trade and investment deals with India worth \u00a31bn.\nIt includes more than \u00a3533m of new investment from India into the UK, which is expected to create about 6,000 jobs.\nDowning Street said the new partnership would \"pave the way\" for a future UK-India Free Trade Agreement.\n\"The economic links between our countries make our people stronger and safer,\" said Mr Johnson.\nThe deal, announced ahead of a virtual meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, includes a \u00a3240m investment by the Serum Institute of India, which will support clinical trials, research and possibly the manufacturing of vaccines.\nSerum has already started phase one trials in the UK of a one-dose nasal vaccine for coronavirus, in partnership with Codagenix.\nIndian investment deals will create 1,000 new UK jobs each at health and tech firms Infosys, HCL Technologies and Mphasis.\nSome 667 UK jobs will be created at Q-Rich Creations, 500 jobs at Wipro and 465 at 12 Agro.\n\"Each and every one of the more than 6,500 jobs we have announced today will help families and communities build back from coronavirus and boost the British and Indian economies,\" said Mr Johnson.\nTrade Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC that the jobs would be created \"within the next year or so\".\nShe said those commitments were \"very different\" from a free-trade deal, which the two governments will start negotiating on this autumn. Discussions will include lowering tariff barriers and new agreements on \"digital and data\".\nThe announcement on 6,000 jobs \"is really the tip of an iceberg\" Ms Truss said. \nTrade between the UK and India is worth about \u00a323bn per year, and the government hopes to double that by 2030.\n\"What we need to do is get the huge tariffs removed on products like whisky, which is over 100%; cars, which is over 100% - that is where the real opportunities lie for us,\" she said.\nThe do that, the UK is likely to have to relax immigration rules between India and the UK, Ms Truss added.\n\"We've already made significant steps in improving the immigration regime with the post-study work visa. We've seen a massive rise in Indian students coming to the UK.\"\n\"Business mobility is a key part of trade. Particularly as the UK and India are both very strong in services, you need to make sure you're able to get your professionals over to the country,\" Ms Truss added.\nIn recent years, the UK has sold more to Belgium or Sweden than India. But the government hopes that closer ties with one of the most populous and fastest-growing major economies could have huge long-term potential - especially as tensions with China mount. \nIt believes that this announcement, which boosts access to India for producers of British fruit and medical devices - and means investment in the UK from India's vaccine producers - is just a taste of what could be achieved.\nBut economists warn that getting a full deal with Delhi that lowers tariff and non-tariff barriers won't be easy. India is likely, for example, to want UK entry visa requirements for its workers and students to be eased. \nAttempts by the European Union, Australia and New Zealand to strike free trade deals with India have all stalled. \nBut as that nation grapples with the economic damage caused by the pandemic and the rising threat from China, it may now take a more pragmatic approach to brokering an agreement. \nMeanwhile, British businesses have secured export deals with India worth more than \u00a3446m, which are expected to create more than 400 British jobs.\nThey include a \u00a3200m deal involving CMR Surgical, which will create 100 new UK jobs.\nThe company's next-generation 'Versius' surgical robotic system - which helps surgeons perform minimal access surgery - will be rolled out to hospitals in India.\nTrade between the UK and India is already worth around \u00a323bn a year, supporting more than half a million jobs, according to the government.\nMr Johnson said: \"In the decade ahead, with the help of new partnership signed today and a comprehensive free trade agreement, we will double the value of our trading partnership with India and take the relationship between our two countries to new highs.\"\nTrade body the CBI said the updated trade partnership \"shows the world the strength of our relationship\".\nCBI president Lord Bilimoria said the talks would \"unlock opportunities for businesses, boost job creation and growth across the country\".\nMr Johnson had been forced to cancel a planned visit to Delhi as it battles with a brutal second wave of coronavirus cases.\nThe visit was designed to foster closer ties between the two countries and had first been scheduled for January.\nIt was delayed after the UK's higher wave of Covid infections over winter.\nA four-day trip was scheduled for April before being cut back to just one day in Delhi, before being postponed indefinitely last month, with India subsequently added to the UK's travel \"red list\".\nOn Monday, authorities in Delhi called for help from the army. The government wants it to run Covid care facilities and intensive care units.\nAcross India, case numbers since the start of the outbreak are closing in on 20 million.\nIn response to India's coronavirus surge, the British Asian Trust has raised more than \u00a31.6m in the last week through its emergency appeal."

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Boris Johnson,Social distancing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is a \"good chance\" the 1m plus social distancing rule can be scrapped on 21 June in England, the prime minister has said.\nBoris Johnson said the results of the vaccine rollout are \"really starting to show up in the epidemiology\" - but any change would depend on the data.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer agreed that caution was necessary.\nMr Johnson also suggested there could be some \"opening up\" of foreign travel on 17 May.\nDuring a campaign visit to Hartlepool the prime minister said ministers would say more about travel \"as soon as we can\" but \"we have got to be very, very tough\".\nHe said that \"the way things are going\" with the vaccine rollout, the 1m plus rule - which allows people to be 1m apart if they take extra precautions such as wearing face coverings - could end when England reaches the final step of its roadmap out of lockdown.\nMr Johnson said 50 million doses of coronavirus vaccine have been administered. That includes more than 34 million people who have had a first dose and more than 15 million who have had a second, according to the latest government figures.\nHe said he felt as though the next stage of reopening on 17 May - which covers indoor hospitality, entertainment and possibly foreign travel - would \"be good\".\n\"I think we have got a good chance of being able to dispense with the 1m plus from 21 June,\" he added.\n\"That is still dependent on the data, we can't say it categorically yet. We have got to look at the epidemiology as we progress, we have got to look at where we get to with the disease. But that's what it feels like to me right now.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said any easing of social distancing measures would have to be \"cautious and careful\".\n\"All of us want to see the restrictions eased but also want to make sure we don't go into another lockdown,\" he said.\n\"I will listen to what scientists say - there are a number of weeks to run until 21 June. I hope we get to situation we can ease restrictions but have got to be led by science.\"\nAre we are on the brink of beating the virus? Talk of foreign travel and the end of social distancing raises the very real prospect we are.\nIt would be foolish to say, categorically, this is it.\nEven with the continued successful rollout of the vaccination programme, there is still scope for the virus to spread, given the jabs are not 100% perfect and not everyone will get vaccinated.\nVariants could also still cause problems - although there is plenty of evidence to suggest these will be more limited than sometimes seems to be the case. Experts remain confident that even if the mutations help the virus dodge some of the immune response from the vaccines, the jabs will still be very effective at preventing serious illness.\nSo while the virus is not going away (cases are certainly going to rise again) the risk it poses has been dramatically reduced.\nAnd that means our response to it can be, too, so some of the non-Covid harms of the past year can really start to be tackled.\nIn Scotland, the government timetable for lifting Covid restrictions suggests physical distancing will be in place beyond \"Level 0\" - the lowest level of curbs - currently expected from late June.\nIn Wales, where \"alert level 3\" restrictions are in place, even its lowest alert level 1 suggests people should still observe \"social distancing rules with people you do not live with or who are not in your exclusive extended household\".\nThe Northern Ireland Executive has described social distancing as part of the \"personal responsibility to protect ourselves and others\" that could be required \"for some time\".\nThe British Beer and Pub Association said the prime minister's comments offered the sector \"hope of a return to normality and viability\".\nChief executive Emma McClarkin said: \"Given pubs are financially unviable under the current restrictions they face, being able to reopen without any restrictions at all from 21 June is going to be vital to their survival.\"\nShe added: \"Our recovery only begins when the restrictions are removed.\"\nSpeaking before Mr Johnson's comments, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, said recommencing unrestricted trading on 21 June would be \"critical\" and would allow companies to \"come off life support\".\n\"We urge the government to confirm reopening dates and these plans at the earliest opportunity, which will boost confidence and allow companies to step up planning and bring staff back,\" she said.\nAsked about international travel, Mr Johnson said experts were assessing which countries were safe.\n\"We do want to do some opening up on 17 May, but I don't think the people of this country want to see an influx of disease from anywhere else,\" he said.\n\"I certainly don't and we have got to be very, very tough and have got to be as cautious as we can whilst we continue to open up.\"\nMr Johnson's comments came after a group of MPs called on the government to keep travel rules in England in place beyond mid-May.\nForeign holidays are currently banned, but a traffic light system of rules will be introduced with countries classed as green, amber or red.\nTravellers to green countries will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test.\nArrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals allowed to return and they must pay to stay in a government quarantine hotel.\nFurther details are expected this week, after the government said it will \"set out by early May\" how countries will be categorised.\nMany in the travel industry are hopeful for holidays this summer, while countries such as Spain, France, Greece, Portugal and Cyprus are preparing to open to tourists.\nThe European Commission has also recommended opening up to travellers who have received both doses of the vaccine.\nThe boss of Thomas Cook earlier told the BBC he expected many popular destinations, particularly in Europe, to be open to UK holidaymakers this summer as they were making \"great progress\".\nThe first ministers of Scotland and Wales have previously argued that 17 May would be too early for foreign holidays to resume, and no date has yet been set for rules to be relaxed. Northern Ireland's executive has not said anything about when it expects to make an announcement.\nBut a representative from the travel industry in Scotland has said any plan needs to be agreed between the four nations.\n\"There's no way it's going to work [with] Scotland operating a different system to England when you can freely travel across the border and fly out of an English airport - and that's exactly what will happen,\" said Alan Glen, from the Scottish Passenger Agents Association.\nThe next stage of England's lockdown easing is expected in a fortnight, on 17 May. As well as the possibility of international travel, people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people or two households can meet indoors."

      "tags": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office,International aid,G7",
      "text": "The G7 group of nations is to agree a new target of sending 40 million more girls from low and middle income countries to school within five years.\nForeign ministers will use a London summit to commit to helping women in developing countries with a $15bn (\u00a310.8bn) two-year package of support.\nAt their first in-person meeting for two years, they will also agree to help 20 million more girls read by age 10.\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said educating girls was a smart investment.\nHe added that the new targets would help ensure 12 years of continuous education for young women and transform \"the fortunes not just of individuals, but whole communities and nations\".\nCharities have welcomed the pledge - but said it was at odds with the UK's decision to cut its overseas aid spending.\nThe UK government announced last year it would cut UK aid spending from 0.7% of national income to 0.5% - a reduction of more than \u00a34bn. It has yet to confirm which programmes will be affected.\n\"We know the reality of these aid cuts,\" said Gwen Hines from Save the Children. \"Life-changing, life-saving support [is] being pulled from families in the middle of a pandemic from schooling, medicine and food.\n\"I just don't see how that is global leadership at a time when the UK is hosting the G7 summit.\"\nThe UK holds the rotating presidency of the G7 group, which also includes the US, France, Germany, Canada, Japan and Italy, and will host a summit of leaders in Cornwall next month.\nMr Raab will meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken later to discuss trade, Iran and China, as part of a three-day meeting of G7 foreign ministers in London. \nThe collective agreement on girls' education, which will be formally signed on Wednesday and also includes the EU, aims to put \"gender equality at the heart of global co-operation to build back better\" from Covid, the government said.\nWomen make up more than two-thirds of the world's 796 million illiterate people, according to the United Nations.\nThe UN said 39% of girls in rural areas attend secondary school worldwide - fewer than rural boys (45%), urban girls (59%) and urban boys (60%).\nIt was estimated that, before the pandemic worsened education outcomes, 90% of children in low income countries were unable to read a simple text by age 10.\nAs part of the funding, there will be renewed support for women-led businesses, and for products or services that particularly benefit women and support their empowerment.\nThe government said the G7 nations would also \"recommit to collective action to defend and protect sexual and reproductive health and rights for all\" and \"scale up gender-based violence prevention and elimination\".\nThe G7 announcement comes amid criticism over the UK's cut to aid spending. The Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) has been accused of going back on a promise to continue funding for UN family planning projects aimed at helping women and girls.\nThe UN Population Fund - which helps provide contraceptives and maternal health care for millions of women - said the UK pledged \u00a3154m for its projects, but then said it would instead receive about \u00a323m.\nIt has also been criticised for the timing of a planned cut in bilateral funding for clean water and sanitation projects.\nAnnette Zera, who works for an education charity helping girls working as domestic servants in Bangladesh, said the aid authorities \"have just let us down\".\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that their project \"is going to have to stop\" because it will no longer receive the grant it expected.\nForeign Office minister James Cleverly said \"there will always be, sadly, individual projects we are not able to support\".\n\"We are experiencing a once in a 300-year - the worst in 300 years - economic contraction as a direct result of coronavirus,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme as he defended the cuts. \"We have to make the decisions in keeping with those economic circumstances.\"\nHe said the UK remained one of the world's leading aid donors and that the reduction in aid spending to 0.5% of national income would be \"temporary\"."

      "text": "The UK and Iran are in discussions over a \u00a3400m debt that the UK owes, foreign office minister James Cleverly has said - but the talks are not linked to the detention of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.\nThe UK owes the money for failing to deliver tanks Iran bought in the 1970s.\nBritish-Iranian national Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is in jail in Iran, believes she has been imprisoned as leverage for the debt.\n\"There are two entirely separate issues,\" the prime minister said.\nSpeaking to reporters during a visit to Hartlepool, Boris Johnson said ministers were doing \"everything we can to look after the interests of Nazanin and all the very difficult dual national cases we have in Tehran\".\nThe case of Mrs Zaghari Ratcliffe made headlines again in recent weeks after she was sentenced to another year in prison, just weeks after she reached the end of a five-year sentence. She was first jailed in Tehran in 2016 on spying charges, which she has always denied.\nHer husband, Richard, maintains she is being used as a bargaining chip in the dispute over the unpaid debt, as well as leverage in talks over the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.\nOn Sunday, Iranian state TV suggested the UK had paid the \u00a3400m debt - but the UK government said nothing had changed. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Foreign Office minister Mr Cleverly said: \"The situation with regards to the... military contract from the 1970s which has dragged on for decades, those negotiations are ongoing. They have been for a long while, sadly, but they are ongoing.\"\nAsked if the talks were getting anywhere, Mr Cleverly said: \"There's a legal process tied up with this as well. Iran most recently stepped away from that legal process which has of course delayed things.\n\"We are looking at ways of resolving what has been a multi-decade long problem. \n\"The reports that we had over the weekend linking that work with the incarceration and the arbitrary detention of British dual nationals I think was completely inappropriate - they are separate issues, one massively predates the other.\"\nHe said the imprisonment of dual nationals in Iran \"should be unlinked to the multi-decade long dispute with regard to the tanks\".\nBy Caroline Hawley, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent\nThe decades-old debt and the imprisonment of British-Iranian nationals may be \"separate issues\" to the UK government. However, they are not in the eyes of Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has been involved in the detention of both Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, a 67-year-old retired engineer now serving a 10-year sentence in Evin jail - where he has twice attempted suicide. Both of them have been told directly that their cases are connected to the military debt.  \nWe don't know exactly what's happening behind the scenes to resolve the debt. British officials have said sanctions on Iran are an obstacle to repayment, but negotiations have been taking place in Vienna which would involve lifting US sanctions in return for Iran complying with the nuclear deal it signed in 2015.  \nAs the nuclear deal came into force back in early 2016, the US paid back its own historic military debt and in return saw the release of four Americans detained in Tehran. Richard Ratcliffe believes Iran is now trying to engineer a \"grand bargain\" - involving frozen assets, Iranian prisoners and jailed dual nationals from several countries.   \nAnd this is against the backdrop of Iran's complex internal politics and elections in June pitting hardliners against moderates.   \nIt's all extraordinarily complicated and, for the innocent families caught up in it, exceedingly fraught.\nMeanwhile, Tulip Siddiq - who is the MP representing 42-year-old Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from West Hampstead in London - tweeted: \"People seem to be being fed a false narrative that the \u00a3400m in Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case is a ransom. It is not. It is a historic debt that the courts (and the government) have confirmed the UK owes Iran.\"\nThe UK government has repeatedly condemned Iran's treatment of her - and on Sunday Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab used its strongest language to date when he said it \"amounts to torture\".\nSpeaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Raab said Tehran was using her in \"a cat-and-mouse game\" for diplomatic leverage.\n\"Nazanin is held unlawfully, in my view, as a matter of international law. I think she's being treated in the most abusive, tortuous way,\" he said.\nRichard Ratcliffe - who has not seen his wife since 2016 - said the family had not been updated but welcomed the reports on Iranian state TV over the long-running dispute as \"a good sign\".\n\"My instinct is that it is actually a sign we are in the middle of negotiations rather than at the end of them,\" he told the BBC.\n\"But we will keep our fingers crossed - for ourselves, and all the other families caught up in this.\""

      "tags": "Social media,Body image,Social media influencers,Instagram,Social media regulation debate",
      "text": "NHS England has urged Instagram to clamp down on accounts selling an unlicensed, \"dangerous\" drug mainly targeted at younger women and girls.\nThe sale of Apetamin is illegal in the UK, but BBC Three revealed it is available in shops and online.\nIn an open letter, NHS leaders say they are concerned about the product's promotion and the impact on physical and mental health. \nInstagram say selling non-medical drugs is \"strictly against our policies\".\nApetamin is not licensed in the UK which means the regulator has not carried out tests to ensure it meets strict safety standards and it should not be sold, supplied or advertised.\nDoctors say misuse of the appetite stimulant can cause severe fatigue, jaundice and even liver failure. \nHowever, the syrup is regularly promoted by social media influencers as a quick way to gain weight and develop an extreme hourglass figure, like celebrities Kim Kardashian and Cardi B.\nInstagram said it had taken down accounts that sell and advertise Apetamin in response to the BBC Three documentary Dangerous Curves, which aired on 21 April.\nHowever, NHS England says it's since found \"dozens of profiles\" are still active and when this was reported, \"no action was taken\".\nIn the letter, National Medical Director, Stephen Powis and National Mental Health Director, Clare Murdoch, demand an urgent update on what action the site is taking to tackle accounts selling Apetamin. \n\"We are concerned about both the physical and mental health impacts of the promotion of this drug and strongly urge you to demonstrate duty of care to your customers and clamp down now on this dangerous content.\"\nThey say they are sending the letter \"on behalf of NHS patients, staff and people experiencing body dysmorphia and other mental health conditions, as well as their families\".\nThe letter, which has also been signed by the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation, has asked Instagram to confirm whether it thinks social media firms should contribute more financially to young people's mental health services - which it's claimed are increasingly being called on.\n\"It's time these media giants stepped up to the plate and took some responsibility,\" Claire Murdoch told the BBC.\n\"Here we are investing more than ever in mental and physical heath, these media giants like Instagram need to contribute more as well.\"\nThe BBC has found Apetamin is also still being sold on other online sites and in shops, following its investigation.\nTwo years ago, Vanessa was taking Apetamin on a regular basis.\n\"I used to be happy with my body, but social media has affected the way I think. I developed insecurities I never knew I had,\" explains the 23-year-old.\n\"When you take Apetamin you can't control the weight you gain. It doesn't go to the right places, just straight to the belly. I was also really bloated and tired.\"\nVanessa, who always bought the product in a shop, says removing accounts which sell Apetamin will help, but won't solve the problem.\n\"A lot of people are blind to the pressure that makes you do things you shouldn't do. People make rude comments and 'skinny-shame' you. \n\"They say you don't look good and a curvaceous figure is the desired shape.\n\"It's madness women and girls like me are willing to take such a risk, but the pressures must be hitting us hard for us to think it's worth it.\"\nIn a statement from the Facebook company, which owns Instagram, a spokesperson said: \"The wellbeing of our community is our top priority and buying and selling non-medical or prescription drugs is strictly against our policies.\n\"We remove accounts that sell Apetamin when we become aware of them and block related hashtags so this content is harder to find. \n\"We'll continue working with law enforcement and youth organisations to help keep drugs sales of any kind off Instagram.\" \nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is currently investigating the sale of Apetamin, which is made by TIL Healthcare in India. \nThe company's spokesperson has previously told the BBC it is not exporting the product to the UK and it has no information on its availability in the UK."

Likewise, there's no law requiring club- and festival-goers to show their pass, if they choose not to.\nHowever, the government says it reserves the right to make showing the pass compulsory at a later date.\nYou will still have to self-isolate if you have Covid symptoms, test positive or are told to do so by NHS Test and Trace. \nIn pubs, cafes and restaurants:\nAt music venues/events:\nSome summer festivals are still planning to go ahead as planned, but others have been cancelled altogether, gone online, or been rescheduled.\nOrganisers of the Latitude (late July), Reading and Leeds (late August) festivals say they will \"sell to capacity\" and are not inclined to encourage those attending to wear masks.\nAll parts of Scotland will move to Covid-protection level zero, with a few changes:\nUnder-12s won't count towards group sizes or the number of households.\nThere will be a 400-person limit for indoor events, 1,000 for outdoor standing events and 2,000 for outdoor seated events.\nUntil 19 July, most areas of Scotland are in level 1 or 2. \nLevel two areas:\nLevel one areas:\nScotland is aiming to remove all major legal Covid restrictions by 9 August.\nRestrictions are due to be relaxed on 26 July (subject to approval on 22 July).\nIndoor gigs and concerts will be allowed without noise restrictions, as long as the audience stay in their allocated seats.\nSocial distancing rules will be removed for outdoor events and relaxed indoors.\nUnder current rules:\nAt the moment, up to six people from different households can meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants. \nPeople who do not live together, or are not in bubbles, should remain socially distanced, 2m (6ft) apart.\nBusiness owners are responsible for making their premises as safe as possible:\nThe maximum number of people allowed at outdoor \"regulated gatherings\" - such as festivals and concerts - is 4,000 standing and 10,000 seated. Capacity rules for indoor music and comedy venues have already relaxed a little.\nFrom 17 July, organised indoor events can take place for up to 1,000 seated and up to 200 standing.\nFrom 7 August, if conditions allow, there will be no legal limits on the number of people who can meet others in places like pubs and restaurants. Masks will also no longer be required in hospitality settings. All businesses currently closed - such as nightclubs - will be allowed to reopen subject to ongoing risk assessments. "

      "text": "Some families and friends have been able to hug for the first time in months and people went back to gyms as Covid lockdown rules eased in Wales.\nTwo households - plus another living on their own - can now form a \"bubble\" to meet and have contact indoors.\nGyms, swimming pools and community centres have reopened after a relaxing of restrictions while indoor classes for adults and children can restart.\nWales' Covid case rate has fallen to its lowest point in eight months.\nOrganised children's indoor activities - like sports classes, scouts, guides - can also restart for the first time since lockdown returned in December.\nIndoor fitness classes can begin again for up to 15 adults, but only if they are organised and in a regulated setting, like a studio or gym.\nHowever, children's birthday parties and family gatherings are still banned.\nChildren's soft play areas are not due to reopen until 17 May - the day pubs and restaurants are due to open indoors and all holiday accommodation can reopen.\nGyms, fitness facilities, leisure centres, spas and swimming pools were all able to reopen from Monday, with strict social distancing and sanitising procedures in place.\nThis latest easing of lockdown is the last act of the current Welsh Labour government before Thursday's Welsh Parliament election.\nThe change was originally planned for 10 May, but was moved forward by a week because of a drop in Covid cases, the Welsh government said.\nThe move followed pressure from gym owners and opposition parties. \n\"You can see everyone's really happy to be back,\" said Craig Hulme, owner of the Valhalla gym in Wrexham.\nHe added the \"stop, start\" nature of the restrictions had made it very difficult to develop the business, despite having invested in new equipment at the start of 2020.\nThe reintroduction of extended households means not just going into the homes of family bubbles  - but having contact, like a hug or a cuddle.\nGrandmother Ann Phillips was \"very emotional\" at giving first grandchild Theo - born in October - a cuddle for the first time in more than five months.\n\"It was so lovely and I was very emotional,\" said the 66-year-old from Penarth in the Vale of Glamorgan.\n\"He's my first grandchild and not being able to give him a cuddle has been so hard but we've played by the rules and have been very cautious for the sake of everyone.\n\"So to hug him today was beautiful. It felt very familiar and now I can't wait to make up for lost time.\"\nTheo's mum Liz, who lives in nearby Barry, took her six-month-old son to parents Tony and Ann's house on Monday for the \"very special day\" - which included plenty of tea and cakes.\n\"I'm so close to my parents so the last few months has been quite hard, especially as Theo is my first child,\" said Liz, 40.\n\"It meant the world to see mum and dad giving him a cuddle - and Theo loved having a hug from his grandparents. Today was a very special day.\"\nParent and baby and parent and toddler classes were able to restart from Monday - with strict Covid procedures - and Christie-Ann Jones was excited to get back for her daughter Eira-Lily and to spend time with their new friends.\nThe mother and daughter, from Cardiff, had gone to their first baby class in September before the winter lockdown.\nAfter spending her maternity leave in lockdown, Ms Jones said it had then been hard not being able to talk to other new mothers, to \"go through it together\" and \"bounce off\" while sharing the experience of having a new baby.\n\"I'm so glad to be able to go out - it's been so isolating and lonely,\" she said.\n\"I haven't had that same connection with other mums - it's been so hard.\"\nWell, you can make a splash now as pools are allowed to reopen - and bathers in Swansea wasted no time for a dip as the city's Penlan Leisure Centre opened just after midnight.\nGeneral Manager Jim Kelly said about 30 people queued to use the pool after it reopened at 12:01 BST on Monday.\n\"It was really good to see the excitement from those customers,\" he said.\nRhys Jones of Better, which runs leisure centres in Cardiff, said allowing gyms and pools to reopen would help prevent a further \"health crisis\".\n\"Exercising has been tough throughout the lockdown winter months and people have been robbed of the opportunity to enjoy regular exercise.\n\"This has had untold consequences on the physical and mental health of our population and for every day that leisure facilities remain closed, public health deteriorates further, and the risk of obesity and stress becomes critical.\"\nThe latest lockdown easing means Wales is entirely into its alert level three - or very high - tier of restrictions where many strict Covid rules remain in place in a bid to control the virus.\nAlthough indoor entertainment venues, indoor visitor attractions and nightclubs remain shut, more sectors can reopen as the country has the lowest case rate and has vaccinated the highest percentage of people in the UK.\nWales' infection rate of 10.8 cases per 100,000 and its virus positivity rate are at their lowest since 1 September.\nCovid patient hospital admissions are now in single figures and at their lowest since the start of the pandemic.\nWales is the last UK nation to reopen gyms and swimming pools for individual exercise.\nBut it is the first to allow adult indoor group exercise and indoor mixing of two households - those will not happen in England and Scotland until 17 May and in Northern Ireland until 24 May at the earliest.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said he could \"allow more elements of normal life to return\" because of a \"successful\" vaccination programme and an \"improving public health situation\".\n\"However, the virus has not gone away,\" he added, warning people to continue to wash hands regularly, wear a face covering in enclosed public spaces, follow social distancing rules and \"limit the number of people we meet socially outdoors\".\n\"By working together, by following these rules, the quicker we will return to normality,\" he added.\nThe easing of rules so gyms could reopen and people could form an extended household was due to happen on 17 May but was brought forward on 9 April.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called it \"a last-minute and cynical sop just days before the election\".\n\"People up and down Wales will be relieved that Labour is at last following the data,\" he said.\n\"But as the Welsh Conservatives have advocated, this could have come sooner and not as a last-minute and cynical sop just days before the election.\n\"On Thursday, people across Wales have an opportunity to end these political games and can turn the page on 22 years of Labour holding back our country and our economy.\"\nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nPlaid Cymru paid tribute to the \"collective effort\" of Wales residents for the latest rule easing.\nLeader Adam Price said: \"It remains the case that when further restrictions are eased that businesses must be supported with restart grants after an incredibly difficult start to the year.\n\"A Plaid Cymru government will provide restart grants of up to \u00a320,000 to businesses in the retail, hospitality, and leisure sectors.\"\nWelsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said she was pleased to see the reopening of gyms and swimming pools but added many business were \"still suffering\".\nShe added: \"At this week's election Welsh Liberal Democrats are pledging to put recovery first and are proposing an extensive and comprehensive package of support for our businesses and high street.\""

      "title": "Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?",
      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indicated there will be some \"opening up\" of foreign travel on 17 May - but said it was important to be cautious.\nMore details are expected this week to confirm when and how international travel will restart in England.\nSpeaking on Monday, the PM said \"we'll be saying more as soon as we can\" but \"we have got to be very, very tough\".\nHe also said there was a \"good chance\" of the one-metre plus social distancing rule being scrapped on 21 June.\nHe stressed any decision on changing the rules was dependent on the data.\nOn Monday, Public Health England reported 1,649 new cases alongside a single death within 28 days of a positive test across the UK. \nThe recorded number of daily deaths is often lower at weekends and on bank holidays due to delays in reporting.\nFifty million doses of coronavirus vaccine had now been administered across the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed.\nMr Johnson was speaking after a group of MPs called on the government to keep travel rules in place beyond mid-May.\nThe all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus said arrival halls in airports risked becoming a \"breeding ground\" for the virus.\nThe group of more than 60 MPs and peers said the government should discourage people from travelling abroad unless it was essential.\nForeign holidays are currently banned, but a traffic light system of rules is going to be introduced with countries classed as green, amber or red.\nTravellers to green countries will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test. \nArrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals allowed to return and they must pay to stay in a government quarantine hotel.\nFurther details are expected this week, after the government said it will \"set out by early May\" how countries will be categorised.\nMr Johnson was asked about holidays during a visit to Hartlepool, Teesside, and said experts were currently assessing which countries were safe.\n\"But I do think that it's important to be cautious in this,\" he said. \n\"We do want to do some opening up on 17 May but I don't think the people of this country want to see an influx of disease from anywhere else. \n\"I certainly don't and we have got to be very, very tough and have got to be as cautious as we can whilst we continue to open up.\"\nAsked whether people should be planning their summer holidays, Mr Johnson said: \"We'll be saying more as soon as we can. \n\"I think that there will be some openings up on the 17th but we have got to be cautious, we have got to be sensible, we have got to make sure we don't see the virus coming back in.\"\nHe added that \"we have got a good chance of being able to dispense with the one-metre plus from 21 June\" - but it was dependant on the data.\nMany in the travel industry are hopeful for holidays this summer, while countries such as Spain, France, Greece, Portugal and Cyprus are preparing to open to tourists.\nThe European Commission has also recommended opening up to travellers who have received both doses of the vaccine.\nThe boss of Thomas Cook earlier told the BBC he expected many popular destinations, particularly in Europe, to be open to UK holidaymakers this summer as they were making \"great progress\".\n\"When the holidays proper start at the end of June, we are expecting most of the countries that the UK goes on holiday to - Europe particularly - to be open,\" said Alan French.\n\"We are expecting Portugal, Spain, Greece, Croatia and so forth to be open; it would be nice if Turkey was open.\"\nMr French also said his company had noticed many people were booking holidays as larger groups since they had not seen their families and friends in such a long time.\nThe first ministers of Scotland and Wales have previously argued that 17 May would be too early for foreign holidays to resume, and no date has yet been set for rules to be relaxed. Northern Ireland's executive has not said anything about when it expects to make an announcement.\nBut a representative from the travel industry in Scotland has said any plan needs to be agreed between the four nations.\n\"There's no way it's going to work [with] Scotland operating a different system to England when you can freely travel across the border and fly out of an English airport - and that's exactly what will happen,\" said Alan Glen, from the Scottish Passenger Agents Association.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he will \"wait and see\" what the government announces, but said: \"We need to be very careful.\"\n\"What we can't have is a repeat of last summer, where the lists were chopping and changing on a daily or even weekly basis,\" he said.\nAccording to the all-party group of MPs who want the government to slow down with the reopening of foreign travel, airports should be made safer to make sure arrival halls have enough space for social distancing and to separate travellers coming from higher-risk countries.\nLiberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who chairs the group of MPs , said \"the model we have right now has too many holes [and] is too risky\".\n\"It is staggering that the government is even contemplating encouraging overseas holidays when airports are already struggling to keep the virus and new variants at bay,\" she said.\nThe group also wants stricter checks on Covid test certificates, after the trade union representing border staff said officials spot around 100 fake Covid test certificates a day. \nA government spokesperson said the traffic light system would allow the UK to manage the risk from different countries. \n\"We introduced robust border controls to stop coronavirus variants in their tracks and every essential check we've introduced for arrivals has strengthened our defences against new mutations.\"\nThe next stage of England's lockdown easing is expected in a fortnight, on 17 May. As well as the possibility of international travel, people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people or two households can meet indoors."

Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot (about 82%) have reached the fewest.\nAround 77% of people in their early 50s had also been given the booster and 81% of those in their late 50s.\nFor care home residents, the range is from just over 82% in Pembrokeshire to 96.6% of those on Anglesey having a booster.\nWales is slightly behind Scotland with the proportions of their populations given a first jab - 79.1%.\nBy 27 January, 2.5m people in Wales had been given their first dose. \nA total of 2,361,042 people have received a second jab, or 74.5% of the total population. \nMore than 64% of 16 and 17-year-olds have now received a second dose.\nWales (74.9%) and Scotland (75.3%) are close together on the proportions of second vaccinations.\nBy 27 January, England was on 71.6% and Northern Ireland trailing a little on 69.1%.\nFor the proportion of its population with booster doses, Wales is ranked fifth in the world, compared with other nations with a population above 1 million.\nWhen we look at figures within Wales, we can see Powys reached nearly 81% of its total population with two doses and 67.9% with boosters. \nSwansea Bay has reached the fewest proportion for vaccines, for all three doses (54.2%).\nNearly 62% of the youngest age group offered vaccines have taken a first dose in Wales by Wednesday.\nBut there is a big variation between counties. This ranged up to last Sunday from 74.1% in Monmouthshire and 70% in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) to less than half of 12 to 15-year-olds in Neath Port Talbot taking up the offer.\nRCT and Merthyr Tydfil have so far reached nearly half of this age group with second doses too."

      "tags": "Refugees and asylum seekers,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "President Joe Biden has lifted the US annual refugee cap, bowing to backlash from his party after he initially opted to stick by the Trump-era figure.\nThe Democratic president is raising the cap from 15,000 to 62,500 after outrage from progressives and refugee agencies. \nMr Biden said the lower figure \"did not reflect America's values\".\nReports said the president was concerned about letting in more people amid a record influx at the US-Mexico border.\nThe new figure of 62,500 \"erases the historically low number\" set by former President Donald Trump, Mr Biden said on Monday.  \nHe also said his administration intended to raise the number of refugees admitted next year to 125,000.\nBut he acknowledged the \"sad truth\" that the US would not achieve either target this year or next, arguing that his administration had to \"undo the damage\" of the previous one. \nThe lower ceiling \"did not reflect America's values as a nation that welcomes and supports refugees\", Mr Biden said.\nAbout 2,000 refugees were let into the US between October and March, according to the Refugee Processing Center.\nThe Biden administration has been accused of seeking to deflect blame on to the Trump administration for having, as the White House says, \"dismantled\" the immigration system down at the US-Mexico border. \nMr Trump did gradually slash the refugee cap through his tenure, bringing the number down from 110,000 in President Barack Obama's last year in office to the record low of 15,000. \nBut World Relief, a humanitarian organisation, last month said White House claims that the US refugee resettlement programme needed to be rebuilt after the Trump years were \"a completely false narrative\" and \"a purely political calculation\". \nMr Biden had vowed during his election campaign to hike the US cap on refugees. But in April he stunned many supporters with an emergency declaration that the admission of up to 15,000 refugees was \"justified by humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest\". \nThe president instead lifted restrictions on resettlements from Somalia, Syria and Yemen and provided more slots to arrivals from Africa, the Middle East and Central America.\nBut as Mr Biden faced swift blowback from refugee groups and members of his own party, the White House said just hours later that he would revise the figure in May. \nInfluential left-wing New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had described the lower refugee cap as \"xenophobic and racist\". \nMr Biden's flip-flop reportedly forced hundreds of refugees already cleared for travel to cancel their flights. \nA White House official told Reuters news agency on Monday that the president had chosen to raise the ceiling in order to \"send a very clear message that refugee processing is a critical part of America's place in the world\", adding that the initial cap \"did not send the right message\". \nThe decision has been applauded by refugee groups, including the International Rescue Committee.\n\"President Biden's decision is good for America and good for refugees,\" said its chief executive, David Miliband, a former British foreign secretary. \"We welcome the bold steps to build back refugee protection after four years of deeply damaging policy.\" \nThe country's refugee programme is distinct from the asylum system. Refugee status applies to those who seek protection while still overseas, while asylum seekers do so from a port of entry or from inside the US. \nBut the White House is known to be concerned about the optics of a record number of undocumented immigrants arriving at the southern border, with the influx expected to rise as the weather warms.\nFigures for unaccompanied children in particular have soared, straining shelters and available resources. Recent photos from inside a migrant border facility showed children crammed together without social distancing.\nLast week, Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, from the border state of Arizona, expressed frustration with Mr Biden's handling of the \"crisis\" - a label that the White House has so far resisted. \nOn Monday a survey from the Pew Research Center found a majority of American adults were critical of the US government's handling of the border situation. \nAbout two-thirds of US adults said the Biden administration was doing a very bad or somewhat bad job of dealing with the increased number of people seeking asylum. This included more than half - 56% - of Democrats polled."

He is sad to have to reveal personal medical information in these circumstances - but feels that others talking about their mental health experiences can help destigmatise the challenges so many people go through. \n\"He has been prescribed medication over the last 12 years on a number of occasions, including diazepam, to deal with panic attacks and anxiety disorder, alongside talking therapies.\""

      "tags": "Tamil Nadu,Narendra Modi,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party has failed to win a key state in elections held amid record Covid-19 deaths and cases. \nThe BJP targeted West Bengal heavily during campaigning but the state was comfortably held by the incumbent, Mamata Banerjee, a fierce Modi critic. \nHer win came as a surprise to political observers, who noted how much time and money the BJP invested in the state.\nMr Modi was even accused of focusing on polls rather than the pandemic.\nDespite the defeat, the BJP won nearly 80 seats to become the main opposition party in the state In the 2016 vote, Narendra Modi's party won just three seats there.\nElections also went ahead in Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala states as well as the territory of Pondicherry (Puducherry).\nThe BJP held power in the north-eastern state of Assam but failed to make major gains elsewhere. \nFor 10 straight days, daily cases in India have topped 300,000. It recorded more than 360,000 new cases and 3,417 deaths on Monday. On Sunday, the country set a new record for daily deaths, with 3,689 recorded. Hospitals are facing dire shortages of beds and medical oxygen, with many Indians resorting to desperate pleas on social media to secure help.\nCampaign rallies and voting have been blamed for the surge in cases. \nMr Modi and his home minister made dozens of speeches in West Bengal and were accused of focusing on the polls rather than the pandemic. \nWith almost all the results counted, the Trinamool Congress party (TMC) led by the state's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has won more than 200 seats in the 294-seat assembly.\nThe results are set to make Ms Banerjee the leader of West Bengal for a third time. She is also India's only female chief minister.\nCelebrating the win, she said West Bengal had \"saved\" India with the result and tackling Covid-19 would be her first priority.\nVictory was soured by the loss of her seat in Nandigram to a former aide turned defector to the BJP. She has said she will challenge the result in court but may have to run again to remain chief minister. \nWest Bengal, home to 90 million people and the city of Kolkata, is of particular interest to election watchers. It is one of the few states that have never been governed by Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP.\nAlthough assembly elections were held in five Indian states, the real battle was over West Bengal. \nThe BJP had pulled out all the stops for electioneering, with PM Narendra Modi leading its campaign from the front.\nTo enhance his appeal further to the Bengali voter, he had grown his beard long, with his supporters drawing comparisons with the state's much loved icon - Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore. \nBut in the end, it all came to nothing.\nAt a time when a deadly second wave of coronavirus swept India and led thousands of Indians across the country to beg for hospital beds and oxygen cylinders, Mr Modi's frequent visits to the state to address huge rallies were called out as a major failure of his prime ministerial duties.\nSo Mamata Banerjee fought back anti-incumbency, the BJP's mammoth election machinery, last-minute desertions from within her own party, and a largely unfriendly media to return for a third term.\nCongratulating Ms Banerjee in a tweet, Mr Modi also noted: \"From a negligible presence earlier [in West Bengal], BJP's presence has significantly increased.\"\nLeader of the opposition Congress party Rahul Gandhi congratulated Ms Banerjee for \"soundly defeating the BJP\" even though his party lost a significant number of seats in the state.\nHe was among a number of regional opposition leaders to revel in Ms Banerjee's win.\nSocial media was flooded with memes and posts about the success of \"Didi\" - a nickname for Ms Banerjee, meaning older sister.\nVoting in the state was held in eight phases over a month. The Election Commission is facing a great deal of criticism for refusing to reduce the number of phases and make campaigning virtual. Critics have accused the commission of being controlled by the BJP.\nA number of congratulatory tweets noted that the TMC had won \"despite\" the commission. \nAs well as the north-eastern states of West Bengal and Assam, there was voting in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the South Indian union territory of Pondicherry, and local council elections in some parts of Uttar Pradesh in the north and Telangana in the south.\nIn Tamil Nadu, the main regional opposition party, the DMK, took power. A left-wing coalition retained power in Kerala, while a BJP-led alliance won no seats there.\nOn top of the coronavirus pandemic, some analysts saw the results as showing the limits of the BJP's rhetoric in states with sizeable Muslim populations. \nIndia has recorded more than 19 million cases of coronavirus - second only to the US. It has also confirmed more than 218,000 deaths, though the real toll is thought to be far higher.  \nExperts have cited low testing rates and the number of people dying at home, especially in rural areas, as contributing factors to under-reported figures.\nThe country's previous highest daily death toll, also reported this week, was 3,645. \nThe head of the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India, which manufactures the AstraZeneca vaccine, has blamed India's government for the shortage of Covid jabs. \nAdar Poonawalla told the Financial Times that initially Narendra Modi's government only ordered 21 million doses, and a larger order was not placed until March, when the second wave of the pandemic had already hit India. The country has a population of 1.3 billion people.\nIn a separate statement, Mr Poonawalla said the Serum Institute of India has now received a total order of more than 260 million doses.\nBrazil and the US have both registered daily tolls of more than 4,000 during the course of the pandemic.\nIn India, distressing images of families begging for hospital beds and life-saving supplies have been emerging for more than 10 days, while morgues and crematoriums remain overwhelmed."
