      "title": "Covid-19: Brazil variant case in England hunted by officials",
      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Health officials are trying to trace one person in England who has been infected with a concerning variant of coronavirus first found in Brazil.\nThey are one of six cases of the P1 variant found in the UK in February.\nThe person is understood to have used a home testing kit but did not complete a registration form - prompting an appeal for anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February to come forward.\nLabour said there had been a lack of a \"comprehensive\" border system.\nThe P1 variant was first detected in travellers to Japan from Manaus in northern Brazil in January.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock will hold a meeting later to update MPs from all parties about the variant.\nThere have been concerns vaccines may not be as effective against the variant, but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be \"rapidly adapted\".\nDr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England (PHE), said the UK was more advanced than many other countries at identifying the variants and mutations, and therefore was able to act quickly.\nIn an attempt to find the unidentified person in England who was infected with the P1 variant, officials are asking anyone who took a test on 12 or 13 February and who has not received a result or has an uncompleted test registration card to come forward immediately by calling 119.\nThe hotel quarantine rule came into force on 15 February. It means that travellers coming to England from 33 countries - including Brazil - must pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while in Scotland the rule applies to international travellers from all countries.\nBefore that date, travellers arriving into the UK still needed to self-isolate in their homes for 10 days.\nBut Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said it was not known whether or not the unidentified person had recently been abroad, so it was not clear if they would have been self-isolating while they were infected.\n\"We need to find them as soon as possible,\" he told BBC Breakfast, adding that PHE was working with the postal service to try to locate them.\nMr Zahawi defended the testing system as \"pretty robust\" and said the UK's strategy of using surge testing to help identify cases of the variant was similar to other countries such as Australia. \nIt is tempting to think that if officials can identify the one missing case, the UK will be able to stamp out the Brazil variant. \nBut it's unlikely this will be possible. There will no doubt be more cases either of this variant or others circulating with the E484 mutation that allows the virus to escape some of the effect of the vaccines. \nThat's because not all positive cases can be checked for variants. The UK carries out nearly half of the genomic sequencing in the world and can check around 25,000 positive tests a week for variants. \nThat means about a quarter of positive cases were checked last week, but a month ago - with infection rates higher - it was under one in 10. \nWhat is more, not everyone who is positive comes forward for a test in the first place. We are seeing just the top of the iceberg.\nSo what is the strategy? Keep cases low and where possible try to limit the spread of these variants. \nAnd in the future, update the vaccines to work better against the variants if that is needed.   \nDr Hopkins told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that PHE was \"really clamping down\" with measures to prevent the spread of variants because the risk of transmission would increase when lockdown is eased - starting with England's schools reopening on 8 March.\nBut Prof Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said variants could threaten the UK's plans to relax restrictions.\n\"We are going to be faced with these [variants] in the next six months as we move towards relaxing measures. There are going to be challenges on the way and there is always a risk that we might have to go backwards, and that's what nobody wants,\" he told Today.\nThe unidentified England case of the Brazil variant is not linked to five other UK cases.\nThree of those cases are Scottish residents who flew to Aberdeen from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said.\nHolyrood said the three people tested positive while self-isolating. Other passengers who were on the same flight to Aberdeen are now being contacted.\nThe other two cases in England are from the same household in South Gloucestershire after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force.\nTwo other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant, so they are not included in the overall UK total of six.\nPHE said officials were tracking down passengers who were on Swiss Air flight LX318 from Sao Paulo to Heathrow, via Zurich, landing on 10 February.\nSara Blackmore, South Gloucestershire's public health director, said \"fast action\" by her local team meant the two cases were a \"very contained situation\".\nShe told the Today programme that everyone in five postcode areas of South Gloucestershire was being invited to take a Covid test, even if they did not have symptoms. But she said the extra testing was a \"precautionary measure\" and the risk to the community was \"low\".\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the news of the Brazil variant cases was \"deeply concerning\" and that it was \"vital\" everything was done to contain it.\n\"This is further proof that the delay in introducing a hotel quarantine was reckless and the continuing refusal to put in place a comprehensive system leaves us exposed to mutations coming from overseas,\" he added.\nHe later said he had written to Home Secretary Priti Patel calling for stricter measures at the border.\nChair of the Home Affairs Select Committee of MPs, Labour's Yvette Cooper, said officials must \"learn lessons\" from how other countries were enabling international travel during the pandemic.\nShe told the Today programme there were \"gaps and weaknesses\" in the measures to prevent variants from entering the UK and that \"stronger measures\" were needed.\nMs Cooper gave the example of South Korea's international travel arrangements, which include testing people at airports and providing contained transport for people from airports to their homes, so that they do not have to use public transport.\nAll travellers to the UK also need to present a negative Covid test taken a maximum of 72 hours before their departure. \nIt comes as the UK announced another 6,035 cases of coronavirus on Sunday and reported that a further 144 people had died within 28 days of a positive test.\nBut a milestone in the vaccination programme has been reached, with more than 20 million people having received their first dose of the vaccine."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

      "text": "Smokers caught sparking up at hospitals, playgrounds or on school sites in Wales now face a \u00a3100 fine.\nIt is also now illegal to smoke in outdoor areas of day-care and child-minding settings in Wales.\nMinister Eluned Morgan said it was a \"proud day\" after the Welsh Government became the first UK administration to implement such a ban.\nHowever smokers' rights campaigners have accused the government of trying to \"micro-manage people's lives\".\nIt is the first major set of curbs on smoking to be introduced since smoking in cars with children was banned in England and Wales in 2015.\nSmoking in enclosed public spaces was banned in Wales in 2007.\nThe Welsh Government said it hoped the ban would help protect people's health by discouraging adults and children from starting smoking and supporting those who are trying to quit.\nIn addition to fines, a speaker system which allows people to press a button and remind smokers they are breaking the law has been installed at the Grange Hospital in Cwmbran and the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport.\nA similar system has previously been used at hospitals in the Hywel Dda and Cardiff and Vale health board areas.\nEnforcement officers employed by Aneurin Bevan health board will also patrol hospital grounds. \nMinister for Mental Health and Well-being Baroness Morgan said the Welsh Government was \"immensely proud\".\n\"We've seen the impact of the indoor smoking ban and we hope this will be similarly successful,\" she said.\n\"This legislation will benefit the health of future generations in Wales, as fewer children will be exposed to smoking and, we hope, fewer will take it up themselves.\n\"We need to do everything we can to combat the harmful effects of smoking.\"\nSuzanne Cass, of anti-smoking group Ash Wales, said: \"We are very proud that Wales is leading the way with this forward-thinking legislation. \n\"For too long smoking has been perceived as a normal lifestyle choice with smokers being able to light up in places where our children play, socialise and learn. \n\"There is nothing normal about smoking, however. It is an extremely harmful addiction that all too often begins in childhood.  \n\"We hope that this legislation will make great strides in changing perceptions about this addiction and prevent children from becoming the next generation of adult smokers.\" \nBut the industry-funded Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco (Forest) has labelled the law \"unnecessary and wrong\" and like \"taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut\".\nDirector Simon Clark said there was no evidence to suggest the law would achieve what the Welsh Government wants it to.\nBanning smoking at hospitals was \"particularly unjust\", Mr Clark said, because it targets smokers who may be \"stressed and in need of a comforting cigarette\".\nHe added: \"Most smokers use their common sense and don't smoke around small children. They don't need politicians telling them how to behave.\"\nAbout 33,000 people in Wales have stopped smoking since the coronavirus pandemic began, a survey by charity Action on Smoking and Health suggests."

      "text": "Actor Johnny Briggs, who played Mike Baldwin in Coronation Street for 30 years, has died aged 85.\nHis family said he died peacefully after \"a long illness, with family by his side\" and asked for privacy to \"remember the wonderful times we had\".\nBriggs was made an MBE in the New Year's Honours in 2007, the year after his character left the ITV soap.\nBaldwin's affair with Deidre Barlow and his feud with her husband, Ken, were a long-running ratings hit for the show.\nCoronation Street colleagues have paid tribute to Briggs calling him a \"wonderful actor\" and describing Mike Baldwin as \"one of the most iconic characters the Street has ever known\".\nWilliam Roache, who played Baldwin's long-term rival Ken Barlow, said Briggs was a \"strong character who will be greatly missed\".\n\"Mike Baldwin and Ken Barlow were arch enemies for many years, but as an actor, Johnny was impeccable, always good, and I was so fortunate to have worked with him for so many years,\" he said.\nSue Nicholls, who plays Audrey Roberts, said he was \"a great friend\" and was \"always fun to be around\". \n\"He played the part of Mike Baldwin so well that, despite all Mike's ducking and diving, you were always on his side,\" she said.\nHelen Worth, who plays Gail Platt on the cobbles, said he was \"one of the Street's most memorable characters\".\nSally Dynevor, who plays Sally Webster, said \"what a wonderful actor he was\", while Samia Longchambon, who plays Maria Connor, tweeted she had \"fond memories\" of working with him, describing him as a \"lovely man\".\nAntony Cotton, who plays Sean Tully, said \"we all adored him\", while former soap writer Phil Ford tweeted it was \"very very sad\" to hear of his death.\nAnd John Whiston, managing director of continuing drama at ITV, said Briggs had been \"right at the centre of the show\" for years adding: \"When Mike Baldwin was in a scene it was very hard to look at anyone else.\"\nBorn on 5 September 1935 in Battersea, in south-west London, Briggs was evacuated to the countryside during World War II before embarking on a career in show business back in London at the age of 12.\nAfter a break for two years of service in Germany with the Royal Tank Regiment, starting in 1953, he resumed his acting career landing roles in several Carry On films and ITV police drama No Hiding Place.\nIt was not until 1976 that he landed his defining role as Mike Baldwin. \nAs the uncompromising businessman in the soap he feuded with Barlow and was caught up in a love triangle with with his wife Deirdre, played by Anne Kirkbride who died in 2015.\nLater, Baldwin would die in his rival's arms after suffering a heart attack, finally killing off the character after three decades.\nThe demise of Baldwin drew 12 million viewers and followed the character's battle with Alzheimer's - leading the actor to back a fundraising appeal to help those affected by the disease.\nBriggs won the British Soap Award for lifetime achievement in 2006.\nIn 1995 Briggs had a UK chart hit, alongside Coronation Street co-star Amanda Barrie, with a version of Frank and Nancy Sinatra's Something Stupid.\nHe also appeared on stage and in films alongside the likes of Norman Wisdom, Dirk Bogarde and Tommy Steele.\nHe married Caroline Sinclair in 1961 and had two children before the couple divorced in 1975.\nThe same year he married schoolteacher Christine Allsop, a marriage which produced four children."

      "text": "A doctor in Sacramento, California joined a traffic court hearing on Zoom while performing surgery on a patient.\nScott Green was dressed in surgical scrubs in an operating theatre when he appeared at his virtual trial on Thursday, the Sacramento Bee reported.\nWhen questioned by the judge, Mr Green said he was happy to go ahead, and that he had \"another surgeon right here who's doing the surgery with me\".\nThe judge said that would not be \"appropriate\" and postponed the trial.\nThe Medical Board of California has now said in a statement that it would look into the incident, adding that it \"expects physicians to follow the standard of care when treating their patients\".\nBefore the Sacramento Superior Court hearing, which was livestreamed on YouTube, a court clerk asked the plastic surgeon: \"Hello, Mr Green? Hi. Are you available for trial? It kind of looks like you're in an operating room.\"\nGreen responded: \"I am, sir. Yes, I'm in an operating room right now. Yes, I'm available for trial. Go right ahead.\"\nThe clerk told Mr Green that the hearing was being livestreamed online, because traffic hearings are required by law to be open to the public. At the same time, an officer summoned to appear in court raised her eyebrows.\nWhile waiting for the judge, Court Commissioner Gary Link, to enter the Zoom, Mr Green appeared to continue operating on the patient.\nOnce Mr Link had joined, he told the hearing: \"So unless I'm mistaken, I'm seeing a defendant that's in the middle of an operating room appearing to be actively engaged in providing services to a patient. Is that correct, Mr Green? Or should I say Dr Green?\"\nAfter the surgeon confirmed he was in the middle of performing surgery, and that he would be happy to continue, Mr Link said: \"I do not feel comfortable for the welfare of a patient if you're in the process of operating that I would put on a trial, notwithstanding the fact the officer is here today.\"\nMr Green then insisted he was able to go ahead, adding: \"I have another surgeon right here who's doing the surgery with me, so I can stand here and allow them to do the surgery also.\"\nMr Link replied: \"I don't think so, I don't think that's appropriate. I'm going to come up with a different date - when you're not actively involved or participating and attending to the needs of a patient.\"\nBBC News has contacted Mr Green's office for comment. \nThe surgeon reportedly told NBC News: \"That's not accurate and I have nothing to say. Thank you.\"\nThis isn't the first Zoom court mishap to go viral. \nEarlier this month, a lawyer was unable to remove a cat filter from his screen, before telling the judge he was happy to go ahead anyway: \"I'm here live, I'm not a cat.\""

      "tags": "Yemen,UK aid,Yemen crisis",
      "text": "Britain has drastically cut its aid to Yemen, which has been devastated by conflict for six years, saying the pandemic created \"a difficult financial context for us all\".\nThe UK government said it would provide \"at least\" \u00a387m ($120m) this year, down from \u00a3164m pledged last year.\nAid officials have condemned the cut. The UN chief, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said reducing aid was a \"death sentence\".\nThe situation in Yemen has been called the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\nThe conflict began in late 2014, when rebels seized control of much of the west of the country and a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched a military operation to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's rule.\nAn estimated 20 million people - two-thirds of the Yemeni population - depend on humanitarian assistance. Some two million children are acutely malnourished.\nIn addition to conflict, Yemen has seen a collapse of its health system, leaving it incapable of coping with the coronavirus pandemic.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab told parliament that the UK remains \"as we have over the last five years, between the third and the fifth highest donor into Yemen\".\n It's true that the UK has consistently ranked in the top five sources of aid funding to Yemen, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which tracks humanitarian spending between countries. \nThe UN database recorded more than $200m from the UK to the war torn country last year, the third highest amount behind Saudi Arabia ($459m) and the United States ($697m).\nAid from all nations to Yemen has been falling in recent years though. It decreased from more than $5bn in 2018  to about $2bn in 2020, according to the UN.\nThe cut in the UK's contribution was announced on Monday at a virtual donors' conference by Minister of State for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly.\nHe said \"recent global challenges\" had \"meant a difficult financial context for us all\". Funding has fallen off in recent years, just as the pandemic has made needs more acute. \nSpeaking at the event, UN officials warned that if the UN failed to meet its $3.85bn target for 2021, millions of Yemenis could face starvation. It is unclear how much has been raised so far.\nDavid Beasley, Executive Director of UN's World Food Programme, told the conference: \"We've got famine knocking on the door.\"\nMr Gurerres said that generous donations had averted a famine in 2018, but that \"today, reducing aid is a death sentence\". \nThe US pledged an extra $191m at the event - bringing its total aid for Yemen to $350m this year.\nAn earlier version of the story gave a higher figure (\u00a3214m) for the total amount donated by the UK in 2020, which was the pledge (\u00a3164m) made at the aid conference last year plus additional spending"

      "text": "The Scottish government has agreed to release key legal advice from its court battle with Alex Salmond after MSPs threatened a vote of no confidence.\nHolyrood has twice voted to urge ministers to publish advice they were given after the former first minister took the government to court.\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney previously argued that such legal advice should remain confidential.\nBut on Monday he confirmed that the advice would be released to MSPs.\nThe move came after all opposition parties indicated they would back a motion of no confidence in Mr Swinney if he did not comply, with the SNP government facing defeat.\nThe Scottish Conservatives had lodged a one-line motion and were pushing for debate on Tuesday - but said they would withdraw it if the advice was released.\nMr Swinney said he would be handing \"key\" papers over to an inquiry committee \"to counter the false claims being made by some\" about what advice the government had been given and when.\nThe row centres on legal advice that was given to the Scottish government after Mr Salmond launched judicial review proceedings in 2018 over the way harassment complaints against him had been handled.\nThe government ended up admitting it had acted unlawfully because its investigating officer had had prior contact with the two complainers, and had to pay the former first minister more than \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses as a result.\nThe Holyrood inquiry investigating the botched probe has been keen to examine exactly what advice the government was given during the row, with Mr Salmond claiming that officials were told by lawyers that it was unlikely to win the case months before actually conceding defeat.\nThe former SNP leader said he had \"absolute reason to believe\" that counsel had informed the government on 31 October 2018 that they were facing defeat - only for the case to continue into January 2019.\nMr Swinney appeared to push back on this while confirming the advice would be published, saying: \"Serious allegations have been made - this material allows people to confirm that these allegations are false.\"\nThe SNP does not have a majority at Holyrood, and what became clear today was they would lose a vote of no confidence.\nWith that threat hanging over the deputy first minister, the government blinked and decided to take the highly unusual step of releasing the legal advice.\nIn fact, the Scottish government has never before handed legal advice over to a parliamentary committee with the expectation it will be published.\nThey're doing that because of political pressure - although they also say they are concerned that Alex Salmond's claims have threatened the integrity of the justice system.\nThis is happening the day before the Lord Advocate is due to give evidence, and two days before Nicola Sturgeon is due to appear in person. This is a massive week for this inquiry.\nMSPs twice voted to demand the inquiry was given access to all legal advice from the civil case.\nThe committee was given sight of a memo summarising key advice from the row, but continued to call for more detail - particularly after Mr Salmond's evidence session on Friday.\nOn Sunday, the Conservatives said they were giving Mr Swinney 24 hours to hand over the advice or face a motion of no confidence.\nAnd on Monday they published a motion stating that \"the parliament has no confidence in the deputy first minister, in light of the government's continued failure to publish legal advice called for in two resolutions of the parliament\".\nAll opposition parties backed the move, meaning the minority SNP government could have been heading for defeat - with Tory leader Douglas Ross saying the deputy first minister was \"out of options - release the legal advice or lose his job\".\nMr Swinney confirmed on Monday evening that \"the key legal advice that underpinned the Scottish government's defence of the judicial review\" would be released on Tuesday.\nHe said: \"In normal circumstances, government legal advice is not released. Indeed, such is the importance of being able to get frank, private advice, it is almost unheard of for the legal advice to be released.\n\"But we have to acknowledge that the issues at stake now are not normal. The very integrity of the legal system is being questioned.\n\"Serious allegations have been made. This material allows people to confirm that these allegations are false.\"\nIndependent MSP Andy Wightman - a member of the inquiry committee - said it was \"not for the government to determine what is key legal advice\", saying the motion of no confidence should be kept on the table.\nThe Scottish Conservatives then tweeted that \"we will not remove the no confidence motion until we know John Swinney will fully publish the legal advice\".\nThe inquiry committee is to take evidence from Lord Advocate James Wolffe - the government's top legal advisor - on Tuesday.\nNicola Sturgeon will then follow on Wednesday, with the first minister saying she is looking forward to putting her side across."

      "text": "People are keen to return to the office because working from home has left many \"fatigued\", says a boss at Britain's biggest office and retail complex.\nHoward Dawber, head of strategy at Canary Wharf Group, said people will still want to divide time between the workplace and home.\nBut they are missing office and city-centre life, he told the BBC.\nThe Canary Wharf financial complex, in London, has only about 6,000 people on site, against 100,000 pre-Covid.\nCanary Wharf Group is the developer behind roughly 7.5 million square feet of office space and would stand to benefit financially if there is a surge in demand once lockdown restrictions ease.\nBut Mr Dawber argued on the BBC's Today programme that people will be eager to get back in the office after so long away from the workplace.\n\"We've got to the point where there is a lot of fatigue out there,\" he said.  \n\"Working from home for the first couple of months of last year when the sun was shining and people were enjoying perhaps a more flexible environment, there was a sense that this was going to be a short-term process.\n\"I think now people are really missing that opportunity to collaborate with and just see their friends in the office, to get your hair cut, to go and get a good coffee at lunchtime, and to do all the life admin things you can do in a city centre.\"  \nIn the government's roadmap for ending coronavirus restrictions, it recommends that people in England continue to work from home where possible \nIt is hoped, however, that all legal limits on social contact can be removed from 21 June.\nWhile Mr Dawber said Canary Wharf expects occupancy levels to return to where they were before the pandemic, the increase will be gradual and people will still want to work from home on some days.\n\"I think it is going to be more socially acceptable for people to take the occasional day working from home,\" he said. \n\"So it may well be that people have a desk at Canary Wharf but some people will choose to work at home one day a week or a couple of days a month and that's a good thing.\"\nSome companies expect home working to continue once coronavirus restrictions have been lifted.\nLloyds Banking Group is set to reduce its office space by 20% over two years after a staff survey found that nearly 80% wanted to work at home for at least three days a week.\nHowever, others such as investment bank Goldman Sachs have rejected remote working as the \"new normal\", with chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, calling it an \"aberration\".\nLast month, Barclays' chief executive Jes Staley said that working from home was \"not sustainable\". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: \"It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have.\""

The government is aiming to offer all adults a first jab by the end of July.\nMeanwhile, nine out of 10 people aged 65 and over have had their first Covid vaccine dose, according to the NHS in England.\nThe Treasury said the chancellor is also expected to outline improvements to the UK's ability to respond to new Covid variants in his Budget announcement.\nMr Sunak will pledge to put \u00a328m from the Vaccine Taskforce's existing funding into expanding the UK's vaccine testing capability and ability to quickly acquire samples of new coronavirus variants. \nAnd \u00a35m will be used by the Centre for Process Innovation in Darlington to acquire a \"library\" of Covid vaccines to use in its work against different variants.\nIt come as a coronavirus \"variant of concern\" first detected in Brazil has been found in the UK, with three cases detected in England and three in Scotland.\nIn England, officials are still trying to track down one of those who tested positive for the new variant. The first two cases were from the same household in South Gloucestershire, with a history of travel to Brazil, but the third is not linked, Public Health England (PHE) said.\nThere are also concerns vaccines may not be as effective against the Brazilian variant - but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be \"rapidly adapted\".\nThe latest government figures show 20,089,551 people in the UK have now had a first dose, while 796,132 have had a second.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson called it a \"huge national achievement\" and said \"every jab makes a difference in our battle against Covid\".\nThe government met its pledge to offer a jab to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK, including the over-70s and frontline health and care staff, by mid-February.\nFrom Monday, nearly two million people aged 60 to 63 in England will start receiving letters inviting them to book their vaccine.\nThe next target is to offer a first dose to all over-50s by 15 April, as well as people aged 16-64 with certain underlying health conditions and unpaid carers for disabled and elderly people.\nAfter that, people will be prioritised by age group.\nRestrictions in England are set to be fully lifted by 21 June at the earliest, with all pupils set to return to schools from 8 March.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, the chancellor said he \"is preparing a Budget that provides support for people\" as Covid lockdown rules are eased.\nMr Sunak confirmed he would provide help up to then but added that he wanted to \"level with people\" about the \"shock to the economy\" caused by Covid."

Nowadays in particular it's about the build up to the wedding. So 1 March means nothing.\"\n\"We need a roadmap in Wales. The government does not understand that a wedding is not like going out for dinner in a restaurant, there's a huge build up to it, it's an expensive day and couples are entitled to it.\"\nThe Welsh Government acknowledged that \"many couples have made the difficult decision to postpone their wedding because of the ongoing pandemic\"\n\"These are challenging times for everyone, especially those working in the events and hospitality sector, but with everyone's help, better times are ahead of us,\" said a government spokesman."

      "text": "A poll suggests the Welsh public are more likely to believe the Welsh Government has handled the coronavirus outbreak better than UK ministers. \nThe findings are in the annual St David's Day poll for BBC Wales carried out by ICM Unlimited.\nIt suggests that seven in 10 (70%) people in Wales say the Cardiff government has dealt with things very or fairly well.\nTwo in five (41%) say the same about the Westminster government. \nGregor Jackson from ICM says the pattern is similar to research commissioned by BBC Scotland in November which shows stronger approval of the Edinburgh parliament's performance than Westminster's.\nHe added: \"The stronger backing of the Welsh rather than the UK Government's approach is likely to partly explain the drop in support for the Conservative Party, which is also suggested in the poll.\"\nResponding to the poll findings, the Welsh Government said it had been working closely with the health service, councils and business \"as one Team Wales, to help save lives and livelihoods\".\nMeanwhile the UK Government said it had been \"tackling the pandemic as one United Kingdom, working closely with the devolved administrations and following the best scientific advice\".\nThe poll also suggests that a majority of Welsh citizens feel that their income has been unaffected by the coronavirus crisis. \nFifty-five per cent of respondents said there has been neither a positive nor negative impact as a result of the pandemic. \nHowever, there are nearly three times as many people who feel that the pandemic has negatively affected their personal finances compared to those who say the pandemic has positively affected them (32% vs 12%). \nICM says these findings are broadly consistent with UK data from November last year. \nThe poll also indicates that the National Health Service is viewed as the most important area to prioritise once the emergency phase is over.\nThirty-nine per cent of respondents chose the NHS as their top choice. \nAfter the health service, the economy and jobs are seen as the next priority for investment (32%), followed by education and schools (16%).\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said: \"Our focus throughout the pandemic has been to keep Wales safe. \n\"We've introduced an unprecedented series of made-in-Wales measures, working closely with the Welsh NHS, local government, businesses and others, as one Team Wales, to help save lives and livelihoods.\n\"We know the last year has been a huge challenge for so many. We thank the people of Wales for their sacrifices and efforts during periods of lockdown, which have been key in driving down infection rates, and helped save so many lives.\"\nA UK Government spokesperson said: \"From the very start we have been tackling the pandemic as one United Kingdom, working closely with the devolved administrations and following the best scientific advice.\n\"The UK Government acted quickly to deliver one of the most generous and comprehensive economic packages in the world, supporting more than 500,000 jobs in Wales and providing the Welsh Government with more than \u00a36bn for its own pandemic response. \n\"The UK Government has also set up more than 50 testing sites in Wales, supplied additional PPE, set up mass testing when required and provided the support of the UK Armed Forces. It has also procured and distributed hundreds of thousands of vaccines to Wales and the success of the vaccine programme is now bringing the return to normal life within sight.\"\n\"As we recover from the pandemic we will prioritise jobs, growth and investment and continue our work to level up all the nations and regions of the UK.\"\nICM Unlimited interviewed a representative sample of 1,001 people aged 16+ by telephone on Jan 28-Feb 21 2021. Interviews were conducted across Wales and the results have been weighted to the profile of all Welsh adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules"

Let alone 4.7 million of them. \nWith so many dependent on it, and having pledged \"support for people\" it's difficult to see how the chancellor can end furlough while some businesses are still closed.\nBut the scheme is not cheap. And with the country's debt topping \u00a32tn, the same value as the UK economy, the chancellor could start to spell out plans on how he plans to pay at least some of the bill. \nThe UK's low corporation tax looks a likely contender for rises - although businesses that have struggled through the pandemic argue this is hitting them while they're down.\nAsked whether he had privately told Conservative MPs he wanted to raise taxes now so he could cut them ahead of the next general election Mr Sunak replied: \"I don't recognise that.\" \nSpeaking to Sky News he said he \"would like to be able to keep taxes low for people in general\" but added that he wanted to \"be responsible\" with people's money.\nMs Dodds said the chancellor should \"follow what is in the interest of our country\" not \"party politics\".\nSpeaking to Sophy Ridge, she said Labour would \"look carefully\" at proposals on corporation tax but added: \"What we don't want to see right now is what the chancellor is doing, particularly in relation to council tax, the imposition of additional costs at a point when our country is experiencing the worst economic crisis of any major economy.\"\nShe also called on the chancellor to confirm that the furlough scheme and \u00a320 increase to Universal Credit would be kept for as long as Covid-based restrictions were in place. \nDuring his interview, Mr Sunak also defended his Eat Out to Help Out scheme, arguing that it protected jobs, but wouldn't say if he would revive the scheme when hospitality venues were allowed to re-open.\nMr Sunak will lay out the government's tax and spending plans in his Budget on Wednesday, at a time when public borrowing has led to the highest national debt level since 1963.\nConservative former chancellor Lord Clarke has argued Mr Sunak should consider raising VAT, national insurance and income taxes in order to repair the public finances.\nHowever some Conservative MPs - including ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis - have warned against such rises and potential Tory rebels have been told they risk being kicked out of the parliamentary party if they vote against the Budget.\nMartin Beck, senior economic adviser to economic forecasting group EY ITEM Club, said repairing the public finances could wait and warned that \"premature fiscal tightening could undermine recovery\".\nAre you a small or medium business owner?

      "text": "A mother and her daughter died when 11 members of the same family caught Covid-19 after meeting on Christmas Day.\nKashmir Bains, 64, and Paramjeet, 43, of Wolverhampton, fell seriously ill after testing positive for the virus. \nThe daughter died on 5 January, the day after she was taken to hospital, and her mother died four weeks later.\n\"It's been devastating for us as a family,\" said Indy Bains, their son and brother.\nMr Bains said the family considered not meeting at Christmas but decided to because his sister, who has learning disabilities, had been suffering in isolation with her mental health.\nThey gathered on Christmas Day, adhered to the government's three household rule and \"played safe\", only meeting for a few hours. Mr Bains and his family, and his younger sister and her family, met up with his mother, father and older sister.\nDays after Christmas, all 11 tested positive for coronavirus.\nMr Bains said: \"We didn't meet anyone else beforehand, no-one had any symptoms, we still don't know who brought the virus into the family, into the house, but it's happened and it's something we'll have to live with for the rest of our lives.\"\nWhile most had mild symptoms, Mrs Bains and her daughter fell seriously ill.\n\"When the ambulances took them away, we just thought, 'Well they're in the right place, they'll get treatment,' we never thought once that they wouldn't return home,\" Mr Bains said.\nBoth mother and daughter spent time in intensive care at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton.\n\"Because of her [Paramjeet's] learning disability she didn't really understand what was happening to her, and I guess she thought that the mask was just obstructing the air flow rather than helping her and she kept pulling it off.\n\"We spent the last few hours pleading, begging her to keep it on, so that she could get the oxygen that she required... but she just couldn't do it, and kept pulling it off, it was heartbreaking for us to see.\"\nMr Bains has set up a JustGiving page in memory of his sister and mother to raise funds for The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust Charity. It has already raised more than \u00a310,000.\nHe said the treatment his family received by hospital staff was \"humbling\".\n\"I think they [hospital staff] deserve all the respect and gratitude we can give them.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Zoom boss Eric Yuan, whose business exploded during the pandemic, says working from home is here to stay.\nThe video conferencing company expects sales to rise more than 40% this year, reaching more than $3.7bn (\u00a32.66bn).\nThe forecast pushed shares in the company up more than 6% in after-hours trade in New York.\nInvestors have been watching for clues as to how the firm would fare as more people get vaccinated and social distancing restrictions lift.\nZoom said it did not expect growth to continue at the pace it enjoyed last year, but so far business remains strong.\nThe firm's sales in the last three months of 2020 were up 370% compared to the same period in 2019, hitting $882.5m. \n\"The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to an unprecedented year for Zoom,\" company boss Eric Yuan said. \"As the world emerges from the pandemic, our work has only begun.\"\nThe pandemic, which prompted an abrupt shift to remote work for many businesses around the world, transformed Zoom into a household name practically overnight.\nThe firm, which charges businesses for its remote meeting software in addition to more limited free use for the general public, saw sales soar 326% to $2.6bn in 2020. Profits jumped from just $21.7m in 2019 to $671.5m.\nWhile some companies have started to ease staff back into the office, many others have said they expect that some of the increased flexibility introduced during the pandemic will linger.\n\"The future is here with the rise of remote and work from anywhere trends,\" Mr Yuan said in prepared remarks for investors. \"We recognize this new reality and are helping to empower our own employees and those of our customers to work and thrive in a distributed manner.\" \nSusannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Zoom's fate would depend on how it manages to compete against firms such as Microsoft and Google, which have introduced similar features.\n\"Although it stole an early march on other players in the first few months of the crisis, it does now have much stiffer competition from the likes of Microsoft and Google who have significantly upped their game,\" she wrote in a research note.\n\"It may be that we have become so used to pandemic habits that we will stick with our virtual social lives, particularly for long distance friendships and work relationships. But just how large a slice of the live video pie Zoom manages to hang on to will depend on how it matches up to its powerful rivals.\""

      "tags": "Teaching,Schools,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "School staff do not have a markedly higher risk of infection than other working-age adults, a study suggests.\nThe number of staff testing positive for Covid antibodies increased by a similar percentage to their peers while schools were fully open.\nExperts described the findings as \"very reassuring\", and suggested efforts by schools to control infections were working.\nThey said this did not mean teachers were at zero risk, however.\nTesting positive for Covid antibodies indicates someone has had the virus in the past. \nIn December, 15% of teaching and support staff tested positive for antibodies compared to about 18% of people of working age in the same local authorities - giving them about an average risk for their age.\nBut the working-age population includes people not in work and working from home, as well as those going into work.\nIt would be \"naive\" to think teachers going into schools wouldn't have higher risks than those working from home, according to Dr Shamez Ladhani who is leading research for Public Health England.\nHis team, from Public Health England, the Office for National Statistics and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, tested staff and students at a sample of schools for current and past infections. \nAnyone working outside their home is likely to have some elevated risk, the researchers explained. \nHowever, teachers' risk was not substantially higher compared with people working in other settings. \nBetween 25% and 50% of hospital staff had antibodies, according to various studies, while in care homes that at least one Covid outbreak, two-thirds (66%) of staff had antibodies by the end of the first wave.\nIn contrast, the proportion of school staff testing positive for antibodies rose to 15% from about 12% between November and December 2020.\nGiven schools were completely open during this period, \"you would expect much higher antibody conversion if it was a high risk environment,\" Dr Ladhani said. \nHe said the long-term harm of keeping children out of school was \"enormous\".\n\"The benefits outweigh the risks, but the risks are not zero,\" he said.\nIt was not possible to tell from the study whether any infections detected had been caught in school or in the wider community, or whether teachers were catching the virus from pupils or other teachers. \n\"The very fact we've not seen a high antibody rise when at school suggests staff were not being infected [at high rates] during that period\".\nHe said schools had never been in a better position to think about re-opening. \nAnd it was a testament to the infection control efforts of schools and their staff, one of the study's lead authors Prof Sin\u00e9ad Langan added.\n\"Schools and their staff have made a huge effort to protect themselves and their students by implementing Covid-19 control measures to try and stop infection entering the school site, and reduce on-site transmission,\" she said.\nIt was announced last week that no occupation would be prioritised for vaccination - instead people doing different jobs would be offered the jab according to their age or health status.\nThat's because those are the biggest factors driving whether someone will get very ill or even die after being infected. \nA relatively small proportion of Covid deaths have been in the working-age population.\nTwo-thirds of deaths in under-65s were in men and the most common occupations of those who died were in caring, service jobs and \"elementary occupations\" like cleaners, shelf-fillers and hospital porters.

      "tags": "Television,Film,Golden Globes",
      "text": "Hollywood stars will be dressing in their finest slippers and gathering in their living rooms later for the 78th Golden Globe Awards.\nThe ceremony, which recognises excellence in film and television, is being held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt is the first major event of awards season, and often a good indicator of which films will go on to Oscar glory. But it has also attracted controversy.\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of Sunday night's event. \nTina Fey and Amy Poehler, truly the greatest combo since apple slices and Nutella, are returning to hosting duties this year.\nThis will be the fourth time the former Saturday Night Live stars have hosted the Globes, after their spell fronting the ceremony between 2013-2015.\nLet's be clear about this, Fey and Poehler are in the God-tier of Golden Globe hosts. They equal Ricky Gervais in their ability to beautifully and brutally poke fun at every star in the room.\nUnfortunately, their chemistry might be somewhat stilted this year as they won't be in the same room. Poehler will be at The Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles, where the Globes are usually held, while Fey will be at NBC headquarters in New York.\nFurthermore, the absence of a live audience means the gasps and shrieks as Hollywood stars get roasted will also be missing, which will take some of the fun out of the whole thing. But still, we're expecting some killer one-liners.\nThroughout the ceremony, there will be guest award presenters including Renee Zellweger, Cynthia Erivo, Joaquin Phoenix, Laura Dern, Salma Hayek and Jamie Lee Curtis. But the nominees will mostly dial in.\nMank, The Trial of the Chicago 7, The Father, Nomadland and Promising Young Woman are the most nominated films across categories such as acting, directing and writing.\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm, The Prom, Judas and the Black Messiah and The Mauritanian are also recognised in multiple categories.\nChloe Zhao, Regina King and Emerald Fennell are all nominated for best director, meaning there's a good chance of a female winner - which would be the first in the category since Barbra Streisand in 1982.\nNormally, several of the main films haven't hit UK cinemas by the time the Globes take place, but this year many are already on streaming services. Films like Pieces of a Woman, One Night in Miami and I Care A Lot are available to watch on platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime. \nOn the TV side, The Crown, Schitt's Creek, Ozark, The Undoing, The Great and Ratched have the most Globe nominations. There could also be wins for Ted Lasso, Normal People and The Queen's Gambit.\nGet ready to hang your union flag from the ceiling, because we could well see some significant British success on Sunday night.\nIn the TV categories, nominees include John Boyega, Hugh Grant, Matthew Rhys and Jodie Comer, while Olivia Colman and Emma Corrin both have nods for The Crown.\nThe film categories are even more crowded with Brits - Vanessa Kirby, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Carey Mulligan, Sacha Baron Cohen, Rosamund Pike, Riz Ahmed, James Corden, Daniel Kaluuya and Gary Oldman are among the contenders.\nThe Queen's Gambit star Anya Taylor-Joy was born in the US and moved to Argentina as a young child but has lived in the UK since she was six, while Emily in Paris star Lily Collins was born in Surrey but moved to LA as a child. \nNo. Or at least, not legally.\nThe Golden Globes are not broadcast in the UK. Admittedly, the ceremony begins at 01:00 GMT Monday and usually doesn't finish until close to 05:00, so it would take some dedication to watch it live.\nBut it's not even repeated on any UK network at a more reasonable hour, so we generally have to make do with news coverage and a few viral YouTube clips.\nThe Globes are sometimes affectionately referred to as the \"drunk uncle\" of awards season, which isn't an entirely unfair description.\nWhile the Oscars are a prestigious, formal affair, the Globes are where celebrities can let their hair down a bit.\nIn normal years, the Globes take place in the first week of January, so the stars are in a good mood, fresh off their Christmas holidays and ready to have a drink with their friends and co-stars. \nThe early placing in awards season means the stars aren't yet sick to death of promoting and talking about their films. This year's ceremony is only taking place later because of you-know-what.\nThe nominees and winners are voted for by the 87 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), a group of international journalists based in California.\n\"One thing that can't be bought is a Golden Globe... officially,\" joked Ricky Gervais in 2010, referring to long-running allegations of corruption within the HFPA. \nIt has been suggested repeatedly over the years that the HFPA's small and secretive membership pool means the choices of nominees and winners can be swayed by promotions and freebies from production companies. \nThat criticism is back again this year: A scathing expos\u00e9 by the LA Times found that 30 of the 87 members were flown to France to visit the set of Emily In Paris when the first series was being filmed. The newspaper alleges the group were treated to a two-night stay in a five-star hotel, as well as a lunch at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts Forains.\nDespite a lukewarm reception from TV critics, Emily in Paris has multiple nominations this year. Meanwhile, devotees of Michaela Coel's critically acclaimed I May Destroy You were outraged that it was shut out. It is cases like this that have regularly prompted some to suggest the Golden Globes should not be taken seriously. \nA source close to the HFPA told BBC News it is common for journalists to attend set visits, premieres and press conferences, adding that members attend 15-20 trips per year on average. They said the airfare to the Emily In Paris set was paid for by the HFPA and not the studio.\nThe suggestion that such trips have any influence on nominations was \"absurd\", they added, pointing out that set visits to many other TV shows in the last year had not led to nominations. \nThe LA Times also found there are currently no black members of the HFPA, but the organisation has said it is working on an \"action plan\" to rectify this.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The Duke of Sussex has drawn parallels between the treatment of his mother and wife, in teaser clips of a much-anticipated Oprah Winfrey TV special.\nIn two 30-second clips released by CBS, Harry says he feared history was \"repeating itself\" before he and Meghan decided to step back as senior royals.\nWinfrey is seen asking Meghan if there had been a \"breaking point\" and if she was \"silent or silenced\", but the duchess does not speak in either clip.\nThe US interview airs on 7 March.\nIt is unclear when the programme, Oprah With Meghan And Harry: A CBS Primetime Special, will be shown in the UK.\nIn the full programme Meghan will talk about marriage, motherhood, life as a royal and how she is handling \"intense public pressure\", CBS said.\nPrince Harry has previously said he stepped back from royal duties in order to protect himself and his family from the \"toxic\" environment created in the UK by the press.\nHarry's late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, relinquished the Her Royal Highness title at the time of her divorce from the Prince of Wales in August 1996. \nShe died the following year after a car crash in Paris. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes when the accident happened.\nIn the clips from the upcoming TV special, an image of a young Prince Harry with Diana is shown as the duke says: \"I can't begin to imagine what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself all those years ago, because it has been unbelievably tough for the two of us - but at least we had each other.\"\nHarry also tells Winfrey: \"My biggest concern was history repeating itself.\n\"For me, I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you with my wife by my side.\"\nWinfrey is a personal friend of Meghan and attended the couple's wedding in 2018.\nIn the full interview, Meghan and Harry talk about their move to the United States last year and their future plans, according to CBS.\nSpeaking to chat show host James Corden last week, the duke insisted the couple were \"stepping back rather than stepping down\" as senior royals. \nHe said the situation was \"destroying my mental health\" and he \"did what any husband [or] father would do\".\nThese first insights into the much-anticipated Oprah interview are designed to draw us in with their tight editing and dramatic music. \nThey are a flavour of what's to come.\nIn the minute of footage, Meghan doesn't say a word.

      "text": "Nomadland and Borat Subsequent Moviefilm were the big winners at Sunday's Golden Globe Awards.\nThe night's top prize - best drama film - went to Nomadland, which stars Frances McDormand as a homeless woman travelling through the American West.\nChlo\u00e9 Zhao was named best director - becoming only the second female winner of the category in Globes history, after Barbra Streisand in 1983.\n\"Thank you everyone who made it possible to do what I love,\" Zhao said.\n\"I fell in love with making movies and telling stories because it gave us a chance to laugh and cry together, to learn from each other, and to have more compassion for each other.\"\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm, the sequel to 2006's hugely successful Borat, was named best musical or comedy film. \n\"Thank you to the all-white Hollywood Foreign Press,\" said Sacha Baron Cohen as he accepted the prize, referring to the recent revelation that the organisation behind the Globes currently has no black members. \nCohen poked further fun at the awards body as he was named best actor in a comedy or musical for the same film.\n\"Wait, Donald Trump is contesting the result. He's claiming that a lot of dead people voted, which is a very rude thing to say about the HFPA,\" he joked.\nBorat and Nomadland were among several films to pick up two awards each. Of the night's 14 acting winners, half were British, including Cohen; Rosamund Pike, who was named best actress in a musical or comedy film for I Care A Lot; and Daniel Kaluuya, who won best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah. \nKaluuya plays US activist Fred Hampton, the chairman of the Black Panther Party, who was assassinated in 1969 at the age of 21.\n\"I hope generations after this can see how brilliantly he fought, he spoke, and he loved,\" Kaluuya said as he accepted his prize. \n\"He taught me about myself, made me grow as a man, and I appreciate that with all my heart.\"\n *Taylor-Joy holds triple British, American and Argentine citizenship and has lived in the UK since the age of six.\nJohn Boyega was named best supporting actor in a limited series for his portrayal of pioneering black British police officer Leroy Logan in an instalment of Small Axe, Steve McQueen's landmark series of BBC films.\n\"I'm so shocked. I've got trackie bottoms on and I'm comfortable but this is exciting,\" Boyega joked as he accepted the award from home.\nLogan shared a video on Instagram of himself reacting to the announcement and raising a celebratory glass. \"You're portrayal of me has been life changing,\" he told Boyega in the accompanying post. \"I'm also very proud of you & your name check on accepting the \u2066\u202aGolden Globes\u202c\u2069 is so humbling.\"\nThe Crown was the big winner in the television categories, winning four prizes in total, including best drama series.\nJosh O'Connor and Emma Corrin both won acting honours for their performances as Prince Charles and Princess Diana respectively.\nAs she accepted her prize, Corrin said: \"Most of all, thank you so much to Diana, you have taught me compassion and empathy beyond any measure I could ever imagine.\"\nO'Connor said: \"I'm very lucky to be able to work in this period, and there are so many people who are unable to work, who are alone and isolated, and I hope we can all collectively put mental health at the forefront our minds.\"\nGillian Anderson was named best supporting actress for her portrayal of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in the series.\nThe Queen's Gambit won best limited series, while its star Anya Taylor-Joy, who has lived in the UK since she was six, was named best actress in a limited series.\nSchitt's Creek was named best comedy series, and one of its stars, Catherine O'Hara, was named best TV comedy actress.\nElsewhere, Chadwick Boseman was posthumously named best actor in a drama film for his performance in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.\nHis wife, Taylor Simone Ledward, accepted the award on his behalf, after the Black Panther star's death last summer from colon cancer at the age of 43.\nIn one of the ceremony's surprises, The United States vs Billie Holiday star Andra Day was named best actress in a drama film for her portrayal of the jazz singer.\nAaron Sorkin paid tribute to the three women who were nominated for best director as he accepted best screenplay for The Trial of the Chicago 7.\n\"You are the reason my college-age daughter wants to be a film-maker, and I'm never going to forgive you for that,\" he joked.\nSpeaking before the ceremony, Regina King, who was nominated for her directorial debut One Night in Miami, said: \"This was another year of powerful work from women with strong voices, so it feels good, and I hope this is the beginning of a true shift.\"\nOther winners included Mark Ruffalo for best actor in a limited series, and Pixar's Soul, which won best animated film.\nThe ceremony, which recognises excellence in film and television, was held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nWhile nominees dialled in from home, the live audience was made up of frontline workers and first responders of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe Golden Globes are the first major event of awards season, and often a good indicator of which films will go on to Oscar glory.\nFormer Saturday Night Live stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler returned to hosting duties this year, but they were in New York and Los Angeles respectively, marking the first time the Golden Globes have been bicoastal.\nThe nominees and winners were voted for by the 87 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), a group of international journalists based in California.\nAfter a recent investigation by the LA Times found the HFPA had no black members, representatives from the organisation said during the ceremony they planned to address the issue.\n\"Tonight, while we celebrate the work of artists from around the globe, we recognise we have our own work to do,\" said Helen Hoehne, vice president of the HFPA.\n\"Just like in film and television, black representation is vital. We must have black journalists in our organisation.\"\nBut in separate letters to the HFPA and the Globes' network sponsor NBC issued after the ceremony's conclusion, Time's Up president and CEO Tina Chen criticised the response as \"cosmetic\". \n\"Change only occurs from an awareness of larger cultural problems, as well as a long-term commitment to systemic change\", she wrote.\nChen also called on NBC to take action and meet their public commitment to reform.\n\"As leaders of NBCUniversal television\", her letter read, \"your power as stakeholders makes you an effective force of change.\"\nVeteran actress and activist Jane Fonda received the Cecil B DeMille Award for lifetime achievement and used her acceptance speech to mirror Chen's sentiments - calling for greater diversity in the industry.\nThe 83-year-old spoke of the importance of storytelling, saying powerful stories can \"change our hearts and our minds\".\nShe said: \"Let's all of us make an effort to expand that tent so that everyone rises and everyone's story has a chance to be seen and heard.

      "title": "CPAC: Trump rules out new political party in speech to conservatives",
      "tags": "Donald Trump Jr,Florida,Ted Cruz,Donald Trump,Orlando",
      "text": "Donald Trump says he has no plans to launch a new political party, telling a conservative conference in Florida that it would split the Republican vote.\nIn his first speech since Democrat Joe Biden became president, he also hinted that he might run for office again in 2024.\nMr Trump strongly criticised his successor, saying US policy had gone from \"America first to America last\".\nThe speech comes weeks after Mr Trump was acquitted in an impeachment trial.\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) is the country's largest meeting of conservative activists and politicians, and usually gives insight into the direction of the Republican Party.\nMr Trump's appearance at the meeting on Sunday suggests he has continued influence over the party despite some senior politicians distancing themselves recently from the ex-president.\nThe mood of the conference in Orlando - which began on Thursday - has been extremely pro-Trump, with loyalists including Texas Senator Ted Cruz and his son Donald Trump Jr among the speakers.\nThe former president remains banned from social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, over his response to January's deadly riot at the US Capitol.\nHe has been living at his Mar-a-Lago Florida golf resort since leaving the White House in January.\nThe 74-year-old former president was cheered by supporters when he appeared on stage at the Hyatt Regency Hotel more than an hour late. Many people in the crowd were not wearing masks.\n\"I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we began together four years ago is far from over,\" he said.\n\"We are gathered this afternoon to talk about the future - the future of our movement, the future of our party, and the future of our beloved country.\"\nHe dismissed any idea that he might start a new political party - describing rumours he would do so as \"fake news\".\n\"Wouldn't that be brilliant? Let's start a new party so we can divide our vote and never win,\" he joked.\n\"We have the Republican Party. It's going to unite and be stronger than ever before.\"\nDespite losing November's presidential election and being deeply criticised over the January riot, reports suggest Mr Trump remains extremely popular among his voting base.\nLast week one US poll suggested 46% of surveyed Trump voters would vote for him if he left the Republicans and started his own party.\nIn his CPAC speech, Mr Trump repeated his false claims that he lost November's election to the Democrats because of electoral fraud and he hinted at another run in 2024, saying: \"Actually you know they just lost the White House. But who knows - who knows? I may even decide to beat them for a third time, OK?\"\nHe excoriated the new administration, criticising Mr Biden for reversing his hard line on immigration and border security. \n\"We all knew that the Biden administration was going to be bad but none of us even imagined how just how bad they would be and how far left they would go,\" he told the cheering crowd.\nDonald Trump is back. After a month out of the public eye, the former president picked CPAC's friendly confines to launch his bid for political revival.\nJudging from the crowd here, not much reviving - at least among conservative activists - will be necessary. Their support for Trump - through electoral defeat, through the January mob attack on the US Capitol, through all of it - never flagged.\nSo when Trump made his bid for continued leadership of the party - as a king-maker and, perhaps, its standard-bearer in 2024 - the crowd gave its full-throated approval. \nFor the ex-president's potential successors in the party, however, there was a glimmer of opportunity on Sunday. Trump's speech was lacklustre by his standards. His self-imposed exile may have taken a toll - leaving him grasping for lines that work in the Joe Biden era. And while approval of Trump's policies was sky-high in a straw poll of CPAC attendees, only just over half said they would vote for him if he ran in 2024. It's a daunting advantage, but perhaps not prohibitive.\nTrump's continued influence within the party seems secure, but translating that influence into another presidential nomination - if he wants it - is no sure thing. He'll have to earn it. \nRepublican lawmakers remained largely loyal to Mr Trump during his time in office but 10 voted to impeach him in the House of Representatives last month and seven voted to convict him in the subsequent Senate trial. The overall tally, 57-43 in favour of his guilt, fell short of the two-thirds margin needed to convict him.\nSenator Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in Congress, criticised the former president's actions after his acquittal - declaring Mr Trump \"practically and morally responsible\" for provoking the riot, despite personally voting against his guilt on the incitement charge.\nMr Trump then broke his relative silence to launch a scathing personal attack on Mr McConnell whom he described as \"a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack\".\nThe schism in the party has remained since, with those who have broken rank against him notably absent from the CPAC stage.\nRepublican Senator Bill Cassidy told CNN that the event was unrepresentative of the party. \n\"If we idolise one person, we will lose,\" he said shortly before Mr Trump's speech. \"That's kind of clear from the last election.\" \nBut Trump loyalists were quick to praise the former president following his remarks. His son Donald Trump Jr branded the event \"T-PAC\", while the gathered crowd chanted Mr Trump's name."

      "text": "Bank of Ireland has announced it will close 15 branches in Northern Ireland, which is more than half of its 28 branches currently operating in NI.\nIt is part of a wider cost-cutting exercise that includes the closure of 88 banks in the Republic of Ireland, where 169 banks will remain open.\nThe Dublin-based bank operates across the Republic and the UK. It is one of NI's \"big four\" banks.\nThe bank's UK head office will also relocate from London to Belfast.\nThe bank has been reviewing its Northern Ireland operations and there had been speculation that it could withdraw from the market.\nThat has not happened, but Chief Executive Francesca McDonagh said the Northern Ireland business will undergo \"a material restructure\".\nThe branch closures will affect the roles of about 120 staff in Northern Ireland but will not result in compulsory redundancies, according to Ian McLaughlin, Chief Executive of Bank of Ireland UK.\nThe branches earmarked for closure are:\nThe bank would work to identify staff who could be redeployed to other roles within the company, as an alternative to redundancy, said Mr McLaughlin.\nBranch closures will not start for 12 weeks and customers will be contacted individually about the changes, he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \nAside from closing 15 branches, the restructuring of its Northern Ireland business will include simplifying its range of products with a greater focus on car finance and mortgages.\nThe bank will also continue with its strategy of withdrawing from less profitable lending across the UK.\nIt said this would mean its UK loan book shrinking by about 10% during 2021.\nThe bank's UK division made a loss of \u00a315m in 2020, compared to a profit of \u00a3152m in 2019.\nThe loss was due to impairment charges - money which must be set aside to cover loans which may not be repaid in full.\nAll banks have seen increased impairment charges due to the economic impact of the pandemic.\nThe bank as a whole showed an annual loss of \u20ac760m (\u00a3657m), again due to impairment charges.\n\"We've announced some rather eye-watering numbers this morning, like most banks,\" Mr McLaughlin told Good Morning Ulster.\n\"It's been a really tough time and anyone who tells you differently isn't really paying attention, but we've got a really solid business here,\" he insisted. \nMr McLaughlin added that the relocation of the bank's UK office to Belfast was \"really good news and a sign of our commitment to Northern Ireland\".\nHe said the branch closures were in response to changes in customer behaviour over the last four years.\nHe argued that as the popularity of digital services like online shopping had increased, banks could not be \"insulated\" from the switch to digital.\n\"Our customers are using our branches less and less and we've reached a bit of a tipping point,\" Mr McLaughlin said. \n\"Our cash usage and customer visits in the closing branches is down 70% since 2017 and commensurately our digital banking up 50% over the same period so we need to adapt and we need to change.\"\nRetail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the number of closures \"seems a step too far\".\nAcknowledging \"the significant increase in online banking\", Mr Roberts said Monday's news will have a \"negative impact\" on high streets across Northern Ireland when the lockdown ends.\n\"I have also particular concerns of the impact on rural communities, with further reduced ATM provision and the ability to access cash,\" he added.\nThe Consumer Council has said the closures risk isolating consumers by removing access to essential services.\nFinancial Services Director Scott Kennerley said many consumers and small businesses still rely on face-to-face banking.\n\"We know that some consumers in Northern Ireland still prefer to use cash so the decision by Bank of Ireland to close half of its branch network will have a negative impact on consumers and their access to cash services,\" he said.\n\"We will continue to engage with Bank of Ireland to understand how it is supporting consumers affected by this decision.\"\nBank of Ireland had already closed several branches over the last decade. \nIn 2011, it had 44 branches in Northern Ireland. \nIn August last year, the bank said it was aiming to cut 1,400 jobs from its UK and Ireland operations. \nLast week, Ulster Bank confirmed it would close its Republic of Ireland business over the next few years."

      "text": "Abusers who use non-fatal strangulation will face up to five years in jail under a new law planned by the government.\nCampaigners have been calling for the change, arguing that perpetrators are often only charged with common assault, meaning up to six months in jail.\nThe government had initially said it had no plans to change the law.\nBut now, ministers plan to make non-fatal strangulation a specific criminal offence in the Domestic Abuse Bill.\nThe Domestic Abuse Bill - which largely applies to only England and Wales - is currently being considered by the House of Lords.\nUntil now, politicians and campaigners have so far tried and failed to have a new offence of non-fatal strangulation introduced in the bill.\nCampaigners say it is a terrifying crime and is used by domestic abusers to control their partners.\nAnd because it may not leave any marks on the victim, prosecutors do not bring more serious charges, they say.\nNow, the government plans to make it a specific offence to intentionally strangle another person or do any other act that affects their ability to breathe. It will also cover suffocation.\nThe legislation will be introduced as an amendment to the bill, the government said on Monday.\nFor the five years they were together, Jenny's abusive partner used non-fatal strangulation as a means of control. \n\"It was like his favourite thing to do,\" said Jenny, who asked the BBC not to use her real name. \n\"That sounds really awful and trivial but that is how it becomes as an abuse victim. You learn to accept that is part of your life. It was like something I had to manage.\"\n\"We would wake up in the morning and he would be in one of those moods, and I would see it in his eyes and I would think today's the day I'm going to get it.\n\"It could be something as simple as: 'I don't like what you have got on' - that would end in strangulation.\"\nDespite the pandemic, Jenny says that having finally escaped her abuser: \"2020 was one of the best years of my life.\"\nLegislation will also be strengthened around controlling or coercive behaviour to no longer make it a requirement for abusers and victims to live together.\nLaws to target so-called \"revenge porn\" will also be expanded to include threats to disclose intimate images with the intention to cause distress.\nThe domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, Nicole Jacobs, called the changes a \"huge win\".\n\"I am delighted that the government has listened and acted,\" she said.\n\"Nevertheless, the government must still go further to make this bill genuinely 'landmark', by increasing the provision of services in the community and ensuring protections are extended to all victims and survivors, regardless of their immigration status.\"\nThe government previously said it had no plans to change the law, arguing that non-fatal strangulation is already covered by existing legislation such as common assault and attempted murder.\nBut peers in the House of Lords - led by Conservative Baroness Newlove - argued it should be included as an amendment in the current Domestic Abuse Bill.\nThe government then changed tack, with Justice Secretary Robert Buckland saying he hoped to make it a specific offence and too many violent offenders were not getting tough enough sentences."

      "text": "The NHS's \"insufficient\" critical care capacity has been laid bare by the pandemic, with the UK having one of the lowest number of beds per head in Europe, NHS Providers has said.\nThe group, which represents trusts in England, is calling for a review of the health service's capacity.\nThe UK has 7.3 critical care beds per 100,000 people, compared to Germany's 33.8 and the US's 34.3, analysis found.\nThe government said it was investing \u00a372bn in the next two years in the NHS.\nThe east of England, South West and South East are areas of key concern.\n\"The UK is towards the bottom of the European League table for critical care beds per head of population,\" NHS Providers said.\nThe group added that the UK had comparatively fewer critical care beds than France, Italy, Australia and Spain.\n\"It's neither safe nor sensible to rely on NHS hospital trusts being able to double or triple their capacity at the drop of a hat as they've had to over the last two months, with all the disruption to other care and impossible burdens on staff that involves.\"\nSeeking a review into critical care capacity in England, the organisation said it wanted the government to commit to providing additional finances in areas where it was needed.\n\"There have been too many reviews of NHS capacity in the past where huge amounts of time have been wasted because the government has not been willing to fund the results of what's been found,\" the group said.\nWhen reviews and a public inquiry at some stage look at lessons to be learned from the handling of the pandemic in the UK, the question of the readiness of the NHS is sure to be considered. \nNHS Providers has highlighted one key part of this - the relative lack of critical care beds in hospitals, reflecting in part insufficient investment going back many years. \nThe UK has fewer hospital beds for seriously ill patients relative to the population than leading European economies such as France, Germany, Italy and Spain. \nSo going into the pandemic the health service was in some ways not as well resourced as it might have been. \nThe NHS coped astonishingly well last April and in the most recent surge, and hospitals were not overwhelmed.\nBut sufficient critical care beds were created for Covid patients only by using wards which could not therefore be used by others - much routine and non urgent care had to be postponed.\nThe argument now being made is that there needs to be a review of what is needed as a safety net for future crises - and funding to go with it.\nA  Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"The government is determined to back the NHS in every possible way in its fight against this virus, investing \u00a352bn this year and \u00a320bn next. \n\"This is on top of \u00a39.4bn capital funding to build and upgrade 40 new hospitals and \u00a33bn earmarked for supporting recovery and reducing the NHS waiting list.\"\nThey added that the government was on track to deliver 50,000 more nurses by the end of this parliament."

      "tags": "Schools,Exams",
      "text": "Poorer students in England are up to three A-level grades behind more affluent students, research suggests.\nThe Education Policy Institute (EPI) said lower GCSE grades, then fewer and lower level qualifications aged 16-19, causes a \"disadvantage gap\".\nIt found in some areas, poorer students were up to five grades behind.\nThe Department for Education says it provided over \u00a3530m in 2020-21 to support college students.\nStudents from poorer families begin their A-level or vocational courses already behind more affluent students, and continue to fall further behind, according to analysis by the EPI.\nIn the first ever study to measure the education \"disadvantage gap\" among students aged 16-19, provisional findings show that across all qualifications, poorer students are the equivalent of three A-level grades behind similar students from richer families.\nBut there were variations across England, with poorer students the equivalent of around five A-level grades behind in areas including Knowsley on Merseyside, North Somerset  and Stockton-on-Tees. \nIn sharp contrast in many London areas, poorer students are level with or even slightly ahead of their more affluent peers.\nThe EPI looked at students' free school meal status during their last six years of school and their attainment, based on qualifications and grades between the end of secondary school and by the age of 19.\nIt finds the gap is bigger in A-levels than vocational qualifications. \nThe researchers say there was no progress in closing the gap between 2017 to 2019, and suggest it is likely to get worse due the impact of the pandemic which has effected poorer communities more severely.\nSam Tuckett, senior researcher at the EPI, said: \"For the very first time, this exploratory research gives us a clear understanding of how disadvantaged sixth form and college students are progressing with their learning compared to their peers.\n\"Our findings demonstrate very plainly that deep-seated inequalities follow poorer teenagers from school through to sixth form and college, and continue to widen further compared to otherwise similar students, as they work towards their qualifications.\" \nThe big gaps in grades is largely explained by poorer students already having lower grades at the end of their GCSEs, the researchers say.\nDisadvantaged students are also more likely to take fewer and lower-level qualifications which adds to the gap in results.\nThere is a \"strong case\" for extra funding for 16-19 education to stop poor pupils falling further behind, the report suggests. \nAnd targeted support is urgently needed to address learning losses caused by the pandemic, which is likely to impact the poorest students the most. \nDavid Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, called for the pupil premium which gives extra money to schools to help poorer pupils, to be extended beyond the age of 16.\n\"Young people in England's school sixth forms and colleges have lower hours of teaching, less support and less enrichment than their peers in other countries, and less than those in private schools. That needs to change.\nBill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said the report provides a welcome perspective on the \"chronic underfunding\" of sixth form education.\n\"There is now a broad consensus that young people need additional support to recover from the disruption to their education caused by Covid, but as this report illustrates, sixth forms and colleges have been helping students to recover from a range of disadvantages for many years.\"\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \"We are determined to ensure disadvantaged students are properly supported while studying at college or sixth form so they can gain the skills they need to progress. \n\"This includes providing extra funding for disadvantaged 16 to 19-year-old students, specifically those with low prior attainment or who live in the most disadvantaged areas.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "Stormont ministers have met to discuss Northern Ireland's recovery plan from lockdown but it is now unlikely to be published until Tuesday.\nMinisters had initially hoped to publish the plan on Monday but work to finalise details is ongoing.\nIt is understood the blueprint will focus on nine areas across social and business settings.\nEach section will have five steps out of lockdown, guided by data.\nThat includes the infection rate of the virus, known as the R number, hospitalisations, vaccine rollout and progress in testing and tracing positive cases.\nThe delay comes as two more coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health.\nA further 138 cases of the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours.\nThe department's daily dashboard shows there are 302 Covid-19 inpatients across Northern Ireland's hospitals.\nThirty-four patients remain in intensive care and 29 coronavirus patients are on ventilators.\nExecutive ministers are due to meet on Tuesday morning with hopes of signing off the pathway-to-recovery document.\nThey will also discuss last week's decision by Agriculture Minister Gordon Lyons to halt work on post-Brexit border control posts, amid a row over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe issue was raised during Monday's executive meeting with some ministers expressing concern that Mr Lyons had taken the decision without consulting other parties.\nSpeaking later in the assembly, Mr Lyons defended his actions as \"entirely sensible and appropriate\".\nThe border control posts are based at ports and are used to check food products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nMr Lyons, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician, said he was responding to \"practical difficulties\" but the move sparked a sharp reaction from Sinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.\nOn Monday afternoon, DUP MP Sammy Wilson defended Mr Lyons' decision on border control posts and told BBC's Talkback programme the DUP would \"fight the protocol with every means we have\".\nIt is believed the Covid-19 lockdown exit plan includes nine \"pathways\" to take account of various parts of the Northern Ireland economy.\nThe plan is not expected to include indicative dates but will set out criteria that must be met before restrictions can be eased.\nNorthern Ireland's lockdown has been extended until 1 April, with a review due on 18 March.\nIn England and Scotland, lockdown exit plans that include target dates for easing restrictions have been published but the respective governments have said the lifting of the rules will only happen if certain conditions are met.\nIn Northern Ireland, children in pre-schools and pupils in primaries one to three will be the first return to class next Monday 8 March.\nThey will be followed by pupils in years 12 to 14 on 22 March.\nPupils in other years do not yet know when they will return to school.\nMeanwhile, some restrictions around visiting care homes and hospitals in Northern Ireland are being eased.\nThe new rules allowing at least one face-to-face visit per week by one person. Daily one-hour visits will be permitted in hospices and women attending maternity services will be able to have someone with them. \nCare homes that do not have an outbreak will also be allowed to facilitate a variety of visiting arrangements, including indoors where possible.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, lockdown restrictions have been extended until 5 April but some pupils are already returning to school.\nOn Monday, the Republic recorded one more coronavirus-linked death which happened in January.\nIt brings the country's death toll to 4,319. A further 687 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed. "

      "tags": "France,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The French government says older people with pre-existing conditions can now get AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, revising its stance on the issue.\n\"People affected by co-morbidities can be vaccinated with AstraZeneca, including those aged between 65 and 74,\" the health minister said.\nLast month France approved use of the vaccine for under-65s only, citing lack of data for older people.\nSince then studies have shown the jab is highly effective among the elderly.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is widely used across the UK, but several EU countries are still limiting it to the under-65s, including Germany. \nThe EU drugs regulator has approved it for all adults, but it is up to each member to set its own roll-out policy.\nIn a further development, Canada's immunisation commission on Monday advised against giving the AstraZeneca vaccine to over-65s, saying clinical trial data for that age group was too limited. \nSpeaking on television, French Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said people with pre-existing conditions - such as high blood pressure or diabetes - could get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from GP surgeries, hospitals and \"within days\" from pharmacies.\nThe policy would apply to those over 50, including those aged 65 to 75, he said.  \nThose aged over 75 will still be offered either Pfizer or Moderna jabs in a vaccination centre, he added.\nIn January French President Emmanuel Macron said the AstraZeneca vaccine was \"quasi-ineffective\" for older age groups - a claim strongly rejected at the time by the UK officials and scientists.\nBut after a European Council meeting on Friday, he said: \"If this is the vaccine I'm offered, obviously I would take it.\" \nAs more data has emerged, French health officials have tried to convince people that it is just as safe and effective as other Covid-19 vaccines. \nJust 273,000 AstraZeneca doses have been administered in France out of 1.7 million received by the end of February, health ministry figures show.\nSome French doctors had spurned the vaccine, citing initial side-effects in some people and trial data suggesting it offered minimal protection against mild disease from the South African Covid variant, though the developer said it still protects against severe disease.  \nThe MG France doctors' association has since hit back at criticism of the AstraZeneca jab and the fact that many doses remain unused. The man in charge of France's vaccine rollout has also backed it, saying it has unfairly received a \"bad press\". \nAbout three million people have so far received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in France - against more than 20 million in the UK, which has roughly the same population.\nIt is hard not to believe that there was some element of post-Brexit ill will motivating the initial French scepticism towards the AstraZeneca jab.\nBut it was noticeable how the remarks made by Mr Macron and Europe Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune that casted doubt on the vaccine's effectiveness never found a receptive audience in the French medical profession.\nThat profession - which had no political axe to grind - said early on that the jab was a welcome addition to the mix. But the politicians set the tone. They must surely take some of the blame for the slow uptake of the vaccine since its launch in France last month.\nAstraZeneca has come to be seen by too many people here as an inferior vaccination. The French government, however, now seems bent on changing that perception and accelerating take-up.\nFrance is still struggling to control increased infection rates in some areas, despite a continuing national night-time curfew. \nBars, restaurants and museums remain closed but the government wants to avoid another national lockdown, resorting instead to tighter measures in some localities such as the southern city of Nice.\nTravel to Germany from the French Moselle region has been restricted at the request of Germany which is concerned about the South African variant. Cross-border public transport is suspended, while drivers can cross but only with proof of a negative coronavirus test. \nGermany is also concerned that AstraZeneca jabs are going to waste and there are calls to widen the number of priority groups who can receive it. Only 240,000 of 1.45 million doses had been used by 23 February. \nOn Sunday, a senior German immunologist, Carsten Watzl, urged his country to change its mind and start allowing over-65s to receive the vaccine.\nGermany's vaccine commission is currently reviewing its recommendation and Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week that it was \"a vaccine that can be trusted\". \nVaccine roll-outs in many EU countries have been hit by delays. \nBritain has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme since December.\nUK health officials say it provides \"high levels of protection\" for all ages. \nNo one who received the Oxford vaccine in trials was admitted to hospital or became seriously ill due to Covid.\nThe vaccine is given via two injections to the arm, the second between 4 and 12 weeks after the first."

When the sun comes out, we want to be out and about,\" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\"Community rates have come right down, but we've been here before. \n\"We had very low rates last summer, and we've seen how quickly it has taken off. There is still a risk that the virus could come back.\"\nAs weather improved over the weekend, car parks were closed across several beaches in Swansea at the request of police. \nCarrie Townsend Jones, a community councillor from Mumbles warned people not to travel from far away to visit the area. \nShe said: \"I do understand it's very difficult for people, particularly if they don't have outdoor space, you know they're looking out and the weather's lovely and of course they're desperate to get out, but there are lots of other places where people can walk that are local to where they live.\""

      "tags": "France,Libya",
      "text": "French ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy has been sentenced to three years in jail, two of them suspended, for corruption.\nHe was convicted of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 - after he had left office - by suggesting he could secure a prestigious job for him in return for information about a separate case.\nSarkozy, 66, is the first former French president to get a custodial sentence.\nHis lawyer says he will appeal. Sarkozy will remain free during that process which could take years.\nIn the ruling, Judge Christine M\u00e9e said the conservative politician \"knew what [he] was doing was wrong\", adding that his actions and those of his lawyer had given the public \"a very bad image of justice\".\nThe crimes were specified as influence-peddling and violation of professional secrecy.\nIt is a legal landmark for post-war France. The only precedent was the trial of Sarkozy's predecessor Jacques Chirac, who got a two-year suspended sentence in 2011 for having arranged bogus jobs at Paris City Hall for allies when he was Paris mayor. Chirac died in 2019.\nIf Sarkozy's appeal is unsuccessful, he could serve a year at home with an electronic tag, rather than go to prison.\nHis wife, supermodel and singer Carla Bruni, reacted by describing the case as \"senseless persecution\", adding that \"the fight continued, and truth would come out\".\nNicolas Sarkozy served one five-year term as president from 2007. He adopted tough anti-immigration policies and sought to reform France's economy during a presidency overshadowed by the global financial crisis.\nCritics nicknamed him \"bling-bling\", seeing his leadership style as too brash, celebrity-driven and hyperactive for a role steeped in tradition and grandeur.\nHis celebrity image was reinforced by his marriage to Bruni in 2008. In 2012 he lost his re-election bid to Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\nSince then he has been targeted by several criminal investigations.\nIn 2017 he tried to make a political comeback, but failed as his centre-right Les R\u00e9publicains party chose another presidential candidate instead.\nSarkozy was on trial with two co-defendants, his lawyer Thierry Herzog and Gilbert Azibert, a senior judge.\nThe case centred on phone conversations between Sarkozy and Herzog that were taped by police in 2014.\nInvestigators were looking into claims that Sarkozy had accepted illicit payments from the L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign.\nThe prosecution convinced the court that Sarkozy and Herzog had sought to bribe Azibert with a prestigious job in Monaco in return for information about that investigation.\nFrench media reported that Sarkozy was heard telling Herzog: \"I'll get him promoted, I'll help him.\"\nThe phone line police tapped was a secret number set up in a fictional name, Paul Bismuth, through which Sarkozy communicated with his lawyer.\nOn Monday Herzog and Azibert were also sentenced to three years in jail, two of them suspended.\nNicolas Sarkozy is no stranger to legal investigations - since he left the presidency he has been the object of half a dozen - but up until now his record sheet has been clean. There was plenty of mud, but none of it stuck.\nHalf an hour in a courtroom in Paris's new Palais de Justice changed all that. Judge M\u00e9e read out a verdict that spared nothing, and no-one. Sarkozy, Thierry Herzog and Gilbert Azibert all knew perfectly well what they were doing, she said.\nThey were trading confidential information for professional favours. And that was corruption in any book.\nIt is not the end of the affair, by any stretch. The appeal could take years. His team will continue to argue that the case rested on ill-gotten evidence - chance eavesdroppings on confidential phone-chats between a man and his lawyer.\nBut from today Sarkozy cuts a different figure. Before he was the wronged ex-president, fighting back against a left-wing judicial cabal. Now he has been convicted in a court of law.\nHe is due to go on trial next month over the so-called Bygmalion affair, in which he is accused of having overspent in his unsuccessful 2012 campaign.\nProsecutors are also investigating claims that Sarkozy received funding for his 2007 campaign from Libya's then-leader Muammar Gaddafi.\nSarkozy has already been cleared in connection with the Bettencourt case. He had said all investigations against him were politically motivated. \nDespite his legal woes he has remained popular in right-wing circles, a year away from another presidential election."

      "text": "A coronavirus \"variant of concern\" first detected in Brazil has now been found in the UK.\nThree cases have been detected in England and separately three in Scotland.\nIn England, officials are still trying to track down one of those who tested positive for the new variant.\nThe three Scottish residents had flown to north-east Scotland from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said.\nExperts believe this variant (P1) - first detected in travellers to Japan from Manaus in northern Brazil in January - could be more contagious. \nThere are also concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it - but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be \"rapidly adapted\".\nDr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England (PHE), said the UK was more advanced than many other countries in identifying the variants and mutations and therefore able to act quickly.\nIn England, the first two cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force.\nTwo other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant, so they are not included in the overall UK total of six.\nPHE said officials are now tracking down passengers who were on the same flight from Sao Paulo to Heathrow, via Zurich.\nThe third case identified in England is not linked to the other two cases and the whereabouts of that person are still not known.\nPHE said the person did not complete their test registration card so follow-up details are unavailable.\nOfficials are asking anyone who took a test on 12 or 13 February and who has not received a result or has an uncompleted test registration card to come forward immediately by calling 119.\nMeanwhile, testing is being ramped up in South Gloucestershire - on the outskirts of Bristol - with people living in five postcode areas invited to get tested even if they do not have symptoms. The postcodes fall within Bradley Stoke, Patchway and Little Stoke.\nRegarding the cases in Scotland, the government said the three people had tested positive while self-isolating.\nOther passengers who were on the same flight from London to Aberdeen are now being contacted. \nThe Brazil variant is something officials are worried about because it shares similar mutations to the South Africa variant of concern. \nBoth have undergone genetic changes that could make them more contagious and perhaps less easy to stop with our current vaccines. \nThe coronavirus jabs being given to people now were designed around earlier versions of the pandemic virus, not these new variants. \nScientists believe they should still protect, although perhaps not quite as well.\nWork is already under way to redesign or tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new \"variants of concern\". \nThese updated vaccines could be ready within months, meaning the UK would have millions of doses ready to give people a booster shot before next winter to make sure the population is protected. \nThere will be more cases out there of new variants that have not yet been identified. \nWhile it may not be possible to eliminate them, the determination is there to slow the spread of coronavirus, including new variants. Sticking to the social distancing rules will help.\nBoth PHE and the Scottish government said the variant had been designated \"of concern\" as it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa (known as B.1.351). \nOne of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies. It is also possible that this variant may respond less well to current vaccines, but more work is needed to understand this.\nIn January, a coronavirus variant from Brazil was found in the UK - but it was not this variant of concern.\nPHE said the \"risk to the wider community is considered low\" but as a precaution extra community testing is be rolled out in some postcodes north of Bristol.\nIt urged people to keep following the coronavirus measures. \nMeanwhile, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the news of the variant was \"deeply concerning\".\n\"It is now vital that we do everything we can to contain it,\" he said.\n\"But this is further proof that the delay in introducing a hotel quarantine was reckless and the continuing refusal to put in place a comprehensive system leaves us exposed to mutations coming from overseas.\"\nThe hotel quarantine rule came into force on 15 February. It means that travellers coming to England from 33 countries - including Brazil - must pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while in Scotland the rule applies to travellers from all countries.\nBefore that date, travellers arriving in the UK still needed to self-isolate in their homes for 10 days.\nAll travellers to the UK also need to present a negative Covid test taken a maximum of 72 hours before their departure. \nHome Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said on Twitter it was \"notable\" that the pre-flight tests first brought in by the government in January did not catch six cases.\nIt comes as the UK announced another 6,035 cases of coronavirus and reported that a further 144 people had died within 28 days of a positive test.\nBut a milestone in the vaccination programme was reached, with more than 20 million people having received their first dose of the vaccine."

      "text": "Stormont ministers have met to discuss Northern Ireland's recovery plan from lockdown but it is now unlikely to be published until Tuesday.\nMinisters had initially hoped to publish the plan on Monday but work to finalise details is ongoing.\nIt is understood the blueprint will focus on nine areas across social and business settings.\nEach section will have five steps out of lockdown, guided by data.\nThat includes the infection rate of the virus, known as the R number, hospitalisations, vaccine rollout and progress in testing and tracing positive cases.\nThe delay comes as two more coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health.\nA further 138 cases of the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours.\nThe department's daily dashboard shows there are 302 Covid-19 inpatients across Northern Ireland's hospitals.\nThirty-four patients remain in intensive care and 29 coronavirus patients are on ventilators.\nExecutive ministers are due to meet on Tuesday morning with hopes of signing off the pathway-to-recovery document.\nThey will also discuss last week's decision by Agriculture Minister Gordon Lyons to halt work on post-Brexit border control posts, amid a row over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe issue was raised during Monday's executive meeting with some ministers expressing concern that Mr Lyons had taken the decision without consulting other parties.\nSpeaking later in the assembly, Mr Lyons defended his actions as \"entirely sensible and appropriate\".\nThe border control posts are based at ports and are used to check food products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nMr Lyons, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician, said he was responding to \"practical difficulties\" but the move sparked a sharp reaction from Sinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.\nOn Monday afternoon, DUP MP Sammy Wilson defended Mr Lyons' decision on border control posts and told BBC's Talkback programme the DUP would \"fight the protocol with every means we have\".\nIt is believed the Covid-19 lockdown exit plan includes nine \"pathways\" to take account of various parts of the Northern Ireland economy.\nThe plan is not expected to include indicative dates but will set out criteria that must be met before restrictions can be eased.\nNorthern Ireland's lockdown has been extended until 1 April, with a review due on 18 March.\nIn England and Scotland, lockdown exit plans that include target dates for easing restrictions have been published but the respective governments have said the lifting of the rules will only happen if certain conditions are met.\nIn Northern Ireland, children in pre-schools and pupils in primaries one to three will be the first return to class next Monday 8 March.\nThey will be followed by pupils in years 12 to 14 on 22 March.\nPupils in other years do not yet know when they will return to school.\nMeanwhile, some restrictions around visiting care homes and hospitals in Northern Ireland are being eased.\nThe new rules allowing at least one face-to-face visit per week by one person. Daily one-hour visits will be permitted in hospices and women attending maternity services will be able to have someone with them. \nCare homes that do not have an outbreak will also be allowed to facilitate a variety of visiting arrangements, including indoors where possible.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, lockdown restrictions have been extended until 5 April but some pupils are already returning to school.\nOn Monday, the Republic recorded one more coronavirus-linked death which happened in January.\nIt brings the country's death toll to 4,319. A further 687 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed. "

      "text": "The UK's Covid vaccination rollout will receive an extra \u00a31.65bn in the Budget to help it reach its target of offering a first dose to every adult by 31 July.\nThe chancellor will also announce \u00a322m of the programme's existing funding will be used in a trial to see if mixing different vaccine doses works.\nOver 20 million people in the UK have had a first dose and NHS England is now asking 60 to 63-year-olds to book jabs.\nRishi Sunak said it was \"essential we maintain this momentum\".\nHe added: \"Protecting ourselves against the virus means we will be able to lift restrictions, reopen our economy and focus our attention on creating jobs and stimulating growth.\"\nThe trial on vaccines will also investigate whether a third dose can be effective. The government is aiming to offer all adults a first jab by the end of July.\nMeanwhile, nine out of 10 people aged 65 and over have had their first Covid vaccine dose, according to the NHS in England.\nThe Treasury said the chancellor is also expected to outline improvements to the UK's ability to respond to new Covid variants in his Budget announcement.\nMr Sunak will pledge to put \u00a328m from the Vaccine Taskforce's existing funding into expanding the UK's vaccine testing capability and ability to quickly acquire samples of new coronavirus variants. \nAnd \u00a35m will be used by the Centre for Process Innovation in Darlington to acquire a \"library\" of Covid vaccines to use in its work against different variants.\nIt come as a coronavirus \"variant of concern\" first detected in Brazil has been found in the UK, with three cases detected in England and three in Scotland.\nIn England, officials are still trying to track down one of those who tested positive for the new variant. The first two cases were from the same household in South Gloucestershire, with a history of travel to Brazil, but the third is not linked, Public Health England (PHE) said.\nThere are also concerns vaccines may not be as effective against the Brazilian variant - but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be \"rapidly adapted\".\nThe latest government figures show 20,089,551 people in the UK have now had a first dose, while 796,132 have had a second.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson called it a \"huge national achievement\" and said \"every jab makes a difference in our battle against Covid\".\nThe government met its pledge to offer a jab to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK, including the over-70s and frontline health and care staff, by mid-February.\nFrom Monday, nearly two million people aged 60 to 63 in England will start receiving letters inviting them to book their vaccine.\nThe next target is to offer a first dose to all over-50s by 15 April, as well as people aged 16-64 with certain underlying health conditions and unpaid carers for disabled and elderly people.\nAfter that, people will be prioritised by age group.\nRestrictions in England are set to be fully lifted by 21 June at the earliest, with all pupils set to return to schools from 8 March.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, the chancellor said he \"is preparing a Budget that provides support for people\" as Covid lockdown rules are eased.\nMr Sunak confirmed he would provide help up to then but added that he wanted to \"level with people\" about the \"shock to the economy\" caused by Covid."

      "text": "Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi has been seen for the first time since she was detained in a military coup, after she appeared in court via video link.\nThe ousted leader appeared to be in \"good health\" and asked to see her legal team, her lawyers say.\nTwo new charges were announced against Ms Suu Kyi, who was arrested after the 1 February coup.\nMeanwhile, protesters took to the streets again despite Sunday seeing the deadliest day yet with 18 killed. \nThe deaths came as the military and police ramped up their response to demonstrations across the South East Asian nation over the weekend, firing into the crowds.\nBut protesters defied the crackdown on Monday, demanding the elected government be restored and Ms Suu Kyi and other leaders of her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), be released from detention.\nThe military says it seized power because of alleged fraud in November's general elections, which saw the NLD win by a landslide. \nIt has provided no proof of these allegations - instead, it has replaced the Election Commission and promised fresh polls in a year.\nMs Suu Kyi, 75, was arrested when the coup began and had not been seen in public until Monday's hearing, when she appeared via video link at the court in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw.\nIt is unclear where she has been held over the past month, but some reports suggest she was detained at her home in Nay Pyi Taw before being moved to an undisclosed location.\nMs Suu Kyi originally faced two charges of illegally importing walkie talkies and violating Myanmar's natural disaster law, but a further two charges were added on Monday. She was accused of using illegal communication equipment and causing \"fear and alarm\".\nThe initial charges carried sentences of up to three years in jail. It is not clear what punishment the new charges might carry, but she could reportedly be barred from running in future elections if convicted.\nThe case has been adjourned until 15 March.\nKhin Maung Zaw, who leads Ms Suu Kyi's legal team, told the BBC that he had been unable to see his client and was forced to listen to the hearing from a small room next door. \"The judge said we are not permitted to see her.\"\nBut another of her lawyers told BBC Burmese he had managed to catch a glimpse of her on the screen in court. And a third told Reuters news agency \"she looks healthy\".\nNews agency Myanmar Now reported that ousted president Win Myint - a key ally of Ms Suu Kyi - had also been charged for incitement under the penal code. \nMs Suu Kyi's popularity has soared in Myanmar since her arrest, but her international reputation still remains tarnished by allegations that she turned a blind eye to ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority Rohingya community.\nWhat else happened on Monday?\nProtests erupted again in multiple cities across the country. According to the AFP news agency, one clash saw unarmed protesters fleeing after a volley of shots were fired. It was unclear if live ammunition was used.\nAFP reported that in Yangon, demonstrators were seen using makeshift items like bamboo poles, sofas and even tree branches to erect barricades across streets. \nTear gas and stun grenades were also used to disperse hundreds of protesters in Yangon, Reuters news agency reported.\nAt least 21 people have been killed since the unrest began last month.\nOn Monday evening, army chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing gave a televised address during which he said protest leaders and \"instigators\" would be punished.\nMyanmar's military seized power after overthrowing the government and declared a state of emergency.\nJust days later, the civil disobedience movement began to emerge - professionals who are refusing to return to work in protest. \nThe movement quickly started to gain momentum and it was not long before hundreds of thousands of people began taking part in street protests. \nBut there has been an escalation of violence between police officers and civilians in recent days."

      "text": "People are keen to return to the office because working from home has left many \"fatigued\", says a boss at Britain's biggest office and retail complex.\nHoward Dawber, head of strategy at Canary Wharf Group, said people will still want to divide time between the workplace and home.\nBut they are missing office and city-centre life, he told the BBC.\nThe Canary Wharf financial complex, in London, has only about 6,000 people on site, against 100,000 pre-Covid.\nCanary Wharf Group is the developer behind roughly 7.5 million square feet of office space and would stand to benefit financially if there is a surge in demand once lockdown restrictions ease.\nBut Mr Dawber argued on the BBC's Today programme that people will be eager to get back in the office after so long away from the workplace.\n\"We've got to the point where there is a lot of fatigue out there,\" he said.  \n\"Working from home for the first couple of months of last year when the sun was shining and people were enjoying perhaps a more flexible environment, there was a sense that this was going to be a short-term process.\n\"I think now people are really missing that opportunity to collaborate with and just see their friends in the office, to get your hair cut, to go and get a good coffee at lunchtime, and to do all the life admin things you can do in a city centre.\"  \nIn the government's roadmap for ending coronavirus restrictions, it recommends that people in England continue to work from home where possible \nIt is hoped, however, that all legal limits on social contact can be removed from 21 June.\nWhile Mr Dawber said Canary Wharf expects occupancy levels to return to where they were before the pandemic, the increase will be gradual and people will still want to work from home on some days.\n\"I think it is going to be more socially acceptable for people to take the occasional day working from home,\" he said. \n\"So it may well be that people have a desk at Canary Wharf but some people will choose to work at home one day a week or a couple of days a month and that's a good thing.\"\nSome companies expect home working to continue once coronavirus restrictions have been lifted.\nLloyds Banking Group is set to reduce its office space by 20% over two years after a staff survey found that nearly 80% wanted to work at home for at least three days a week.\nHowever, others such as investment bank Goldman Sachs have rejected remote working as the \"new normal\", with chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, calling it an \"aberration\".\nLast month, Barclays' chief executive Jes Staley said that working from home was \"not sustainable\". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: \"It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have.\""

Mr Fischer said she was his \"guardian angel\".\nHe credited seeing her next to him with giving him the determination to survive. \n\"My panicked screams calmed as I looked at her, even though it registered that the blood pooling around her tiny body was my own,\" he wrote in an Instagram post on Monday.\n\"I cradled Asia as best I could, thanked her for all the incredible adventures we'd been on together, apologised that I couldn't defend her brothers, and then resolved that I would still try to save them\u2026 and myself,\" Mr Fischer wrote.\nHe is expected to make a full recovery. \nLady Gaga's pooches were recovered Friday night, after a woman brought the dogs - unharmed - to a Los Angeles police station. Authorities said the woman found the dogs and was uninvolved in the incident. Police have yet to identify any suspects. \nIt is not known if Lady Gaga - who is currently shooting a film in Rome, Italy - will hand the woman the $500,000 (\u00a3359,300) reward she initially offered for the safe return of the two dogs.\nMr Fischer tagged the pop star in his Instagram post, writing: \"your support as a friend, despite your own traumatic loss from your kids, was unwavering\".\n\"Your babies are back and the family is whole\u2026 we did it!\"\nHe wrote that, although his life had \"taken a very sudden and unexpected turn\", he was glad the dogs were safe and hoped the criminals would be brought to justice.

They couple up and take part in challenges to win the support of the voting public and ultimately compete for the cash prize.\nParticipants are catapulted into the limelight, and there has been criticism in recent years that Love Island has failed to adequately support contestants' mental health, while black contestants have spoken out about experiencing racism.\nLove Island says it has taken steps to address these issues. And in a first, a black couple won the US edition last year.\nYet many viewers in South Africa are disappointed with the programme's debut in their country.\n\"Wow so much diversity. This is a true representation of what I thought SA looks like,\" was one sarcastic reaction.\nAccording to a 2011 census at least 79% of South Africa's population is black, 9% is white, 9% is coloured and 3% is Indian.\n\"There aren't any Indian people on [Love Island SA], the one time we're thankful for not being represented,\" said Twitter user @joekhan360.\nYet another person complained that the ethnic breakdown of the group could mean there will be no mixed couples, in a country known for its fraught racial politics that persist 27 years after the end of white-minority rule:\nRespected news site IOL however says some of the criticism may be \"over the top\", and points out that the Love Island format brings in new cast members as the series goes on. \"Indeed, as the show progresses, it's likely that the show will become more diverse,\" IOL reports.\nLove Island SA's distributor DStv told the BBC this was indeed the case, adding: \"We pride ourselves in reflecting diversity and inclusion for all our shows, including Love Island. \n\"Viewers can be assured that this will become more apparent in future episodes of Love Island SA. We hope viewers will keep watching to enjoy the new stars of the show who will be arriving over the next few days.\"\nDStv's spokesman also apologised for \"technical issues\" that saw poor image and sound quality and which they are \"working really hard to resolve\"."

      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh has been transferred to St Bartholomew's Hospital for continued treatment, after 13 nights at another London hospital.\nPrince Philip, 99, is being treated for an infection and doctors will also carry out testing and observation for a pre-existing heart condition, Buckingham Palace said. \nThe duke is responding to treatment and \"remains comfortable\", it added.\nHe is expected to remain in hospital until at least the end of the week.\nPrince Philip, who turns 100 in June, was taken to King Edward VII's hospital in London on 16 February as a precaution, after feeling unwell. A palace source at the time said the duke had walked into the hospital unaided. \nOn Monday morning, someone was screened from journalists' cameras by umbrellas as they got into an ambulance outside the hospital in Marylebone.\nPrince Philip was transferred about three miles (5km) to St Bartholomew's Hospital, also known as Barts, Uniformed officers from the City of London police were positioned at the hospital entrance.\nBarts is a centre of excellence for cardiac care, its NHS site says.\nThe exact reason for Prince Philip's initial admission has not been disclosed, but his stay is not related to coronavirus. \nBoth the duke and the Queen, 94, received Covid-19 vaccinations last month. \nAside from the fact that the duke is 99 years old there are two, further, causes for concern.\nThe first is that he is still not home; this is his longest recorded stay in hospital. A reasonable expectation was that he would be heading back to Windsor by now.  \nInstead he has gone into St Bartholomew's Hospital for further treatment. The infection that sent him to King Edward VII's hospital is still being treated.\nThe second is the worry over his heart. The duke had a stent fitted following a blocked coronary artery in 2011. As far as we understand it has not played up since then. Now there are concerns - so there will be tests and observation in a hospital renowned for cardiovascular treatment.\nBecause he has retired from public life we hear little about the duke other than his rather infrequent visits to hospital.  When he was last seen in public, in July last year, he looked in good shape. But this extended stay in hospital will be a cause for heightened concern.\nThe Prince of Wales visited his father for about 30 minutes, the weekend after he was admitted.\nTwo days later the Duke of Cambridge said his grandfather was \"OK\" and that doctors were \"keeping an eye\" on him.\nThe following day, on 23 February, Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip was being treated for an infection and was not expected to leave hospital for several days. The Earl of Wessex added his father was feeling \"a lot better\" and appreciated the \"lovely messages\" from the public.\nBBC health correspondent Hugh Pym said the nature of the duke's pre-existing heart condition had not been made public, and speculated that it might be related to the stent operation in 2011 or that the infection had somehow exacerbated an existing heart condition, such as heart rhythm issues.\n\"Certainly he will be monitored extensively, with some of the best specialists in the country at Barts Heart Centre.\n\"But I think, probably, it's more than just monitoring. I think he has gone to this specialist centre because of the possibility - no more than that - that the doctors feel there may be a need for an intervention or procedure to be carried out.\"\nMembers of the Royal Family, including the Queen, have continued with their official duties during the duke's hospital stay.\nThe Queen has unveiled, virtually, a statue of herself for the first time, speaking to officials in Australia from Windsor Castle.\nIn a video of the call, made on Wednesday but released on Monday evening, the monarch joked that visitors to Government House in Adelaide might be alarmed to think she had paid them a surprise visit.\nHer other engagements over the past two weeks have included hosting a video call with health officials leading the UK's Covid vaccine rollout, and knighting a royal aide during a private socially-distanced ceremony at Windsor.\nPrince Philip retired from royal duties in 2017 in a move supported by the Queen.\nKnown for off-the-cuff remarks at public events, Prince Philip joked at the time that he was the \"world's most experienced plaque unveiler\".\nIn his time as a working royal, he has attended over 22,000 solo engagements and given more than 5,000 speeches.\nThe duke has received treatment for various health conditions over the years, including a blocked coronary artery in 2011, a bladder infection in 2012 and exploratory surgery on his abdomen in June 2013."

      "text": "The hunt is on for meteorite fragments that are likely to have fallen to Earth over England on Sunday night.\nMany people across Northern Europe saw a fireball in the sky shortly before 22:00 GMT, and the streak of light was also caught on special cameras.\nScientists think some pieces will have survived the intense heat of atmospheric entry and hit the ground.\nA computer model that analysed the camera data suggests the probable site of impact is just north of Cheltenham.\n\"We can track the fireball really well, but the 'black magic' starts when it goes dark - when the light goes out and it still has another 10-20km to reach the ground,\" explained Dr Ashley King from the UK Fireball Alliance (UKFAll) and London's Natural History Museum (NHM). \n\"Strong winds can blow the object off course of where you think it's going to land, and that's what we're working on now. But, yes, somewhere north of Cheltenham, out towards Stow-on-the-Wold,\" he told BBC News.\nThe fireball produced a sonic boom as it hurtled across the southern England sky. Eyewitness accounts describe the object breaking up into several defined streaks just before going dark. \nAny fragments that made it to the ground will be small, smaller than an orange, say, and are likely to be dark and shiny.\nAnyone who finds what they think might be a meteorite is asked to photograph it in situ, noting the GPS co-ordinates from a phone, if that's possible.  \nThe object should then be bagged without direct handling. And the absolute no-no: do not put a magnet near the object. This could destroy important information needed to study the rock. \n\"We've learned over the years that most meteorites carry a kind of intrinsic magnetic record within them from when they were in space,\" said Dr King.\n\"We can actually study that and learn about where these things came from and how they formed. But if you put a magnet on the object, it's a little bit like wiping your credit card with a magnet. We lose all of that information.\"\nSome of the trajectory work from the camera data has already suggested the object originated in the outer asteroid belt, which is between Mars and Jupiter.\n\"Most of the asteroids further away from the Sun tend to be these carbonaceous type that have got water and volatile materials in them but until we actually get our hands on some fragments, we can't say for certain,\" Dr King told BBC News.\nScientists from the UKFAll and meteorite experts from the universities of Glasgow and Manchester and the NHM are interested to hear from anyone who thinks they may have found something of interest.\nEven if you just have a photo or video of the event, the researchers request you upload and share it.\nBetween 10 and 20 meteorites are estimated to fall to the ground in the UK each year, but it's rare that any fragments are actually picked up.\nThe last recovered fall was in 1991 - the so called Glatton Meteorite, because it fell in the village of Glatton near Peterborough. \nMr Arthur Pettifor was tending his onions in his garden when a 10cm rock fell into his hedge."

      "tags": "UK banking,NI economy,Banking",
      "text": "Bank of Ireland has announced it will close 15 branches in Northern Ireland, which is more than half of its 28 branches currently operating in NI.\nIt is part of a wider cost-cutting exercise that includes the closure of 88 banks in the Republic of Ireland, where 169 banks will remain open.\nThe Dublin-based bank operates across the Republic and the UK. It is one of NI's \"big four\" banks.\nThe bank's UK head office will also relocate from London to Belfast.\nThe bank has been reviewing its Northern Ireland operations and there had been speculation that it could withdraw from the market.\nThat has not happened, but Chief Executive Francesca McDonagh said the Northern Ireland business will undergo \"a material restructure\".\nThe branch closures will affect the roles of about 120 staff in Northern Ireland but will not result in compulsory redundancies, according to Ian McLaughlin, Chief Executive of Bank of Ireland UK.\nThe branches earmarked for closure are:\nThe bank would work to identify staff who could be redeployed to other roles within the company, as an alternative to redundancy, said Mr McLaughlin.\nBranch closures will not start for 12 weeks and customers will be contacted individually about the changes, he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \nAside from closing 15 branches, the restructuring of its Northern Ireland business will include simplifying its range of products with a greater focus on car finance and mortgages.\nThe bank will also continue with its strategy of withdrawing from less profitable lending across the UK.\nIt said this would mean its UK loan book shrinking by about 10% during 2021.\nThe bank's UK division made a loss of \u00a315m in 2020, compared to a profit of \u00a3152m in 2019.\nThe loss was due to impairment charges - money which must be set aside to cover loans which may not be repaid in full.\nAll banks have seen increased impairment charges due to the economic impact of the pandemic.\nThe bank as a whole showed an annual loss of \u20ac760m (\u00a3657m), again due to impairment charges.\n\"We've announced some rather eye-watering numbers this morning, like most banks,\" Mr McLaughlin told Good Morning Ulster.\n\"It's been a really tough time and anyone who tells you differently isn't really paying attention, but we've got a really solid business here,\" he insisted. \nMr McLaughlin added that the relocation of the bank's UK office to Belfast was \"really good news and a sign of our commitment to Northern Ireland\".\nHe said the branch closures were in response to changes in customer behaviour over the last four years.\nHe argued that as the popularity of digital services like online shopping had increased, banks could not be \"insulated\" from the switch to digital.\n\"Our customers are using our branches less and less and we've reached a bit of a tipping point,\" Mr McLaughlin said. \n\"Our cash usage and customer visits in the closing branches is down 70% since 2017 and commensurately our digital banking up 50% over the same period so we need to adapt and we need to change.\"\nRetail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the number of closures \"seems a step too far\".\nAcknowledging \"the significant increase in online banking\", Mr Roberts said Monday's news will have a \"negative impact\" on high streets across Northern Ireland when the lockdown ends.\n\"I have also particular concerns of the impact on rural communities, with further reduced ATM provision and the ability to access cash,\" he added.\nThe Consumer Council has said the closures risk isolating consumers by removing access to essential services.\nFinancial Services Director Scott Kennerley said many consumers and small businesses still rely on face-to-face banking.\n\"We know that some consumers in Northern Ireland still prefer to use cash so the decision by Bank of Ireland to close half of its branch network will have a negative impact on consumers and their access to cash services,\" he said.\n\"We will continue to engage with Bank of Ireland to understand how it is supporting consumers affected by this decision.\"\nBank of Ireland had already closed several branches over the last decade. \nIn 2011, it had 44 branches in Northern Ireland. \nIn August last year, the bank said it was aiming to cut 1,400 jobs from its UK and Ireland operations. \nLast week, Ulster Bank confirmed it would close its Republic of Ireland business over the next few years."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning. \nA single shot of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca or the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab reduces the chance of needing hospital treatment in older adults by more than 80% according to an analysis in England. The Public Health England data, based on people over the age of 80 testing positive for Covid in hospital, follows similar results in Scotland. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press conference the results were \"seriously encouraging\" and that it \"shows the power of science\".  It comes as the latest government figures show 5,455 new infections have been recorded in the last 24 hours and a further 104 deaths, of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days. \nBoris Johnson has defended the government's measures to prevent new coronavirus variants being imported into the UK. Speaking on a visit to Stoke-on-Trent, he said: \"We have got one of the toughest border regimes anywhere in the world for stopping people coming in to this country who may have variants of concern.\" It comes as officials seek a person in England who has been infected with a concerning variant of coronavirus first found in Brazil. It is understood the person used a home testing kit but did not complete their registration form properly. They are one of six cases of the P1 variant found in the UK in February.  \nSchool staff do not have a markedly higher risk of infection than other working-age adults, a study suggests. According to its findings, the number of staff testing positive for Covid antibodies increased by a similar percentage to their peers while schools were fully open. Experts described the findings as \"very reassuring\", and suggested efforts by schools to control infections were working. But they said this did not mean teachers were at zero risk. And it would be \"naive\" to think teachers going into schools wouldn't have higher risks than those working from home, according to Dr Shamez Ladhani who is leading research for Public Health England. \nThis year's Download Festival has been cancelled for the second year in a row because of the pandemic. Organisers of the event, which was due to take place from 4 to 6 June, said they had realised it was \"not possible\" to make the event happen. It was due to be headlined by Kiss, Biffy Clyro and System of a Down. The government has set the target date of 21 June for removing all legal limits on social contact. Other festivals to confirm they're being cancelled this year include Glastonbury. But a number of other festivals, including Reading and Leeds Festival in August, say they are hopeful of being able to host events later in the year.\nA new mum who was diagnosed with Covid-19 at 30 weeks' pregnant has finally held her baby's hand for the first time, five weeks after his birth. Ellie Wright, 20, from Walsall, gave birth to Leo by emergency Caesarean on 12 January, 10 weeks premature. She could not have life-saving treatment until her baby was delivered. Ellie's rehabilitation might take up to two years - she has been in the hospital's critical care unit, fighting the virus and pneumonia. Baby Leo was on a ventilator but came home last week and is being cared for by his grandmother. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can read more about the new coronavirus variants here.\nAnd you can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Health officials are trying to trace one person in England who has been infected with a concerning variant of coronavirus first found in Brazil.\nThey are one of six cases of the P1 variant found in the UK in February.\nThe person is understood to have used a home testing kit but did not complete a registration form - prompting an appeal for anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February to come forward.\nLabour said there had been a lack of a \"comprehensive\" border system.\nThe P1 variant was first detected in travellers to Japan from Manaus in northern Brazil in January.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock will hold a meeting later to update MPs from all parties about the variant.\nThere have been concerns vaccines may not be as effective against the variant, but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be \"rapidly adapted\".\nDr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England (PHE), said the UK was more advanced than many other countries at identifying the variants and mutations, and therefore was able to act quickly.\nIn an attempt to find the unidentified person in England who was infected with the P1 variant, officials are asking anyone who took a test on 12 or 13 February and who has not received a result or has an uncompleted test registration card to come forward immediately by calling 119.\nThe hotel quarantine rule came into force on 15 February. It means that travellers coming to England from 33 countries - including Brazil - must pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while in Scotland the rule applies to international travellers from all countries.\nBefore that date, travellers arriving into the UK still needed to self-isolate in their homes for 10 days.\nBut Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said it was not known whether or not the unidentified person had recently been abroad, so it was not clear if they would have been self-isolating while they were infected.\n\"We need to find them as soon as possible,\" he told BBC Breakfast, adding that PHE was working with the postal service to try to locate them.\nMr Zahawi defended the testing system as \"pretty robust\" and said the UK's strategy of using surge testing to help identify cases of the variant was similar to other countries such as Australia. \nIt is tempting to think that if officials can identify the one missing case, the UK will be able to stamp out the Brazil variant. \nBut it's unlikely this will be possible. There will no doubt be more cases either of this variant or others circulating with the E484 mutation that allows the virus to escape some of the effect of the vaccines. \nThat's because not all positive cases can be checked for variants. The UK carries out nearly half of the genomic sequencing in the world and can check around 25,000 positive tests a week for variants. \nThat means about a quarter of positive cases were checked last week, but a month ago - with infection rates higher - it was under one in 10. \nWhat is more, not everyone who is positive comes forward for a test in the first place. We are seeing just the top of the iceberg.\nSo what is the strategy? Keep cases low and where possible try to limit the spread of these variants. \nAnd in the future, update the vaccines to work better against the variants if that is needed.   \nDr Hopkins told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that PHE was \"really clamping down\" with measures to prevent the spread of variants because the risk of transmission would increase when lockdown is eased - starting with England's schools reopening on 8 March.\nBut Prof Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said variants could threaten the UK's plans to relax restrictions.\n\"We are going to be faced with these [variants] in the next six months as we move towards relaxing measures. There are going to be challenges on the way and there is always a risk that we might have to go backwards, and that's what nobody wants,\" he told Today.\nThe unidentified England case of the Brazil variant is not linked to five other UK cases.\nThree of those cases are Scottish residents who flew to Aberdeen from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said.\nHolyrood said the three people tested positive while self-isolating. Other passengers who were on the same flight to Aberdeen are now being contacted.\nThe other two cases in England are from the same household in South Gloucestershire after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force.\nTwo other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant, so they are not included in the overall UK total of six.\nPHE said officials were tracking down passengers who were on Swiss Air flight LX318 from Sao Paulo to Heathrow, via Zurich, landing on 10 February.\nSara Blackmore, South Gloucestershire's public health director, said \"fast action\" by her local team meant the two cases were a \"very contained situation\".\nShe told the Today programme that everyone in five postcode areas of South Gloucestershire was being invited to take a Covid test, even if they did not have symptoms. But she said the extra testing was a \"precautionary measure\" and the risk to the community was \"low\".\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the news of the Brazil variant cases was \"deeply concerning\" and that it was \"vital\" everything was done to contain it.\n\"This is further proof that the delay in introducing a hotel quarantine was reckless and the continuing refusal to put in place a comprehensive system leaves us exposed to mutations coming from overseas,\" he added.\nHe later said he had written to Home Secretary Priti Patel calling for stricter measures at the border.\nChair of the Home Affairs Select Committee of MPs, Labour's Yvette Cooper, said officials must \"learn lessons\" from how other countries were enabling international travel during the pandemic.\nShe told the Today programme there were \"gaps and weaknesses\" in the measures to prevent variants from entering the UK and that \"stronger measures\" were needed.\nMs Cooper gave the example of South Korea's international travel arrangements, which include testing people at airports and providing contained transport for people from airports to their homes, so that they do not have to use public transport.\nAll travellers to the UK also need to present a negative Covid test taken a maximum of 72 hours before their departure. \nIt comes as the UK announced another 6,035 cases of coronavirus on Sunday and reported that a further 144 people had died within 28 days of a positive test.\nBut a milestone in the vaccination programme has been reached, with more than 20 million people having received their first dose of the vaccine."

      "tags": "Tax,Mel Stride,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021,Treasury Select Committee",
      "text": "Now is \"not the time for tax rises\" as they could undermine the UK's economic recovery from Covid - but they may be needed at a later date, MPs have said.\nAhead of the Budget announcement on Wednesday, a Treasury Committee report says public finances are on an \"unsustainable long-term trajectory\".\nIt says some tax rises may not harm recovery, but advises against others.\nThe committee's chairman, Mel Stride, told the BBC it was \"almost inevitable\" that some tax rises would occur.\nThere has been much speculation that the rate of corporation tax might rise, and Mr Stride told the BBC's Today programme: \"Putting up taxes is in general not a great thing to do but we are where we are and I think the committee view is that looking at income tax and looking at corporation tax is... the right way to go.\"\nMr Stride added: \"Each 1% increase in corporation tax raises about \u00a33bn so I think... [it] is almost inevitable that some level of rise in going to occur.\"\nHe added that the UK had cut corporation tax rates from 28% to 19% and was extremely competitive with the rest of the world so \"there seems to be scope for some modest increase\". \nThe Conservatives' election promise was not to raise rates of national insurance, income tax or VAT, but Mr Stride said that did not include the level at which people started paying tax, and those levels could be frozen.\nFreezing thresholds would mean more people paying more tax as wages rose.\nThe Treasury Committee's report said: \"With our public finances on an unsustainable long-term trajectory, our clear message is that Budget 2021 is not the time for tax rises or fiscal consolidation, which could undermine the economic recovery. \n\"But we will probably need to see significant fiscal measures, including revenue raising, in the future.\"\nThe report, published as part of the Tax After Coronavirus inquiry, comes after Rishi Sunak said he must \"level with people\" about the economy.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Sunak will use the Budget to set out the government's tax and spending plans following a year of financial disturbance and high government borrowing brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe huge amounts of money spent on pandemic support schemes have meant that government borrowing for this financial year has now reached \u00a3270.6bn, which is \u00a3222bn more than a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nMore than \u00a346bn has been spent covering salaries as part of the furlough scheme, for example, and tens of billions of pounds on guaranteeing loans to businesses.\nThe committee recommends a number of actions it says could raise additional money for the government without hampering economic recovery.\nAs well as mentioning corporation tax rises and income tax thresholds, it suggested that stamp duty, a tax paid by people buying properties, is \"economically inefficient\" and causes damage to the economy by \"affecting when and how often people buy homes\".\nThe government should also look at introducing a \"loss carry-back\" for trading losses, it said. This would allow losses made during the pandemic to be set against up to three previous profitable years, generating a tax refund for both incorporated and unincorporated firms.\nIt also called a review of the tax treatment of the self-employed \"long overdue\" and said the current system is \"confused, unfair and unsustainable\".\nThe chancellor has said he \"is preparing a Budget that provides support for people\" as Covid lockdown rules are eased.\nAt the earliest, restrictions in England are set to be fully lifted by 21 June.\nHowever, Mr Sunak also said he wanted to \"be honest\" with the public about the pandemic's impact on the economy and \"clear about what our plan to address that is\".\nHe warned high levels of borrowing had meant the UK was \"more sensitive to interest rate changes\" and that debt could \"rise indefinitely\" if borrowing continued after the recovery.\nA Treasury spokesman said that, since the start of the pandemic, more than \u00a3280bn had been invested to protect jobs and businesses.\n\"We've been able to respond comprehensively and generously through this crisis because of our strong public finances,\" he said.\n\"The chancellor has made clear that once our economy recovers, we should look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing.\n\"We will level with people about how we'll do that - and at the Budget this week we'll set out support for the economic recovery while being up front about the need to repair the public finances once the recovery takes hold.\""

      "title": "Covid variants: Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights?",
      "tags": "Travel,Reality Check,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are more than 40 countries on the government's red list, which has the strictest travel restrictions.\nOne is India, where a new mutation of coronavirus first identified in the country has spread to the UK. This has been linked to international travel. It has been classified as a \"variant of concern\" and more than 3,400 cases of it have been found in the UK.\nBut despite this and the discovery in the UK of other variants identified abroad, the government has never banned international travel altogether - unlike some countries.\nA traffic light system has been introduced for travel, with countries classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests.\nRed list countries (which include India, Pakistan, Brazil and South Africa) are those the UK government says are at the highest risk from Covid, and should not be visited \"except in the most extreme of circumstances\".\nIf you have been in one, you can only enter the UK if you are a UK or Irish national, or UK resident.\nYou must be tested negative for Covid-19 before departure and self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel.\nDirect flights from many red list countries to the UK are banned but some are allowed. These include flights from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya. The government says this is to avoid potential disruption to critical freight and British nationals seeking to return home.\nOn one day (19 May), Reality Check counted 4 direct flights from India to Heathrow.\nCoronavirus variants originally found in Brazil, South Africa and India are believed to be more transmissible, and there are concerns vaccines may not be quite as effective against them.\nBritish and Irish citizens who have been in these countries are allowed to return to the UK and - until mid-February - were trusted to self-isolate at home and could take public transport to get there. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had moved \"as fast as we could\" to introduce quarantine hotels, describing them as a \"very tough regime\". The measures began on 15 February 2021, after weeks of speculation.\nLabour said there had been a lack of a \"comprehensive\" border system. \nThe Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. \nThe country was placed on the red list on 23 April and there has been criticism that it should have been added earlier.\nJust under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling, according to a 13 May briefing from Public Health England. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England.\nPositive tests from passengers arriving in the UK are automatically sent for genome sequencing, which identifies new variants.\nBut there is concern that by the time a variant has been identified, it may already have spread in the UK.\nThe debate over whether to shut UK borders stretches back to the start of the pandemic.\nBetween January and March 2020, the UK introduced some measures to try to protect itself from the new virus.\nQuarantine was imposed on 273 people travelling from Wuhan in China, where the first outbreak was seen. Others from \"high-risk countries\" including China, Iran and Northern Italy were asked to voluntarily isolate for 14 days.\nAn inquiry into the pandemic suggested it was understandable the government \"did not consider it practical or effective simply to restrict flights\" at that time, partly because there were so many British residents trying to get home.\nBut these self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on 13 March 2020 - 10 days before the UK went into the first lockdown.\n\"The government's failure to have proper quarantine measures in place in March as the infection was spreading fast was a grave error and meant Covid spread faster and reached more people,\" Yvette Cooper, chair of the committee of MPs behind the inquiry said. \nOne study found the virus was introduced to the UK \"well over a thousand times in early 2020\", with a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from France, neither of which faced any restrictions. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases.\nAt the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against travel bans, saying they were \"usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact\".\nIn April 2021, the WHO said it would update its \"risk-based guidance\" on Covid and international travel.\nThe Home Office said the committee behind the inquiry was \"incorrect in their assertions\".\nIt said keeping borders open helped businesses maintain international connections, boosted the economy and meant people could still travel for essential reasons. \nIt argued that by mid-March 2020 there was \"significant transmission\" in the UK and any extra travel restrictions at that time would have had a \"very marginal\" impact.\nAt a meeting in February 2020, the government advisory committee Sage suggested that cutting the number of infections entering the UK by half would only delay the epidemic by five days. \nThe scientists estimated that a 95% reduction in imported cases, which would have required \"draconian\" travel restrictions, would have pushed things back by a month.\nBut at its meeting in January 2021, Sage said: \"No intervention, other than a complete, pre-emptive closure of borders, or the mandatory quarantine of all visitors upon arrival in designated facilities, irrespective of testing history, can get close to fully preventing the importation of cases or new variants.\""

      "text": "The US and its allies should reject calls for a global ban on AI-powered autonomous weapons systems, according to an official report commissioned for the American President and Congress.\nIt says that artificial intelligence will \"compress decision time frames\" and require military responses humans cannot make quickly enough alone.\nAnd it warns Russia and China would be unlikely to keep to any such treaty.\nBut critics claim the proposals risk driving an \"irresponsible\" arms race.\n\"This is a shocking and frightening report that could lead to the proliferation of AI weapons making decisions about who to kill,\" said Prof Noel Sharkey, spokesman for the Campaign To Stop Killer Robots.\n\"The most senior AI scientists on the planet have warned them about the consequences, and yet they continue. \n\"This will lead to grave violations of international law.\"\nThe report counters that if autonomous weapons systems have been properly tested and are authorised for use by a human commander, then they should be consistent with International Humanitarian Law.\nThe recommendations were made by the National Security Commission on AI - a body headed by ex-Google chief Eric Schmidt and ex-Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work, who served under Presidents Obama and Trump. \nOther members include Andy Jassy, Amazon's next chief executive, Google and Microsoft AI chiefs Dr Andrew Moore and Dr Eric Horvitz, and Oracle chief executive Safra Catz.\nMuch of the 750-page report focuses on how to counter China's ambition to be a world leader in AI by 2030.\nIt says that senior military leaders have warned the US could \"lose its military-technical superiority in the coming years\" if China leapfrogs it by adopting AI-enabled systems more quickly - for example by using swarming drones to attack the US Navy.\n\"The DoD [Department of Defense] has long been hardware-oriented toward ships, planes, and tanks [and] is now trying to make the leap to a software-intensive enterprise,\" the report says.\n\"If our forces are not equipped with AI-enabled systems guided by new concepts that exceed those of their adversaries, they will be outmatched and paralysed by the complexity of battle.\"\nThe report predicts AI will transform \"all aspects of military affairs\", and talks of rival algorithms battling it out in the future.\nAnd while it warns that badly-designed AI systems could increase the risk of war, it adds that \"defending against AI-capable adversaries without employing AI is an invitation to disaster\".\nIt does, however, draw the line at nuclear weapons, saying these should still require the explicit authorisation of the president.\nAnd it says the White House should press Moscow and Beijing to issue public commitments of their own over this matter. \nThe commission began its review in March 2019 and this marks its final report.\nIt says previous warnings about national security threats posed to the US by AI were ignored, but there is still \"a window\" to carry out proposed changes if President Biden and other politicians act with speed.\nBut not all its proposals focus on the military, suggesting that the US's non-defence spending on AI-related research and development be doubled to reach $32bn (\u00a323bn) a year by 2026.\nOther proposals include:\nWhile the members of the commission serve in a personal capacity, many of the companies they work for have bid for Pentagon and other government AI contracts.\nThese include a $10bn deal awarded to Microsoft, which Amazon is challenging in court.\nThe report also focuses on the US's need to restrict China's ability to manufacture state-of-the-art computer chips.\n\"If a potential adversary bests the United States in semiconductors over the long term or suddenly cuts off US access to cutting-edge chips entirely, it could gain the upper hand in every domain of warfare,\" the report states.\nIt advises that the US must keep at least two generations ahead of China's micro-electronics manufacturing capabilities.\nTo do this, it says the government needs to offer large tax credits to companies which build new chip fabrication plants on US soil.\nAnd it says export restrictions need to be put in place to prevent China being able to import the photolithography machines required to make the most advanced types of chips with the smallest transistors. \nThis, it says, will require the co-operation of the governments of the Netherlands and Japan, whose companies specialise in these tools. \nIn addition, the report says US firms that export chips to China should be compelled to certify they are not used to \"facilitate human rights abuses\", and should submit quarterly reports to the Department of Commerce listing all chip sales to China.\nThis follows allegations that chips from American firms Intel and Nvidia were used to conduct mass surveillance against China's Uighur ethnic minority in its Xinjiang region.\nPresident Biden has already ordered a review of the US semiconductor industry, and last week pledged support for a $37bn plan by Congress to boost local output.\nMinds are being focused by a current shortage of chips affecting the automobile industry.\nBut China also views the matter as critical to its own ambitions, and earlier on Monday its Ministry of Industry and Information Technology promised to \"vigorously support\" its own chip-makers.\nBeijing has previously said it wants to produce 70% of locally-used chips by 2025.\nChina's semiconductor-makers have been seeking out second-hand photolithography equipment to do this, buying up as much as 90% of available stock, according to a report in Nikkei Asia.\nHowever, these older machines are not capable of producing the most advanced chips, which are prized for use in both the latest smartphones and other consumer gadgets, as well as military applications.

      "text": "The UK should \"build walls higher\" to stop new variants entering the country, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said.\nAs part of England's roadmap out of lockdown, the UK Government has said international travel could resume no earlier than 17 May.\nBut Welsh and UK Labour leaders say it is too soon. Sir Keir Starmer said not enough had been done to secure borders.\nBoris Johnson says the current system is among the toughest in the world.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called Mr Drakeford's comments \"Trump-esque\".\nThe two Labour politicians made the comments in a joint virtual event on Monday. \nIt comes as health officials in England attempt to trace one person who has been infected with a concerning coronavirus variant first found in Brazil.\nIt is one of six cases of the P1 variant found in the UK in February.\nTravellers to England from 33 countries have been required to quarantine in hotels for 10 days, since earlier last month.\nWales has adopted the same rules as England, while in Scotland the rule applies to international travellers from all countries.\nSir Keir said the search for the individual in England infected with a variant first found in Brazil \"demonstrates the slowness of the government to close off even the major routes, but also the unwillingness to confront the fact that the virus doesn't travel by direct flights\".\n\"I still think we have not secured our borders in the way that we should have done and the sooner that's done the better.\"\nMr Drakeford said the mid-May travel date \"worries me hugely\".\nWales saw a \"big importation\" of virus last September when people returned from foreign holidays, he said.\n\"I would build the walls higher for now against the risk that we would bring in to this country the variants that could brewing in any part of the world and could then put at risk all the careful work that we have done to try to keep Wales safe.\"\nLater, at a press conference Mr Drakeford said Cardiff Airport, which is owned by the Welsh Government, would not take any flights from countries on the so-called \"red list\".\nHe said he would have the policy \"the opposite way to the UK Government\".\n\"I would say we shouldn't be having international travel, but here is a list of countries where we are confident that things are under control\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson defended the UK Government's measures on Monday.\n\"We have got one of the toughest border regimes anywhere in the world for stopping people coming in to this country who may have variants of concern,\" he said.\nHe said the government had moved \"as fast as we could\" with introducing hotel quarantine measures, describing it as a \"very tough regime\".\nAndrew RT Davies told BBC Wales the first minister was \"full of hot air\".\n\"Let's not forget back last June when Ryanair were flying flights in [to Cardiff] from Faro and Malaga,\" he said, adding \"all\" the Welsh Government had done in response was \"write a letter\".\nPlaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones agreed with the first minister that \"this was not the time for international travel\" and said restrictions should remain tight for the time being.\nA UK Government spokesman said: \"We continue to take every necessary step to protect the public and prevent the spread of the virus, including the stringent border measures currently in place. \n\"The reformed Global Travel Taskforce will assess how we can safely facilitate international travel when the time is right and while managing the risk of imported cases and variants.\""

      "text": "The prime minister says he has \"no doubt\" there will be a strong jobs-led recovery from coronavirus.\nMr Johnson said it had \"been expensive\" to look after everyone during the pandemic and the chancellor would be \"frank\" about state of the economy in Wednesday's Budget. \n45 Conservative MPs have urged Mr Sunak to cut business rates in England to help \"save the High Streets\".\nLabour has accused ministers of \"short-termism\".  \nWriting to the chancellor ahead of the Budget, the MPs from constituencies in the North of England,  said the tax should be cut from 50% of market rent to 35%.\nRishi Sunak has promised to offer businesses support while Covid-19 restrictions remain in place.\nBut in a pre-Budget speech, Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the chancellor had no plan and had spent the crisis \"looking for the escape hatch\" rather than setting out a strategy to take the country forward. \nShe said coronavirus had exposed \"the weaknesses of 10 years of Conservative mismanagement of our economy\".\nOn Wednesday, Mr Sunak will use the Budget to set out the government's tax and spending plans following a year of financial disturbance and high government borrowing brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.\nHe is facing pressure - including from the former Conservative Chancellor Ken Clarke - to raise taxes in order to repair public finances.\nHowever, others have argued that taxes could hinder the country's recovery from Covid-19.\nAnd now a group of MPs from the chancellor's own party - known as the Northern Research Group - have urged him to cut the tax paid by shops. \nThe tax is calculated based on the value of a business's property. As part of emergency pandemic measures introduced last year, the government brought in a business rates holiday, but this is currently due to end in April.\nIn a letter to Mr Sunak, the MPs - many of whom represent traditional Labour seats won by the Conservatives at the last election - argue that the burden of business rates is falling on areas most in need of support.\nThey say cutting the tax, when it is reintroduced, would \"ensure retailers have the confidence to invest in their bricks and mortar stores and save High Streets across the country\".\nAlthough they acknowledge that the business rates holiday \"undoubtedly saved hundreds of retail businesses\", they also call for \"longer-term fundamental reform\" to help High Street shops compete against online retailers. \nOn Sunday, the government announced a \u00a35bn grant scheme to help High Street shops and hospitality reopen as the lockdown is eased.\nAsked about introducing a sales tax to target online retailers such as Amazon, Mr Sunak said he was trying to reach an international agreement with other countries \"on how to tax these large multinational digital companies properly\".\nA report from the treasury committee says now \"is not the time for tax rises\". The cross-party group of MPs says increasing taxes could undermine the UK's economic recovery from Covid-19, but they may be needed at a later date.\nThe main focus of the Budget will be support for people and businesses in, what the government hope will be, the last, difficult part of the Covid-19 crisis. That's why the Treasury has already announced another \u00a35bn of grants for businesses that are still closed. \nDespite the publication of the roadmap for lifting the lockdown in England, there's still uncertainty about the future. \nAnd so the Chancellor will \"level with\" people about \"the challenges\" ahead for the public finances rather than setting out specific plans for raising more money and reducing borrowing. \nThey will come later in the year, and will almost certainly include a gradual increase in corporation tax. Although the Treasury isn't commenting on that now. \nThe economy performed better than expected at the end of last year, then worse at the start of this year because of the new lockdown. \nBut the Bank of England is predicting bumper economic growth, thanks to a combination of the vaccine and households raring to spend money they've saved. That could make the chancellor's job a bit easier. \nIn a speech to Bloomberg, Anneliese Dodds accused the chancellor of looking for \"a quick fix\" and presiding over \"12 months of irresponsible decision making\". \nShe said businesses and families had been \"left in the lurch\" because Mr Sunak had \"failed to make the link between health and the economy\".\nShe called on the government to extend Covid-19 support measures including the furlough scheme, the business rates holiday, the reduced rate of VAT and the \u00a3500 payment for those self-isolating.\nMs Dodds also accused Mr Sunak of implementing \"a triple hammer blow of council tax rises, social security cuts and pay freezes\".\nAnd she attacked the government for wasting money citing \"\u00a322bn spent on the Test and Trace system, \u00a3150m spent on unsafe PPE and \u00a32bn on contracts to businesses with clear links to the Conservative party, with no tender at all\". \nShe said a Labour government would bring forward \u00a330bn of planned investment \"to support the creation of 400,000 new green jobs\" and would support 100,000 new businesses by expanding start-up loans.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, Mr Sunak said he had responded to the pandemic \"generously and comprehensively\".\n\"We went big, we went early and there's more to come,\" he said.\n\"My priority is to keep supporting British families, businesses and people through this crisis - I said at the beginning I would do whatever it took to do exactly that and I remain committed to that and you'll see more of that in the Budget.\""

      "text": "A single shot of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca or the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab reduces the chance of needing hospital treatment by more than 80%, an analysis in England shows.\nThe Public Health England data showed the effect kicked in three to four weeks after vaccination.\nIt was based on people aged over 80 who were the first to receive the jab.\nGovernment scientists hailed the result, but stressed that two doses were needed for the best protection.\nIt comes after similar findings were published by Scottish health authorities last week, which they hailed as \"spectacular\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street briefing on Monday the latest vaccine results were \"very strong\".\nHe added: \"They may also help to explain why the number of Covid admissions to intensive care units among people over 80 in the UK have dropped to single figures in the last couple of weeks.\"\nAlso speaking at the news conference, England's deputy chief medical officer - Prof Jonathan Van-Tam - said the data offered a glimpse of how the vaccine programme \"is going to hopefully take us into a very different world in the next few months\".\nBut he said it was \"absolutely critical\" that second doses \"are still part of the course of immunisation against Covid-19 and no less important\".\nProf Van-Tam stressed there was a \"significant likelihood\" that a second dose of a vaccine would \"mature your immune response, possibly make it broader and almost certainly make it longer than it would otherwise be in relation to a first dose only.\"\nMore than 20 million people in the UK have had their first dose of a vaccine - over a third of the adult population.\nMeanwhile, another 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus have been reported in the UK, and a further 5,455 new cases, according to the latest figures.\nThe PHE data, which has not been peer reviewed, also suggested the Pfizer vaccine, which started being rolled out a month before the AstraZeneca vaccine, leads to an 83% reduction in deaths from Covid. This was based on people over the age of 80 who had died.\nThe data also showed vaccination cuts the risk of people over 70 developing any Covid symptoms by around 60%, three weeks after an initial dose.\nProf Van-Tam said the decision to give the AstraZeneca vaccine to older people was \"clearly vindicated\".\nSome European nations have refused to give it to the over 65s because data from the trials was mainly on its effect among younger adults.\nProf Van-Tam said the judgement made by the UK authorities was that it was simply \"not plausible\" the vaccine would only work on younger adults.  \nHe said other countries would doubtless be \"very interested\" in the data coming out of the UK. \nDr Mary Ramsay, Public Health England's head of immunisation, said there was growing evidence that the vaccines were working to reduce infections and save lives.\n\"While there remains much more data to follow, this is encouraging and we are increasingly confident that vaccines are making a real difference,\" she said.\nHowever, more evidence is needed to know how well the vaccines protect against the Brazil variant that has recently been identified in the UK.\nThis variant has a mutation - E484 - that could reduce some of the effectiveness of the vaccines.\nIt was announced on Sunday that six new variant cases - three in England and three in Scotland - had been found through testing.\nHealth officials have been able to contact all but one of these people. The whereabouts of the remaining individual is unknown as they did not complete their test registration card. \nIt has prompted an appeal for anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February to come forward immediately by calling 119.\nThe health secretary has denied that delays in imposing quarantine hotel measures on travellers to the UK put lives at risk, as officials continue to seek the individual.\nMr Hancock said there was \"no evidence\" the infected person had not followed home quarantine rules.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK has \"one of the toughest border regimes anywhere in the world for stopping people coming in to this country who may have variants of concern\"."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has been warned by some of his foreign ambassadors that a planned coal mine in Cumbria is damaging his reputation.\nThe PM wants to lead the world on climate change, but the ambassadors say his tacit support for the mine is bringing accusations of hypocrisy.\nThe issue has flared as the UK  co-hosts a coalition of nations pledging to phase out coal in power generation.\nThe Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) was initiated by the UK.\nSupporters of the Cumbria mine argue it should be encouraged because it will produce special coking coal for steel making, not thermal coal for power.\nBut that's too fine a distinction for some developing nations.\nThey have accused the UK of hypocrisy for shunning one type of coal while backing another.\nI understand some of the UK's ambassadors have told the government the Cumbria controversy is making it harder for them to persuade other nations to contribute fully to the UN climate summit Mr Johnson will host in November.   \nOpponents of the mine say the government must support clean technologies to make steel without using coking coal. \nIt's a prickly dilemma for the PM. Around 85% of the coal from Cumbria will be exported but the project will create well-paid employment in so-called Red Wall constituencies whose Conservative MPs have promised to increase job prospects.\nThe mine area has slightly below average unemployment, but it's forecast that manufacturing jobs in the north of England will be especially vulnerable as the UK economy moves away from fossil fuels. The government has a challenge to replace these with new jobs in clean industries.\nThe UK's stance on coal will fall under the spotlight on Tuesday when the UK and Canada co-host the first virtual summit of the PPCA, which will be addressed by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. \nThe Cabinet Office hopes the Cumbria problem can be resolved by then.\nIf the mine goes ahead, it fears climate talks will be soured through the year as the UK invites other nations to abandon coal. \nIn any event, the fate of the mine is in limbo. Cumbria County Council first approved it, then withdrew the decision to consider the latest advice from the UK's independent Climate Change Committee. \nThis says the UK should abandon the use of coking coal by 2035, unless its emissions are captured and buried underground. \nEurope's major steel producers are already striving to make low-carbon steel, but Mark Jenkinson, a Conservative MP in the constituency next to the Whitehaven mine, thinks that will not be economical by 2035.\nHe and other Conservative MPs have criticised the Labour party for trying to block the mine on climate change grounds.\nThe council will make a new decision on the mine in coming months. If it grants permission again, the issue will bounce back to the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick to decide on it. First time round he said it was purely a local issue.\nOne solution might be for the government to introduce new rules obliging local councils to take climate change implications into account when they consider planning applications for high-carbon projects.\nThe UK is not alone in wrestling with policy tensions in the transition to a low-carbon economy, especially as fossil projects approved years ago come to fruition in a new era when permission is likely to have been denied.   \nGermany is also a member of the PPCA, yet it opened a new coal-fired power plant last year.\nCanada has committed to phase out coal-fired electricity by 2030, but there are plans for new and expanded coal mining production in the west of the country.\nIt all comes as major emitters are again accused by the UN of not doing enough to combat climate change. \nA global stock take of plans for emissions reductions showed that nations would only stabilise emissions overall by 2030 - instead of halving them, which is deemed necessary to avoid global temperatures rising above the threshold of 1.5C. \nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

      "text": "A single shot of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca or the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab reduces the chance of needing hospital treatment by more than 80%, an analysis in England shows.\nThe Public Health England data showed the effect kicked in three to four weeks after vaccination.\nIt was based on people aged over 80 who were the first to receive the jab.\nGovernment scientists hailed the result, but stressed that two doses were needed for the best protection.\nIt comes after similar findings were published by Scottish health authorities last week, which they hailed as \"spectacular\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street briefing on Monday the latest vaccine results were \"very strong\".\nHe added: \"They may also help to explain why the number of Covid admissions to intensive care units among people over 80 in the UK have dropped to single figures in the last couple of weeks.\"\nAlso speaking at the news conference, England's deputy chief medical officer - Prof Jonathan Van-Tam - said the data offered a glimpse of how the vaccine programme \"is going to hopefully take us into a very different world in the next few months\".\nBut he said it was \"absolutely critical\" that second doses \"are still part of the course of immunisation against Covid-19 and no less important\".\nProf Van-Tam stressed there was a \"significant likelihood\" that a second dose of a vaccine would \"mature your immune response, possibly make it broader and almost certainly make it longer than it would otherwise be in relation to a first dose only.\"\nMore than 20 million people in the UK have had their first dose of a vaccine - over a third of the adult population.\nMeanwhile, another 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus have been reported in the UK, and a further 5,455 new cases, according to the latest figures.\nThe PHE data, which has not been peer reviewed, also suggested the Pfizer vaccine, which started being rolled out a month before the AstraZeneca vaccine, leads to an 83% reduction in deaths from Covid. This was based on people over the age of 80 who had died.\nThe data also showed vaccination cuts the risk of people over 70 developing any Covid symptoms by around 60%, three weeks after an initial dose.\nProf Van-Tam said the decision to give the AstraZeneca vaccine to older people was \"clearly vindicated\".\nSome European nations have refused to give it to the over 65s because data from the trials was mainly on its effect among younger adults.\nProf Van-Tam said the judgement made by the UK authorities was that it was simply \"not plausible\" the vaccine would only work on younger adults.  \nHe said other countries would doubtless be \"very interested\" in the data coming out of the UK. \nDr Mary Ramsay, Public Health England's head of immunisation, said there was growing evidence that the vaccines were working to reduce infections and save lives.\n\"While there remains much more data to follow, this is encouraging and we are increasingly confident that vaccines are making a real difference,\" she said.\nHowever, more evidence is needed to know how well the vaccines protect against the Brazil variant that has recently been identified in the UK.\nThis variant has a mutation - E484 - that could reduce some of the effectiveness of the vaccines.\nIt was announced on Sunday that six new variant cases - three in England and three in Scotland - had been found through testing.\nHealth officials have been able to contact all but one of these people. The whereabouts of the remaining individual is unknown as they did not complete their test registration card. \nIt has prompted an appeal for anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February to come forward immediately by calling 119.\nThe health secretary has denied that delays in imposing quarantine hotel measures on travellers to the UK put lives at risk, as officials continue to seek the individual.\nMr Hancock said there was \"no evidence\" the infected person had not followed home quarantine rules.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK has \"one of the toughest border regimes anywhere in the world for stopping people coming in to this country who may have variants of concern\"."

In the first half of the last decade, the proportion of black and coloured (the term used in the country for people who are mixed-race) people in poverty increased, according to the government's own data. \nThe show is made by production company Rapid Blue for the DStv network.\nThe commercial arm of the BBC, called BBC Studios, is a majority shareholder in Rapid Blue, which makes a number of reality TV shows in South Africa including The Bachelor and I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.\nLove Island has now been franchised to several countries across the world, including the USA, Germany, France and Norway after the popularity of the British version.\nAustralia's latest season of the show is being broadcast in the UK from this week.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,London Heathrow Airport,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Passengers have complained of queues of up to seven hours long at Heathrow Airport's border control.\nOne passenger described a mother having to feed her baby on the floor, saying conditions were \"not humane\".\nA union for border control workers said Covid security measures designed to reduce infections was leading to inadequate staffing.\nHeathrow Airport said the government needed to make sure there were enough staff to cope with demand.\nAlicia, 26, who did not want her surname used, was flying back from Vienna after attending a medical appointment for her leg.\nShe told the BBC she began queuing to go through border control at 18:30 on Sunday evening, but did not get through until 01:30 on Monday. \n\"I felt really unsafe,\" she said. \"It was really disorganised. One mother had to feed her baby on the floor. It's not humane.\"\nAlicia added: \"The staff didn't offer any chairs, there was no social distancing. Only about three or four people were checking documents.\"\nSeveral passengers told the BBC that they had spent five, six or seven hours waiting at the border on Sunday evening with only a few border force officials processing their paperwork.\nCamilla Tetley, 26, was flying back from Dusseldorf having spent Christmas with her parents who live there. She said she joined the queue at passport control at 7pm and didn't leave it until 1:30am. \n\"The queue never seemed to end. There was nowhere to sit, including for people with children or older people. I felt like we were just left stranded,' Ms Tetley said.\n\"There was some water at two hour intervals. We asked people what was going on and how long it would be, but no one seemed to know. There were lots of empty booths at the front of the queue so it looked like the space wasn't being used very well. \n\"We were quite crowded in as well. It seemed like it was quite mismanaged. The staff were not enforcing social distancing rules. Everyone had a mask on, but people were very close together.\"\nA worker in the immigration department at Heathrow, who asked not to be named, said the situation was chaotic. \"It's a mess. We cannot deploy without breaching health and safety measures. We are short staffed anyway. What are you meant to do?\"\nLucy Moreton, general secretary of ISU, the union for Borders and Immigration, said the queues were caused by Covid restrictions imposed by Border Force, which is part of the Home Office. \nShe said that staff have been put into bubbles of 10 people to reduce the risk of cross infection, but that this prevents more staff being deployed when the border becomes busy. \n\"Staff are very upset about the measure,\" said Ms Moreton. \"They have been receiving verbal abuse as the queues have got longer.\n\"The measure is not necessary, it contributes to the queues and it doesn't stop infection as staff have to interact outside those bubbles in other areas of the site,\" she said.\nThe Home Office called these comments \"disingenuous\" and said that the ISU had previously acknowledged that zonal working provides benefits to health and safety.\nThe ISU disputes this, saying it had never said that the measure has any benefits.\nIt said the measure adds nothing material to Covid security for staff, but impairs their ability to respond to demand.\nStaff at the border have also been told not to wear masks as they are processing passengers. \nWhile this is in line with public health guidance as there is a screen, she said staff are concerned as interactions can be between 15 and 20 minutes and include passing materials between passenger and Border Force. \nBorder Force have failed to meet their targets for processing passengers over the pandemic.\nA spokesman for the PCS Union, who have 13,000 members in the Home Office, said: \"The union has voted for strike action over the fixed roster, which by creating a bubble of 10 is inflexible and is leading to unacceptably long queues at Heathrow.\n\"We support any attempt to reduce the risk of spreading Covid-19.\n\"However, the current approach is not the best mechanism for keeping staff safe,\" he added.\nHeathrow Airport said: \"When additional measures were implemented at the border, we were clear with the government that they must support the Border Force to ensure appropriate numbers of officials are on duty to minimise queuing in the Immigration Hall.\n\"It is deeply regrettable that Border Force has been unable to provide adequate resourcing, despite our many attempts to highlight the implications of not doing so.\n\"Leaving arriving passengers to queue for hours is completely unreasonable and no airport has the space to hold arriving passengers in socially distanced queues for over four hours, as has been the case in recent weeks.\nThe airport added that it was Border Force's and the government's responsibility \"to ensure that their processes are properly managed and efficiently carried out\" without hitting passenger welfare.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Unfortunately a large number of arrivals yesterday failed to purchase their mandatory testing packages for the second and eighth days of quarantine in the UK. \n\"This caused delays as they were made to purchase them after being checked by Border Force. We make absolutely no apologies for this. Every essential check stops the spread of coronavirus in the UK. These people should not have been allowed to travel without their testing packages and we are following up with regulators and carriers to ensure the law is enforced.\"\nDespite travel measures in place to try to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, new variants of the disease are being detected in the UK.\nOfficials are trying to find a person who tested positive for the Brazil variant of coronvavirus, which may be more contagious than \"regular\" Covid.\nThe person used a home-testing kit, but didn't complete a registration form, prompting an appeal for anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February to come forward."

      "text": "Police have fired on protesters in Myanmar killing at least 18, the UN human rights office says, on the deadliest day of anti-coup rallies.\nDeaths were reported in several cities including Yangon, Dawei and Mandalay as police used live rounds and tear gas.\nSecurity forces began the violent crackdown on Saturday, after weeks of largely peaceful protests against the 1 February military takeover.\nGovernment leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, were overthrown and detained.\nSocial media footage from Sunday showed protesters running away as police charged at them, makeshift roadblocks being erected, and several people being led away covered in blood.\nThe police operation was expanded on Sunday as coup leaders sought to quash a civil disobedience campaign that has shown no sign of ending.\nUS National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration was preparing \"additional actions\" against those responsible for the violent crackdown.\n\"We will continue co-ordinating closely with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region and around the world to hold those responsible for violence to account,\" he said in a statement on Sunday.\nThe US has already imposed sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders since the army seized power.\nAt the scene: BBC video journalist\nAs I arrived on Hledan road in Yangon an ambulance passed me. I heard one man had been shot. I ran to the location and when I arrived the volunteers had already lifted him into the ambulance.\nI saw blood on the road and a homemade shield next to it. The bullet had passed through the shield.\nA few minutes later, more protesters occupied the road, blocking the area with shields and carts and readying themselves to take on the police.\nMany more arrived, sitting down on the road and chanting. There were so many I couldn't see the back of the crowd.\nTwo people were shot dead here and one was badly injured. But the people did not retreat.\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office condemned the violence against protesters, saying it had \"credible information\" that at least 18 people had been killed on Sunday. More than 30 others have been injured.\n\"The people of Myanmar have the right to assemble peacefully and demand the restoration of democracy,\" spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said. \"Use of lethal force against non-violent demonstrators is never justifiable under international human rights norms.\" \nActivists and medical workers said at least four people had been killed in the largest city, Yangon, as police fired bullets, stun grenades and tear gas.\nThe protesters remained defiant. \"If they push us, we'll rise. If they attack us, we'll defend. We'll never kneel down to the military boots,\" Nyan Win Shein told Reuters.\nAnother protester, Amy Kyaw, told AFP: \"Police started shooting just as we arrived. They didn't say a word of warning. Some got injured and some teachers are still hiding in neighbours' houses.\"\nSome demonstrators were herded away in police vans.\nIn the south-eastern city of Dawei, security forces moved to break up a rally. There are reports of live rounds being used. Four people were killed in the city, activists told the BBC.\nPolice also cracked down on a large rally in Mandalay, where police used water cannon and fired into the air. One person was killed there, the BBC has been told.\nProtests have continued elsewhere, including the north-eastern town of Lashio.\nThe UN said deaths had also been reported in Myeik, Bago and Pokokku.\nThe number of arrests since the protests began has not been confirmed. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group has put the figure at 850, but hundreds more appear to have been detained this weekend.\nActivists held rallies across Asia, including in Taipei and Hong Kong, to support the protesters in Myanmar.\nIn Bangkok, police used tear gas and water cannon against demonstrators who were also calling for the resignation of the Thai prime minister. \nMyanmar's civilian leader has not been seen in public since she was detained in the capital Nay Pyi Taw as the coup began.\nHer supporters and many in the international community have demanded her release and the restoration of the November election result that saw her National League for Democracy party win a landslide.\nMs Suu Kyi is scheduled to face court proceedings on Monday on charges of possessing unregistered walkie-talkies and violating coronavirus rules. But her lawyer says he has been unable to speak to her.\nMilitary leaders justified the seizure of power by alleging widespread fraud in the elections, claims dismissed by the electoral committee.\nThe coup has been widely condemned outside Myanmar, prompting sanctions against the military and other punitive moves."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "text": "School staff do not have a markedly higher risk of infection than other working-age adults, a study suggests.\nThe number of staff testing positive for Covid antibodies increased by a similar percentage to their peers while schools were fully open.\nExperts described the findings as \"very reassuring\", and suggested efforts by schools to control infections were working.\nThey said this did not mean teachers were at zero risk, however.\nTesting positive for Covid antibodies indicates someone has had the virus in the past. \nIn December, 15% of teaching and support staff tested positive for antibodies compared to about 18% of people of working age in the same local authorities - giving them about an average risk for their age.\nBut the working-age population includes people not in work and working from home, as well as those going into work.\nIt would be \"naive\" to think teachers going into schools wouldn't have higher risks than those working from home, according to Dr Shamez Ladhani who is leading research for Public Health England.\nHis team, from Public Health England, the Office for National Statistics and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, tested staff and students at a sample of schools for current and past infections. \nAnyone working outside their home is likely to have some elevated risk, the researchers explained. \nHowever, teachers' risk was not substantially higher compared with people working in other settings. \nBetween 25% and 50% of hospital staff had antibodies, according to various studies, while in care homes that at least one Covid outbreak, two-thirds (66%) of staff had antibodies by the end of the first wave.\nIn contrast, the proportion of school staff testing positive for antibodies rose to 15% from about 12% between November and December 2020.\nGiven schools were completely open during this period, \"you would expect much higher antibody conversion if it was a high risk environment,\" Dr Ladhani said. \nHe said the long-term harm of keeping children out of school was \"enormous\".\n\"The benefits outweigh the risks, but the risks are not zero,\" he said.\nIt was not possible to tell from the study whether any infections detected had been caught in school or in the wider community, or whether teachers were catching the virus from pupils or other teachers. \n\"The very fact we've not seen a high antibody rise when at school suggests staff were not being infected [at high rates] during that period\".\nHe said schools had never been in a better position to think about re-opening. \nAnd it was a testament to the infection control efforts of schools and their staff, one of the study's lead authors Prof Sin\u00e9ad Langan added.\n\"Schools and their staff have made a huge effort to protect themselves and their students by implementing Covid-19 control measures to try and stop infection entering the school site, and reduce on-site transmission,\" she said.\nIt was announced last week that no occupation would be prioritised for vaccination - instead people doing different jobs would be offered the jab according to their age or health status.\nThat's because those are the biggest factors driving whether someone will get very ill or even die after being infected. \nA relatively small proportion of Covid deaths have been in the working-age population.\nTwo-thirds of deaths in under-65s were in men and the most common occupations of those who died were in caring, service jobs and \"elementary occupations\" like cleaners, shelf-fillers and hospital porters.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe P1 variant of Covid-19 emerged in Manaus in northern Brazil. Experts fear that, like other variants, it could be more contagious than \"regular\" Covid, and less responsive to vaccines. Six cases of the variant have now been found in the UK - and officials don't know where one patient is. In England, two patients are from the same household in South Gloucestershire after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the hotel quarantine rule came into force. Three Scottish residents have also tested positive - they flew to north-east Scotland from Brazil via Paris and London. But the identity of the sixth case is unknown, because the person did not complete their test registration card. Anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February is now being asked to come forward. Labour said news of the Brazilian variant was \"further proof that the delay in introducing a hotel quarantine was reckless\".\nThe UK's vaccination rollout will receive an extra \u00a31.65bn in the Budget to help it reach its target of offering a first dose to every adult by 31 July. The chancellor will also announce that \u00a322m of the existing funding will be used in a trial to see if mixing different vaccine doses works. More than 20 million people in the UK have had a first dose. Watch more about the rollout below.\nNow is \"not the time for tax rises\" as they could undermine the UK's economic recovery from Covid - but they may be needed at a later date, MPs have said. Ahead of the Budget on Wednesday, a Treasury Committee report warns that public finances are on an \"unsustainable long-term trajectory\". Government borrowing for this financial year has now reached \u00a3270.6bn - which is \u00a3222bn more than a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nWedding and civil partnership ceremonies can take place at licensed venues in Wales from Monday, as lockdown restrictions are slightly relaxed. But as wedding receptions are still not allowed in Wales, some couples have delayed their big day until later in the year. Previously, only register offices and places of worship were allowed to perform marriages. \"Licensed venues\" include places such as hotels and stately homes.\nAlex has been homeless on and off for 10 years - but when the pandemic hit he lost his job as a lorry driver and found himself living in the back of a van.

      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "Police officers are facing \"greater hostility\" from the public when enforcing Covid rules, the head of the South Wales Police Federation has said. \nSteve Treharne said officers were dealing with \"significant problems\" of people congregating in public spaces. \nIt follows \"numerous reports\" of crowds at beauty spots over the weekend, which led to the closure of car parks and fines being issued. \nCovid rules mean you should only leave home for essential reasons or exercise.\nMr Treharne told BBC Radio Wales: \"It's incredibly frustrating for our officers and, I dare say, the community at large. \n\"We understand people are incredibly frustrated these restrictions have been in place for a long while now, however, the rules are quite clear on this, that people shouldn't be travelling to take exercise.\n\"I don't think the situation is being helped with the circumstances around off-licences being allowed to open, so we've got people congregating,\" he added. \n\"The off-licences are open, people are purchasing alcohol and of course that brings us significant problems, and our officers are now facing greater hostility from members of the public and it's not really fair.\n\"Our officers don't draft the legislation, they've got a job to do and they can only enforce the legislation that's there.\"\nAt Monday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, First Minister Mark Drakeford called for \"responsible\" behaviour as more people head outside. \nHe said: \"I understand that over the weekend, when the weather was beautiful and people have spent the long winter months confined at home, people wanted to enjoy the fresh air, but it's still a matter of doing that in a way that's responsible and within the rules.\n\"When I was walking in Cardiff yesterday, there were lots of people out but they were still behaving in a way that was respectful to one another, and that's what we need to see continuing.\"\nWales' Chief Medical Officer Frank Atherton warned that \"coronavirus has not gone away\". \n\"People have been cooped up over the winter. When the sun comes out, we want to be out and about,\" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\"Community rates have come right down, but we've been here before. \n\"We had very low rates last summer, and we've seen how quickly it has taken off. There is still a risk that the virus could come back.\"\nAs weather improved over the weekend, car parks were closed across several beaches in Swansea at the request of police. \nCarrie Townsend Jones, a community councillor from Mumbles warned people not to travel from far away to visit the area. \nShe said: \"I do understand it's very difficult for people, particularly if they don't have outdoor space, you know they're looking out and the weather's lovely and of course they're desperate to get out, but there are lots of other places where people can walk that are local to where they live.\""
