      "title": "Calls grow for extra bank holiday if England win",
      "tags": "UK economy",
      "text": "Prime minister Boris Johnson is coming under pressure to give workers a one-off bank holiday if England win their final Euro 2020 championship on Sunday.\nA petition on the Parliament website passed 320,000 signatures on Friday. It says an extra day off would help families to watch the match together.\nMr Johnson said granting a bank holiday now would be \"tempting fate\".\nThe Trades Union Congress also urged firms to be flexible, if possible, and allow workers to start later on Monday.\nTUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"Bosses should talk to their staff about flexible working arrangements ahead of Monday morning - perhaps allowing them to start later and claim back their time afterwards.\"\nSome stores are changing their hours to accommodate the big event.\nThe Co-op is closing its stores at 7.45pm on Sunday, rather than its normal closing time of between 10-11pm, in order to give staff the chance to watch the match.\nTesco will also close its Express stores in England at 7:45pm on Sunday evening.\nSupermarket chain Lidl will alter its opening hours on Monday if England wins to allow staff an additional hour to \"kick back and relax in the morning\".\nShoppers and staff alike were likely to appreciate the extra time first thing, the supermarket said.\nThe petition calls for a bank holiday this coming Monday, but arranging a bank holiday at such short notice would not be possible. The government also said it did not want to pre-empt the outcome of Sunday's match. \n\"Clearly we want England to go all the way and win the final, and then we will set out our plans in due course,\" it added.\nParliament considers all petitions that get more than 100,000 signatures for a debate.\nThere are eight bank holidays a year in England and Wales, nine in Scotland, and ten in Northern Ireland.\nBank holidays are created under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, or are created by royal proclamation - that is, by the Queen, who acts on government advice. \nThe department responsible for bank holidays is the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\nBank holidays are not actually statutory holidays, although most workers do get the day off.\nNine things you might not know about bank holidays\nThe petition, which was started by marketing manager Lee Jones, says: \"English people would naturally want to continue to enjoy the win, giving the retail and leisure industry a much-needed opportunity to make up lost revenues.\"\nA win for England over Italy on Sunday night would be the first major triumph for the country since 1966 saw it win the World Cup. \nThe match is set to end at 10pm, but if it goes to extra time it could finish closer to 11pm, the semi-final against Denmark on Wednesday was not over until 10.45pm.\nSome firms are already working on the assumption there will be some sort of hangover effect on their workforce and are trying to work around it.\nIan Uttley director at transport firm Stagefreight, told the BBC's Wake Up to Money Programme he had been doing his best to give drivers a later start: \"We do have a lot of England fans but it's  very difficult. We try to give them later shifts but at the end of the day they are professional drivers doing a professional job.\n\"We are trying to give them time off. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience but we do work seven days a week and there'll always be someone in a truck somewhere who will need to drive the next day. Someone has to get the food to the supermarket shelves and into the shops.\"\nHe said there were strict checks in place to ensure no-one was tempted to over celebrate: \"We expect them to limit alcohol limits and we expect them to be under the limit when they start driving - and we do conduct checks.\" \nDowning Street supports the idea, saying employers who are able to should be flexible about allowing staff to go in to work late on Monday or take the day off if England win.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: \"We would want businesses who feel able to consider it if they can, but we recognise it will vary depending on the business and company.\"\nMr Johnson has already said pubs can stay open until 11.15pm this Sunday to reduce the risk of customers being told to leave before the match ends.\nDowning Street has said it will set out any celebrations such as a victory parade for the England team \"in due course\", but has not confirmed whether plans for a potential bank holiday are in motion behind the scenes."

      "tags": "Violence against women,Sarah Everard murder",
      "text": "\"Missing: Please Help Our dear friend Sarah Everard,\" read the posters that went up on south London streets and local social media forums in the days after the 33-year-old disappeared on her walk home in early March.\nIt was concerning but such appeals are not exactly a rare sight, and the hope was that she would soon turn up safe and sound. \nBut in the days that followed, as police put out a CCTV image of Sarah and gave details of her last known movements, concern grew to alarm, then dread, then fear, shock and sadness.\nSarah Everard's journey from Clapham Common to Brixton had taken her through some of the capital's most populated, brightly-lit, and well-walked parts. Hundreds of people - many of them young women - tread those pavements every day and consider the streets in and around them home.\nAs the police investigation ramped up, local women were warned to be careful about venturing out alone. When a police officer was arrested - and subsequently charged with Sarah's murder - the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick acknowledged that women in London and beyond \"will be worried and may well be feeling scared\", although she said for a woman to be abducted off the street was an \"incredibly rare\" event.\nBut the case had touched a nerve, particularly as walking is one of the few activities to have been allowed during Britain's coronavirus lockdown.\nWomen across the country took to social media to discuss their own experiences of walking the streets and the lengths they went to to feel safe. Out poured stories of being followed, harassed, catcalled, assaulted and exposed to. \nHelena Wadia was one of those. She told BBC Radio 5 Live she wanted to highlight how common it was for women to feel unsafe.\n\"The first time I was catcalled I think I was about 12 years old,\" she said. \n\"I have been self-policing since then. We moderate everything - our clothing, our drinking. We get taxis where maybe we can't afford it. We hold keys between our fingers. We don't wear headphones when we're jogging. We stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting.\"\nOne tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces was liked more than 120,000 times.\nPeople even began sharing tips on what apps were out there to help women stay safe.\nAnna Birley is one of many people in recent days to have underlined that the narrative around women's safety must change.\n\"What's so upsetting is it shouldn't be our problem,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's not our fault. Women aren't the reason women get attacked.\"\nA vigil she helped plan at Clapham Common - one of several around the country - as a way of \"reclaiming our public spaces and coming together to feel a level of solidarity\" in itself became controversial when it resulted in clashes with police and women were seen being physically restrained.\nSeveral hundred people had turned up despite being told it had to be cancelled because it breached lockdown restrictions. The organisers had criticised the police for failing to \"constructively engage\" with them on efforts to make the event Covid-safe, instead of urging mourners to hold candle-lit vigils at home. \nThe Metropolitan Police defended their actions at the Clapham vigil. They said they \"were placed in this position because of the overriding need to protect people's safety\", but have faced intense criticism from across the political spectrum.\nOn International Women's Day every year, British MP Jess Phillips reads out the names of all the women and girls killed over the previous 12 months, where a man has been convicted or charged as the main perpetrator.\nThis year it fell on the day remains were found in the hunt for Sarah Everard, and she read out 118 names. \"Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives,\" Ms Phillips told Parliament. \"Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common.\"\nIn a separate debate in the Lords, Parliament's upper chamber, Baroness Jenny Jones of Moulescoomb called for an 18:00 curfew for men on the streets.\nShe later told Sky News that while she hadn't been \"entirely serious\", she wanted to make the point that \"when the police victim-blame by asking women to stay home, we don't react. We just think it's normal.\"\nSo what has been the response of men?\nAs women took to social media to tell their stories, Stuart Edwards, who lives five minutes away from where Sarah went missing, tweeted: \"Aside from giving as much space as possible on quieter streets and keeping face visible, is there anything else men can reasonably do to reduce the anxiety/spook factor?\" The tweet received 27,000 likes and more than 3,000 retweets.\nAmong those who joined the conversation was food critic Jay Rayner, who also lives in south London. \"If I find myself walking behind a single woman on a quiet street I always cross the road to the other side and ideally accelerate away as quickly as possible. I am a big man and absolutely aware what my silhouette looks like in the darkness,\" he tweeted.\nSome however have been keen to point out that it's a tiny minority of men who are attackers - using the hashtag #NotAllMen.\nBut the issue of violence against women is not one for the UK alone.\nThe World Health Organization this week published a report saying one in three women globally, around 736 million, had been subjected to physical or sexual violence in their lifetimes.\nWHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said violence against women was \"endemic in every country and culture\", and had been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"Unlike Covid-19, violence against women cannot be stopped with a vaccine,\" he said, as the WHO called for more investment in services to help vulnerable women."

      "text": "Giant pandas are no longer classified as endangered but are still vulnerable, Chinese officials say.\nThe classification was downgraded as their number in the wild has reached 1,800.\nExperts say that the country managed to save its iconic animal through its long-term conservation efforts, including the expansion of habitats.\nChina considers pandas a national treasure, but have also loaned them to other countries as diplomatic tools.\nThe latest classification upgrade \"reflects their improved living conditions and China's efforts in keeping their habitats integrated\", said Cui Shuhong, head of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment's Department of Nature and Ecology Conservation at a news conference.\nThe new classification comes years after the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) had already removed the animal from its endangered species list and re-labelled it as \"vulnerable\" in 2016. \nAt the time, however, Chinese officials had disputed the decision, saying that it could mislead people into believing that conservation efforts could be relaxed.  \nThis week's announcement by China's environmental ministry is the first time the animal's status was changed on its own endangered species list, which uses similar standards as the Swiss-based IUCN. \nChinese social media users were delighted at the news, saying that it is \"proof\" that conservation efforts are worth it.\n\"This is the result of years of hard work. Well done to all the conservationists,\" one person wrote on microblogging platform Weibo.\nExperts have said that the success is largely due to Chinese efforts to recreate and repopulate bamboo forests. Bamboo makes up some 99% of their diet, without which they are likely to starve.\nZoos have also attempted to increase numbers via captive breeding methods. \nSince the 1950s China has used pandas to forge political friendships across the globe. Here's a look at where the animals have been used in diplomacy in the past."

      "text": "Southern Water has been fined a record \u00a390m for deliberately dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the sea.\nThe company admitted 6,971 illegal spills from 17 sites in Hampshire, Kent and West Sussex between 2010 and 2015.\nHis Honour Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson said the offences had been \"committed deliberately\" by Southern Water's board of directors at the time. \nLawyers for the company had told Canterbury Crown Court the spills were the result of \"negligence\".\nThe offences were discovered as part of the Environment Agency's largest ever criminal investigation, which began after shellfish were found to be contaminated with E. coli.  \nRaw sewage had been diverted away from treatment works and into the environment, allowing the company to avoid financial penalties and the costs of upkeep and upgrades, the court heard. \nMr Justice Johnson said Southern Water \"showed a shocking and wholesale disregard for the environment, for the precious and delicate ecosystems along the north Kent and Solent coastlines, to human health and to the fisheries and other legitimate businesses that depend on the vitality of the coastal waters\".\nThe total volume of untreated sewage dumped into the environment was estimated between 16 to 21 billion litres, or 7,400 Olympic-sized swimming pools, the court heard.\nIn Bedhampton Creek, in Havant, Hampshire, anglers reported finding sanitary towels, condoms and tissues in the water, along with a strong smell of sewage, the court heard.\nResidents in Swalecliffe, Kent, said discharges from the sewage works were \"occurring events\", the court heard. \nThe \"sheer scale\" of offending meant it was \"inherently unlikely this was due to a small number of rogue employees\".\n\"It is far more likely to be due to deliberate disregard for the law from the top down,\" the judge said.\nThe offences had been aggravated by Southern Water's \"persistent pollution of the environment\" which had led to 168 previous convictions and cautions, he said.\nHe said the scale of the fine was intended to \"bring home to the management of this and other companies the need to comply with laws that are designed to protect the environment\".\nIt is the largest sentence issued by a court after an Environment Agency investigation, exceeding a \u00a320m fine received by Thames Water in 2017.\nIn March 2020, Southern Water admitted 51 counts at Maidstone Crown Court, covering discharges of untreated sewage from sites in:\nDuring periods of heavy rain, water companies are permitted to divert untreated waste water away from treatment plants, discharging sewage straight into the environment to prevent sewers backing up.\nHowever, the Environment Agency found that on thousands of occasions untreated sewage had left Southern Water sites through this route during periods of lower rainfall.\nDirecting sewage straight into rivers and seas improved the quality of treated water leaving the works, which is regularly tested and can lead to heavy fines if standards fall, the court heard. \nMr Justice Johnson said the offences had been motivated by a desire to \"focus the company's attention on those metrics that increase its income, disregarding its wider compliance obligations\".\nChief executive Ian McAulay, who was appointed in 2017, was in court on Friday alongside chairman Keith Lough, who joined in 2019.\nAfter the hearing, Mr McAulay said: \"We have heard what the judge has said today and will reflect closely on the sentence and his remarks. \n\"He has rightly put the environment front and centre which is what matters to all of us. \"\nMr McAulay said the fine would not affect customers' bills or infrastructure investments, with shareholders due to bear the cost. \nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Coronavirus testing,NHS,Self-isolation,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The NHS Covid contact tracing app used in England and Wales may need to change as coronavirus restrictions change, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.\nEngland ending the 1m-plus rule on 19 July may mean the app's sensitivity needs to be reduced, he said.\nThe app detects the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes.\nIt comes amid a huge rise in alerts as infections surge.\nThe system allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test.\nUnder current rules, those who receive an alert are asked to stay at home for up to 10 days, although the Department of Health said the app \"is, and always has been, advisory\" - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace.\nCoronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July but the requirement to self-isolate if you have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears that millions of people would be asked to self-isolate this summer as people mixed more.\nThe hospitality industry and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge.\nOne possible solution could be to change the sensitivity of the app, so it would tell people to self-isolate only after closer and more prolonged contact.\nBut sources at the app developers told the BBC they have not yet been asked to do this, although they are planning a change from 16 August when people would be able to record that they were fully vaccinated to turn off the self-isolation countdown timer.\nMr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: \"As our restrictions change, of course the app needs to change. Things like replacing the 1m-plus rule on 19 July might well lead to a review of the way the app itself needs to function.\"\nBut he said the app was still \"very important as one of the tools in our armoury\". He said there were still large numbers of people downloading it and said he had not seen any data showing people were deleting it.\nThe most recent figures for the last week of June show an extra 300,000 downloads, bringing the total to more than 26 million, but it is not known how many people are active users.\n\"It's in our interests as a society to carry on doing the things that protect each other,\" Mr Shapps said.\nTechnically, it wouldn't be very difficult to tweak the app to make it less \"sensitive\" - the hard bit is working out exactly what those tweaks should be.\nCurrently, two phones with the app installed, exchange a digital handshake, via bluetooth, every five minutes. It registers how far apart they are, and for how long.\nIf one of those phones then goes on to report a positive Covid test, other phones who were two metres away or less, for a duration of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are likely to receive an isolation alert.\nAs we have learned more about the virus, other factors have also been incorporated such as how infectious the person was likely to have been at the time the two phones were in close proximity.\nChanging those parameters would be straightforward.\nBut fundamentally it's the volume of cases which are driving the volume of isolation alerts, not the app itself. In the last week of June there were 356,000 alerts, triggered by 61,000 positive test reports - that's about six app users isolating per Covid case. \nWhen you look at it like that, it doesn't sound so excessive.\nAnd because of the app's focus on privacy nobody, including the government, the police and the NHS knows who has been \"pinged\" - making it legally unenforceable.\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned about the possible changes, saying weakening the app would undermine the track and trace system the government had spent billions on.\nHe said: \"This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea.\"\nA Downing Street source stressed people were still being encouraged to self-isolate if they got an alert, adding the Department of Health's statement that the app was advisory was consistent with the government's message to \"act cautiously, especially as we know cases will rise\".\nDr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday she was \"aware that people are choosing not to use the app\" when asked about concerns people have been deleting it to avoid being \"pinged\".\nHinting at a change, she added there was \"work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk\".\nA source close to Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC \"we are looking at the sensitivity of the app\" and pointed out the sensitivity had been changed before.\nBut they did not say exactly what would change. At present, if two phones running the app are close for long enough, and one of the two users later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert.\nYou can also use the app to \"check-in\" to venues so you can be notified of any positive cases you may have encountered there, although the requirement to check-in will be lifted in England when lockdown rules ease further on 19 July.\nA total of 496 venue alerts - which use the check-in data to alert people to potential contact with a positive case - were sent between 24 June and 30 June.\nBut alerts for people coming into close contact with someone testing positive soared by more than 60% in the last week of June to 360,000.\nAt the end of May, there were only 16,000 alerts in a week.\nA BBC analysis has estimated 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate between this week and 16 August, as the number of infections continues to rise.\nThe NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations and separate test-and-trace programmes.\nOn Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged there was \"frustration\" at how the NHS contact tracing app could continue to order the double jabbed to isolate.\nProf Sir Jonathan Montgomery, a healthcare law expert from University College London who advised the government on the initial launch of the app, said it could still be useful but the government needed to issue new guidance.\n\"The real reason we shouldn't abandon the tool is because so many transmissions of Covid happen before people realise they are unwell,\" he told Times Radio.\n\"What the app does is enable you to be careful, and what the government needs to say is 'what does care look like in the new world?'.\"\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the country was \"moving to a system of testing rather than self-isolation\".\n\"I rely on the NHS app, as many people do,\" he said. \n\"I know how difficult it has been for people and I'm sorry for the hassle that people experienced as a result of this - it is coming to an end.\"\nA further 32,551 new coronavirus cases were recorded on Thursday, alongside another 35 deaths within 28 days of a positive test."

      "text": "Bookings for flights and holidays have surged after the decision that fully vaccinated travellers returning from amber-list countries will not have to self-isolate after 19 July.\nAirlines said there was a rapid rise in ticket purchases within hours after the government announced it was relaxing quarantine rules on Thursday.\nEasyJet said bookings to amber-list destinations increased by 400%.\nDespite suggestions prices could rise, analysts thought this unlikely.\nThe need to quarantine on return to the UK has hindered the travel industry's recovery from the pandemic, with many people choosing not to holiday abroad.\nUnder previous rules, those returning to Britain from its top holiday destinations - Spain, France, the US and Italy - all had to self-isolate for up to 10 days.\nThe travel agents' association, Abta said the industry was \"very much led by supply and demand\", so prices could rise as more people booked after the rule change.\nBut consumer group Which? said previous research found holiday prices before and after government green-list announcements \"stayed the same or went down, not up\".\nIt said that so far, prices had not increased to popular destinations on the amber list.\nOut of 14 package holiday prices and six flights to Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal it tracked departing during the peak holiday season in last August, 12 packages remained the same price and two increased.\nFour of the six flights rose in price, although the average fare increase was \u00a37. \nRory Boland, Which? Travel Editor, urged people to take news of surging prices \"with a pinch of salt\". \nEasyJet said flight bookings from the UK to amber-listed countries had surged 400% following the government's announcement on Thursday, adding that holiday bookings were more than 440% up on the previous week.\nAlicante, Malaga, Faro, Nice and Corfu are among the top destinations for flights this summer, the airline said.\nJohan Lundgren, easyJet chief executive, said Europe had \"now turned green for the double-jabbed\".\nHe urged the government to \"remove expensive testing\" for fully vaccinated people travelling to green and amber-list destinations \"as we do not want to see a return to flying being a preserve of the rich\".  \nBritish Airways said \"within a couple of hours\" of the government's announcement, it witnessed a 96% increase in the number of views on its website compared with Wednesday last week.\nA spokesperson for Tui told the BBC the tour operator had seen a \"surge in website visits showing demand is incredibly strong\". \nThe most popular destinations among their holidaymakers were Mediterranean hotspots such as Spain and Greece, the company said.\nHays Travel said in a statement: \"There's huge optimism from our customers who are booking for the popular destinations - about a quarter of our bookings are for Spain this summer - and also for once-in-a-lifetime holidays.\"\nBut one business said the government's new plans would not change its own decision not to sell holidays at all this summer.\nOperator On The Beach had said in May it would not be selling holidays for June, July and August this year. The firm reiterated that decision in the wake of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps' announcement. \nSpokeswoman Zoe Harris told the BBC: \"We welcome the decision, it's a step in the right direction... but these amber destinations can still go back to red. \n\"And it's not just our government restrictions. The governments in the countries we travel to are looking closely at how they manage tourism, we'll see what the response is from those tourist destinations to see when its the right time for us to start selling July and August holidays again.\" \nMr Shapps told the BBC the government was working towards extending the exemption to arrivals from those vaccinated in other countries, provided the vaccine had been approved by the World Health Organization, but said that this was complicated because other countries used different systems. \nHe suggested EU arrivals may be the first to be able to bypass the quarantine system: \"It's easier from the EU because they're creating their own digital passport, it's more complicated from other countries.\" He said the US had 50 different systems for each state. \nMr Shapps said he hoped to give more detail in a couple of weeks. \nHe also warned holidaymakers to expect additional queues when checking in for flights home: \"Before you board a plane you would need to show you have completed your passenger locator form, that you have carried out a pre-departure test, that you have got your test booked for day two and all of that needs to be checked by the carrier - the airline usually - before you travel.\n\"So the place to expect queues is the airport you are coming from. Once you get back to the UK all of that is starting to be automated.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe NHS Covid contact-tracing app used in England and Wales could be made less sensitive to cut the number of people asked to self-isolate for 10 days. The app detects how long users are in proximity, alerting those who spend more than 15 minutes within 2m (6ft 6in) of someone who later tests positive. However, ministers are considering a change after the number of alerts rose from 16,000 to 360,000 a week during June. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has told BBC Breakfast: \"We will make sure the app is constantly reviewed so it's appropriate for the period of time we're living through, particularly as we're getting to a majority of adults having been double-vaccinated.\"\nThe overall risk of children becoming severely ill or dying from Covid is extremely low, according to a new analysis of infection data. Data from the first 12 months of the pandemic in England shows 25 under-18s died from Covid, putting the overall risk of death at around two in a million children, scientists estimate. Those living with chronic illnesses and neuro-disabilities were most at risk.\nThe UK economy grew by 0.8% in May, as coronavirus restrictions eased to allow pubs and restaurants to serve indoors, official figures show. This marked the fourth consecutive month of growth but it was a slower rate than analysts had expected, the Office for National Statistics says. Economy growth is still 3.1% below pre-pandemic levels, it adds.\nUK councils face a \u00a33bn black hole in their budgets as they emerge from the pandemic, a BBC investigation reveals. Some local authorities are said to be struggling to carry out statutory duties - such as provision of social care or planning control - and at risk of bankruptcy. Read the full report.\nSunshine breaks finally beckon, for some people at least. There's been a surge in demand for flights and holidays, following the decision that fully vaccinated travellers returning to England from amber-list countries will not have to self-isolate after 19 July. Airlines say there's been a rapid rise in ticket sales for those destinations, with EasyJet saying bookings were up 400%.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\n... you can remind yourself of all the rules around travelling abroad.

      "tags": "Terminal illness,Justin Tomlinson",
      "text": "Terminally ill people with less than a year to live will get fast-tracked for benefits after ministers said they will expand the timeframe for those eligible for special consideration.\nPreviously patients had to prove they had less than six months to live and charities say many died without their cases being resolved. \nIt is two years since a government review was launched into the issue.\nCampaigners say it is a \"significant step forward\". \nThey have been seeking a change to how terminally ill people access benefit support, known as Personal Independence Payments (PIP). \nUnder the current rules, patients in England and Wales must provide medical proof that they have six months or less to live to access benefits quickly and at a higher rate.\nAnd if they live longer than three years after benefits are awarded, they have to be reassessed. \nCharities and some MPs say people have endured distress trying to wade through red tape, filling in forms and attending interviews with benefits advisers.\nAnd some patients have died waiting for the welfare benefits they need.\nHelen Nicell, who has stage 4 cancer, told the BBC her payment was reduced initially when she was moved from disability allowance to PIP because a doctor could not say she was likely to die within six months.\nShe said: \"To have to ask your consultant - do you think I may only have six months to live -  when really they can't answer that, it's a very, very difficult question and very difficult to live with. \n\"The consultant said it was actually impossible to put a prognosis on how long it would take.\n\"The cancer is in my spine and at any point it could spread in to one of my organs\" she said. \nShe added: \"When you have retired from work and you have a budget and you have no other income\" the uncertainty of waiting for an assessment to come through is very hard.\nIn a written statement to MPs,  Minister for Disabled People, Justin Tomlinson, said the changes will \"increase much needed support for people who are nearing the end of their lives\".\nHe said the new 12-month approach \"will ensure people get the financial help they need as quickly as possible in the most challenging of times.\"\n\"Under the updated rules, clinicians still have discretion and will be supported by a realistic and straightforward definition\" he added.\nIn an interview with BBC News, Mr Tomlinson said under the special rules, payments can be made within four to five days rather than 16 weeks.\nHe said the changes will bring the benefits system in line with the NHS definition of terminal illness, which is having less than twelve months to live.\n\"What clinicians were telling us was about removing duplication\", he said.\n\"The GP and the patient would have this devastating awful conversation at 12 months as part of the NHS role and then they would have to come and have it a second time with us to get the GPs the [benefits] form at six months\". \nMatthew Reed, Chief Executive of Marie Curie welcomed the announcement as a \"significant step forward\", and a \"tribute to all those who bravely shared their experiences of the benefits system\".\n\"This will help ensure that more dying people can concentrate on making the most of the limited time they have left, rather than worrying about their finances. \n\"There is more to be done, but this is important progress and we look forward to working with the UK Government to bring in this change as quickly as possible\", he said. \nSally Light, CEO of the Motor Neurone Disease Association said the recommendations \"must be implemented quickly\".\n\"No more people already facing the most difficult time of their life [should] have to wait to claim the support they not only desperately need but are entitled to\". \nThe changes will not happen immediately - ministers say the law will be changed within 12 months \"when parliamentary time allows\". \nThe reforms  in England and Wales follow similar pledges in the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland and Scotland.  \nLast week the Stormont Assembly signalled it intended to scrap the six month rule for those with terminal illnesses.  \nAnd in 2019, Holyrood said it intended to do the same, with guidelines for clinicians due to be published this summer."

      "text": "Lebanon's two main power plants were switched off on Friday, plunging much of the country into a near-total blackout.\nThe shutdown - caused by the two plants running out of fuel - worsens a crisis that has seen people receive just two hours of electricity a day.\nA lack of foreign currency has made it hard to pay overseas energy suppliers.\nPharmacies have also gone on strike over medicine shortages caused by the failure to pay foreign importers.\nLebanon's two biggest power stations, Deir Ammar and Zahrani - which together provide about 40% of the country's electricity - shut down on Friday, their owner Electricite Du Liban (EDL) said.\nShips loaded with gas oil had refused to offload the fuel before money was transferred to their owners' accounts in dollars.\nIn the eastern city of Zahle, EDL asked residents to reduce their consumption to a minimum, saying the \"power supply has been cut across Lebanese territories indefinitely\".\nAs the BBC's Sebastian Usher notes, swathes of the country are now facing water rationing as well. The pumping stations are powered by diesel, and lack the supplies they need to function.\nLebanon has suffered a severe economic crisis over the past 18 months, and its currency - the Lebanese Pound - has collapsed to record lows.\nSome local healthcare companies have already run out of medicines needed to treat cancer and heart disease.\nPharmacies closed their doors on Friday in protest at the shortages.\nThe association of pharmacy owners announced a \"general open-ended strike across Lebanon\", claiming 80% of stores in the capital Beirut were shut.\nThe failing economy has left half the population living in poverty and prompted mass protests, demanding the removal of a political elite accused of corruption and negligence.\nCarine Torbey, BBC News, Beirut\nPower cuts are not unusual in Lebanon - the country hasn't had 24/7 electricity for decades. \nState-generated power was rationed, and people filled in the gaps by plugging in to a parallel system of private generators. \nToday, it wasn't just a gap. For the first time, the entire grid went offline, and the private generators became the only source of power. \nBut they too are under pressure. They run on diesel, which is hard to find, and they simply don't have the capacity to completely replace state electricity. On top of this, they have become very expensive, and thus unaffordable for a lot of people. \nThis means that most people in Lebanon are currently facing long hours of total blackout. \nLebanon is currently facing financial and economic collapse. It's hard for the people here to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Literally. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Department for Transport,Grant Shapps,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fully vaccinated UK residents arriving in England from amber travel list destinations will no longer have to quarantine from 19 July.\nHowever, they will still need to pay for Covid tests before and after their return, the transport secretary said.\nGrant Shapps told MPs that under-18s returning from amber list places would also be exempt from quarantine.\nTravel industry leaders said the change was a \"positive step\" but called for the amber list to be expanded.\nCurrently, anyone returning from countries on the amber or red list must isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccine status. \nMr Shapps said a full vaccination means \"14 days have passed since your final dose of the vaccine\" - and only vaccines given by the NHS will count. \nBut he said officials were \"working to extend our approach to vaccinated passengers from important markets and holiday destinations, later this summer, such as the United States and the EU\".\nNorthern Ireland plans to adopt the change from 26 July, while both Scotland and Wales have said they will consider whether to follow the same rules.\nUnder the change, fully-jabbed people travelling from amber list countries will still be required to take a test three days before they return and on the second day after they are back - but they will now be exempted from a day eight test.\nMr Shapps told MPs: \"In essence, this means that for fully vaccinated travellers the requirements for green and amber list countries are the same.\"\nHe also said that, from 19 July - the day when most Covid rules in England are due to end - the guidance that people should not travel to amber list countries will be removed.\nBut he cautioned that \"an amber list country could still turn red\", meaning hotel quarantine would become a requirement. \nAll of England's 19 July rule changes are due to be confirmed on 12 July after a review of the latest data.\nFewer than 30 destinations are on the green list - meaning travellers do not have to self-isolate when they get back to the UK, while more than 50 countries are on the strictest red list, which requires arrivals to pay to self-isolate in a hotel.\nBut most places - including holiday hotspots such as mainland Spain, Greece and the US - are on the amber list. \nThe next review of the countries on the green, red and amber lists will take place on 15 July.\nSpeaking later, the transport secretary told the BBC: \"We had the choice of simply saying people would never be able to travel until every single last person had been vaccinated - or at least starting to open things up.\"\nMr Shapps said testing was \"important to keep people safe\" and prevent variants arriving in the UK, but denied the requirements would continue to price-out many families.\nOn Thursday evening, the government website was listing nearly 400 providers carrying out the tests fully vaccinated travellers would need to take on their return. Prices begin at \u00a32.49, with the majority in the \u00a350-\u00a3100 range.\nThe Foreign Office, which issues travel advice that is independent from the government's traffic light system and could affect travel insurance, is stressing that not all amber countries will be approved for international travel on 19 July. \nHowever, it has updated its approved list and it now has several amber list countries including France, Greece, Morocco, Switzerland, the US, Jamaica and mainland Spain.\nFor the first time in a while, travel bosses are relatively pleased. \nToday's announcement is a big change, opening up international travel far more significantly that has been possible this year. However, there are limitations.\nThis policy only applies to those jabbed in the UK, meaning those jabbed abroad will still have to quarantine if coming from an amber list country. \nThat will affect some family and friends hoping to reunite and impact on businesses that rely on international visitors who won't see those customers return in the same numbers as UK travellers will leave.\nTests are still required from green and amber list countries. The cost will dissuade some from travelling.\nCrucially, this rule is just about what happens when people travel to the UK. Whether other countries will let UK travellers in is a different matter altogether.\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, the industry body representing UK-registered carriers, said the rule change was a \"positive move towards the genuine reopening the sector has been looking for\".\nJohn Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow, welcomed the change but said: \"The UK should open up travel to fully vaccinated people from more countries - particularly our key partners in the US - by the end of July.\"\nHowever, MP Caroline Lucas - vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said the government was \"in danger of repeating the same mistakes that allowed the Delta variant to take root in the UK\".\nKatherine Wood, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, will not get a second jab until the end of August and told the BBC the government changes were frustrating for young people who had already sacrificed a \"huge amount\" during the pandemic.\nThe 26-year-old said: \"They should have waited until the vast majority of people, particularly young people, had been double-vaccinated before changing any rules because I really feel quite disenfranchised by what's happened.\"\nThe traffic light system sets the rules travellers must follow on their return. But holidaymakers also need to check their destination's entry rules.\nFor example, all non-vaccinated travellers to mainland Portugal need a negative Covid test, and must quarantine for 14 days. Twelve to 17-year-olds travelling with fully vaccinated parents don't have to quarantine but need a negative test. Under-11s are exempt.\nOnly fully vaccinated adults can travel to Malta, and do not need a negative test. Children aged five to 11 can travel with fully vaccinated adults, but need a negative test. Under-fives don't need a test. Unvaccinated 12 to 17-year olds can't enter. \nOver-12s travelling to Spain need a negative test or proof of vaccination. \nUnvaccinated travellers can only enter France for \"essential reasons\", and must self-isolate for seven days. Fully-vaccinated adults with a negative test can enter. Under-18s travelling with fully vaccinated adults don't need to self-isolate.\nEarlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that in addition to relaxing the rules around isolation for travellers, the government was considering a \"more proportionate and balanced approach\" to isolation for Covid contacts.\nIt comes amid fears that surging cases will lead to millions of people being asked to self-isolate during the summer, even if they have been fully vaccinated.\nThe requirement for double-jabbed people to isolate after contact with a positive case is due to end on 16 August, four weeks after the majority of England's Covid rules are set to end, to allow more people to be vaccinated.\nMr Sunak acknowledged there was \"frustration\" at how the NHS contact tracing app could continue to order the double jabbed to isolate.\nDr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, urged people to continue using the app - saying it had helped to detect about 500,000 cases to date - but told the Commons Public Accounts Committee work was being done to \"tune\" it to operate within the vaccinated population so it was there \"for a purpose, not for annoyance\".\nNearly 65% of the adult population in the UK have received two jabs, and 86% have had a first dose.\nA total of 32,551 new UK coronavirus cases were announced on Thursday - up very slightly on Wednesday and taking the total number of positive tests in the pandemic above five million. There were also 35 more deaths. \nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "tags": "Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government,Local Government Association,Local government",
      "text": "UK councils face a \u00a33bn black hole in their budgets as they emerge from the pandemic, a BBC investigation into their finances can reveal.\nSome local authorities were struggling to carry out statutory duties and were at risk of bankruptcy, a local government expert said.\nAnd 10 councils have asked to borrow \u00a3300m of emergency money from the government to plug financial holes.\nThe government says it has handed councils \u00a312bn during the pandemic.\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said: \"In the coming months, we will take stock of the demands faced by councils and the resources available to meet them and will decide on the timetable for future funding\u202freform.\"  \nThe spokesman claimed there were a small number of councils that were \"in severe financial distress such as Croydon and Slough due to poor leadership and chronic financial mismanagement, long predating the pandemic. \n\"These councils have badly let down their residents.\"\nAnalysing 170 upper-tier and single tier councils in the UK the BBC Shared Data Unit found:\nSavings will see the threshold for which disabled or elderly individuals can receive care raised, bus services scrapped and children's centres closed in parts of the UK.\nFees and charges for parking, planning and crematoria are set to rises in places.\nIn the London borough of Bexley, 264 staff posts will be deleted, while library opening hours and road repairs will be reduced.\nSharon Taylor, a Labour councillor who chairs the Local Government Association's resources board, said the pandemic had highlighted an existing funding crisis brought about by a reduction in central government grants - a fall of up to 70% over ten years in some places.\nShe said \"Cuts to local government hurt people and they hurt the everyday services people see when they walk outside their door.\"\nCouncil budgets have been stretched for some time, but for many the pandemic has exacerbated the problem. It's increased the amount local authorities have had to spend on supporting their communities, and at the same time hit income streams hard.\nThis new BBC analysis lays bare the scale of the challenge facing councils across the UK, and spells out some of the cuts to services planned for this year - as well further shortfalls predicted. \nWestminster and the devolved governments have provided extra money, which has been welcomed by local authorities. But what many in the sector really want is a new, more sustainable way of funding councils and the services they provide - not least social care. The government has promised reform; for local authorities it can't come too soon.\nSince the start of the pandemic, councils have been asked to provide extra services, such as home food deliveries for those shielding, finding accommodation for street sleepers and, in some cases, helping with the test and trace initiative.\nThey have also had to supply workers with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). But, at the same time they have seen income from things such as town centre parking, council tax and business rates plummet.\nIn many cases, councils have also lost revenue from private investments. Authorities in Luton, Manchester and the West Midlands part-own airports, where passenger flights have been largely grounded during the pandemic.\nCroydon Council, which borrowed \u00a3545m to make a series of investments including a shopping centre and a hotel, saw the latter go into administration in June 2020. The authority effectively declared itself bankrupt in November 2020. \nBetween 2016 and 2020, councils invested more than \u00a37.6bn into commercial properties, a third of which were retail properties, according to the National Audit Office.\nMs Taylor said the government had encouraged councils to invest in commercial property to raise funds.\nShe said: \"[It] seems to have a very ambiguous attitude towards that now, and is saying those investments were down to us and if we've lost income they are not going to make up for those losses.\"   \nChair of the public accounts committee Dame Meg Hillier MP said some councils had made \"risky choices\" at the expense of the taxpayer.\nBut she also said the committee was generally critical of the MHCLG policy and its \"lack of understanding about councils' exposure to risk\".\nLast week, Slough Council issued a Section 114 notice, becoming the third council in four years to effectively declare itself bankrupt.  \nThe authority was one of 9 in England to have applied for a capitalisation direction, an emergency measure allowing a council to either borrow money to cover losses or to move funds from its building programme to fund day-to-day expenses.\nAround \u00a3290m is to be issued to councils, all of which will have to be repaid over a period of time.\nCroydon Council asked for the most support from the scheme - worth \u00a3120m over the next two years. \nNottingham City Council, which placed its power company, Robin Hood Energy, into administration in January,  is set to borrow \u00a335m.  \nOther councils seeking financial support are Wirral, Peterborough, Bexley, Eastbourne, Luton and Copeland. \nRedcar and Cleveland said it had sought a government grant following a ransomware attack by hackers which affected its computer network.\nIn Croydon, residents said they were feeling the effects of council cuts.\nEarlier this year, the residents of Regina Road said they had so much black mould in their council-owned properties it was a risk to their health. Others said they went days without electricity, or burst pipes that spilled sewage into living spaces.\nMonths before, in November, the council had issued a section 114 notice, limiting itself to only essential spending, as it seeks to make \u00a345m of cuts.\nSome residents were not able to find graves at a cemetery as the reduction to grounds maintenance had allowed the grass to grow over the headstones, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nElizabeth Ash, a Croydon resident of 25 years and part of a campaign to stop the council closing five libraries, said the state of services was causing some people to consider moving out of the south London borough.\n\"The graffiti services have all but stopped now,\" she said. \"There's been a proliferation of tagging on people's properties. All of these things have a knock-on effect in the community.\"\n\"We don't have money to waste but it keeps getting wasted. The residents have to live with the fallout from it.\"\nCouncillor Hamida Ali, leader of the council, said she was \"serious about tackling (the) financial situation, improving how Croydon is run and providing good value services for residents\".\nArianna Giovannini is deputy director of the Local Governance Research Centre (LGRC) based at De Montfort University.\nShe said the pandemic had \"deepened regional inequalities\" - particularly in England - by pushing financially burdened councils into further difficulty.\nShe said: \"The pandemic has forced councils to think the unthinkable.  We are in a position where some councils are struggling to continue to deliver just the statutory services.\" \nAn MHCLG spokesperson said: \"We've given councils over \u00a38.9bn in response to specific pressures from the pandemic - that's over \u00a32bn more than they told us in the detailed reporting they have provided that they spent last year to tackle Covid-19. We have already provided \u00a33bn in additional funding for this year.\"\nThe Welsh government said it had provided councils with \u00a31.4bn to ensure services did not bear the brunt of the financial impact of the pandemic. \nThe Scottish government said its support package totalled more than \u00a31.5bn.\nA spokesman said: \"However, our ability to go further in supporting the recovery is limited and our calls to the UK Government for additional fiscal powers have so far gone unheeded.\"\nThe Northern Ireland Executive said it had provided an additional \u00a385m of funding to councils, adding that it considered the financial situation of local authorities to be \"generally satisfactory\".\nReporting team: Paul Lynch, Alex Homer, Sam Ferguson and Pete Sherlock\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nFor more information on methodology, click here.

      "text": "Bookings for flights and holidays have surged after the decision that fully vaccinated travellers returning from amber-list countries will not have to self-isolate after 19 July.\nAirlines said there was a rapid rise in ticket purchases within hours after the government announced it was relaxing quarantine rules on Thursday.\nEasyJet said bookings to amber-list destinations increased by 400%.\nDespite suggestions prices could rise, analysts thought this unlikely.\nThe need to quarantine on return to the UK has hindered the travel industry's recovery from the pandemic, with many people choosing not to holiday abroad.\nUnder previous rules, those returning to Britain from its top holiday destinations - Spain, France, the US and Italy - all had to self-isolate for up to 10 days.\nThe travel agents' association, Abta said the industry was \"very much led by supply and demand\", so prices could rise as more people booked after the rule change.\nBut consumer group Which? said previous research found holiday prices before and after government green-list announcements \"stayed the same or went down, not up\".\nIt said that so far, prices had not increased to popular destinations on the amber list.\nOut of 14 package holiday prices and six flights to Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal it tracked departing during the peak holiday season in last August, 12 packages remained the same price and two increased.\nFour of the six flights rose in price, although the average fare increase was \u00a37. \nRory Boland, Which? Travel Editor, urged people to take news of surging prices \"with a pinch of salt\". \nEasyJet said flight bookings from the UK to amber-listed countries had surged 400% following the government's announcement on Thursday, adding that holiday bookings were more than 440% up on the previous week.\nAlicante, Malaga, Faro, Nice and Corfu are among the top destinations for flights this summer, the airline said.\nJohan Lundgren, easyJet chief executive, said Europe had \"now turned green for the double-jabbed\".\nHe urged the government to \"remove expensive testing\" for fully vaccinated people travelling to green and amber-list destinations \"as we do not want to see a return to flying being a preserve of the rich\".  \nBritish Airways said \"within a couple of hours\" of the government's announcement, it witnessed a 96% increase in the number of views on its website compared with Wednesday last week.\nA spokesperson for Tui told the BBC the tour operator had seen a \"surge in website visits showing demand is incredibly strong\". \nThe most popular destinations among their holidaymakers were Mediterranean hotspots such as Spain and Greece, the company said.\nHays Travel said in a statement: \"There's huge optimism from our customers who are booking for the popular destinations - about a quarter of our bookings are for Spain this summer - and also for once-in-a-lifetime holidays.\"\nBut one business said the government's new plans would not change its own decision not to sell holidays at all this summer.\nOperator On The Beach had said in May it would not be selling holidays for June, July and August this year. The firm reiterated that decision in the wake of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps' announcement. \nSpokeswoman Zoe Harris told the BBC: \"We welcome the decision, it's a step in the right direction... but these amber destinations can still go back to red. \n\"And it's not just our government restrictions. The governments in the countries we travel to are looking closely at how they manage tourism, we'll see what the response is from those tourist destinations to see when its the right time for us to start selling July and August holidays again.\" \nMr Shapps told the BBC the government was working towards extending the exemption to arrivals from those vaccinated in other countries, provided the vaccine had been approved by the World Health Organization, but said that this was complicated because other countries used different systems. \nHe suggested EU arrivals may be the first to be able to bypass the quarantine system: \"It's easier from the EU because they're creating their own digital passport, it's more complicated from other countries.\" He said the US had 50 different systems for each state. \nMr Shapps said he hoped to give more detail in a couple of weeks. \nHe also warned holidaymakers to expect additional queues when checking in for flights home: \"Before you board a plane you would need to show you have completed your passenger locator form, that you have carried out a pre-departure test, that you have got your test booked for day two and all of that needs to be checked by the carrier - the airline usually - before you travel.\n\"So the place to expect queues is the airport you are coming from. Once you get back to the UK all of that is starting to be automated.\""

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has defended his decision to withdraw military forces from Afghanistan, saying that US operations will end on 31 August.\nThe fourth US president to oversee the war also defended the speed of the US withdrawal, saying it saved lives.\nMr Biden's speech comes as the Taliban militant group continues to seize territory around the country.\nUS forces have fought in Afghanistan for nearly 20 years, following the terror attacks of 11 September 2001. \nEarlier this year, Mr Biden set a 11 September 2021 goal of withdrawing all US troops. \nDonald Trump had agreed with the Taliban to pull out US troops by May 2021, but that deadline was pushed back by Mr Biden after he took office in January.\n\"Just one more year of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution,\" Mr Biden said in a White House speech, \"but a recipe for fighting there indefinitely.\"\nHe also denied that a Taliban takeover is \"inevitable,\" saying that the Taliban force of approximately 75,000 fighters is no match for the 300,000 Afghan security forces.\nEven after the total pull out is complete, the US is expected to keep 650 to 1,000 troops in Afghanistan to guard the US embassy, Kabul airport, and other key government installations.\nRecent polls have shown broad US support for leaving Afghanistan, with Republican voters more sceptical of the decision to withdraw.\nMr Biden also said that efforts are being made to get translators, interpreters and other Afghans that worked with the US government out of the country. He said 2,500 special immigrant visas have been issued to allow them to come to the United States, but only half have come so far.\nSenator Biden and Vice-President Biden believed the US should get out of Afghanistan. Now President Biden is Commander-in-Chief. \nHe was at pains to say support for Afghanistan wouldn't stop, but even more adamant that both Afghan politicians and security forces had the capacity to prevent a Taliban takeover. \"Will they do it?\" he asked. \nThat's what Afghans have asked - repeatedly - in the midst of continuing disarray and disunity in Kabul, and the dramatic Taliban advance in the districts. \nThe president's emphasis on speaking out for women and girls isn't heard in districts already under Taliban control where they're not going to school. \nAs a president who's known to study all the scenarios, he made it clear \"it's highly unlikely\" there will be a unified government, and not much the US could do, or should do, if Kabul collapses. That's up to Afghans - and the countries next door.\nLast month, Mr Biden assured Afghan leaders at a White House meeting that US aid will continue.\nThe vast majority of remaining foreign forces in Afghanistan have left ahead of the US 11 September deadline, leaving the Afghan military completely in charge of national security.\nPresident Ashraf Ghani insists that Afghan security forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but there have been reports of thousands of Afghan troops seeking refuge in other countries to avoid the fighting.\nEarlier in the week, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC that the group was not responsible for the recent increase in violence.  He insisted that many districts had fallen to the Taliban through mediation after Afghan soldiers refused to fight.\nUS-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US that triggered the invasion. However, it has gradually been regaining territory in recent years."

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Air travel,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Travel agents, airlines and tour operators want clarity from the Scottish government on travel rules as England prepares to open up.\nThe UK government has announced an end to the ten-day quarantine period for fully vaccinated passengers and children in England from 19 July.\nThe Scottish government has responsibility for quarantine rules north of the border.\nBut it has not yet said whether it will follow the same approach. \nWithout similar changes in Scotland, there have been concerns that people will travel to airports in England to avoid restrictions.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she is \"carefully considering\" what to do, with an announcement expected to be made next week.\nNorthern Ireland will follow England in removing quarantine rules for fully vaccinated people travelling to and from amber list countries from 26 July, while Wales - like Scotland - has not yet decided whether to do the same. \nTravel businesses have called on the Scottish government to adopt a four nations approach to the issue.\nKaren Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, told BBC Radio's Good Morning programme she believes there is no reason why Scotland's airports should be operating differently from other parts of the UK.\nShe said: \"Aviation is a global industry and we have shown we can do this safely. We can follow the same rules and get going again.\n\"We have said to the government we need a risk-based approach. We can bring that risk down to something we think is proportionate.\n\"We simply cannot carry on with closure. If we want connectivity to be restored which is really important to Scotland's economy we have to get going again.\"\nShe added: \"Absolutely what will happen is that Scots will fly from English airports. We can't make decisions without considering what our neighbours are doing. Decisions shouldn't be taken in isolation, we need at the very least a four-nations approach.\"\nAdults will no longer have to quarantine for 10 days on return from an amber-list country, if they were fully vaccinated in the UK.\nThey will still need to pay for a test three days before returning to England, and a PCR test two days after arriving. There will no longer be a test on day eight.\nThey will have to prove they were vaccinated at least 14 days previously.\nChildren under 18 will no longer have to self-isolate. Children aged 10 and under will not have to take a test before departure for England. Those aged four and under will not need to take a test two days after arrival.\nFully-vaccinated passengers returning to Northern Ireland will no longer need to quarantine from 26 July (if the plans are confirmed on 22 July). Under-18s, participants of clinical trials and those with medical advice against vaccines will be treated as being fully vaccinated. \nScotland and Wales have yet to say whether they will follow these changes.\nSince the announcement by UK Transport minister Grant Shapps earlier this week, travel agents, airlines and tour operators say interest in holidays to amber list countries has soared.\nJaqueline Dobson, president of Barrhead Travel, said she was disappointed the Scottish government did not taken similar action at the same time to open up travel for Scottish holidaymakers\nShe said: \"Our English counterparts - industry and holidaymakers - are getting ready to make plans from 19 July, but once again Scotland is left in limbo. \n\"These plans were tentatively announced in June so we have to ask, why is this still under consideration?\n\"Given the lack of clarity for Scottish arrivals into England, there is also a significant risk that Scottish holidaymakers will begin to depart and arrive from English airports which will have huge long-term effects on our airports.\" \nJoanne Dooey, president of The Scottish Passenger Agents' Association (SPAA), said Scottish travel agents and travellers need to know that Scotland will swiftly follow suit.\nShe added: \"We continue to raise the question of travel certification and how Scotland will deliver a scheme to allow the public to provide proof of vaccination status in order to fly to other countries. \n\"Currently English travellers can use the NHS app to prove their certification status and this integrates with the EU Digital COVID Certificate (EUDCC) which gives digital proof of a traveller's vaccination, testing and recovered from COVID-19 status.\n\"The Scottish government needs, as a matter of urgency, to tell us what stage, if any, the development of a Scottish app is at.\"\nShe said Scots who wish to travel currently have to apply for a paper certificate, but argued that the country needs to be operating at the same level as other countries which have developed and are already using the technology.\nDuring Thursday's coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said she would \"carefully consider\" whether Scotland would follow England in allowing double-vaccinated travellers to return from about 140 amber list countries without having to quarantine. \nThe first minister said: \"We will look carefully at the statement that's been made in the UK, and we'll come to a decision on that fairly soon in terms whether or not that will apply to people returning to Scotland.\"\nMs Sturgeon said she was not ruling anything out at this stage but stressed that the situation in Scotland remains fragile and the government needed to be careful.\nScotland has seen soaring infection levels in past weeks but Ms Sturgeon said on Thursday that the rate of new cases was slowing down.\nScotland registered 2,802 confirmed cases on Thursday and a further four deaths following a positive test.\nOn Friday Health Secretary Humza Yousaf announced that 100 additional contact tracing staff would support Scotland's Test and Protect system, after recent reports that the system was under pressure during a surge in cases."

      "title": "Sarah Everard: Met Police chief will not resign over vigil scenes",
      "text": "The Met Police chief has said she is not considering her position, after the force was criticised over its handling of a vigil for Sarah Everard.\nOfficers handcuffed women and removed them from crowds on Clapham Common in London on Saturday.\nCommissioner Cressida Dick said she was \"more determined\" to lead the Met.\nThe home secretary has commissioned an independent investigation into the force's decisions, which were taken in the light of Covid restrictions.\nSources said both Priti Patel and the prime minister had confidence in Dame Cressida.\nDame Cressida said she agreed on the need for a \"sober review\" and defended how officers responded to the \"really big crowd\".\n\"Quite rightly, as far as I can see, my team felt that this is now an unlawful gathering which poses a considerable risk to people's health,\" she said.\n\"I don't think anybody who was not in the operation can actually pass a detailed comment on the rightness and wrongness... This is fiendishly difficult policing.\"\nShe added: \"What has happened makes me more determined, not less, to lead my organisation.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said Ms Patel had commissioned the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), to \"conduct a lessons learned review in to the policing of the event\".\nIn a statement on Sunday night, he said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the scenes on Clapham Common and that Dame Cressida had \"committed to reviewing how this was handled\".\nHe will chair a meeting of the government's crime and justice taskforce on Monday to \"look at what further action we need to take to protect women and ensure our streets are safe\".\n\"The death of Sarah Everard must unite us in determination to drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to protect and defend them,\" he added.\nEarlier, Ms Patel said she had read a report from Dame Cressida about Saturday night's events, but \"questions still need to be answered\". \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan had also called for an investigation, describing police actions as \"unacceptable\".\nMr Khan said he had spoken to Dame Cressida and the deputy commissioner, and that he was \"not satisfied with the explanation they have provided\".\nIn a statement posted on Twitter, he said he wanted HMIC to conduct a \"full independent investigation of events\" - and the Independent Office for Police Conduct to \"investigate the actions of police officers\".\nAn official vigil planned on Clapham Common - near where Ms Everard was last seen alive on 3 March - had been called off earlier on Saturday after organisers Reclaim These Streets said police had failed to \"constructively engage\" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way.\nMr Khan added that he had asked police to work with organisers so that the vigil could go ahead.\n\"I received assurances from the Metropolitan Police last week that the vigil would be policed sensitively. In my view, this was not the case,\" he said.\nMartin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, tweeted that he would \"bring all police chiefs together\" on Monday to discuss \"what more we can do to better protect women\".\nReclaim These Streets urged mourners not to go to Clapham Common on Saturday after it called off the official vigil, asking them instead to light candles and shine other lights on their doorsteps at 21:30 GMT - to coincide with the time that Ms Everard was last seen.\nBut several hundred people gathered there to pay tribute to the 33-year-old - whose death has prompted a public debate over women's safety - despite Covid restrictions.\nIn a letter to Dame Cressida, posted on Twitter on Sunday, Reclaim These Streets accused the Met chief of putting those who attended \"at a serious health risk through a lack of Covid-safe marshalling\" and \"at risk of being manhandled, fined and arrested\" by officers.\nThe group said it believed the Met had misrepresented a High Court ruling on Friday, when a judge refused to say the event would be permitted under coronavirus regulations.\nIt recognised that the police faced \"unprecedented challenges\", but called on Dame Cressida to work with organisations and suggested it may still take \"further legal action\".\nAmong those who attended Saturday's vigil were members of Sisters Uncut. The group also held another event outside New Scotland Yard on Sunday -  which it said was to remember Ms Everard and demonstrate against broader \"police brutality\".\nOne video posted online on Saturday showed officers removing women who were standing by the bandstand. \nCries of \"shame on you\" and \"let them go\" could be heard from onlookers. The video showed them being put in a police van and driven away.\nPolice said four arrests were made at the vigil to \"protect people's safety\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the scenes were \"deeply disturbing\", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called for Dame Cressida to resign.\nDelivering a statement in the early hours of Sunday, Met Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said hundreds of people were \"packed tightly together\", posing a risk of transmitting Covid-19.\n\"We absolutely did not want to be in a position where enforcement action was necessary. But we were placed in this position because of the over-riding need to protect people's safety,\" she said in a statement.\nJamie Klingler, from Reclaim These Streets, said the event would have been \"a lot safer\" if it had been held officially, adding the group had 50 stewards who were \"trained and ready to go\". \nThe group added in a statement that it was asking Dame Cressida \"to meet us urgently\" to explain the actions taken by police. \nLabour's shadow domestic violence minister, Jess Phillips, said the force had \"got it wrong at every single turn\".\nVictims Commissioner for England and Wales Dame Vera Baird QC said there was no real prospect of police successfully intervening in the crowd, describing the circling of the bandstand as \"quasi military\".\nConservative MP Caroline Nokes, who chairs the Commons Women and Equalities Select Committee, tweeted: \"In this country we police by consent - not by trampling the tributes to a woman who was murdered and dragging other women to the ground. Badly misjudged by #metpolice.\" \nOn Sunday, people continued to visit the bandstand on the common to pay their respects to Ms Everard. \nThe BBC's Emily Unia, who has been at the scene, said there had been a \"steady stream\" of people visiting who had laid flowers and lit candles and stopped for a \"moment of reflection\". \nOn Saturday, Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with Ms Everard's kidnap and murder.\nMr Couzens was remanded in custody to appear again at the Old Bailey on 16 March.\nHave you been affected by any of the issues raised?

      "text": "Paul Holland has seen some upheavals in his life over the past year, but his music collection of vinyl albums and CDs has helped him to get through tough times.\n\"It's been massively important,\" the 35-year-old from Bracknell in Berkshire told the BBC.\n\"It's always there, always accessible when you need it. That's why I like having physical copies.\"\nPaul's collection actually straddles two continents at the moment - he has about 100 albums in the UK, but the rest are in Portland, Oregon. \nThat's because, after living in the US since 2015, he moved back last year, at the height of the pandemic, following the breakdown of his marriage to an American woman.\n\"We're still in touch, but it didn't work out,\" he says, adding that his ex-wife is still taking good care of his records.\nPaul is one of many BBC News website readers who got in touch with us following the news that supermarket giant Sainsbury's has decided to stop selling CDs and DVDs.\nAlthough streaming has replaced buying records for many people, others would never part with their collections and are still adding to them whenever they can.\n\"I can't imagine a world where media is not in your hands and not yours. Films, albums and TV shows are removed from streaming services all the time,\" says Paul.\nHe has a varied selection of albums, including Otis Redding and David Bowie, but also \"a lot of rock and heavy metal\".\nHis favourite album is Black Sabbath's first: \"It's got the heavy bits if you want to shake your head, but also quieter songs as well - there's a bit of light and shade.\"\nSome music collectors have quite specialised tastes. Kathryn Kyle, 29, from Carlisle, loves buying CDs and DVDs, but by just one artist, a Japanese rock band called D.\nThat means she scours the internet for import releases, which she buys from Japanese websites or from online fan communities.\n\"Though my family and colleagues don't understand the draw to these physical copies, I love the way CDs look, and I love opening them up, reading the leaflet and pamphlets inside,\" she told the BBC.\n\"It's an expensive hobby, for sure, but I can't help that feel that something could go wrong with digital services and having something physical is a reliable back-up.\"\nKathryn, who works in a building society, says she got into the band through listening to the music from Japanese video games and anime films.\n\"I've just moved house and I've bought a bookshelf for my CDs,\" she says.\nBut she adds that her housemate doesn't share her musical tastes. \"She's into vinyl and she listens to country music. Frankly, I would rather cut my ears off!\"\nRetired market researcher Leslie Sopp, 68, of Brill in Buckinghamshire, has let go of his old vinyl albums, but still has a collection of 850 CDs to which he adds regularly.\n\"My son took over the vinyl mantle,\" he told the BBC. \"He works in the music industry, so he cherry-picked my records with my permission.\n\"CD has given me a real benefit, because it allowed me to downsize the volume while maintaining a physical collection.\"\nEven so, he admits that he misses the artwork and lyric sheets that come with LPs: \"I can't read lyrics on CD inserts.\"\nLeslie says his collection contains \"smatterings of everything\", but his main interests are electronica, ambient and above all jazz, with a special fondness for Keith Jarrett and other artists on the ECM label.\nHowever, he also listens to music digitally with a Spotify account and buys new CDs after checking them out on the streaming service.\n\"Storage is an issue,\" he says. \"I have one big piece of furniture to hold them and the rest are in plastic storeaway boxes.\n\"It's all out of sight, but I've got it all on a spreadsheet, so I know where everything is.\"\nHowever, not all music fans believe in owning physical copies of their favourite tunes. And whereas you might think that younger people prefer streaming and older listeners want CDs or vinyl, that's not always the case.\n\"I am passionate about vinyl. I loathe it with a passion,\" says Tony Neal, a 69-year-old civil servant from Fareham in Hampshire.\n\"I spent a small fortune in the 1970s building a top-end hi-fi system to play my records and the quality was impressive, but there was always that click and crackle to spoil the experience,\" he told the BBC.\n\"The gear is still in the loft, never to be used again, along with the records that now sound so much better when streamed. I am now fully digital.\"\nThese days, Tony has Bluetooth speakers scattered around the house and listens to his music on Spotify. \nHe says that getting involved with sound recording for amateur dramatic productions has taught him to be \"picky\" about what he listens to.\n\"It's been years since I last bought a CD and playing old vinyl is a pain,\" he says. \"Streaming is so much more convenient and the quality is so much better.\n\"I've heard things listening to streaming on headphones that I've never heard on the original recordings back in the 1960s and 1970s. It's the clarity and depth of the stream.\""

      "text": "Supermarket giant Sainsbury's says it has decided to stop selling CDs and DVDs as streaming services take their toll on sales of the products.\nA spokesperson said Sainsbury's customers increasingly went for music and films online instead of buying the shiny silver discs.\nThe firm said sales were being phased out, although it would continue to sell vinyl records in some stores.\nCD sales have shrunk in the past decade but were still worth \u00a3115m last year.\nOther big supermarkets show no sign of following Sainsbury's lead, with larger branches of Tesco, Asda and Morrisons still stocking a range of CDs and DVDs.\n\"Our customers increasingly go online for entertainment, so earlier this year we took the decision to gradually phase out the sale of DVDs and CDs, so that we can dedicate extra space to food and popular products like clothing and homewares,\" Sainsbury's said.\nThe decision is another sign that the CD, once the dominant means of buying and selling recorded music, is long past its heyday.\nWith sales hit first by the MP3 music file, then by streaming services such as Spotify and Deezer, the silver disc is now seen as unfashionable in many circles.\nWorse still, the format that it was designed to kill off, the vinyl record, has enjoyed a resurgence, with UK sales climbing to 4.8 million last year, bringing in revenue of more than \u00a386m.\nThat was still well short of the money brought in by CDs. But according to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the value of record sales in 2021 is expected to surpass that of CDs for the first time since the late 1980s.\n\"The CD has proved exceptionally successful for nearly 40 years and remains a format of choice for many music fans who value sound quality, convenience and collectability,\" said a BPI spokesperson.\n\"Although demand has been following a long-term trend as consumers increasingly transition to streaming, resilient demand is likely to continue for many years, enhanced by special editions and other collectible releases.  \n\"If some retailers now see the format as less of a priority, this will create a further opportunity for others, such as independent shops and specialist chains such as HMV, to cater to the continuing demand.\"    \nMusic industry observer Graham Jones points out that supermarkets have always carried a very limited selection of CDs, with an emphasis on big names such as Ed Sheeran.\nBut as his book Last Shop Standing makes clear, the supermarkets could still make life difficult for record shops, especially by undercutting them on price.\nIn one chapter, he recounts an incident from 2008, when a shop in the East Midlands found that rather than ordering copies of the latest Coldplay CD from the record company, it was cheaper to buy them on special offer from Morrisons and Asda and resell them.\nHowever, such incidents are unlikely to be repeated these days.\n\"Sales of CDs are slowing down, so I can understand why Sainsbury's are pulling out, really,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Vinyl is incredibly fashionable and the CD has gone out of fashion.\n\"A lot of indies [independent shops] may be stocking less CDs than they used to, but they're still selling. There's this myth that the CD is completely dead.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe number of Covid-19 infections in the UK has risen by more than 50% in the week to 3 July, according to the Office for National Statistics. Its latest data from swab tests in the community suggests one in every 160 people has the virus, up from one in every 250 in the previous week. Meanwhile, the NHS Covid contact tracing app used in England and Wales may need to have its sensitivity reduced when restrictions are lifted in England, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has confirmed.\nPassengers returning to England from abroad could face peak-time airport queues of up to six hours when travel rules are eased, a union has warned. Bookings for flights and holidays have surged after the announcement fully jabbed residents coming back from amber list countries will no longer need to quarantine from 19 July. The Immigration Service Union says the \"sheer number\" of passengers and a shortage of Border Force officers would slow down checks. However, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has highlighted  the travel company apps being developed to cut queues. Meanwhile, travel businesses have launched legal action against the government over how it takes decisions on Covid travel rules. Remind yourself of the rules for travelling to green, amber and red list countries.\nTravel agents, airlines and tour operators are calling for the Scottish government to adopt the same international travel rules as England. The Scottish government can make its own rules but has not yet said whether it will follow the same approach. Without similar changes in Scotland, there have been concerns that people will travel to airports in England to avoid restrictions. An announcement is expected next week. Northern Ireland will follow the same rules as England from 26 July, while Wales has not yet decided whether to do the same.\nBoxer Tyson Fury has tested positive for coronavirus, meaning his much-anticipated third fight against Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas on 24 July has been postponed. A source close to Fury told BBC Sport the WBC world heavyweight champion was \"deeply frustrated\". Wilder's manager Shelly Finkel said: \"Deontay is disappointed.\" Fury tested positive on Thursday and after discussions with medical experts the fight was called off. It is likely to be rescheduled for October.\nAs the Llangollen International Eisteddfod begins in Wales this weekend, organisers have said the pandemic has forced it to modernise. The festival will be held digitally this year, with competitions and concerts streamed across the world. Organisers said digital components could feature more prominently in the eisteddfod's future. But one of the main attractions this year is a 60m (200ft) patchwork fabric artwork displayed on the town's bridge. Commissioned by the festival, artist Luke Jerram's Bridges, Not Walls \"represents Wales and the countries that usually attend the Eisteddfod\".\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAs coronavirus cases rise we look at how many people are deleting the contact tracing app.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "A man who missed England's semi-final win over Denmark so he could donate stem cells has been given tickets to the final. \nSam Astley, from Sedgley in the West Midlands, instead watched the Euro 2020 match from his hospital bed as he prepared for a procedure on Thursday.\nHe has been praised by the Anthony Nolan Trust and Gary Lineker. \nEuro 2020 sponsor Vivo is providing him with final tickets which he will collect on Friday after his discharge.\nMr Astley said it was \"unbelievable\" to be seeing England v Italy in the final. \nHis partner, Beth Hill, said he had also been offered a room in the Dorchester hotel so he could stay in London until Sunday's match.\nThe smartphone manufacturer responded to calls on Twitter from Lineker and football fans trying to find Mr Astley tickets to Sunday's match as a thank you.\nMr Astley, who works for Yamazaki Mazak in Worcester, said the response to his story had been \"crazy\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, he said missing the donation had not been an option, despite his girlfriend winning tickets to the Denmark match.\nHe said the chance to watch England in a semi-final would have been fantastic, but he quickly recognised donating stem cells was \"more important than any football game\" and he never considered delaying the procedure.\n\"I am obviously pleased it has taken off, because we have managed to spread awareness for the great charity Anthony Nolan so hopefully more people will sign up to their register,\" he said.\n\"I think because it has been such a crazy 24 hours I think it has really helped with my recovery and the adrenaline has kept me going.\"\nHe said he did not know who would be receiving his stem cells, but it was expected to be a child. \nThe appointment to donate the bone marrow had been made six weeks ago, after he signed up to be on the Anthony Nolan Trust's register at a football tournament organised by his partner's friend Simon Wilkes, Stourbridge News reported.\nHe said: \"Simon suffers from a form of blood cancer himself so [he] invites Anthony Nolan to the charity events and encourages as many people as possible to sign up to the register.\"\nMr Astley's partner Beth Hill, who has been working as a critical care nurse with coronavirus patients for the past 18 months, could not go either, after a colleague tested positive, forcing her to isolate.\nShe said: \"I am just so proud of him, he literally is a lifesaver and a modern day hero, it is amazing what he is doing.\" \nBut Mr Astley said she was the \"real hero\" and her work during the pandemic had been a \"big influence\" on his decision to become a donor. \nMr Astley's step-mother, Angie, who works for Telford and Wrekin Council in Shropshire, said she was \"bursting with pride\". \nThe procedure Mr Astley underwent on Thursday involved the removal of bone marrow containing stem cells from his hip bones. \nMs Hill said he was recovering well in hospital and had been told by the anaesthetist that he had woken up singing It's Coming Home.\nIn a tweet, the 24-year-old also thanked Gary Lineker for his support and for \"all the wonderful messages\".\n\"Sam has shown us all what a true hero he really is, by putting his own once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see England play at Wembley aside, to give someone with blood cancer or a blood disorder their best chance at survival and we simply cannot thank him enough,\" Anthony Nolan Trust's chief executive Henny Braund said.\nIn a statement, Vivo said it wanted to thank Mr Astley for \"his selfless lifesaving donation\" and had arranged for him and his girlfriend to attend the final as its guests. \n\"We hope that both of them enjoy the experience,\" it added.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Coronavirus testing,NHS,Self-isolation,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The NHS Covid contact tracing app used in England and Wales may need to change as coronavirus restrictions change, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.\nEngland ending the 1m-plus rule on 19 July may mean the app's sensitivity needs to be reduced, he said.\nThe app detects the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes.\nIt comes amid a huge rise in alerts as infections surge.\nThe system allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test.\nUnder current rules, those who receive an alert are asked to stay at home for up to 10 days, although the Department of Health said the app \"is, and always has been, advisory\" - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace.\nCoronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July but the requirement to self-isolate if you have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears that millions of people would be asked to self-isolate this summer as people mixed more.\nThe hospitality industry and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge.\nOne possible solution could be to change the sensitivity of the app, so it would tell people to self-isolate only after closer and more prolonged contact.\nBut sources at the app developers told the BBC they have not yet been asked to do this, although they are planning a change from 16 August when people would be able to record that they were fully vaccinated to turn off the self-isolation countdown timer.\nMr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: \"As our restrictions change, of course the app needs to change. Things like replacing the 1m-plus rule on 19 July might well lead to a review of the way the app itself needs to function.\"\nBut he said the app was still \"very important as one of the tools in our armoury\". He said there were still large numbers of people downloading it and said he had not seen any data showing people were deleting it.\nThe most recent figures for the last week of June show an extra 300,000 downloads, bringing the total to more than 26 million, but it is not known how many people are active users.\n\"It's in our interests as a society to carry on doing the things that protect each other,\" Mr Shapps said.\nTechnically, it wouldn't be very difficult to tweak the app to make it less \"sensitive\" - the hard bit is working out exactly what those tweaks should be.\nCurrently, two phones with the app installed, exchange a digital handshake, via bluetooth, every five minutes. It registers how far apart they are, and for how long.\nIf one of those phones then goes on to report a positive Covid test, other phones who were two metres away or less, for a duration of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are likely to receive an isolation alert.\nAs we have learned more about the virus, other factors have also been incorporated such as how infectious the person was likely to have been at the time the two phones were in close proximity.\nChanging those parameters would be straightforward.\nBut fundamentally it's the volume of cases which are driving the volume of isolation alerts, not the app itself. In the last week of June there were 356,000 alerts, triggered by 61,000 positive test reports - that's about six app users isolating per Covid case. \nWhen you look at it like that, it doesn't sound so excessive.\nAnd because of the app's focus on privacy nobody, including the government, the police and the NHS knows who has been \"pinged\" - making it legally unenforceable.\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned about the possible changes, saying weakening the app would undermine the track and trace system the government had spent billions on.\nHe said: \"This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea.\"\nA Downing Street source stressed people were still being encouraged to self-isolate if they got an alert, adding the Department of Health's statement that the app was advisory was consistent with the government's message to \"act cautiously, especially as we know cases will rise\".\nDr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday she was \"aware that people are choosing not to use the app\" when asked about concerns people have been deleting it to avoid being \"pinged\".\nHinting at a change, she added there was \"work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk\".\nA source close to Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC \"we are looking at the sensitivity of the app\" and pointed out the sensitivity had been changed before.\nBut they did not say exactly what would change. At present, if two phones running the app are close for long enough, and one of the two users later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert.\nYou can also use the app to \"check-in\" to venues so you can be notified of any positive cases you may have encountered there, although the requirement to check-in will be lifted in England when lockdown rules ease further on 19 July.\nA total of 496 venue alerts - which use the check-in data to alert people to potential contact with a positive case - were sent between 24 June and 30 June.\nBut alerts for people coming into close contact with someone testing positive soared by more than 60% in the last week of June to 360,000.\nAt the end of May, there were only 16,000 alerts in a week.\nA BBC analysis has estimated 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate between this week and 16 August, as the number of infections continues to rise.\nThe NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations and separate test-and-trace programmes.\nOn Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged there was \"frustration\" at how the NHS contact tracing app could continue to order the double jabbed to isolate.\nProf Sir Jonathan Montgomery, a healthcare law expert from University College London who advised the government on the initial launch of the app, said it could still be useful but the government needed to issue new guidance.\n\"The real reason we shouldn't abandon the tool is because so many transmissions of Covid happen before people realise they are unwell,\" he told Times Radio.\n\"What the app does is enable you to be careful, and what the government needs to say is 'what does care look like in the new world?'.\"\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the country was \"moving to a system of testing rather than self-isolation\".\n\"I rely on the NHS app, as many people do,\" he said. \n\"I know how difficult it has been for people and I'm sorry for the hassle that people experienced as a result of this - it is coming to an end.\"\nA further 32,551 new coronavirus cases were recorded on Thursday, alongside another 35 deaths within 28 days of a positive test."

      "text": "Met Police officer Wayne Couzens has pleaded guilty to the murder of Sarah Everard.\nThe firearms officer snatched her as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham on 3 March, driving her away in a car he had hired.\nThe 33-year-old's body was found a week later in woodland near Ashford, Kent, metres from land owned by Couzens. She had been raped and strangled.\nCouzens, 48, will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 29 September.\nMet Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick was in court when Couzens pleaded guilty.\nSpeaking outside the Old Bailey, Dame Cressida said she felt \"sickened, angered and devastated\" by his crimes.\nShe added: \"They are dreadful and everyone in policing feels betrayed. \n\"Sarah was a fantastic, talented young woman with her whole life ahead of her and that has been snatched away.\"\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct said on Friday that a total of 12 gross misconduct or misconduct notices had so far been served on police officers from multiple forces in relation to the Couzens case, including about the handling of two separate claims that Couzens had indecently exposed himself.\nProsecutor Tom Little QC told the court that Couzens and marketing executive Ms Everard had been \"total strangers to each other\".\nOn the night Ms Everard was snatched, she and Couzens were seen on camera standing by his hire car.\nIt was parked on the pavement with its hazard lights flashing.\nCouzens drove them out of London to Tilmanstone, near Deal in Kent. Investigators were able to track the route he took using CCTV and identified the driver through the car hire firm.\nThe police constable had made the booking in his own name, picking up the Vauxhall Astra on the afternoon of the abduction and returning it the next morning. He was arrested on 9 March, only minutes after he had wiped the data from his mobile phone.\nIn Court 12 of the Old Bailey five members of Sarah Everard's family sat listening as police officer Wayne Couzens pleaded guilty to her murder. \nOn video-link from Belmarsh Prison he kept his head down and was shaking slightly. \nAs the barrister representing Couzens said his guilty plea was a sign of his remorse and the burden he would have to bear, Sarah's mother raised her hands. \nIt seemed as if she was saying that wasn't much comfort now.\nThe Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick was also in court. Her force caught the murderer, only to discover it was one of her own officers. \nQuestions remain for the Met Police.\nIn his police interview, Couzens said he had got into trouble with a gang of Eastern Europeans who threatened him and his family. \nThey demanded he deliver \"another girl\" after he had underpaid a prostitute a few weeks before, the firearms officer said.\nHe claimed he kidnapped Ms Everard, drove out of London and handed her over to three men in a van in a layby in Kent, while she was alive and uninjured.\nMeanwhile, police found out that Couzens and his wife owned a small patch of woodland in Ashford.\nPhone data led officers to the site and Ms Everard's body was found just outside the property boundary the day after Couzens' arrest.\nOn Friday, Couzens' defence barrister told the court his client's admission of murder \"represents a truly guilty plea and remorse for what he did and, as he put it to us this morning, he will bear the burden for the rest of his life - his words - 'as I deserve'.\"\nJudge Lord Justice Fulford - who before adjourning the case discussed legal precedents for whole-life prison sentences - told the court: \"This has been a mammoth investigation which has produced some very significant results in terms of being able to understand what happened.\"\nSpeaking after the conviction, the Crown Prosecution Service's Carolyn Oakley said: \"Wayne Couzens lied to the police when he was arrested and to date, he has refused to comment. \n\"We still do not know what drove him to commit this appalling crime against a stranger.\n\"Today is a day to remember Sarah and our thoughts remain with her family and friends.\""

You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result.\nEach UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: \nWhen people test positive for coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include:\nIf you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms.\nScotland\nFrom 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. \nInstead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test.\nEngland\nFrom 16 August, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advised to take one PCR test as soon as possible. \nAs long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action.\nWales\nSimilar changes will happen in Wales from 7 August. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not.\nNorthern Ireland\nMinisters in Northern Ireland are expected to discuss changes on 12 August. \nAny adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts.\nAnyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. \nThe NHS Covid app is available to download in England and Wales. \nIf you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a \"ping\" alert if they later test positive for Covid. \nYou need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. \nNorthern Ireland and Scotland have separate apps. \nIf you are \"pinged\" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days.\nGovernment ministers have said it is \"crucial\"  that people self-isolate when sent an alert.\nHowever, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led to many users deleting the app.\nCurrently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time.\nHowever, the app will soon only alert close contacts from the previous two days before the positive test.\nThe sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate.\nIn the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before.\nIn England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated. Sectors include energy and emergency services.\nSupermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status.\nA similar system is being launched in Scotland.\nA \u00a3500 grant is available in England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, many applications have been turned down.\nIn Scotland people can apply for the Self-Isolation Support Grant, worth \u00a3500, and there is a similar scheme in Wales. In Northern Ireland a discretionary payment is available.\nYou may also be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay, which is worth \u00a396.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,David Frost,Brexit",
      "text": "The UK's Brexit minister has described negotiations with the EU over the Northern Ireland Protocol as \"a little tense\" at the moment.\nLord Frost appeared in person at Stormont's Executive Office committee on Friday.\nHe said the UK and EU needed to find a \"new balance\" to ensure problems with the protocol's implementation were resolved.\nBut he said elements of the protocol were also currently \"working well\".\nLord Frost's evidence to the committee came just a week after the EU's chief negotiator gave evidence to the committee.\nAppearing before the committee, Lord Frost repeated that the government is preparing to publish its plans for the future of the protocol in the next fortnight, before Parliament rises for the summer recess.\nHe said the EU had still not responded to 12 papers tabled by the UK.\nThe EU has said a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement for Northern Ireland, in which the UK continues to follow EU agri-food rules, could be a solution, but it has been rejected by the UK.\nLord Frost accused the EU of being unreasonable in responding to some of the UK's concerns.\n\"Their solution is 'why don't you adopt our rules, then there won't be a problem'. We're accused of being ideological but it seems to me, equally ideological to say 'why don't you just adopt our laws?'\"\nHe said there were possible resolutions but that \"getting politics in the right place seems to be difficult\".\n\"It is a little tense at the moment. Nobody wants that but the protocol issues are at the core.\n\"There is a big prize if we can get this right, it does need both sides to take the situation seriously and fix the problems that currently exist,\" he added. \nThe protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports.\nIt was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020.\nLord Frost helped to negotiate the protocol on behalf of the UK government, but previously said it was not being implemented as he intended.\nUnder the terms of the Brexit withdrawal treaty, the protocol can only be removed by a majority vote of the Stormont Assembly, with a vote due in 2024.\nCommittee chairman, the SDLP's Colin McGrath, said the government needed to \"own your deal\" and work to develop pragmatic solutions.\nSinn F\u00e9in's Pat Sheehan put it to Lord Frost that political problems with the protocol were being \"completely overblown\" and that a majority of businesses in Northern Ireland were supportive of the protocol.\nThe minister replied that GB-NI trade opportunities had changed and in some cases, disappeared, and that was not what the government had \"wanted to achieve\" when delivering Brexit.\n\"Nobody that I've spoken to from a wide range of political and civil society, businesses, nobody thinks it's working perfectly as it should, or have suggested improvements,\" he added.\nEarlier on Friday, Lord Frost had met business representatives from Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade, and other business leaders.\nFormer DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the government needed to recognise that the protocol had no support from any unionist parties at Stormont.\n\"You and the EU have overridden consent and now want majority rule. What are you going to do to restore the balance of consent?,\" she asked.\nLord Frost said he had \"a good deal of sympathy\" for that argument.\n\"The consent mechanism is an albeit imperfect way of allowing the institutions here to say, looking at all these variances it's working tolerably, or looking at them all, it's not working,\" he added.\n\"If you don't have a fairly broad consent at most points, this is not simply something about in four years' time - you need to have broad consent to make it workable and that's why it worries us so much that we don't have it.\nUlster Unionist vice-chair of the committee, John Stewart asked Lord Frost to explain what any \"rebalancing\" of the protocol would look like.\nLord Frost said he would not reveal the details prior to a statement being made in Parliament, but added that the \"fundamental issue\" was finding a way to ensure goods could move from GB to NI in a \"freer way than possible\" at present. \nLord Frost's appearance at the committee comes just over a week after EU chief negotiator Maros Sefcovic gave evidence to MLAs about the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol.\nLast week, the EU agreed to a UK request to delay a ban on chilled meat products from Great Britain being sold in Northern Ireland. \nProducts such as chilled sausages were due to be prohibited from 1 July as a consequence of the protocol arrangement, but this has been postponed for another three months."

      "tags": "Haiti,Jovenel Moise assassination,Jovenel Moise,United States,Colombia",
      "text": "A group of 28 foreign mercenaries, including retired Colombian soldiers, assassinated Haiti's President Jovenel Mo\u00efse earlier this week, police say.\nAfter a gun battle in the capital Port-au-Prince, 17 were detained, some at the house they were using, others after entering Taiwan's diplomatic compound.\nThree suspects were killed by police and eight are still being sought.\nBloodied and bruised, arrested suspects were shown to the media on Thursday, along with a slew of seized weapons.\nIt is still unclear who organised the attack and with what motive.\nAlso unclear is who is in charge of the country. On Friday, a group of political parties added to that uncertainty by nominating a president, although how much legitimacy that has is unknown.\nThe attack took place in the early hours of Wednesday, when gunmen broke into the president's home in Port-au-Prince, shooting him dead and wounding his wife. Mr Mo\u00efse, 53, was found lying on his back with 12 bullet wounds and a gouged eye, according to authorities.\nMartine Mo\u00efse, 47, was seriously wounded and is in a stable condition after being flown to Florida for treatment.\nPolice said the hit squad included mainly Colombians, along with two Haitian-Americans.\nFound in the suspects' possession were firearms, sets of US dollar bills, the president's personal chequebook and the server that held surveillance camera footage from his home, Le Nouvelliste newspaper reported.\nTaiwan confirmed that 11 of the suspects were arrested after breaking into a courtyard at its compound.\nAngry civilians had joined the search for the gunmen, and helped police track down some who were hiding in bushes. The crowd set fire to three of the suspects' cars and destroyed evidence.\nPolice chief L\u00e9on Charles called for calm, saying the public should not take the law into their own hands.\nAt the news conference on Thursday, police showed reporters Colombian passports.\n\"Foreigners came to our country to kill the president,\" Mr Charles said, as the suspects sat on the floor behind him in handcuffs.\nColombia's government has pledged to assist Haiti with its investigation efforts.\nColombian police director, Gen Jorge Luis Vargas, said 17 former Colombian soldiers were thought to be involved.\nThe US state department, meanwhile, said it could not confirm if any of its citizens had been detained.\nHowever, US and Canadian media are reporting that one of the dual citizens arrested, James Solages, 35, is from Florida and was a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haiti.\nAn investigating judge told local media that Mr Solages and the other US citizen, named as Joseph Vincent, had said they were there as translators for the mercenaries, after finding the job on the internet.\n\"The mission was to arrest President Jovenel Mo\u00efse... and not to kill him,\" Judge Cl\u00e9ment No\u00ebl told Le Nouvelliste.\nThe US said on Friday it was sending FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials to Haiti following the nation's request for help in the investigation.\nMembers of Mr Mo\u00efse's security detail have been summoned before Haiti's courts to answer questions about its failures.\nColombian daily El Tiempo said that it had seen confidential documents that named the Colombian suspects. The paper's research suggests that four of them flew from Colombia to the Dominican Republic on 4 June.\nThey crossed by land from there into Haiti two days later. The two countries share the island of Hispaniola.\nAccording to El Tiempo, Colombian intelligence has seen photos posted on social media by members of the group, showing them posing at a popular tourist spot in the Dominican Republic.\nThe killing has triggered some civil unrest in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Americas. A state of emergency remains in force across the country, while the Dominican Republic has closed its border.\nThe situation has been unclear and is getting murkier.\nIn this particular situation, the constitution says the National Assembly should choose another president. But disputes meant that elections scheduled for October 2019 did not take place - and Mr Mo\u00efse had been ruling by decree amid widespread protests.\nAmendments to the constitution - not accepted by everyone - suggest the prime minister should be the next one to take over.\nBut Haiti has both an interim prime minister, Claude Joseph, and a new appointee, Ariel Henry, who has yet to be sworn in.\nBoth are claiming to be in charge.\nOn Friday, a group of political parties signed a resolution proclaiming a new president - Joseph Lambert - with Mr Henry acting as his PM.\nThe situation is doing little to resolve the political and economic instability that has long plagued the nation."

      "text": "The Taliban have captured major border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan in a sweeping offensive across northern Afghanistan, officials say.\nThe militants say they seized two key border towns - Islam Qala near Iran, and Torghundi bordering Turkmenistan.\nVideo footage appeared to show Taliban forces taking down the Afghan flag from the roof of a border customs office.\nThe Taliban are rapidly retaking land across Afghanistan as the US-led mission removes the last of its troops.\nTaliban officials say their fighters have taken control of 85% of territory in Afghanistan - a claim impossible to independently verify and disputed by the government.\nOther estimates have put the amount of territory the Taliban controls at more than a third of the country's 400 districts, including an arc of land from the Iranian border in the west to the frontier with China on the other side of the country.\nThe Americans earlier this week quietly departed from Bagram airfield, a sprawling base that was the centre of US operations in Afghanistan and once held tens of thousands of troops.\nAfghan officials acknowledged the loss of the Islam Qala and Torghundi border crossings, both in Herat province.\nThe Islam Qala crossing is one of the biggest trade gateways into Iran, generating an estimated $20m (\u00a314m) in monthly revenue for the government. The Torghundi border town is one of two trade gateways into Turkmenistan.\nAfghan forces are trying to recapture the two border crossings, a government spokesperson said.\n\"All Afghan security forces including the border units are present in the area, and efforts are under way to recapture the site,\" interior ministry spokesman Tareq Arian told the AFP news agency.\nZabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said the Islam Qala crossing was \"under our full control\".  \nReports said Taliban fighters had seized five districts in Herat without a fight. \nEarlier this week, more than 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces fled into Tajikistan, which lies north-east of Afghanistan, as the Taliban advanced around them.\nRussia on Friday said the Taliban had taken control of about two-thirds of the Afghan-Tajik border in a swift advance. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow was urging all sides in Afghanistan to \"show restraint\". \nThe reports came hours after US President Joe Biden defended his administration's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan after 20 years of war.\n\"I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome,\" Mr Biden said.\nHe admitted it was \"highly unlikely\" the Afghan government would be able to control the entire country. \nSome US intelligence analysts fear the Taliban could seize control of the country within six months, according to an assessment distributed to officials in June.\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani has insisted that Afghan security forces are capable of keeping the Taliban at bay, and Afghan forces appear to have retaken lost ground in some areas. \nAccording to officials, troops on Wednesday recaptured government buildings in the western city of Qala-e-Naw - the first major provincial capital entered by the Taliban in their latest offensive.\nUK Chief of Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter told the BBC's Today programme that one of three scenarios would likely unfold in Afghanistan. \nFirstly, the Afghan government could \"hold the ring, as it's demonstrating through holding all the provincial capitals at the moment\", he said. \n\"The second scenario I think is a very sad scenario, where the country fractures and you see the government collapse. You see the Taliban perhaps controlling part of the country, and the other nationalities and ethnicities controlling other parts of the country, like we saw in the 1990s,\" he said. \n\"A third, more hopeful, scenario, is where you actually see a political compromise and talks occurring. US operations in Afghanistan will officially end on 31 August, but the vast majority of foreign troops have already left.\"\nPeace talks between the government and the Taliban continue, but the talks have regularly stalled and failed to progress significantly.

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Boris Johnson,Self-isolation,Grant Shapps,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People should continue using the NHS Covid contact tracing app in England and Wales and isolate when asked to do so, Downing Street has said.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said the app had been an \"important tool\" and Boris Johnson continued to use it.\nThe software detects the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes.\nIt comes amid a huge rise in alerts as infections surge.\nThe latest government figures show UK infections are continuing to rise, with 35,707 Covid cases reported on Friday - the highest daily cases figure since 22 January. A further 29 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded.\nEarlier Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the app's sensitivity may need to change when the 1m-plus rule ends on 19 July.\nThe system allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test.\nUnder current rules, those who receive an alert are asked to stay at home for up to 10 days, although the Department of Health said the app \"is, and always has been, advisory\" - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace.\nCoronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July but the requirement to self-isolate if you have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears that millions of people would be asked to self-isolate this summer as people mixed more.\nThe hospitality industry and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said: \"A large number of the population continues to use the app and it has been an important tool in getting people to isolate and break the chain of transmission.\n\"It is important that people continue to isolate if they are asked to do so. We continue to ask people to isolate if they are asked to through the app.\"\nThe Welsh government has said people in Wales should continue to use the app even if social distancing rules differ from those in England. No date has been given for the end of the 1m-plus rule in Wales.\nOne possible solution could be to change the sensitivity of the app, so it would tell people to self-isolate only after closer and more prolonged contact.\nBut sources at the app developers told the BBC they have not yet been asked to do this, although they are planning a change from 16 August when people would be able to record that they were fully vaccinated to turn off the self-isolation countdown timer.\nMr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: \"As our restrictions change, of course the app needs to change. Things like replacing the 1m-plus rule on 19 July might well lead to a review of the way the app itself needs to function.\"\nThe most recent figures for the last week of June show an extra 300,000 downloads, bringing the total to more than 26 million, but it is not known how many people are active users.\n\"It's in our interests as a society to carry on doing the things that protect each other,\" Mr Shapps said.\nTechnically, it wouldn't be very difficult to tweak the app to make it less \"sensitive\" - the hard bit is working out exactly what those tweaks should be.\nCurrently, two phones with the app installed, exchange a digital handshake, via bluetooth, every five minutes. It registers how far apart they are, and for how long.\nIf one of those phones then goes on to report a positive Covid test, other phones who were two metres away or less, for a duration of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are likely to receive an isolation alert.\nAs we have learned more about the virus, other factors have also been incorporated such as how infectious the person was likely to have been at the time the two phones were in close proximity.\nChanging those parameters would be straightforward.\nBut fundamentally it's the volume of cases which are driving the volume of isolation alerts, not the app itself. In the last week of June there were 356,000 alerts, triggered by 61,000 positive test reports - that's about six app users isolating per Covid case. \nWhen you look at it like that, it doesn't sound so excessive.\nAnd because of the app's focus on privacy nobody, including the government, the police and the NHS knows who has been \"pinged\" - making it legally unenforceable.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned about the possible changes, saying weakening the app would undermine the track and trace system the government had spent billions on.\nHe said: \"This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea.\"\nDr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday she was \"aware that people are choosing not to use the app\" when asked about concerns people have been deleting it to avoid being \"pinged\".\nHinting at a change, she added there was \"work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk\".\nA source close to Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC \"we are looking at the sensitivity of the app\" and pointed out the sensitivity had been changed before - although they did not say what would change.\nAt present, if two phones running the app are close for long enough, and one of the two users later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert.\nUsers can also use the app to \"check-in\" to venues enabling it to notify them of any positive cases they may have encountered there -although the requirement to check-in will be lifted in England when lockdown rules ease further on 19 July.\nA total of 496 venue alerts - which use the check-in data to alert people to potential contact with a positive case - were sent between 24 June and 30 June.\nBut alerts for people coming into close contact with someone testing positive soared by more than 60% in the last week of June to 360,000.\nAt the end of May, there were only 16,000 alerts in a week.\nA BBC analysis has estimated 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate between this week and 16 August, as the number of infections continues to rise.\nThe NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations and separate test-and-trace programmes.\nProf Sir Jonathan Montgomery, a healthcare law expert from University College London who advised the government on the initial launch of the app, said it could still be useful but the government needed to issue new guidance.\n\"The real reason we shouldn't abandon the tool is because so many transmissions of Covid happen before people realise they are unwell,\" he told Times Radio."

Under previous rules, those returning to Britain from its top destinations, Spain, France, the US and Italy, all had to self-isolate for up to 10 days.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told the Commons, however, that Britons returning from amber list destinations would still have take a Covid-19 test before they arrive home and then a second test on or before day two.\nChildren under the age of 18 will not have to self-isolate, but will need to take tests. There is no change to red-list travel restrictions.\nHeathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: \"This is excellent news that will give a much needed boost to millions of people across Britain looking forward to a more normal summer and reuniting with family and friends abroad. \n\"But the job isn't done,\" he said, adding: \"The UK should open up travel to fully vaccinated people from more countries - particularly our key partners in the US - by the end of July.\"\nHe said Heathrow was \"working closely\" with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic to demonstrate this could be done safely, with checks on departure, and no need for delays at immigration on arrival.\nDame Irene Hays, boss of independent travel agent Hays Travel, told the BBC she was \"absolutely delighted\" by the move.\n\"I think it's a huge step in the right direction,\" she said, adding that it came at the right time for all those whose holidays had been cancelled last year and who had been \"sitting there with their fingers crossed\" hoping for good news.\nShe acknowledged that there were still \"some constraints\", especially involving testing, but advised would-be holidaymakers to have good travel insurance.\nSteve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2, said: \"This is the news that UK holidaymakers have been looking forward to, as it finally signals a meaningful restart to international travel.\"\nHe said his firm would restart flights and holidays to all amber-list destinations from 19 July onwards.\nShai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said the announcement was \"a positive development\" that provided \"assurance for consumers and businesses who can now book and travel with greater confidence\".\nGatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate described the new rules as \"another small step in the right direction\".  \n\"However, with summer holidays just around the corner, we are approaching a crucial time for our industry and we urge government to remove other barriers inhibiting international travel, including the need for costly PCR tests for those who have been double vaccinated,\" he added.\nBritish Airways chief executive and chairman Sean Doyle welcomed what he called a \"common-sense approach which is already working safely for many other countries\".\n\"But there is more work to do,\" he added.\n\"While the quarantine requirement for 'amber' countries is being lifted for fully vaccinated UK travellers, the government needs to quickly extend this to all vaccinated travellers, agree a reciprocal deal with the US, add more countries to the 'green' list and reduce the need for unnecessary, expensive tests.\"\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, said it was \"a positive move towards the genuine reopening the sector has been looking for\".\n\"We now urge the government to continue this momentum by adding many more countries to the green list next week and removing onerous testing requirements at its next review on 31 July, thereby opening up more non-quarantine travel to all.\"   "

      "tags": "Public sector,Social care,Pay",
      "text": "Frontline social care workers are being paid thousands of pounds less than other workers with equivalent skills, a charity claims.\nCommunity Integrated Care said teaching assistants and police community support workers have similar skillsets but on average receive \u00a37,000 more per year.\nIt is calling for an \"immediate and fair\" rise, saying the status quo is \"immoral\" and \"cannot be justified\".\nThe government said it was committed to improving the adult social care system.\nThe charity, one of Britain's biggest care providers, commissioned consultancy firm Korn Ferry to analyse public sector roles and compare pay rates. \nTheir report, Unfair to Care, puts support workers in the same skills league as healthcare assistants, police community support officers and senior classroom assistants. \nBut it also finds a large pay gap.\nFor example, support workers in England who assist people to live independently in the community are paid on average \u00a317,695 a year, the researchers found. \nBut other public sector roles, with equivalent scope, complexity and accountability pay on average \u00a324,602. \nThis rises to \u00a325,142, for equivalent roles in the NHS, the study found - a discrepancy of almost \u00a37,500 a year. \nThis leaves many social care workers living in poverty and is largely to blame for 112,000 unfilled vacancies in the sector, says the charity. \nLong hours, low pay and low recognition - a combination that makes it unsurprising that care providers struggle to find and keep staff.\nSupermarkets or shops often pay more. It angers care staff when they are described as low skilled and the new research underlines the complexity of the roles they take on. \nWorking at a care home is \"so much more\" than \"making tea and wiping bums\", care team leader Lucy Jantschenko says.\nThe 25-year-old, who works at a care home in Nottinghamshire, says workers also need the ability to be quick-thinking when things go wrong.\n\"Someone starts choking halfway through mealtime and you've got the nurse upstairs sorting out tablets, you're the only person there that can save them,\" she says.\nShe says all care workers \"make such a big difference every day\" but adds: \"Then some days I've had an awful day, I've got home, I've only made \u00a310.30 an hour when I could have been at Lidl stacking shelves for \u00a312.50 an hour.\"\nAimme Murray supports adults with learning disabilities and physical disabilities who have complex needs in Leicestershire.\nThe 22-year-old says the job requires her to \"be on the ball consistently\" - sorting out the right medication and liaising with GPs and family members are among her tasks.\n\"I get paid the minimum wage, not the living wage because that's higher than what I get paid,\" she says.\n \"If the pay isn't addressed and things don't change, I can't see many people staying in this job.\"\nThe researchers say their analysis demonstrates how the role of social care workers has changed in the past decade, \"as the sector increasingly supports people with highly complex health and care needs\".\nThese days, says the study, care workers must frequently : \n\"It is a matter of national shame that social care workers, who provide such an invaluable service to society, are in such desperate circumstances,\" says Community Integrated Care chief executive Mark Adams. \nThe charity is urging Boris Johnson to live up to a promise made when he first became prime minister, almost two years ago, to fix the crisis in social care once and for all.\nTo do that, the long-awaited reforms will need to address staffing, as well as how care is paid for in the long term.\nWith an ageing population and more adults under 65 living with disabilities, the pressures on the care system are increasing. It is propped up by many dedicated staff, who do a good job, but there is also care which is poor. \nExperts maintain that to ensure quality support for anyone who needs it, it will take a workforce that is well trained and properly rewarded for the difference they can make to people's lives.\nOonagh Smyth, chief executive of Skills for Care, the strategic body for workforce development in adult social care in England, warns that reform policies \"will not be successful unless they address the needs of the workforce\". \nFormer care minister Phil Hope, co-chair of Future Social Care Coalition, added that it was \"time for the government to respect, reward and regulate, to support all those on the forgotten frontline'. \n\"It has never been clearer that they warrant and deserve a fair deal.\"\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement the social care sector \"has been an essential and valued part of the front line response to the pandemic\".\nThe government has \"sought to protect the workforce and those receiving social care\", the statement said, by providing more than \u00a32bn for the sector including infection prevention and control measures and PPE.\n\"We are committed to the sustainable improvement of the adult social care system and, as set out in the Queen's Speech, we will bring forward proposals later this year to ensure every person receives the care they need, provided with the dignity they deserve,\" the statement added."

What was the sacrifice for? Because it's too high a price to pay.\"\nAsked for his response to Ms Aldridge, Gen Carter told the Today programme he \"absolutely\" understood \"where the bereaved come from\".\n\"All those who fought in Afghanistan can hold their heads up very high,\" he said.\n\"The British military was not defeated on the battlefield. They showed remarkable adaptability against a very cunning and nefarious opponent, and they showed phenomenal courage under great pressure.\n\"And, at the end of the day, we have prevented attacks like the one we saw from al-Qaeda on 9/11 ever occurring from Afghanistan in this intervening period, and I think there's no reason to suppose that that can't prevail.\"\nAt the height of the war, Nato had more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone.\nBut with both the US and UK withdrawing their troops from Afghanistan, violence has been rising and the Taliban are thought to now control more than a third of the country's 400 districts.\nOn Friday, Afghan officials said the Taliban had captured a major border crossing between Afghanistan and Iran.\nGen Carter said the Afghan army had made a strategic decision to withdraw from some rural parts of the country and concentrate forces on key urban areas.\nAsked if he thought the almost two decades spent there had been a success or a failure, Gen Carter said it was \"too early to judge\" - and he saw three possible scenarios that could play out.\n\"I think, first and foremost, the current Afghan government, with its very well-trained army, could hold the ring, as it's demonstrating through holding all of the provincial capitals at the moment,\" he said.\n\"The second scenario - a very sad scenario - is where the country fractures and you see that government collapse, the Taliban perhaps controlling part of the country and the other nationalities and ethnicities controlling other parts of the country, like we saw in the 1990s.\n\"Then I think there is a third, more hopeful scenario, which is where you actually see a political compromise and talks occurring. \n\"If the current Afghan government holds on for long enough and proves to the Taliban it can't be defeated, then I think the third scenario becomes ever more likely.\"\nAsked if the US and UK were abandoning their responsibilities by leaving, the general said both nations would maintain a \"diplomatic presence in Kabul for the foreseeable future\".\nHe added the current Afghan army was the best the country had ever had, and that Afghan government institutions, including the army, would continue to receive support in the form of international funding."

      "text": "The cost of Covid tests required as part of international travel to Wales has been criticised.\nThe Welsh government wants people to use specific NHS PCR tests with results fed directly into NHS Wales' system - costing \u00a388 for one test and \u00a3170 for two - but in England people can shop around and pay less than \u00a350 per test.\nTravellers have said it is \"unfair\" that people must pay more in Wales.\nThe Welsh government said prices for NHS tests were the same across the UK.\nThere is a fine of \u00a31,000 in Wales for using a private test provider instead.\nThe Welsh system also applies to travellers flying into and from an airport in another part of the UK before returning to Wales.\nThe Welsh government has advised people \"should only travel abroad for essential reasons\".\nHelen Flowers, 41, from Dinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan, said it was \"unfair\" that she could have to pay more for PCR tests after flying from Cardiff Airport than those living over the border and flying from Bristol Airport. \n\"It doesn't sit with me right, especially when the price they are quoting is significantly higher than choosing another company,\" said the finance worker.\nShe spotted the cheaper test prices over the border when considering travelling to Spain to visit her parents.\n\"I just think it's wrong,\" said Ms Flowers, who has postponed the trip until the Welsh government has eased its advice against non-essential overseas travel.\nMary Baldwin, 68, and husband Russell, 81, returned to Wales from Spain on Saturday, and they are now isolating at their home in Penperlleni, Monmouthshire.\n\"Why are we not having the same choice as English residents?\" Mrs Baldwin asked. \n\"I don't believe the Welsh public know about this. It's a lot of money.\"\nThe retired travel agent said she was \"furious\" that the choice available in England was not available in Wales. \n\"We need that cost to come down,\" she said.\nAs well as proof of a negative test prior to travel, overseas arrivals to Wales must also have proof that they have ordered \"NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect\" tests to be taken after their return, using a specific booking portal.\nThe tests cost \u00a388 for one for green list locations and \u00a3170 for two after a visit to amber list areas which also require people to self-isolate for 10 days.\nScotland uses the same system as Wales but travellers arriving in England and Northern Ireland can choose from dozens of third party suppliers, with some charging \u00a348 for one test and \u00a396 for a pair.\nThose arriving from amber list locations have to take two tests - one by day two and the other from day eight of their return - and must currently isolate for at least 10 days.\nIn England, people can also pay for a test after day five and, providing their Covid-19 result is negative, they would no longer have to remain in isolation under the UK government's Test to Release scheme. \nIt was announced on Thursday that, from 19 July, fully vaccinated UK residents arriving in England from amber travel list destinations will no longer have to quarantine. But they will still need to pay for Covid tests before and after their return. \nThe Welsh government is still considering whether to follow this move by the UK government.\nPCR (polymerase chain reaction) test swabs are sent to a laboratory for analysis.\nIn Wales, the NHS test results are \"sent directly into NHS Wales' systems\", according to the Welsh government's website.\nPeople cannot travel directly to Wales if they have visited or passed through a red-list country.\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"In order to enter the UK you must be able to show proof of a post-arrival test. \n\"Tests should be booked through the CTM web portal. \n\"CTM are the booking agent for NHS Test Trace Protect tests which are processed through the UK Lighthouse Laboratory network, they are not the test provider. \n\"The price for these NHS tests is the same across the UK. \n\"If you arrive in Wales without proof of a test booking, you could be fined \u00a32,000.\n\"If you arrive in Wales and have booked tests with a private test provider, you could be fined \u00a31,000.\""

If the DUP were doing what Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP are doing we would be called out on it.\"\nIn Mr Poots' letter to the ministers, he said any decision to take a judicial review would need to be taken by the executive as a whole.\nMs O'Neill, the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president, had accused the PSNI of being \"more interested in facilitating the bonfire than going into the site and doing their job to remove it\".\nAsked whether the legal action being taken by two Stormont departments was in breach of the ministerial code, she said: \"Any government ministers shouldn't have to take the PSNI to court to do their job.\"\nMs O'Neill said she had spoken to residents living in the area who felt \"under attack\" and said she believed the DUP leader and other unionist representatives should encourage community representatives to find an alternative location for the bonfire.\n\"I hope that common sense prevails, I hope we don't have disruption,\" she said.\n\"People are more than entitled to celebrate their culture but culture isn't bonfires and culture isn't other communities feeling under attack so I hope there's a peaceful weekend ahead.\"\nHundreds of Eleventh Night bonfires will be lit in loyalist communities across Northern Ireland over the weekend, most of them late on Sunday night, to usher in the main date in the Protestant loyal order parading season - the Twelfth of July.\nThe road on Adam Street on which the Tiger's Bay bonfire has been built is owned by the Department for Infrastructure.\nThe department has sought and secured the assistance of Belfast City Council (BCC) to remove the pyre.\nHowever, in order for council contractors to carry out the operation they need protection from the PSNI.\nThe police are refusing to do so, having made the assessment that an intervention would risk disorder, placing people, including children, congregating at the bonfire at risk.\nIn the letter, seen by the PA news agency, the ministers argued that the PSNI's refusal to act runs contrary to its statutory responsibilities under the Police (NI) Act 2000, namely to protect life and property, preserve order, prevent the commission of offences and bring offenders to justice.\nOn Friday evening, former boxer Carl Frampton, who grew up in Tiger's Bay, said bonfires played a \"big part in a lot of people's cultures and traditions here\" and that \"all cultures should be respected\".\nHe said that because of the row about the bonfire this week, \"you'd be forgiven for thinking\" this year was the first time one had been built at that location.\nHe remembered \"helping to build and watch the bonfire being lit on that exact spot\" as a young boy.\nHe said that \"attacks on neighbouring communities\" were \"wrong and need to stop\"."

      "text": "Covid vaccines are highly effective in people with underlying health conditions who were advised to shield earlier in the pandemic, real-world UK data reveals. \nThe study of more than a million people in at-risk groups shows two doses of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines are needed for this protection. \nBeing double-jabbed reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%.\nOne dose cut it by about 60%, says Public Health England (PHE).\nIt takes a couple of weeks for the protection offered by a second to kick in. \nProtection against hospitalisation and death in at-risk groups is expected to be greater than protection against symptomatic disease, as has been seen in studies of the general population, although more data is needed to confirm this. \nThe preprint study findings also cover a time period when the Alpha, or UK, coronavirus variant was dominant, rather than the Delta one, which is behind most infections occurring now. \nBut experts are increasingly confident that existing vaccines still work well against Delta. \nDr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: \"This real-world data shows for the first time that most people who are clinically vulnerable to Covid-19 still receive high levels of protection after two doses of vaccine.\n\"It is vital that anyone with an underlying condition gets both doses, especially people with weakened immune systems as they gain so much more benefit from the second dose.\"\nIn the study, one dose of vaccine was, on average, only 4% effective in people with weakened immune systems. Efficacy increased to 74%, however, after two doses.\nThe charity Blood Cancer UK says much more data is needed to assess vaccine efficacy in different groups of people who are immunocompromised. \nChief Executive Gemma Peters said: \"The study states that vaccine response is lower in the immunocompromised, and there are too few immunocompromised people to draw confident conclusions. Also, there are a wide range of health conditions that weaken people's immune systems, and it is unhelpful to make generalised conclusions.\n\"Our advice to people with blood cancer remains the same. While there is a lot of uncertainty, there is enough reason to think the vaccines may not work as well for some people with blood cancer to continue to be cautious even after having both doses.\""

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The delay to ending quarantine for fully vaccinated contacts of people with Covid could lead to millions being asked to self-isolate this summer. \nThe knock-on for the economy and workplaces, including the NHS, could be huge, ministers are being warned.\nThe government says close contacts who are double-jabbed will not have to isolate after 16 August in England.\nBut BBC analysis shows more than 4.5 million people could still be asked to self-isolate between now and then. \nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Keir Starmer accused Boris Johnson of \"ignoring the next big problem that's heading down the track\" as he said \"millions\" would have to self-isolate as cases rose.\n\"It won't feel like freedom day to those who have to isolate, when they're having to cancel their holidays, when they can't go to the pub or even to their kid's sports day,\" he said.\nMr Johnson said the country was \"moving to a system of testing rather than self-isolation\".\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said the system was already causing \"carnage\". And chief executive Kate Nicholls added the government's plans did not go \"far enough, quickly enough\".\nHospital bosses have also expressed concern.\nNHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said: \"Trust leaders know self-isolation requirements are an ongoing source of frustration for some staff, particularly amongst those who have had both vaccinations, tested negative and want to support their colleagues at a time when there is very high pressure on staffing levels. \n\"There is a major risk that this situation will become more challenging after 19 July when all remaining restrictions are lifted, with the expectation that even more NHS staff will have to self-isolate as community infections rates spike. This is a real current cause of concern amongst trust leaders.\"\nA conservative guess is that we might see 1.5 million cases in the four weeks after 19 July - that would be just over 50,000 cases a day on average. \nAbout three close contacts have been identified for every Covid case reported, according to Test and Trace figures for England in the last month.\nSo, 1.5 million cases, each with about three contacts, gives us between four and five million contacts who might be asked to isolate between 19 July and 16 August.\nAnd, once restrictions are lifted on 19 July and society opens up further, we might expect to see the numbers of contacts to rise.      \nThis is a very rough calculation. The true figures could, of course, be lower or even higher. \nBut it's looking increasingly clear that millions of people will be close contacts of people with coronavirus and legally required to self-isolate in the weeks before England changes the rules.\nSo why are we doing it? Clearly there is a risk scrapping the self-isolation policy would push up the infection rate.\nThe hope is in another month the rise in cases will have peaked and the change would not be as risky.\nEngland is seeing close to 25,000 cases a day on average with cases doubling every 10 days.\nAnd with the remaining restrictions - such as social distancing, limits on the gatherings and the need to wear masks - set to be lifted on 19 July, ministers have warned the public they need to be braced for very high infection levels.\nOn Tuesday Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned there could be as many as 100,000 cases a day.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has conceded the plan to keep self-isolation requirements in place after the end of other restrictions in England was \"not a perfect solution\".\nHe added: \"You can't have it both ways. On the one hand we're saying we want to reopen but we're giving a measure of precaution in terms of delaying the lifting of self-isolation restrictions.\n\"It's a balance, it's not a perfect solution.\"\nUnder-18s, who are not currently entitled to the vaccine, will also no longer be required to self-isolate from 16 August if they are close contacts of a confirmed Covid case in England. \nOther parts of the UK are also seeing rising rates, which will mean many people will be asked to self-isolate. But those nations have not announced what they plan to do about self-isolation as they open up.\nSelf-isolation for people who have symptoms will still be required in England.\nIt is defined by the government as a person who has been close to someone who has tested positive for Covid.\nIt can be anyone who:\nYou can be deemed a contact any time from two days before the person who tested positive developed their symptoms - or, if they did not have any symptoms, from two days before the date their positive test was taken."

      "text": "People in Wales should still use the NHS Covid-19 app even if social distancing rules differ from England, the Welsh government has said. \nThe UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said changes to the app could be made, with England set to scrap its lockdown rules on 19 July. \nThe app also covers Wales, where a similar date has not been given. \nThe Welsh government said it was working to ensure any changes to the app align with policies in Wales. \nThe app detects the distance between smartphone users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and for more than 15 minutes.\nIt allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test.\nThose who are alerted then have to self-isolate. \nBut under plans in England, 1m-plus social distancing rules would be scrapped and the app's sensitivity reduced. \nAny changes to Wales' Covid rules will be announced on 15 July. \nCovid lockdown rules have often differed in the UK nations during the course of the pandemic, with face masks in shops made mandatory in England before Wales, while Wales entered autumn and winter lockdowns earlier than elsewhere. \nOn Tuesday, Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the country was going to have to \"learn to live with coronavirus\" but the Welsh government would not move to a \"political deadline that has been set out artificially\" across the border. \nThe Welsh government said on Friday: \"We are working closely with the UK government on potential changes to the NHS Covid app to ensure it aligns with Welsh policies. \n\"People in Wales are encouraged to download and use the NHS Covid-19 app. \n\"It's an important part of our Test, Trace, Protect programme to control the spread of Covid-19.\""

      "text": "The overall risk of children becoming severely ill or dying from Covid is extremely low, a new analysis of Covid infection data confirms.\nData from the first 12 months of the pandemic in England shows 25 under-18s died from Covid.\nThose living with multiple chronic illnesses and neuro-disabilities were most at risk, though the overall risk remained low.\nThe conclusions are being considered by the UK's vaccine advisory group.\nCurrently, under-18s are not routinely offered Covid vaccines, even if they have other underlying health conditions that put them at risk. \nScientists from University College London, and the Universities of York, Bristol and Liverpool say their studies of children are the most comprehensive yet anywhere in the world. \nThey checked England's public health data and found most of the young people who had died of Covid-19 had underlying health conditions:\nResearchers estimate that 25 deaths in a population of some 12 million children in England gives a broad, overall mortality rate of 2 per million children. \nCurrent data shows some 128,301 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test since the pandemic started. \nSeparately, scientists considered all children and young people in England who had an emergency hospital admission for Covid up to February 2021:\nLead researcher Prof Russell Viner said complex decisions around vaccinating and shielding children required input from many sources - not their work alone.  \nBut he said if there were adequate vaccines, their research suggested certain groups of children could benefit from receiving Covid jabs.\nHe added: \"I think from our data, and in my entirely personal opinion, it would be very reasonable to vaccinate a number of groups we have studied, who don't have a particularly high risk of death, but we do know that their risk of having severe illness and coming to intensive care, while still low, is higher than the general population.\"\nHe said further vaccine data -  expected imminently from other countries, including the US and Israel - should be taken into account when making the decision. \nDr Elizabeth Whittaker, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and Imperial College London, said it was encouraging they were seeing very few seriously unwell children in hospital. \nShe added: \"Although this data covers up to February 2021, this hasn't changed recently with the Delta variant. We hope this data will be reassuring for children and young people and their families.\""

      "tags": "Economics,Economic growth,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The UK's economy grew more slowly than expected in May after a rebound in the hospitality sector was offset by disruptions to car production.\nThe economy expanded by 0.8% in May as coronavirus restrictions eased to allow pubs and restaurants to serve indoors.\nWhile that was the fourth consecutive month of growth, it was also a slowdown from the 2% growth seen in April.\nThe economy is still 3.1% below pre-pandemic levels, the Office for National Statistics said.\n\"Of course, the pace of the recovery was always going to slow as the economy climbed back towards its pre-crisis level. But we hadn't expected it to slow so much so soon,\" said Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics.\nPubs and restaurants \"were responsible for the vast majority of the growth seen in May\", said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics\n\"Hotels also saw a marked recovery as restrictions lifted,\" he added.\nAccommodation and food services grew by a massive 37.1% in May, with the overall services sector growing 0.9%.\nBut UK carmakers struggled with a shortage of microchips, with the manufacture of transport equipment falling by 16.5%.\nConstruction firms were hit by very wet weather in May as firms lost working days, although the ONS said the sector remained 0.3% above February 2020's pre-pandemic level.\nBritish Chambers of Commerce head of economics Suren Thiru said: \"While the latest figures confirm the rebound in economic activity continued into May, the sharp slowdown in growth suggests that the recovery is losing a little steam as the temporary boost, from the earlier phases of reopening, fades.\"\nOverall, in the three months to May, economic output rose by 3.6%, helped by strong retail sales, and as pubs, restaurants and schools reopened from March.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"The government is continuing to support the recovery, with the furlough scheme in place until September, and schemes like Restart helping people who have sadly lost their jobs get back into work.\"\nLooking ahead, Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: \"A sporting summer may not directly cause an 'it's coming home' bounce, but the impact on consumer confidence can't be ignored.\n\"That being said, there are many unknowns ahead. The UK is set on its roadmap to 'freedom day' but cases are rising, challenges in the labour market persist and the initial spending boom could slow in pace.\"\nAfter shrinking at the start of the year under renewed lockdowns, the economy is meant to be surging back. On a chart, a line graph looks like the second bounce of a precipitous economic bungee jump.\nIn that light, today's figures are a disappointment. The consensus forecast was for growth of 1.5% in May.\nInstead we got barely half that - 0.8% - with activity in construction shrinking for the second month in a row and manufacturing also down.\nSome of that was down to one-off factors such as the shortage of microchips, which forced carmakers to send workers home.\nBut while activity in restaurants and pubs jumped as customers were allowed inside for the first time in months, it's clear that our economic bungee cord is slackening before it was expected.\nThe economy remains 3.1% below where it was in February last year, and no larger than it was in January 2017, making it one of the two weakest performers in the G20 group of advanced economies.\nIn the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched.\nIn a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer.\nMost economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily.\nRising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises.\nIf GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking - bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can mean pay freezes and lost jobs.\nRead more here.\nA separate statement from the Office for National Statistics on trade figures showed that the UK is still importing more goods from outside the EU than from the bloc following Brexit. However, the difference is narrowing.\nThe value of imports from non-EU countries were \u00a320bn in May, while imports from the bloc - many of which face new barriers to cross-border trade - were \u00a318.4bn, the ONS said.\nThe value of goods exported to non-EU countries - \u00a313.7bn - was also higher than to EU countries, at \u00a312.9bn."

      "text": "The UK is experiencing a marked increase in new Covid infections, say experts from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nLatest data from swab tests in the community suggests one in every 160 people has the virus. \nThat is up from one in every 250 in the previous week. For England, it is the highest level since mid February.\nThe more infectious Delta variant now accounts for 99% of cases, according to Public Health England. \nAround two-thirds of adults have now been double jabbed against the virus, and experts say this is helping prevent very big rises in Covid hospitalisations, although admissions are increasing. \nMany of the infections being seen are among teenagers and young adults. \nAn estimated 400,000 people in the UK are thought to have been positive in the week to 3 July.\nThe final step of unlocking is expected to go ahead as planned on 19 July in England. It will be confirmed on 12 July after a review of data.\nOn Friday the latest government figures showed an increase of 35,707 Covid cases across the UK - the highest daily figure since 22 January. A further 29 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded.\nAccording to the ONS Infection Survey findings for the week to July 3:\nEngland's coronavirus R number has risen slightly to between 1.2 and 1.5, which means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 12 and 15 other people. \nLast week R was between 1.1 and 1.3.\nSarah Crofts from the ONS said: \"We are seeing marked increases in infections across all four UK countries driven by the Delta variant, which continues to be the most common across the UK.\n\"As the vaccine rollout continues and restrictions are further lifted, it is crucial that we continue to closely monitor the data.\"\nDr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said the sharp increase in cases being seen had not been followed by a similar increase in hospitalisation and death, suggesting the vaccines were working well. \n\"Two doses of the available vaccines offer a high level of protection against the Delta variant. \n\"Getting both jabs is the best way to ensure you and the people you love remain safe, so we once again urge everyone to come forward as soon as they are eligible.\n\"As we approach the planned end of restrictions, we must remain cautious and careful. Cases are rising across the country, and whilst the vaccines offer excellent protection, they do not offer 100% protection. \n\"Be sensible, and follow 'hands, face, space, fresh air' at all times and make sure to get tested if required.\""

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Deal,Metropolitan Police Service,Brixton",
      "text": "The murder of Sarah Everard sparked a national outcry, spurring women to share their experiences of feeling unsafe on the streets. Many included a sense of the teller lining themselves up shoulder-to-shoulder with her: \"She was the same age as me\", \"I used to live near her\", \"I've walked the same route\".\nMs Everard didn't set herself up to be such an everywoman, a symbol of longstanding - and ongoing - violence against women. She had no choice in her name becoming a battle cry for change. \nThe private, excoriating grief of friends and family seems to have been subsumed by the wider - albeit important and valid - reactions of protest and polemic, marches and mass mourning. \nSarah Everard was a daughter, sister, friend and colleague. According to those in the know, she was dreadful at karaoke but \"brilliant\" at everything else. \nThere were just 38 minutes between the time this \"clever, articulate and caring\" woman left a friend's house and the last time she was seen. \nThe final image of her, captured by a bus camera, also showed a white Vauxhall Astra with its hazard lights on and both front doors open.\nThe car had been hired specifically for kidnapping a woman. It was returned to the rental company the following morning, having served its purpose.\nSarah Everard was dead.\nHer body was found a week later in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, where her killer owned a patch of land. \nA complete stranger, a police officer, had kidnapped, raped and murdered her.\nHe knew what he was doing, this man who killed her for his own gratuitous wants.\nOutwardly, he had what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary life. A responsible job. Wife and children. A house in Deal in Kent he shared with them.\nBut the 48-year-old officer's fa\u00e7ade hid the actions of a sexual predator who had been planning the crime - although not yet selecting his victim - in chilling detail. On 28 February, three days before he killed Ms Everard, he had been accused of indecent exposure in a branch of McDonald's. It wasn't the first time.\nThe very same day, he bought a roll of self-adhesive plastic described as \"carpet protector\" and booked the hire car he would use to abduct the marketing executive. He arranged for time off work.\nAfter he killed Ms Everard, he bought builders' bags, a tarpaulin and a cargo net, wiped his phone and concocted an implausible and time-wasting web of lies about his involvement in her disappearance.\nThat they won't have to sit through the grisly evidence and twisted lies of a trial must be scant relief to her loved ones.\nMs Everard should have had a brilliant future, a lot to look forward to. She had bounced back after a relationship breakup and was seeing someone new. She had just started a new job. \nShe, her boyfriend Josh Lowth and four others were planning a trip to Ibiza at the end of summer.\nOne of Ms Everard's friends said: \"What I loved about her was that she had depth. She wasn't a vapid, nice person. She had opinions, sarcasm and wanted things to be better. \n\"We could trust her to fight the good fight.\"\nMs Everard grew up in York, with an older brother and sister. Her father was a professor and her mother a charity worker.\nDescribed by her family as \"bright and beautiful\", \"kind and thoughtful\", \"caring and dependable\", she \"always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour. She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all\".\nRose Woollard has been a close friend of Ms Everard since university, and was one of the first to become alarmed. She contacted the BBC in an attempt to raise awareness before Ms Everard's disappearance had become an official police investigation.\nMs Woollard said: \"Sarah has always been an exceptional friend, dropping everything to be there to support her friends, whenever they need her.\n\"It was only recently that she was telling me the good news about her new role, which she was excited to start.\"\n\"She was sunshine and light, and made you feel warm and good and safe,\" said another friend. \"I feel angry about it as well, but my main anger is that it happened to her.\"\nA former colleague said: \"Sometimes you meet a person with a beautiful soul and it shines through. \n\"There is nothing anyone can say that will make things better for her family and loved ones. They must be in hell. I can only say that Sarah was a very special person and will be missed by so many.\"\nThe uproar over Ms Everard's death, and what she has come to represent, led one friend to say: \"I would like to just say who she was to me, as a person. \n\"Finding the right words is so hard. \n\"I can't sum her up in a few well-chosen words, nor express what she meant to me by sharing memories. I can only skim the surface now in the wake of the horror and the anger, and work through the rest alone in the weeks and months to follow.\n\"Sarah was open. Honest. Unflinching in her ability to listen and empathise. There are some people you know for a relatively short time, but whom you instantly strike up a close bond with due to your similarities - Sarah was one of these people. We shared a lot, and I was never in any doubt of her discretion or sincerity in her support and kindness. We laughed, we cried. We talked about the future. \n\"She should be here.\"\nA simple post on Facebook on 14 June said: \"Happy Birthday Sarah Everard. I miss you today, and every single day\".\nWhen she was taken, Ms Everard was less than a mile from her flat in Brixton. The killer had been cruising around for more than four hours before he saw her for the first time. Years of predatory behaviour, days of planning, hours of scouting, and mere minutes to trap his prey.\nThis was a decision he made. It was not a frenzied attack in which a person loses self-control. It was cool-headed and clinical. \nInvestigators are looking into the hypothesis he used his police ID card as a means to stop Ms Everard, under the guise of questioning her about Covid restrictions.\nAt any point he could have driven away. \nHe chose not to."

      "text": "The situation with Covid will get worse before it gets better with cases \"rising dramatically\", medical leaders have warned.\nThe Academy of Medical Royal Colleges said people should remain cautious, taking measures such as wearing face coverings in crowded indoor spaces.\nIt has warned that the NHS is \"under unprecedented pressure\".\nOn Monday the government is expected to confirm whether the easing of measures in England will go ahead on 19 July.\nThe UK is experiencing a marked increase in cases according to the Office for National Statistics, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid has previously said he would expect numbers of infections to reach about \"50,000 new cases a day\" by that date.\nOn Saturday, the UK recorded 32,367 new cases and 34 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nIt is the fourth day in a row case numbers have been above 30,000, while Friday saw the highest daily figure since 22 January. \nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the academy was \"cautious about issuing dire warnings\" but she had become \"profoundly concerned\" over the last couple of weeks about the idea of removing all restrictions on 19 July.\n\"There seems to be a misapprehension that life will return to normal from then and that we can throw away all the precautions and, frankly, that would be dangerous,\" she said.\nIn a statement the academy, which represents 23 medical bodies responsible for training and development in various specialties, said it was essential that people took a responsible approach when restrictions were formally lifted.\nIt warned that there was \"little doubt that things will get worse before they get better\".\nThe academy said there were reports of routine care being postponed due to healthcare professionals isolating amid mounting pressure as people who had stayed away from the NHS during the pandemic now sought treatment.\nIt added that the growth of long Covid, as well as the backlog of elective work which had built up during the crisis, meant that \"it is like the worst of a bad winter in July\".\n\"There is no doubt that we will get to a position when this dangerous and erratic disease is largely under control for the population as a whole and we can 'learn to live with' Covid-19.  \n\"However, we are not in that position yet and sadly, we have to expect things to get worse again.\"\nA few hospitals in the UK have announced that non-urgent surgery is being postponed because of rising admissions of Covid patients, very high patient numbers at A&E and staff absences caused by self-isolation requirements. \nNow medical leaders suggest this will become more widespread and are predicting that across the NHS things will get worse before they get better. \nThe sobering message is that this is the situation, even after the success of the vaccination programme in reducing the relative levels of hospital admissions and deaths. \nIn essence, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges - the professional voice of doctors - is saying that the Covid impact will be felt for many more months and right through next winter.\nProf Anthony Harnden, who is deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation  which advises the government on the vaccine rollout, said that although it was \"worrying\" that infections were rising again, \"at some point we have got to get back to normality\".\nHe told the Today programme: \"We're in the middle of summer and, providing people carry on behaving responsibly - which I think they will do - then we're in a much better position\" than in previous waves.\nHe said the vaccination programme had gone \"incredibly well\" but there was still \"a long way to go\", adding that increasing vaccination rates was key.\nProf Harnden said around 55% of 18 to 29-year-olds had received their first dose of a Covid vaccine nationally but it was the early stages and he was confident of better uptake among young people.\nDr Mike Tildesley, an epidemiologist and member of the SPI-M modelling group, told Times Radio that high levels of cases could \"challenge the virus\" to mutate into variants which the current vaccines are less effective against.\nHe added that there was \"a risk\" with the planned 19 July reopening but that should decrease \"as we go through August and we get more people vaccinated\".\nMost Covid rules are set to end in England from 19 July. Announcing the plan, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that if the government did not go ahead with the easing of restrictions now then it ran the risk of \"either opening up at a very difficult time when the virus has an edge\" or \"putting everything off to next year\".\nThe government has previously said it has taken a cautious approach to the roadmap in England, delaying the next step to allow for millions more vaccinations so those most at risk are fully protected.\nAmong the changes to restrictions that have been announced are:\nMeanwhile, a study has found that Covid vaccines are highly effective in people with underlying health conditions who were advised to shield earlier in the pandemic.\nBeing fully vaccinated reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by about 90%."

      "text": "Heart inflammation is a \"very rare\" side-effect of the Covid vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, according to regulators in Europe. \nThe European Medicines Agency said the side-effects were more common in younger men.\nThe medicines safety body said the benefits of Covid vaccines continue to far outweigh any risks. \nBut doctors and patients have been advised to be aware of the symptoms of heart inflammation. \nThese include chest pain, a feeling of breathlessness and a pounding or fluttering heartbeat. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor. \nTwo conditions were linked to the vaccines - inflammation of the heart muscle itself, known as myocarditis, and inflammation of the fluid-filled sac the heart sits in, known as pericarditis. \nThe EMA analysis of cases found:\nFive people died. The review said they were all either elderly or had other health conditions. \nThe UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has also been investigating the link. \nIt reported: \"A consistent pattern of cases occurring more frequently in young males and shortly after the second dose of the vaccines.\n\"These reports are extremely rare, and the events are typically mild with individuals usually recovering within a short time with standard treatment and rest,\" it added.\nMost cases are thought to be within 14 days of vaccination.  \nWhile the risk is very rare, it is more likely to develop in young people - who are currently the focus on the vaccination campaign in the UK. \nConcerns about the side-effects have already played into the UK debate around vaccinating children, who are at lower risk of Covid.\nMyocarditis and pericarditis will be officially listed as side-effects in the UK and Europe, mirroring a move by the regulators in the US last month.\n\"The chance of these conditions occurring is very low, but you should be aware of the symptoms so that you can get prompt medical treatment to help recovery and avoid complications,\" the EMA said. \nThe link with heart inflammation was found only in the vaccines that rely on mRNA technology to train the immune system. \nThere was no link found for vaccines such as Oxford-AstraZeneca or Janssen, which use a genetically modified virus.\nHowever, the EMA has advised anyone with a history of capillary leak syndrome should not be given the Janssen vaccine. This is a rare but serious syndrome in which fluid leaks from blood vessels in the body.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Women,Contraception",
      "text": "Some types of oral contraceptive pill can now be sold over the counter at pharmacies without a prescription, the UK's drug regulator has ruled. \nThe landmark decision should make access easier for people, although buyers will still need to have a consultation with the pharmacist.\nThe reclassification applies to two brands of \"progesterone only\" pill - Hana and Lovima. \nCombined oestrogen and progesterone pills still require a prescription.\nThe move has been welcomed by campaigners who say the coronavirus pandemic has made a difficult situation even worse for those trying to access contraception services. \nSexual health doctors say services have been stretched and underfunded for some time. \nHana and Lovima, which contain 75 micrograms of desogestrel, are still available for free on prescription too.\nThey should be taken once a day, with no break between packs. If a dose is missed by more than 12 hours, the contraceptive effect may fail. \nTaken correctly, the mini pill is more than 99% effective, meaning fewer than one in 100 women using it will get pregnant in a year. In reality, because of a range of factors, it is about 91% effective.\nMost women can take desogestrel even if they are over 35 and smoke, unlike the combined pill, where risks can outweigh benefits. \nDr June Raine, head of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said: \"This is good news for women and families. \n\"We have consulted a wide range of people to enable us to reach the decision to make this contraceptive available for the first time in the UK without prescription. We received many responses to our consultation, the majority of which supported this approach.\"\nThe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it was delighted by the news. \nDr Asha Kasliwal, president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said: \"Progestogen-only contraceptive pills are safe, reliable, easy to use and are an incredibly popular contraceptive method. Availability over the counter in pharmacies will make it easier for women to access essential contraception to avoid unplanned pregnancies during and beyond Covid-19.\" \nShe said successive cuts to public health budgets have made it harder for women to get the contraception they need. \n\"Reclassification may also reduce unnecessary pressures on GPs, who will not need to see patients for repeat prescriptions.\n\"However, reclassification of one brand is only the first step, and buying contraception should definitely not be the only solution. We are calling for these pills to be available to everyone for free in community pharmacies, as well as the reclassification of other contraceptives moving forward.\""

      "text": "People should continue using the NHS Covid contact tracing app in England and Wales and isolate when asked to do so, Downing Street has said.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said the app had been an \"important tool\" and Boris Johnson continued to use it.\nThe software detects the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes.\nIt comes amid a huge rise in alerts as infections surge.\nThe latest government figures show UK infections are continuing to rise, with 35,707 Covid cases reported on Friday - the highest daily cases figure since 22 January. A further 29 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded.\nEarlier Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the app's sensitivity may need to change when the 1m-plus rule ends on 19 July.\nThe system allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test.\nUnder current rules, those who receive an alert are asked to stay at home for up to 10 days, although the Department of Health said the app \"is, and always has been, advisory\" - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace.\nCoronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July but the requirement to self-isolate if you have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears that millions of people would be asked to self-isolate this summer as people mixed more.\nThe hospitality industry and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said: \"A large number of the population continues to use the app and it has been an important tool in getting people to isolate and break the chain of transmission.\n\"It is important that people continue to isolate if they are asked to do so. We continue to ask people to isolate if they are asked to through the app.\"\nThe Welsh government has said people in Wales should continue to use the app even if social distancing rules differ from those in England. No date has been given for the end of the 1m-plus rule in Wales.\nOne possible solution could be to change the sensitivity of the app, so it would tell people to self-isolate only after closer and more prolonged contact.\nBut sources at the app developers told the BBC they have not yet been asked to do this, although they are planning a change from 16 August when people would be able to record that they were fully vaccinated to turn off the self-isolation countdown timer.\nMr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: \"As our restrictions change, of course the app needs to change. Things like replacing the 1m-plus rule on 19 July might well lead to a review of the way the app itself needs to function.\"\nThe most recent figures for the last week of June show an extra 300,000 downloads, bringing the total to more than 26 million, but it is not known how many people are active users.\n\"It's in our interests as a society to carry on doing the things that protect each other,\" Mr Shapps said.\nTechnically, it wouldn't be very difficult to tweak the app to make it less \"sensitive\" - the hard bit is working out exactly what those tweaks should be.\nCurrently, two phones with the app installed, exchange a digital handshake, via bluetooth, every five minutes. It registers how far apart they are, and for how long.\nIf one of those phones then goes on to report a positive Covid test, other phones who were two metres away or less, for a duration of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are likely to receive an isolation alert.\nAs we have learned more about the virus, other factors have also been incorporated such as how infectious the person was likely to have been at the time the two phones were in close proximity.\nChanging those parameters would be straightforward.\nBut fundamentally it's the volume of cases which are driving the volume of isolation alerts, not the app itself. In the last week of June there were 356,000 alerts, triggered by 61,000 positive test reports - that's about six app users isolating per Covid case. \nWhen you look at it like that, it doesn't sound so excessive.\nAnd because of the app's focus on privacy nobody, including the government, the police and the NHS knows who has been \"pinged\" - making it legally unenforceable.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned about the possible changes, saying weakening the app would undermine the track and trace system the government had spent billions on.\nHe said: \"This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea.\"\nDr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday she was \"aware that people are choosing not to use the app\" when asked about concerns people have been deleting it to avoid being \"pinged\".\nHinting at a change, she added there was \"work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk\".\nA source close to Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC \"we are looking at the sensitivity of the app\" and pointed out the sensitivity had been changed before - although they did not say what would change.\nAt present, if two phones running the app are close for long enough, and one of the two users later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert.\nUsers can also use the app to \"check-in\" to venues enabling it to notify them of any positive cases they may have encountered there -although the requirement to check-in will be lifted in England when lockdown rules ease further on 19 July.\nA total of 496 venue alerts - which use the check-in data to alert people to potential contact with a positive case - were sent between 24 June and 30 June.\nBut alerts for people coming into close contact with someone testing positive soared by more than 60% in the last week of June to 360,000.\nAt the end of May, there were only 16,000 alerts in a week.\nA BBC analysis has estimated 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate between this week and 16 August, as the number of infections continues to rise.\nThe NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations and separate test-and-trace programmes.\nProf Sir Jonathan Montgomery, a healthcare law expert from University College London who advised the government on the initial launch of the app, said it could still be useful but the government needed to issue new guidance.\n\"The real reason we shouldn't abandon the tool is because so many transmissions of Covid happen before people realise they are unwell,\" he told Times Radio."

      "text": "The government is facing a legal challenge over the use of private email accounts and WhatsApp by ministers and senior officials.\nCampaign group Good Law Project believes current official guidance on it leaves an \"accountability gap\". \nIt follows reports about health ministers using private email to discuss government business.\nThe government said the guidelines were \"appropriate\" and official business was conducted in line with guidance.\nIt is not against the rules for ministers to use private email - but Cabinet Office guidelines say \"substantive discussions\" and formal decisions should be accessible. \nBut Good Law Project believes the government's approach is unlawful - and is seeking to challenge it in the courts. \nIn a pre-action notice sent to a number of government departments and seen by the BBC, the group alleges the use of \"non-governmental communications systems\" breaches obligations to preserve records of decision-making.  \nThe group, which campaigns for transparency and has raised a number of concerns about how government contracts were awarded during the pandemic, also says the current policy fails to comply with Freedom of Information laws.\nThe document refers to WhatsApp messages recently published by the PM's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings, which appear to show government business being discussed.\nIt also refers to reports in the Sunday Times that former health secretary Matt Hancock used a private Gmail address for government business. \nCabinet Office advice makes clear \"substantive discussions or decisions generated in the course of conducting government business\" should be accessible - for example by copying it to a government email address.\nHowever, Good Law Project argues there is \"little evidence\" that messages sent by private email or WhatsApp \"are generally recorded properly\".\nThe organisation also argues the guidance is unfit for purpose, because it does not make clear when it is acceptable for personal email addresses to be used.\nHealth minister Lord Bethell, another of those named in the action, has said that while some third parties \"in their enthusiasm\" often contact ministers via their personal email accounts, \"that's not the same as using a personal email for formal departmental decision-making\".\nHe has also told peers: \"I am absolutely rigorous in ensuring that government business is conducted through the correct formal channels.\"\nGemma Abbott, legal director of Good Law Project, said: \"We don't just think the current approach is wrong, we think it's unlawful. \n\"If successful, this legal action could close this accountability gap, paving the way for a robust, lawful policy on the use of private email and Whatsapp.\"\nThe government has 14 days to respond to the Good Law Project's solicitors. It would then be for a court to decide whether a judicial review goes ahead.\nA government spokesperson said: \"There are appropriate arrangements in place for the management of electronic communications, including instant messages and emails.\n\"Ministers and officials are aware of the guidance around personal email usage, and government business is conducted in line with that guidance.\"\nThe UK's data watchdog is already looking into the use of private email accounts at the department for health. \nInformation commissioner Elizabeth Denham expressed concern it could lead to a \"loss of transparency\".\nShe wrote earlier this week: \"My worry is that information in private email accounts or messaging services is forgotten, overlooked, autodeleted or otherwise not available when a freedom of information request is later made. \n\"This frustrates the freedom of information process, and puts at risk the preservation of official records of decision making.\"\nLabour has demanded a \"full scale investigation\" into whether private emails had been used to discuss government contracts."

      "text": "US authorities are searching for a grizzly bear that killed a woman in Montana after dragging her from her tent in the middle of the night.\nLeah Lokan, a 65-year-old nurse from California, had stopped over in the town of Ovando during a cycling trip.\nDuring the attack on Tuesday, her fellow campers used bear spray to force the animal out of their camping site.\nWildlife and law enforcement officials are sweeping the area and say they plan to kill the bear if they find it.\nA private air rescue service, Two Bear Air Rescue, is using infrared technology to locate the animal, according to Montana's Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) agency.\nTraps have also been laid in the area near a chicken coop where the bear killed and ate several chickens the same night.\nInvestigators believe the animal weighs roughly 181kgs (400lb). Its DNA has been recovered at the scene of the attack, and it will be compared with that of  any bear that authorities trap.\nA friend of Ms Lokan's, Mary Flowers, told AP news agency that Ms Lokan had taken long-distance bike trips in the past. On this latest journey she had been accompanied by her sister and a friend.\n\"She loved these kind of adventures,\" said Ms Flowers. \"She had a passion for life that was out of the ordinary.\"\nThe FWP said the bear first approached the campers at around 03:00 local time (09:00 GMT), but initially ran away. \nMs Lokan and her two companions, who were staying in a separate tent, then removed food from their tents and secured them before going back to sleep. But the bear returned shortly afterwards, leading to the fatal attack.\nOvando, a community of fewer than 100 people, sits to the south of Glacier National Park - an expanse of forests and mountains stretching over the border into Canada. \nThe park is home to the largest concentration of bears within the contiguous US, but fatal attacks are rare in the region. Over the last 20 years there have  been two other incidents, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.\nBears that attack people are not always killed if their attack results from a surprise encounter, or if the bear was defending its young. \nBut a Montana FWP spokesperson told AP that the bear involved in Ms Lokan's death is considered a threat because of the nature of the attack."

      "text": "The overall risk of children becoming severely ill or dying from Covid is extremely low, a new analysis of Covid infection data confirms.\nData from the first 12 months of the pandemic in England shows 25 under-18s died from Covid.\nThose living with multiple chronic illnesses and neuro-disabilities were most at risk, though the overall risk remained low.\nThe conclusions are being considered by the UK's vaccine advisory group.\nCurrently, under-18s are not routinely offered Covid vaccines, even if they have other underlying health conditions that put them at risk. \nScientists from University College London, and the Universities of York, Bristol and Liverpool say their studies of children are the most comprehensive yet anywhere in the world. \nThey checked England's public health data and found most of the young people who had died of Covid-19 had underlying health conditions:\nResearchers estimate that 25 deaths in a population of some 12 million children in England gives a broad, overall mortality rate of 2 per million children. \nCurrent data shows some 128,301 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test since the pandemic started. \nSeparately, scientists considered all children and young people in England who had an emergency hospital admission for Covid up to February 2021:\nLead researcher Prof Russell Viner said complex decisions around vaccinating and shielding children required input from many sources - not their work alone.  \nBut he said if there were adequate vaccines, their research suggested certain groups of children could benefit from receiving Covid jabs.\nHe added: \"I think from our data, and in my entirely personal opinion, it would be very reasonable to vaccinate a number of groups we have studied, who don't have a particularly high risk of death, but we do know that their risk of having severe illness and coming to intensive care, while still low, is higher than the general population.\"\nHe said further vaccine data -  expected imminently from other countries, including the US and Israel - should be taken into account when making the decision. \nDr Elizabeth Whittaker, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and Imperial College London, said it was encouraging they were seeing very few seriously unwell children in hospital. \nShe added: \"Although this data covers up to February 2021, this hasn't changed recently with the Delta variant. We hope this data will be reassuring for children and young people and their families.\""

      "text": "The NHS Covid-19 app will be altered to send out fewer isolation alerts, the BBC has learned.\nThe team behind the contact tracing app for England and Wales has been told to adjust the measurements which trigger the alerts, a source has confirmed.\nThe time frame for the change is not yet known.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps had suggested that the app might need to change for the planned lifting of restrictions in England on 19 July. \nThe app has so far been downloaded nearly 26m times in England and Wales.\nBut businesses and individuals have raised concerns that too many people were being advised to self-isolate for up to 10 days, following close contact with a device that later reported a positive Covid test result. \nA requirement to self-isolate if people have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears that millions would be asked to self-isolate this summer as they mixed more after 19 July, and cases rise.\nThe UK is experiencing a marked increase in Covid infections, according to the Office for National Statistics, with the latest data suggesting one in every 160 people has the virus.\nThat is up from one in every 250 in the previous week and an estimated 400,000 people are thought to have been positive in the week to 3 July.\n\"Things are moving fast,\" said the source at the app team.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the app was doing \"exactly what it was designed to do\". \nThe app user's phone detects others that are around it, using bluetooth.\nPeople who later test positive for Covid can anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for all those flagged as close contacts in the days before the test. \nCurrently this is devices at a distance of 2m or less, for a minimum of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period. This formula has been tweaked several times since the app launched in September 2020, and additional variables have also been factored in as more has been learned about the infectious nature of the virus.\nIt is these parameters which are to be adjusted, and the source said the changes could be made very quickly.\nHowever, Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer has expressed concerns about making the changes as case numbers increase. \n\"This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea,\" he said.\nIn the week of the 30 June some 356,000 alerts were triggered following the input of 61,000 positive Covid tests - an average of about six isolation requests per case.\nThe isolation alerts are not legally enforceable - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace.\n\"The app is, and has always been, advisory,\" said the Department of Health in a statement. \n\"In the context of rising cases it is vital people are aware of their personal risk so they can make informed decisions on their behaviour to protect those around them.\" \nDowning Street said the app had been an \"important tool\" and people should continue using it and isolate when asked to do so.\nThe NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations and separate test-and-trace programmes.\nThe Welsh government has said people in Wales should continue to use the app even if social distancing rules in Wales differ from those in England.

      "tags": "Swansea University,Llanbradach",
      "text": "Brexit, Covid-19 and the Euro 2020 final are three things that may appear to have little in common. \nBut are they all helping to shape our identity as Welsh, British, or both?\nWhen England take the field in the Euro 2020 final on Sunday, they will be cheered by some the other side of the Severn, with others supporting Italy.\nWhether you back the Three Lions or not comes down to a complex social identity with layers similar to a Russian doll, said psychologist Dr Simon Williams.\n\"Different layers become more prominent on different occasions and in different contexts,\" the Swansea University behaviour expert said. \n\"So, for example, watching the Olympics, we might identify, along with a friend from England, as all being Team GB - that is Great British. Watching the Euros, we might connect more with our Welsh identity and our friend with their English identity. \n\"Watching club football, we might narrow our identity further and connect with our identity as a Swansea fan, while a fellow Welsh friend focused in on their identity as a Cardiff fan.\"\nWhat separates it from mere sporting tribalism, though, is a \"long and complex history\" linked to Wales' status as a distinct nation, with its own political and cultural identity separate from England, Dr Williams added.\nHe believes developments over the past few years have led Welsh people to contemplate this more than ever.\nDuring the pandemic, for example, a distinct border in terms of rules emerged for the first time in centuries, while a Welsh first minister was leading the efforts in the crisis rather than a British prime minister. \nDr Williams said: \"Whereas before, a person living in Wales might have had a sense of a dual identity as Welsh and British, now, if they were in favour of remaining in the European Union, they might have more of a sense of being Welsh and European, which might weaken their sense of connection to a British identity and therefore their willingness to support England.  \n\"Identity is key to understanding why some Welsh fans are willing to support England and others prefer to support anyone England is playing.\"\nHowever, as we live an increasingly cosmopolitan age, with more migration and mobility than ever before, Welsh people now have closer ties with England - in the form of close or extended family, friends and colleagues - than they would have had a few generations ago.\n\"So, this might be another factor behind why some Welsh fans are more willing than others to support England as their second team,\" he said.\nAnother factor is historically \"Welshness\" being defined as something different to England, with Dr Williams adding: \"In extreme cases, this manifests as anti-Englishness and discrimination.  \n\"More often than not, however, it is intended in a harmless and playful way - that is as banter.\"\nBut overall, perhaps geography is the biggest factor.\n\"Rivalry is often territorial - think local derbies - which is why England and Wales, and England and Scotland are big rivalries,\" said Dr Williams\nThe layers Dr Williams described as being more prominent at different times is perhaps evident in a number of situations - such as at Euro 2016, when footage emerged of the Wales team cheering as England lost to Iceland in the last 16.\nIn that tournament, Wales reached the semi-final, but with the side failing to emulate the success at Euro 2020, defender from that tournament James Collins threw his weight behind England. \n\"If Wales don't go and win it, I'm supporting England as far as they can go,\" he said. \nHe was not the only one, with former Wales rugby union and Great Britain rugby league star Jonathan Davies tweeting: \"Come on England, Wales and Scotland are out so come on carry the UK flag\", before adding: \"I knew it would split opinion but there you go.\"\nThere is another factor which could influence how much support England receive in Wales - 636,000 people (21% of the population) were actually born over the border, according to the 2011 census. \nIt also found 34.1% of the population have no Welsh identity, with the figure highest in Flintshire (57.3%), Conwy (52.4%) and Powys (52.4%).\nHowever, if identity is the biggest determinant, as Dr Williams suggest, 66% who responded to the census expressed their national identity as Welsh, with it highest in areas of the south Wales valleys - more than 70% in Neath Port Talbot, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly. \nJohn Cook from Llanbradach, Caerphilly, said \"as a Welshman, I could never support England\", adding: \"I was living in England a few years ago and had nothing but abuse because I'm Welsh and love Wales.\"\nA poll of 2,000 fans conducted by YouGov for Betfair before the tournament found 47% of Wales supporters would back England. \nThe situation could be even more complicated though due to Sunday's opponents - there were once 300 Italian cafes in Wales, with thousands claiming heritage from the country.\nWales' former world champion boxer Joe Calzaghe tweeted \"Forza Italia\" following one of the country's previous wins, while others including Chiara Bertelli, 42, who lives in Swansea, will also be supporting the land of their fathers. \nHer dad hails from Loano in northern Italy and she said: \"We've always supported Italy in my house growing up, in football especially, and I will be on Sunday. \n\"We generally supported England after Italy in the World Cup or Euros as Wales often didn't make it through, but now Wales have become more competitive, it makes it more interesting.\"\nWhile she admitted she likes Gareth Southgate and the English players, Chiara added: \"I'm pleased for them they have gotten this far, but as a nation Italy will always get my support.\n\"If it was Italy versus Wales, though, I would be far more torn, obviously.\""

The next day is day one of self-isolation.\nYou can leave self-isolation after five full days if you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart.\nYou can take the first on day five. If it's negative, you can take another test 24 hours later on day six. If this is also negative - and you don't have a temperature - you can immediately end isolation. \nThe rules apply whether or not you are vaccinated.  \nThe current self-isolation regulations run out on 24 March.\nThe prime minister has told MPs he does not expect to renew the rules and said they could end sooner - if Covid data allows.\nHe said that \"as Covid becomes endemic\" (in other words, constantly present) the government will \"replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others\". \nThis would be similar to advice for other infectious diseases such as flu. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid also said he was \"optimistic\" the government would shortly be able to \"remove all restrictions around Covid\".\nIt is not clear whether the rest of the UK would follow suit. \nIn Scotland and Wales you must self-isolate for at least seven days as soon as symptoms appear.\nPeople without symptoms who have a positive LFT result should also self-isolate immediately. They don't need to take a PCR test, although clinically vulnerable people in Wales are advised to do so.\nYou can end self-isolation after two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart - the first no earlier than day six. If you don't have a temperature, you can stop self-isolating after the second negative test, on day seven.\nIf the day six test is positive, you can take two further tests on subsequent days.\nThe guidance applies whatever your vaccination status.\nAnyone leaving self-isolation is \"strongly advised\" to limit close contact with people in crowded or poorly-ventilated spaces. \nThey should work from home and minimise contact with people at higher risk from Covid.\nThe rules about self-isolation after contact with someone with Covid are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or until 10 days since your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to under-18s (18 years and four months in Scotland; 18 years and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test.\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \nIn Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nSelf-isolation means staying at home and not going out.\nAdults shouldn't go to work and children shouldn't go to school. \nYou should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies.\nNo-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care.\nIf you have symptoms or test positive, you should: \nPeople on a low income who are told to isolate may be entitled to some financial help:"

I don't want to sell or wash it,\" she said.\nBelle says she has been recognised by members of the public after a video of her ecstatic reaction to receiving the number 19 shirt on Wednesday was watched millions of times.\nShe says she attracted the Chelsea player's attention at a previous match when he smiled and waved at her from the team bus and so decided to make a flag for him.\nShe said: \"I didn't realise until the last moment because when he walked over, he was coming in my direction but he was looking the other way so I didn't expect it. \n\"When he came over and stood right in front of me, that's when I finally realised I had it in my hands and it was just crazy.\"\nHer father Tommy revealed they had been trying to attract the Portsmouth-born player's attention before the game had even kicked off.\n\"She's small but very mouthy and was shouting 'Mason Mount' as he was warming up and she managed to catch his eye in the warm up and he saw her flag so luckily made an impression and was hoping after the game ended, maybe she'd catch his eye and be the lucky recipient of the shirt.\n\"The plan worked perfectly and to be honest we're still in dreamland. It's just been crazy. \n\"Since the game, we haven't come down to earth.\""

      "text": "UK councils face a \u00a33bn black hole in their budgets as they emerge from the pandemic, a BBC investigation into their finances can reveal.\nSome local authorities were struggling to carry out statutory duties and were at risk of bankruptcy, a local government expert said.\nAnd 10 councils have asked to borrow \u00a3300m of emergency money from the government to plug financial holes.\nThe government says it has handed councils \u00a312bn during the pandemic.\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said: \"In the coming months, we will take stock of the demands faced by councils and the resources available to meet them and will decide on the timetable for future funding\u202freform.\"  \nThe spokesman claimed there were a small number of councils that were \"in severe financial distress such as Croydon and Slough due to poor leadership and chronic financial mismanagement, long predating the pandemic. \n\"These councils have badly let down their residents.\"\nAnalysing 170 upper-tier and single tier councils in the UK the BBC Shared Data Unit found:\nSavings will see the threshold for which disabled or elderly individuals can receive care raised, bus services scrapped and children's centres closed in parts of the UK.\nFees and charges for parking, planning and crematoria are set to rises in places.\nIn the London borough of Bexley, 264 staff posts will be deleted, while library opening hours and road repairs will be reduced.\nSharon Taylor, a Labour councillor who chairs the Local Government Association's resources board, said the pandemic had highlighted an existing funding crisis brought about by a reduction in central government grants - a fall of up to 70% over ten years in some places.\nShe said \"Cuts to local government hurt people and they hurt the everyday services people see when they walk outside their door.\"\nCouncil budgets have been stretched for some time, but for many the pandemic has exacerbated the problem. It's increased the amount local authorities have had to spend on supporting their communities, and at the same time hit income streams hard.\nThis new BBC analysis lays bare the scale of the challenge facing councils across the UK, and spells out some of the cuts to services planned for this year - as well further shortfalls predicted. \nWestminster and the devolved governments have provided extra money, which has been welcomed by local authorities. But what many in the sector really want is a new, more sustainable way of funding councils and the services they provide - not least social care. The government has promised reform; for local authorities it can't come too soon.\nSince the start of the pandemic, councils have been asked to provide extra services, such as home food deliveries for those shielding, finding accommodation for street sleepers and, in some cases, helping with the test and trace initiative.\nThey have also had to supply workers with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). But, at the same time they have seen income from things such as town centre parking, council tax and business rates plummet.\nIn many cases, councils have also lost revenue from private investments. Authorities in Luton, Manchester and the West Midlands part-own airports, where passenger flights have been largely grounded during the pandemic.\nCroydon Council, which borrowed \u00a3545m to make a series of investments including a shopping centre and a hotel, saw the latter go into administration in June 2020. The authority effectively declared itself bankrupt in November 2020. \nBetween 2016 and 2020, councils invested more than \u00a37.6bn into commercial properties, a third of which were retail properties, according to the National Audit Office.\nMs Taylor said the government had encouraged councils to invest in commercial property to raise funds.\nShe said: \"[It] seems to have a very ambiguous attitude towards that now, and is saying those investments were down to us and if we've lost income they are not going to make up for those losses.\"   \nChair of the public accounts committee Dame Meg Hillier MP said some councils had made \"risky choices\" at the expense of the taxpayer.\nBut she also said the committee was generally critical of the MHCLG policy and its \"lack of understanding about councils' exposure to risk\".\nLast week, Slough Council issued a Section 114 notice, becoming the third council in four years to effectively declare itself bankrupt.  \nThe authority was one of 9 in England to have applied for a capitalisation direction, an emergency measure allowing a council to either borrow money to cover losses or to move funds from its building programme to fund day-to-day expenses.\nAround \u00a3290m is to be issued to councils, all of which will have to be repaid over a period of time.\nCroydon Council asked for the most support from the scheme - worth \u00a3120m over the next two years. \nNottingham City Council, which placed its power company, Robin Hood Energy, into administration in January,  is set to borrow \u00a335m.  \nOther councils seeking financial support are Wirral, Peterborough, Bexley, Eastbourne, Luton and Copeland. \nRedcar and Cleveland said it had sought a government grant following a ransomware attack by hackers which affected its computer network.\nIn Croydon, residents said they were feeling the effects of council cuts.\nEarlier this year, the residents of Regina Road said they had so much black mould in their council-owned properties it was a risk to their health. Others said they went days without electricity, or burst pipes that spilled sewage into living spaces.\nMonths before, in November, the council had issued a section 114 notice, limiting itself to only essential spending, as it seeks to make \u00a345m of cuts.\nSome residents were not able to find graves at a cemetery as the reduction to grounds maintenance had allowed the grass to grow over the headstones, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nElizabeth Ash, a Croydon resident of 25 years and part of a campaign to stop the council closing five libraries, said the state of services was causing some people to consider moving out of the south London borough.\n\"The graffiti services have all but stopped now,\" she said. \"There's been a proliferation of tagging on people's properties. All of these things have a knock-on effect in the community.\"\n\"We don't have money to waste but it keeps getting wasted. The residents have to live with the fallout from it.\"\nCouncillor Hamida Ali, leader of the council, said she was \"serious about tackling (the) financial situation, improving how Croydon is run and providing good value services for residents\".\nArianna Giovannini is deputy director of the Local Governance Research Centre (LGRC) based at De Montfort University.\nShe said the pandemic had \"deepened regional inequalities\" - particularly in England - by pushing financially burdened councils into further difficulty.\nShe said: \"The pandemic has forced councils to think the unthinkable.  We are in a position where some councils are struggling to continue to deliver just the statutory services.\" \nAn MHCLG spokesperson said: \"We've given councils over \u00a38.9bn in response to specific pressures from the pandemic - that's over \u00a32bn more than they told us in the detailed reporting they have provided that they spent last year to tackle Covid-19. We have already provided \u00a33bn in additional funding for this year.\"\nThe Welsh government said it had provided councils with \u00a31.4bn to ensure services did not bear the brunt of the financial impact of the pandemic. \nThe Scottish government said its support package totalled more than \u00a31.5bn.\nA spokesman said: \"However, our ability to go further in supporting the recovery is limited and our calls to the UK Government for additional fiscal powers have so far gone unheeded.\"\nThe Northern Ireland Executive said it had provided an additional \u00a385m of funding to councils, adding that it considered the financial situation of local authorities to be \"generally satisfactory\".\nReporting team: Paul Lynch, Alex Homer, Sam Ferguson and Pete Sherlock\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nFor more information on methodology, click here.

Everybody knows who those one-in-four are.\n\"If you are in those age groups and you've got a friend that hasn't yet had the vaccine... please just encourage them to go and chat, just go along and have a chat, and discuss any concerns that you have.\n\"The health boards can only do so much.\"\nShe said some people in the age group had \"a lot of other things on their minds\".\n\"The Euros for instance, there's all sorts of things, like work and studies and childcare,\" she said. \nShe said details of walk-in centres could be found on health board websites. \nDr Bnar Talabani is a doctor and scientist from Cardiff who encourages people to take the vaccine using social media such as TikTok and Instagram.\nShe said some younger people think they did not need a vaccine because they were young and well, but that did not mean they were safe from Covid.\nShe said: : \"We focus so much on hospitalisation and deaths, which tends to be rare in young people, but sadly it can happen in young people if you're completely healthy and well. We have seen people like that end up in hospital and sadly die.\n\"But actually, what's more important and what people I don't think have focused on as well, is long Covid, which is just as common in young people as in middle-aged and older people. \n\"It's a irretractable fatigue so people can't return to work, can't return to university, and are really struggling to return to school - because we've also seen it in children, adolescents - and it's also irreversible organ damage.\"\nThe higher case rates among the under-25s has been driving the rates in those local authority areas where they are highest.\nThe latest Public Health Wales breakdown has shown cases among under-25s across north Wales and in Cardiff in particular continue to have higher incidences.\nThe highest cases rate for under-25s was in Wrexham with 412.4 cases per 100,000 - that's 165 cases in the last week.\nThe area has 6,000 young people who have not yet taken up a vaccine.\nWrexham also has above average cases among the over 65s.\nTwo-thirds of the cases in Cardiff were among the under 25s."

      "text": "The UK is experiencing a marked increase in new Covid infections, say experts from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nLatest data from swab tests in the community suggests one in every 160 people has the virus. \nThat is up from one in every 250 in the previous week. For England, it is the highest level since mid February.\nThe more infectious Delta variant now accounts for 99% of cases, according to Public Health England. \nAround two-thirds of adults have now been double jabbed against the virus, and experts say this is helping prevent very big rises in Covid hospitalisations, although admissions are increasing. \nMany of the infections being seen are among teenagers and young adults. \nAn estimated 400,000 people in the UK are thought to have been positive in the week to 3 July.\nThe final step of unlocking is expected to go ahead as planned on 19 July in England. It will be confirmed on 12 July after a review of data.\nOn Friday the latest government figures showed an increase of 35,707 Covid cases across the UK - the highest daily figure since 22 January. A further 29 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded.\nAccording to the ONS Infection Survey findings for the week to July 3:\nEngland's coronavirus R number has risen slightly to between 1.2 and 1.5, which means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 12 and 15 other people. \nLast week R was between 1.1 and 1.3.\nSarah Crofts from the ONS said: \"We are seeing marked increases in infections across all four UK countries driven by the Delta variant, which continues to be the most common across the UK.\n\"As the vaccine rollout continues and restrictions are further lifted, it is crucial that we continue to closely monitor the data.\"\nDr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said the sharp increase in cases being seen had not been followed by a similar increase in hospitalisation and death, suggesting the vaccines were working well. \n\"Two doses of the available vaccines offer a high level of protection against the Delta variant. \n\"Getting both jabs is the best way to ensure you and the people you love remain safe, so we once again urge everyone to come forward as soon as they are eligible.\n\"As we approach the planned end of restrictions, we must remain cautious and careful. Cases are rising across the country, and whilst the vaccines offer excellent protection, they do not offer 100% protection. \n\"Be sensible, and follow 'hands, face, space, fresh air' at all times and make sure to get tested if required.\""

      "tags": "Economics,Economic growth,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The UK's economy grew more slowly than expected in May after a rebound in the hospitality sector was offset by disruptions to car production.\nThe economy expanded by 0.8% in May as coronavirus restrictions eased to allow pubs and restaurants to serve indoors.\nWhile that was the fourth consecutive month of growth, it was also a slowdown from the 2% growth seen in April.\nThe economy is still 3.1% below pre-pandemic levels, the Office for National Statistics said.\n\"Of course, the pace of the recovery was always going to slow as the economy climbed back towards its pre-crisis level. But we hadn't expected it to slow so much so soon,\" said Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics.\nPubs and restaurants \"were responsible for the vast majority of the growth seen in May\", said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics\n\"Hotels also saw a marked recovery as restrictions lifted,\" he added.\nAccommodation and food services grew by a massive 37.1% in May, with the overall services sector growing 0.9%.\nBut UK carmakers struggled with a shortage of microchips, with the manufacture of transport equipment falling by 16.5%.\nConstruction firms were hit by very wet weather in May as firms lost working days, although the ONS said the sector remained 0.3% above February 2020's pre-pandemic level.\nBritish Chambers of Commerce head of economics Suren Thiru said: \"While the latest figures confirm the rebound in economic activity continued into May, the sharp slowdown in growth suggests that the recovery is losing a little steam as the temporary boost, from the earlier phases of reopening, fades.\"\nOverall, in the three months to May, economic output rose by 3.6%, helped by strong retail sales, and as pubs, restaurants and schools reopened from March.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"The government is continuing to support the recovery, with the furlough scheme in place until September, and schemes like Restart helping people who have sadly lost their jobs get back into work.\"\nLooking ahead, Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: \"A sporting summer may not directly cause an 'it's coming home' bounce, but the impact on consumer confidence can't be ignored.\n\"That being said, there are many unknowns ahead. The UK is set on its roadmap to 'freedom day' but cases are rising, challenges in the labour market persist and the initial spending boom could slow in pace.\"\nAfter shrinking at the start of the year under renewed lockdowns, the economy is meant to be surging back. On a chart, a line graph looks like the second bounce of a precipitous economic bungee jump.\nIn that light, today's figures are a disappointment. The consensus forecast was for growth of 1.5% in May.\nInstead we got barely half that - 0.8% - with activity in construction shrinking for the second month in a row and manufacturing also down.\nSome of that was down to one-off factors such as the shortage of microchips, which forced carmakers to send workers home.\nBut while activity in restaurants and pubs jumped as customers were allowed inside for the first time in months, it's clear that our economic bungee cord is slackening before it was expected.\nThe economy remains 3.1% below where it was in February last year, and no larger than it was in January 2017, making it one of the two weakest performers in the G20 group of advanced economies.\nIn the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched.\nIn a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer.\nMost economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily.\nRising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises.\nIf GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking - bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can mean pay freezes and lost jobs.\nRead more here.\nA separate statement from the Office for National Statistics on trade figures showed that the UK is still importing more goods from outside the EU than from the bloc following Brexit. However, the difference is narrowing.\nThe value of imports from non-EU countries were \u00a320bn in May, while imports from the bloc - many of which face new barriers to cross-border trade - were \u00a318.4bn, the ONS said.\nThe value of goods exported to non-EU countries - \u00a313.7bn - was also higher than to EU countries, at \u00a312.9bn."

      "title": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak hints at ruling out 8% pension rise",
      "tags": "Personal finance,Rishi Sunak,Pensions",
      "text": "The chancellor has given his strongest indication yet of ruling out a predicted 8% rise in the state pension next year.\nOfficial forecasts suggest that the link with earnings growth could mean the bumper rise in the amount paid from April 2022.\nRishi Sunak told the BBC a decision on pensions would be \"based on fairness for pensioners and for taxpayers\".\nVarious commentators have called for an overhaul of the rules.\nHowever, groups representing older people say the government's promises to pensioners should remain.\nMr Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The triple lock is government policy but I recognise people's concerns about what that might mean, given some of the numbers that are being put around.\n\"We will approach these decisions with fairness in mind - fairness for both pensioners but also for taxpayers.\"\nHe said there were \"some questions around the earnings numbers\". \nThe rise in pensions each year is governed by what is known as the triple lock - a Conservative manifesto promise until at least 2024.\nThis means the state pension increases in line with the rising cost of living seen in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, increasing average wages, or 2.5%, whichever of those three is highest.\nPredictions by the Bank of England suggest that average earnings could go up by 8%, hence the equivalent rise in the state pension.\nThat would cost the Treasury \u00a33bn more than previously anticipated, according to the government's official forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility.\nMany economists point out the sharp rise in earnings is an anomaly created, in part, by calculations being affected by people coming off furlough.\nThere is no reason in law why the chancellor cannot change the way earnings are judged in the triple lock system.\nHe is certainly under pressure to do some from some quarters.\nLord David Willetts, president of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes, said: \"The Covid crisis has laid bare the design faults of the triple lock, with a severe jobs crisis last year inadvertently contributing to an unnecessary and unjustified 8% rise in the state pension next year. \n\"The chancellor should take the opportunity this autumn to replace the triple lock with a smoothed earnings link. This would mean the state pension would rise in line with the living standards of working age people - a change that would be fair to all generations.\"\nHowever, Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: \"We do not think the government should rush headlong towards a decision to suspend it. Pensioner poverty has been rising in recent years.\n\"While older people we speak to are generally keen to do their bit to help as the pandemic continues, they are also wary of unscrupulous policymakers who might want use exceptional times as a reason to make permanent changes - a government sleight of hand that would not be acceptable at all.\"\nThe chancellor said that he would hold \"fairness in mind\" for any decision that it is made, but fairness can be hard to quantify.\nAt present:\nThat is one of the least generous state pensions in Europe, even if there was a significant rise next year.\nThe former pensions minister, Baroness Ros Altmann, also pointed out that, for many people, the state pension was their only retirement income.\n\"Millions of pensioners - especially women - rely solely on state pensions because they did not have the opportunity to build up private pensions when younger,\" she said.  \nShe has called for a wholesale review of pensioner benefits, rather than a short-term change in the rules.\nOther considerations of \"fairness\" might also include the wide range of life expectancy in different parts of the country, the different rules determining the rise in Pension Credit - a state pension top-up, and the expectations of younger people about their eventual state pension entitlement.\nAt a time when the official recommendation for the main NHS pay award is well below inflation, a rise of 8% for the state pension would appear to be an outlier.\nThe chancellor's comments this morning are the clearest indication that it will not happen.\nTo be clear, it is very much a distortion. Average earnings were depressed in the pandemic by a reduction in hours worked. The official figures showed earnings were falling. From this lower base, the resumption of normality will lead to a very high number, when comparing one quarter this year to the same quarter in 2020 during lockdown.\nBut this also reflects the design of the triple lock. As the OBR put it, \"it has no memory\". The point of the lock was, last year, to deliver a 2.5% rise in pensions this year, despite earnings being -1% and inflation being just 0.5%. \nThe state pension was shielded from what was happening everywhere else in the economy last year. But its current design disregards that history and will lead to a compensatory bumper boost, if it is measured as in the past (growth in the quarter to July over same quarter last year), although we won't get the figures until autumn."

There are a number of issues that arose.\"\nMr Harris, who had more than 35 years of service before retiring, said some of his officers were \"stuck in a loop\" of trying to contact the police and displayed \"some inertia\" in overcoming the communication problems. \nPaul Greaney QC, lead counsel to the inquiry, asked if the delay represented \"not just a failure but a gross failure in response\".\nMr Harris replied: \"It does, sir.\"\nHe agreed that on the night there had been a failure of leadership within GMFRS and that it was \"too risk averse\" in its response. \nA few hours after the bombing, Mr Harris met firefighters who were \"fuming\" about the failed response. \nHe recalled there was a \"ring of firefighters around me\" demanding answers which he was unable to give. \n\"Not only did we let down the people of Greater Manchester, we let those firefighters down,\" he said.\nThe inquiry continues. \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "Dua Lipa is being sued after allegedly putting a paparazzi photo of herself on Instagram.\nAccording to US court documents, the star was snapped queuing at an airport in February 2019 and later shared the shot with her fans \"without permission or authorisation\".\nIntegral Images says Lipa profited from the photo, as her Instagram feed acts as a marketing tool for her music.\nIt is seeking $150,000 (\u00a3108,000) damages and has asked for a jury trial.\nThe company is also asking for an order preventing the singer from further acts of infringement, as well as legal costs.\nLipa posted the photo to her Instagram account on 7 February 2019, about four days after it was taken.\nThe now-deleted post shows the star standing in line, clutching her airline ticket and passport, while wearing an oversize hat, \n\"I'll be living under big fluffy hats until further notice,\" she wrote in the caption.\nIntegral Images had applied to register copyright for the images, and the request was granted on 20 February 2021 - after Lipa's Instagram post - according to records from the US Copyright Office.\nThe company claims Lipa \"knowingly\" posted the photo to social media without permission, and stood to make money from the shot.\nCourt documents obtained by the BBC claim her Instagram account is \"monetised in that it contains content designed to accumulate followers who are directed to, via link and/or advertisement, consume and purchase [her] content\".\nLipa's team has been contacted for a response. \nAlthough many people assume they can post an image in which they are the subject, copyright law means the photographer usually owns the rights.\nLipa is not the first star to be sued for sharing paparazzi images of themselves to social media. Gigi Hadid, Liam Hemsworth and Khloe Kardashian have all faced similar cases, while in 2019 both Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber settled complaints brought by photographer Robert Barbera. \nIn the same year, Jennifer Lopez was sued by the Splashy News and Picture Agency for posting a photo of herself and Alex Rodriguez to Instagram. The company later voluntarily dismissed the complaint with prejudice.\nOutside of the legal case Lipa is having a stellar year, winning best album at the Brits and best pop album at the Grammys for her lockdown antidote Future Nostalgia.\nShe has also landed her first film role, starring alongside Henry Cavill, Sam Rockwell, Bryce Dallas Howard and Samuel L Jackson in the upcoming spy thriller Argylle.\nLipa will also provide original music for the film's title track and score.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Haiti,Jovenel Moise assassination,Jovenel Moise",
      "text": "The assassination of Haiti's President Jovenel Mo\u00efse remains a mystery more than six months on. \nHis death in his private residence in the capital, Port-au-Prince, plunged the country, already suffering from rising violence and an economic crisis made worse by natural disasters, into further turmoil.\nPolice say a group of mercenaries, most of them Colombians, was behind the attack which they suspect a Haitian doctor of ordering as part of a plot to become president.\nDozens of people have been arrested in connection with the case and a number of others are being sought. But the investigation has been slow, and the exact details about the people who carried out the plan, those behind it and their real motives are still not clear.\nMo\u00efse, 53, was shot dead inside his home in the Pelerin 5 neighbourhood, in the hills above Port-au-Prince at 01:00 local time on 7 July 2021, according to police. \nThe president was shot 12 times and had bullet wounds to his forehead and several to his torso. His left eye had been gouged out and bones in his arm and in his ankle had been broken, according to one of the judges conducting the investigation.\nHe died at the scene and was found lying on the floor on his back, his shirt soaked in blood. The first lady, Martine Mo\u00efse, was also shot but survived. \nHaitian police allege a group of mainly foreign mercenaries - 26 Colombians and two Haitian Americans - made up the group that carried out the killing.\nAn investigating judge said the two Haitian Americans had told interrogators they had been hired as interpreters on the internet.  \nThe two allege that they did not know there was a plan afoot to kill the president but believed they were to act as interpreters when he was arrested. Haiti's official languages are Creole and French, while the Colombian suspects speak Spanish.\nOne of the Haitian Americans said he had been given what he believed was an arrest warrant for the president.  \nMost of the Colombian detainees have been identified as former soldiers, including a lieutenant-colonel. Family members told Colombian media the suspects had told them that they had been hired \"to provide security\" in Haiti. \nAfter retiring from the army, many Colombian soldiers go on to work for security firms abroad, mainly in the United Arab Emirates, where they are valued for their training and experience in fighting armed groups.\nIn January, one of the Colombian suspects - the former military officer Mario Antonio Palacios - became the first person to be charged in connection with the case in Miami.\nHaitian police chief L\u00e9on Charles said Haitian national Christian Emmanuel Sanon, who was arrested after the assassination, was a \"key suspect\" in the case. \nAccording to Mr Charles, Mr Sanon hired 26 of the 28-strong hit squad through a Miami-based company called CTU, run by Venezuelan national Tony Intriago. Mr Sanon, he added, was \"the first person\" that one of the Colombian suspects had called when police surrounded them. \nMr Sanon, a 63-year-old doctor who lived in Florida, arrived in Haiti on a private jet in early June with \"political motives\", Mr Charles said, adding that police had found weapons, ammunition and a Drug Enforcement Administration cap in his possession. \nThe police chief suggested that the Colombians might have been duped by Mr Sanon, who was planning to become Haiti's president.\n\"The initial mission that was given to these assailants was to protect the individual named Emmanuel Sanon, but afterwards the mission changed,\" he said without clarifying if all or any of the suspects had been briefed about the changes.\nAnother prime suspect, according to Mr Charles, was former Haitian senator John Joel Joseph, who allegedly supplied weapons and planned meetings. He was arrested in January in Jamaica.\nBut still on the run is Joseph Felix Badio, a former official in the justice ministry's anti-corruption unit, also seen as a key suspect in the case.\nVideo footage, not independently verified but thought to have been taken by residents, shows armed men dressed in black arriving in several vehicles. \nA man, thought to be a security guard, appears to have been forced to lie face down in the street while another man can be heard shouting in English over a loudspeaker, \"DEA [US Drug Enforcement Administration} operation, everybody stay down!\"\nHaiti's ambassador to the US, Bocchit Edmond, said that while the attackers had disguised themselves as US drug agents, he believed there was \"no way\" they really were US agents. \nOfficials say the ground between the property's gatehouse and the residence was littered with cartridge cases, indicating that multiple shots were fired. \nYet the only people injured by bullets were the president and his wife, a fact which has raised questions about the possible complicity of the president's guards.\nThe group seems to have met little or no resistance inside the residence or during their initial getaway.\nTwo domestic staff were tied up and the presidential couple's adult daughter, Jomarlie, hid in her brother's bedroom and was unhurt. \nThe timeline immediately after the assassination is not very clear. Some of the suspects were reportedly tracked down to a house nearby, which was then surrounded by police.\nThree suspects died while another 18 were later arrested. They have not yet been charged."

He will be sentenced in September.\nTwo officers are under investigation for possible breaches of professional standards in relation to the alleged flashing offence in London, said to have happened in a fast-food restaurant.\nIn total, the IOPC said 12 gross misconduct or misconduct notices had so far been served on police officers from several forces relating to the Couzens case.\nOne IOPC investigation is examining allegations that a probationary Met constable, who was at a cordon around a scene of investigation in the case, shared an \"inappropriate graphic\" with colleagues via social media. Three officers have been served with gross misconduct notices in relation to that allegation.\nThe IOPC is also looking into allegations that officers from several different police forces breached standards of professional behaviour by sharing via a messaging app information that was linked to the prosecution of Couzens.\nOne officer has been served with a gross misconduct notice and another six have received misconduct notices.\nAdditionally, the IOPC is examining the circumstances around Couzens sustaining head injuries in custody, on 10 and 12 March, while he was being held on suspicion of Ms Everard's murder.\nIt said all officers in that inquiry were being treated as witnesses.\nCouzens joined the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) in March 2011, leaving to work for the Met in September 2018.\nHe was initially based in Bromley in south-east London then moved to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, where his primary role was uniformed patrols, mainly at a range of embassies in the central London.\nThe CNC said Couzens served for eight months at Sellafield in Cumbria before transferring to Dungeness, Kent, where he was based for the rest of his service.\nBefore joining the CNC, he was with Kent Police. \nThe CNC said Couzens underwent an \"enhanced level of vetting\" and had no records of complaints or misconduct made against him."

      "title": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak hints at ruling out 8% pension rise",
      "tags": "Personal finance,Rishi Sunak,Pensions",
      "text": "The chancellor has given his strongest indication yet of ruling out a predicted 8% rise in the state pension next year.\nOfficial forecasts suggest that the link with earnings growth could mean the bumper rise in the amount paid from April 2022.\nRishi Sunak told the BBC a decision on pensions would be \"based on fairness for pensioners and for taxpayers\".\nVarious commentators have called for an overhaul of the rules.\nHowever, groups representing older people say the government's promises to pensioners should remain.\nMr Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The triple lock is government policy but I recognise people's concerns about what that might mean, given some of the numbers that are being put around.\n\"We will approach these decisions with fairness in mind - fairness for both pensioners but also for taxpayers.\"\nHe said there were \"some questions around the earnings numbers\". \nThe rise in pensions each year is governed by what is known as the triple lock - a Conservative manifesto promise until at least 2024.\nThis means the state pension increases in line with the rising cost of living seen in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, increasing average wages, or 2.5%, whichever of those three is highest.\nPredictions by the Bank of England suggest that average earnings could go up by 8%, hence the equivalent rise in the state pension.\nThat would cost the Treasury \u00a33bn more than previously anticipated, according to the government's official forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility.\nMany economists point out the sharp rise in earnings is an anomaly created, in part, by calculations being affected by people coming off furlough.\nThere is no reason in law why the chancellor cannot change the way earnings are judged in the triple lock system.\nHe is certainly under pressure to do some from some quarters.\nLord David Willetts, president of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes, said: \"The Covid crisis has laid bare the design faults of the triple lock, with a severe jobs crisis last year inadvertently contributing to an unnecessary and unjustified 8% rise in the state pension next year. \n\"The chancellor should take the opportunity this autumn to replace the triple lock with a smoothed earnings link. This would mean the state pension would rise in line with the living standards of working age people - a change that would be fair to all generations.\"\nHowever, Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: \"We do not think the government should rush headlong towards a decision to suspend it. Pensioner poverty has been rising in recent years.\n\"While older people we speak to are generally keen to do their bit to help as the pandemic continues, they are also wary of unscrupulous policymakers who might want use exceptional times as a reason to make permanent changes - a government sleight of hand that would not be acceptable at all.\"\nThe chancellor said that he would hold \"fairness in mind\" for any decision that it is made, but fairness can be hard to quantify.\nAt present:\nThat is one of the least generous state pensions in Europe, even if there was a significant rise next year.\nThe former pensions minister, Baroness Ros Altmann, also pointed out that, for many people, the state pension was their only retirement income.\n\"Millions of pensioners - especially women - rely solely on state pensions because they did not have the opportunity to build up private pensions when younger,\" she said.  \nShe has called for a wholesale review of pensioner benefits, rather than a short-term change in the rules.\nOther considerations of \"fairness\" might also include the wide range of life expectancy in different parts of the country, the different rules determining the rise in Pension Credit - a state pension top-up, and the expectations of younger people about their eventual state pension entitlement.\nAt a time when the official recommendation for the main NHS pay award is well below inflation, a rise of 8% for the state pension would appear to be an outlier.\nThe chancellor's comments this morning are the clearest indication that it will not happen.\nTo be clear, it is very much a distortion. Average earnings were depressed in the pandemic by a reduction in hours worked. The official figures showed earnings were falling. From this lower base, the resumption of normality will lead to a very high number, when comparing one quarter this year to the same quarter in 2020 during lockdown.\nBut this also reflects the design of the triple lock. As the OBR put it, \"it has no memory\". The point of the lock was, last year, to deliver a 2.5% rise in pensions this year, despite earnings being -1% and inflation being just 0.5%. \nThe state pension was shielded from what was happening everywhere else in the economy last year. But its current design disregards that history and will lead to a compensatory bumper boost, if it is measured as in the past (growth in the quarter to July over same quarter last year), although we won't get the figures until autumn."

      "tags": "UK economy",
      "text": "Prime minister Boris Johnson is coming under pressure to give workers a one-off bank holiday if England win their final Euro 2020 championship on Sunday.\nA petition on the Parliament website passed 320,000 signatures on Friday. It says an extra day off would help families to watch the match together.\nMr Johnson said granting a bank holiday now would be \"tempting fate\".\nThe Trades Union Congress also urged firms to be flexible, if possible, and allow workers to start later on Monday.\nTUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"Bosses should talk to their staff about flexible working arrangements ahead of Monday morning - perhaps allowing them to start later and claim back their time afterwards.\"\nSome stores are changing their hours to accommodate the big event.\nThe Co-op is closing its stores at 7.45pm on Sunday, rather than its normal closing time of between 10-11pm, in order to give staff the chance to watch the match.\nTesco will also close its Express stores in England at 7:45pm on Sunday evening.\nSupermarket chain Lidl will alter its opening hours on Monday if England wins to allow staff an additional hour to \"kick back and relax in the morning\".\nShoppers and staff alike were likely to appreciate the extra time first thing, the supermarket said.\nThe petition calls for a bank holiday this coming Monday, but arranging a bank holiday at such short notice would not be possible. The government also said it did not want to pre-empt the outcome of Sunday's match. \n\"Clearly we want England to go all the way and win the final, and then we will set out our plans in due course,\" it added.\nParliament considers all petitions that get more than 100,000 signatures for a debate.\nThere are eight bank holidays a year in England and Wales, nine in Scotland, and ten in Northern Ireland.\nBank holidays are created under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, or are created by royal proclamation - that is, by the Queen, who acts on government advice. \nThe department responsible for bank holidays is the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\nBank holidays are not actually statutory holidays, although most workers do get the day off.\nNine things you might not know about bank holidays\nThe petition, which was started by marketing manager Lee Jones, says: \"English people would naturally want to continue to enjoy the win, giving the retail and leisure industry a much-needed opportunity to make up lost revenues.\"\nA win for England over Italy on Sunday night would be the first major triumph for the country since 1966 saw it win the World Cup. \nThe match is set to end at 10pm, but if it goes to extra time it could finish closer to 11pm, the semi-final against Denmark on Wednesday was not over until 10.45pm.\nSome firms are already working on the assumption there will be some sort of hangover effect on their workforce and are trying to work around it.\nIan Uttley director at transport firm Stagefreight, told the BBC's Wake Up to Money Programme he had been doing his best to give drivers a later start: \"We do have a lot of England fans but it's  very difficult. We try to give them later shifts but at the end of the day they are professional drivers doing a professional job.\n\"We are trying to give them time off. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience but we do work seven days a week and there'll always be someone in a truck somewhere who will need to drive the next day. Someone has to get the food to the supermarket shelves and into the shops.\"\nHe said there were strict checks in place to ensure no-one was tempted to over celebrate: \"We expect them to limit alcohol limits and we expect them to be under the limit when they start driving - and we do conduct checks.\" \nDowning Street supports the idea, saying employers who are able to should be flexible about allowing staff to go in to work late on Monday or take the day off if England win.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: \"We would want businesses who feel able to consider it if they can, but we recognise it will vary depending on the business and company.\"\nMr Johnson has already said pubs can stay open until 11.15pm this Sunday to reduce the risk of customers being told to leave before the match ends.\nDowning Street has said it will set out any celebrations such as a victory parade for the England team \"in due course\", but has not confirmed whether plans for a potential bank holiday are in motion behind the scenes."

      "text": "From 26 July, fully vaccinated people returning to Northern Ireland from so-called amber countries will not have to quarantine under new indicative dates agreed by the executive for lifting Covid restrictions.\nStormont ministers agreed the changes when they met on Thursday.\nThey also agreed that theatres are to be allowed to reopen on 26 July.\nThe requirement for face coverings to be worn in places of worship could also be removed then.\nHowever, most proposals will need to be ratified at an executive meeting on 22 July.\nThe plans agreed at Thursday's executive meeting mean that Northern Ireland will not directly follow the approach Prime Minister Boris Johnson has outlined for England.\nHe has said masks will no longer be required and social distancing rules will be scrapped for England at the final stage of his government's plan, due to take effect on 19 July.\nStormont ministers have agreed to make the following changes on 26 July, subject to health advice:\nIt is understood ministers also agreed to consider removing the guidelines for students to wear face coverings in classrooms and school \"bubbles\" but that, along with other measures, would be subject to public health conditions on 22 July.\nIt is understood the executive has agreed to give consideration to the full return of live music and dancing without mitigations later in August.\nThe BBC understands ministers will at that stage, also look at lifting remaining restrictions on mandatory use of face coverings, as well as the removal of social distancing and isolating.\nThe government's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has set out his plans for England. \nFrom 19 July, fully vaccinated adults there will not need to isolate from amber list countries.\nIt is believed all of the measures would still need to be rubber stamped closer to the time at an executive meeting on 22 July.\nTheatres and some other audience venues have been closed or had to restrict numbers throughout the  pandemic because of social-distancing guidance.\nThey had previously been given an indicative date of 21 June for their reopening but the executive has so far delayed that.\nJimmy Fay of the Lyric Theatre in Belfast said on Thursday that the vaccination programme had been \"such a success that we need to look at a date, preferably in September, when we can remove all social distancing in theatres\".\nSome other indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas have been allowed to resume trading.\nSpeaking after the executive meeting, First Minister Paul Givan said ministers from his party - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - believed more progress could be made \"at a faster pace\".\n\"We believe that is backed up by all of the data, the scientific evidence, the impact on our economy and the impact on family and wider society,\" said Mr Givan.\nThe minister said the executive had received a \"very positive report\" about a falling number of Covid-19-related deaths, but that other ministers decided they wanted to \"move forward at a slower pace\".\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the executive had taken a \"cautious\" and \"steady\" approach, which she believed was the \"right one\".\nShe said \"the Boris Johnson approach\" to easing restrictions was reckless.\n\"Based on our own information and our own data we have taken decisions today that demonstrates progress, demonstrates that we're able to continue to make some easements,\" said Ms O'Neill.\nEarlier Sir Michael McBride, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer, has expressed concern about mixed messages on issues such as masks.\n\"It's important that we guard against sending the public mixed messages about the evidence around matters such as face coverings and the benefit of face coverings,\" he said.\n\"Whether those are mandatory or whether those are voluntary, those are policy matters and ultimately a matter for ministers.\"\nInfrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon met representatives from the Unite union ahead of the executive meeting."
