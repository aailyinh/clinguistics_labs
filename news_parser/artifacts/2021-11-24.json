      "title": "The UK migrant dilemma - it's all about Brexit",
      "tags": "Home Office,English Channel,Brexit,Migration",
      "text": "The almost daily sight of migrants jumping out of an inflatable onto a beach below Kent's iconic white cliffs is now, we are told, the government's number one priority.  But why?  \nGiven Home Office plans to use Border Force vessels to push precarious dinghies back into French waters, it seems improbable that it is concern about the safety and welfare of the migrants.  \nAnd given that the latest official figures suggest the UK currently has negative net migration - more people leaving than arriving - it is unlikely to be about numbers, especially for a country with more than a million job vacancies for the first time in its history.  \nIn any event, when it comes to offering protection to asylum seekers and refugees, proportionately the UK offers sanctuary to far fewer people than Germany, Spain, Greece or France. \nNo, concern inside Number 10 is driven by the politics of Brexit: this is a government elected on a promise to take back control of Britain's borders and strike our own path on immigration and asylum outside the EU.  \nMinisters want to illustrate how Brexit has restored sovereignty and independence to the United Kingdom.  \nYet the record number of migrants arriving in small boats across the Channel demonstrates impotence, rather than control. No surprise that polls suggest a clear majority of Tory voters at the last election think the response to the challenge is simply too soft.\nThe problem for the government is that you cannot simply pull up the drawbridge. Controlling the country's borders requires international agreement and co-operation. \nFor the moment, with few bilateral deals in place, and outside EU arrangements, Brexit has made the situation more complicated, not less.  \nFor example, the Home Office has introduced post-Brexit rules barring people who have come through a \"safe\" third country from claiming asylum in the UK. Those deemed \"inadmissable\" should be removed.  \nSo, of the more than 25,000 who have crossed from France in small boats this year, how many have been returned?  Tom Pursglove, the minister with responsibility for tackling what the government calls illegal migration, was asked exactly that last week, - by Adam Holloway and Yvette Cooper, MPs on the Commons' Home Affairs Committee.\nHis answer was five - five people arriving by small boats on UK shores this year, have been returned to EU states since January.\nWhen part of the EU's \"Dublin\" arrangements, Britain requested the return of approximately a quarter of asylum cases to our European neighbours. \nNow outside the European Union, the UK currently has no return arrangements with any EU country. The government proposed a post-Brexit replacement for the Dublin arrangement - but the EU turned it down.\nAnother idea is to discourage migrants from crossing the channel by employing the Australian approach of processing asylum seekers offshore.  \nAs soon as the migrants arrive, they would be shipped off again. Options under discussion at the Home Office have included Rwanda, Ascension Island and Albania.  Again, the difficulty is completing cost-effective agreements with other states. None currently seem close.  \nThe government's longer-term plan comes with the reform of the asylum system contained in the Nationality and Borders Bill. \nThis would distinguish between asylum seekers who use clandestine methods to reach the UK and those who come via recognised refugee schemes, the former getting a time-limited opportunity to prove they are fleeing persecution, the latter being offered indefinite leave to remain in Britain almost immediately.  \nThe government is being urged to create more safe routes for refugees, but ministers want such arrangements to be limited to those coming directly from a country of persecution, with Britain choosing who is eligible and a focus on women and children.  \nThere is significant pressure on the government to get tough with what the Home Secretary calls illegal migrants, and to smash the business model of the criminal gangs who profit from people-trafficking.\nBut international migration is an international challenge and, in the end, however much ministers might want to operate independently, will require international solutions.

      "text": "Northern Ireland ministers have announced a relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions that were introduced in December due to the Omicron variant.\nTheir decision comes as the number of new coronavirus cases has been falling.\nAlthough they are still well above what they were at the height of the peak last winter, the big difference is that Omicron is affecting people much less severely.\nBBC News NI explains the latest rules on socialising, working, face coverings and other areas.\nProof of Covid status will no longer be legally required for entry to bars, restaurants or cinemas from 12:00 GMT on Wednesday 26 January.\nHowever the Stormont executive has said their continued use will be \"strongly encouraged\".\nMinisters have also agreed to remove rules on table service in hospitality businesses and the so-called \"rule of six\" people per table from midday on Friday 21 January.\nNightclubs - which were forced to closed on 26 December - will be allowed to reopen from 26 January, with dancing and indoor events at which people are not seated being permitted again.\nSo-called Covid passports will remain in use for access to nightclubs, as well as for indoor unseated and partially-seated events with 500 or more people in attendance.\nThe guidance limit of three households allowed to meet indoors in a home is also to be removed from 21 January.\nA maximum number of 30 people permitted to gather will be retained in regulation.\nFrom 21 January, the guidance on working from home will revert to working from home where you can with employers encouraged to facilitate that.\nThe requirement for offices to take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing will be removed from 26 January. \nGuidance will be that risk assessments should be carried out.\nThe executive has been advised by the Department of Health that the minimum self-isolation period for people testing positive for Covid-19 will be reduced to five full days from 21 January.\nThat will be subject to negative lateral flow tests on days five and six of a person's isolation.\nFrom 21 January, the requirement to provide proof of exemption from wearing a mask will be removed and the reasonable excuse of \"severe distress\" will be reintroduced.\nIt means businesses should still be encouraging people to wear face coverings but they should not asking for proof of exemption.\nNo changes have been made to the limits on numbers of people who can attend outdoor events.\nThe executive has previously advised people not to car-share when attending outdoors events, and to wear face coverings and take a lateral flow test before going to the event.\nThere are no plans to close schools.\nThe executive has said its \"absolute priority\" is ensuring schools remain open.\nAll remaining Covid measures will be reviewed by the executive on 10 February.\nThose include:"

      "title": "Childcare: One in three NI providers 'plans to raise prices'",
      "tags": "NI economy,Childcare",
      "text": "One in three childcare providers in Northern Ireland is planning to put up prices as they struggle with rising costs, a survey has suggested. \nThe survey was carried out by social enterprise Employers For Childcare and received more than 2,200 responses from parents and childcare providers. \nIt found almost a third of childcare providers described their current financial position as \"distressed\".\nSome said that they were facing immediate risk of closure.\nAt the same time, about a quarter of families - 28% - said they were struggling to find and pay for the childcare they need. \nThe research suggested the average cost of a full-time childcare place in Northern Ireland was \u00a3170 per week - the equivalent of 34% of the median weekly household income in Northern Ireland.  \nAoife Hamilton, the enterprise's head of charity services, said: \"Childcare providers are facing unprecedented challenges - in recruiting and retaining staff and meeting salaries, particularly with the increase announced to the National Living Wage, as well as rising food and energy costs and uncertainty over numbers and occupancy levels.\n\"We have been reporting on childcare in Northern Ireland for over a decade and for many years, parents and childcare providers have been telling us about the issues they face, but this is the most worrying picture yet.\" \nThe affect of Covid-19 on the sector means one in two parents (51%) who took part in the survey said the pandemic had changed their childcare requirements. \nIn 2021, families reported using an average of 39 hours of childcare per week, down from 42 hours in 2020. \nAlicia Lappin is among the working parents who are concerned about rising childcare costs.\nThe mother of four from Portadown, County Armagh, would like to return to work full time, but said \"the cost of childcare doesn't allow me to do it\".\n\"Year on year, it seems that my pay packet goes up pennies but the childcare seems to go up pounds... every single year it's a bit more,\" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"It's got to the stage where I've had to make my hours part time in order to be able to cover the cost of childcare - it doesn't financially pay me to be there full time.\"\nHer children are aged nine, seven, four and 15 months.  With the eldest three in school or nursery, she currently pays for day care for her youngest child.\nShe pays about \u00a375 for him for 15 hours a week while she is at work.\nThe centre is run by a social enterprise and Ms Lappin admits it is \"relatively cheap compared to what other people are paying\" but the bill is still a \"huge proportion\" of her part-time wage.\nBy the time she factors in other work-related outgoings such as fuel costs, parking and tax, there is very little left.\n\"I don't work for the money at the minute.  I'm working because I want my foot in the door, I don't want to lose my position and I'm working because I love what I do,\" she said. \nSpeaking on the same programme, childcare provider Diane Koplewsky said her industry was facing rising costs and currently has no choice but to pass them on to customers.\nShe is the co-owner of the Sleepy Hollow Group which is one of Northern Ireland's biggest childcare companies, operating across 18 locations. \n\"As household costs increase, so do business costs,\" she said.\n\"Our PPE, cleaning, hygiene costs have all increased and ironically, so has our insurance even though insurers didn't pay out when we had to close.\n\"So the cost of operating a childcare business has never been higher.\"\nMs Koplewsky called for more government support for her industry so that childcare costs are no longer a barrier to employment for parents.\n\"Childcare needs to be valued as essential element of the economic infrastructure and we need to fund it as such,\" she said.\n\"We aren't seeing any level of investment in childcare here - working parents deserve it, childcare providers deserve it and so do our workforce. \n\"Our workforce need to be valued for their role in care, we need to be valued as early educators.\"\nMs Koplewsky said childcare providers \"do not want to increase fees\" because they know the challenges facing working parents.\nHowever, she said their only source of income at the moment is parents' fees and these may have to rise if there is no government investment.\n\"Nobody wants to increase costs but what else are we to do if we don't get funding from the executive?\"\nMaria McDonagh who owns Adventures Day Nursery in west Belfast said she has been left with no other choice but to increase fees. \nShe said: \"For us to be able to remain in business, we are probably looking at up to a 15% increase - 10% should cover wage increases and increases in the cost of providing food and activities and resources, but the energy costs will be the remaining hike that we have to look at this year.\"\nDad-of-two Liam Mahaffy saw his childcare provider close its doors last month.\nHe said: \"It's very sad for my son, the friends he had made there, they are all going to separate places now so it will be hard to maintain those friendships. It is very upsetting for the staff, they were absolutely brilliant the whole time.\"\nHis partner is currently on maternity leave so while their current bill is significant, it is likely to increase next year.\nHe said: \"It literally is, for us, a second mortgage, and that's just for three days a week. In another seven months' time, there will be a second one going into childcare so hopefully that's not a third mortgage.\n\"When my partner goes back after maternity leave, she might have to reduce her hours. I will be looking after them two days a week. It definitely does impact more, unfortunately, on women's employment prospects.\""

      "tags": "Charlottesville,United States",
      "text": "A US jury has awarded $25m (\u00a319m) in damages against the organisers of a deadly far-right rally in August 2017.\nThe defendants were found liable in four out of six counts over the bloodshed at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nThe civil lawsuit was filed by nine people who suffered physical or emotional injuries in the rally.\nA woman was killed and dozens were hurt after an avowed neo-Nazi drove a car into counter-protesters.\nIn court, the jury awarded $500,000 in punitive damages against 12 defendants, and $1m against five white supremacist organisations. Punitive damages are awarded at a court's discretion to punish a defendant for conduct judged to be especially harmful.\nA total of $12m in punitive damages was also imposed against the driver of the car in the fatal incident.\nThe jury of 11 deliberated for over three days following nearly a month of testimony at the trial in Charlottesville.\nThe two federal conspiracy charges that jurors could not agree on alleged that the defendants had plotted to commit racially motivated violence.\nRoberta Kaplan, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said they plan to refile the lawsuit so a new jury can decide on those two charges. \nThe legal action alleged that the defendants \"brought with them to Charlottesville the imagery of the Holocaust, of slavery, of Jim Crow and of fascism\".\n\"They also brought with them semi-automatic weapons, pistols, mace, rods, armour, shields and torches,\" the lawsuit said.\nThe defendants include several prominent figures in America's white nationalist and far-right sphere.\nAmong those found liable in the case were Jason Kessler, the rally's main organiser, and Richard Spencer, who came up with the term \"alt-right\" and spoke at the event.\nAnother defendant, Christopher Cantwell, became famous as \"the crying Nazi\" after an emotional YouTube video he posted once the rally went viral.\nThe lawsuit largely rested on an 1871 law passed after the US Civil War to protect black Americans, following their emancipation from slavery, from the Ku Klux Klan.\nIt allows private citizens to sue others believed to have committed civil rights violations - with the condition that the plaintiffs must prove that they conspired to do so.\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs also collected more than 5.3 terabytes of data to help them make their case, including social media posts and chat exchanges.\nThe rally began as a protest against the removal of a Confederate statue.\nThen-President Donald Trump came under fire after saying afterwards that there were \"very fine people on both sides\". In the same speech he also said neo-Nazis and white nationalists \"should be condemned totally\".\nA counter-protester, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, was killed when James Alex Fields drove his car into a crowd. He was sentenced to life in prison in June 2019.\nThe civil case included testimony from survivors of the incident.\n\"It was a complete terror scene. It was blood everywhere,\" one of the plaintiffs, Marissa Blair, testified. \"I was terrified.\"\nThe defendants sought to distance themselves from the violence and maintained that there was no conspiracy. They said none of them knew Fields and so they could not have predicted he would ram a vehicle into a crowd.\n\"None of these defendants could have foreseen what James Fields did,\" Mr Kessler's attorney said.\nThe defendants argued that their racist views were protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which guarantees free speech, and that their rhetoric before the rally was just bluster.\nThey also said they had acted in self-defence and that the police bore responsibility for failing to keep the two sides from fighting. \nCourt testimony, however, suggested that some of the organisers could have foreseen the violence. \nFormer extremist Samantha Froelich, for example, testified that the idea of using vehicles to target counter-protesters was discussed ahead of the event. \nAttorneys for the plaintiffs have said they hope the lawsuit acts as a deterrent against further extremist rallies. \nAmy Spitalnick, executive director of Integrity First for America, which backed the legal action, told the BBC in October that \"a case like this can also have much broader impacts in making clear there will be very real consequences for violence extremism\"."

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Dominic Raab,Boris Johnson,Prime Minister's Questions",
      "text": "Boris Johnson batted away opposition calls for him to stand down and defended himself against accusations of \"broken promises\" at PMQs.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM on social care funding, rail investment and tax.\nPicking up on reports of Tory disquiet after the PM's chaotic speech to business leaders, he asked: \"Is everything OK, prime minister?\"  \nThe PM said the government was \"delivering for...working people\".\nThe Conservative benches were packed for the exchanges, in contrast to last week's session.\n\"I see they have turned up this week prime minister,\" said Sir Keir, prompting uproar on all sides and an intervention from Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who ordered MPs to calm down.\nSeveral MPs have told the BBC that they were urged by party managers, via text or phone call, to attend Prime Minister's Questions to support Mr Johnson.\nSir Keir repeatedly claimed the government's plans for social care funding broke a Conservative manifesto pledge that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care.\n\"He's picked the pockets of working people to protect the estates of the wealthiest,\" said the Labour leader, adding: \"How could he have devised a working class dementia tax?\"\nMr Johnson said homes will not be included in the cap on costs, adding that Labour did not have a plan to solve the problem.\nThe prime minister said the government's \"huge investment\" in health and social care meant people will be able to insure themselves against the \"catastrophic cost\" of suffering from diseases such as dementia.\nSir Keir also accused Mr Johnson of breaking a promise not to raise taxes - and to deliver a \"rail revolution\" in the North of England, despite now cancelling the northern leg of HS2.\n\"Who knows if he'll make it to the next election, but if he does, how can he expect anyone to take his promises seriously?,\" asked the Labour leader. \nMr Johnson insisted there would be a rail revolution, and claimed the government was spending \u00a396bn on upgrading links.\nAnd he said Sir Keir had campaigned against HS2 - which runs through his Holborn and St Pancras constituency - adding that he had backed the new high speed rail link even though it affected his own constituents, because it was in the national interest. \n\"How can they trust that man?\" he asked.\nTalk of ousting the PM seems fanciful. He has a track record of bouncing back from adversity.\nBut it is worth noting that loud cheers from a leader's own side does not mean that underlying concerns have evaporated.\nThe former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, was greeted by regular, co-ordinated standing ovations at his party conference, but that didn't prevent MPs quietly but definitively submitting letters of no confidence.\nThe mood at the moment though seems to be for the current Conservative leader to get a grip rather than to get out.\nWhile Mr Johnson was on the back foot at PMQs, he nonetheless managed to step up attacks on the Labour leader too - the most effective of which was to suggest that HS2 would never have been built at all if Sir Keir Starmer had got his way.\nBoris Johnson's premiership has looked juddery recently, but hasn't yet been derailed.\nThe SNP's Westminster Leader, Ian Blackford, also seized on reports of Tory disquiet with the PM's recent performance, accusing him of \"floundering in failure\" and asking him if he had \"considered calling it a day\".\n\"In the real world, people are suffering a Tory cost of living crisis, Brexit is hitting the economy hard, but the prime minister can't even give a coherent speech to business leaders,\" he added.\nHe asked why Mr Johnson was \"clinging on when he quite clearly isn't up to the job\".\nThe prime minister said the British public wanted to hear less about politics and more about what the government is doing \"for the people of Scotland\".\nEarlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab praised Mr Johnson's \"ebullient, bouncy, optimistic, Tiggerish character\", saying it \"livens up\" his speeches. \nHe said there was a \"steeliness\" to the prime minister, adding: \"We work as a team\", and he dismissed the criticism as Westminster \"tittle tattle\".\nMr Johnson appeared before the CBI conference earlier this week to make his pitch for a \"green industrial revolution\" to business, including support for electric cars, investing in wind power and the government's integrated rail plan. \nBut it drew more negative attention after his impression of a car and his personal anecdote from a trip to Peppa Pig World. \n\"I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,\" he told the conference. \"Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place.\n\"It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig.\"\nAsked after the speech, \"is everything OK?\", Mr Johnson said he thought people had \"got the vast majority of the points\" he wanted to make and that the speech \"went over well\".\nIt comes after a few weeks of turbulence at Westminster.\nThe PM backed attempts to overhaul the standards system for MPs' conduct, blocking the suspension of Tory MP Owen Paterson - who had been found to have broken lobbying rules. \nNo 10 performed a U-turn on the move following a furious backlash from MPs, including some Conservatives.\nBut the fall-out led to accusations about sleaze, and wider questions about MPs' second jobs.\nThe PM came under further pressure this week over the cost cap element of his social care plan, which charities warned could unfairly hit people with fewer assets. \nMPs backed the proposals, but it was only a narrow victory for Mr Johnson thanks to a significant Tory rebellion.

      "text": "Apple is suing Israeli spyware firm NSO Group and its parent company for allegedly targeting iPhone users with a hacking tool.\nNSO's Pegasus software can infect both iPhones and Android devices, allowing operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras.\nNSO Group said its tools were made to target terrorists and criminals.\nBut it has allegedly also been used on activists, politicians and journalists.\nNSO Group says it only supplies Pegasus to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human-rights records.\nHowever earlier this month, US officials placed the company on a trade blacklist, saying the software had \"enabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression, which is the practice of authoritarian governments targeting dissidents, journalists and activists\".\nApple's move follows a lawsuit launched in 2019 by WhatsApp which is still working its way through the US court system.\nIn its initial court filing, WhatsApp said NSO Group \"developed their malware in order to access messages and other communications after they were decrypted on target devices\".\nOther tech firms, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Google-owner Alphabet and Cisco Systems have all previously criticised NSO. \nIn a blog post announcing the California lawsuit, Apple said it wanted to hold NSO Group and its parent company OSY Technologies \"accountable for the surveillance and targeting of Apple users\".\n\"To prevent further abuse and harm to its users, Apple is also seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices,\" it said.\nApple prides itself on its privacy. It's a major selling point for its devices. \nSo it's not totally surprising that a company that has allegedly sought to bypass Apple security features might antagonise the giant. \nThat's not the only reason Apple is making a stand though. \nNot all hackers are considered equals. NSO Group has government clients, or as Apple puts it, is \"state-sponsored\".\nNSO claims it only works with agencies with good human rights records.\nIn that way the company has tried to distinguish itself from underground hackers doing nefarious activities. \nBy suing NSO Group Apple is rejecting that distinction.\nApple is making the point that it doesn't matter who you are, if you're a group trying to hack into an Apple product they'll take action - whatever the motives. \nBut there's a bit more depth to it than that.\nApple will feel it's easier, and more politically palatable, to sue a private company, rather than the governments who are allegedly using the tech.\nIn its complaint, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, Apple said NSO's tools were used in \"concerted efforts in 2021 to target and attack Apple customers\" and that \"US citizens have been surveilled by NSO's spyware on mobile devices that can and do cross international borders.\"\nApple alleged that NSO group created more than 100 fake Apple ID user credentials to carry out its attacks.\nThe tech giant said that its servers were not hacked, but that NSO misused and manipulated the servers to deliver the attacks on Apple users.\nApple also alleged that NSO Group was directly involved in providing consulting services for the spyware, but NSO maintains that it only sells its tools to clients.\nApple said it was forced to engage in a continual arms race with NSO, saying the Israeli firm was \"constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple's own security upgrades\".\nThe iPhone maker said that it will donate $10m, as well as any damages recovered in the lawsuit, to cybersurveillance research groups including Citizen Lab, the University of Toronto group that first discovered NSO's attacks.\nNSO Group said in response: \"Thousands of lives were saved around the world thanks to NSO Group's technologies used by its customers\".\n\"Paedophiles and terrorists can freely operate in technological safe-havens, and we provide governments with the lawful tools to fight [them].\n\"NSO group will continue to advocate for the truth.\""

      "text": "A Conservative MP has told the BBC she has been \"sent to Coventry by some\" after accusing the prime minister's father of touching her inappropriately.\nLast week, Caroline Nokes told Sky News that in 2003 Stanley Johnson had smacked her \"on the backside about as hard as he could\".\nAsked about the claim, Mr Johnson said he had \"no recollection\" of Ms Nokes.\nMs Nokes told BBC's Woman's Hour she felt \"absolute shame\" about not having spoken out at the time.\nFollowing Ms Nokes' accusation, Ailbhe Rea - a journalist for the New Statesman - also accused Mr Johnson of groping her, at a Conservative Party conference in 2019. \nWriting for the magazine, Ms Rea said: \"I didn't want Nokes to be alone in calling out something I knew hadn't only happened to her.\"\nIn an interview with Sky News, Ms Nokes said the incident took place at a Conservative Party conference in Blackpool when she was the party's candidate for the Romsey and Southampton North constituency.\nThe former minister said she remembered Mr Johnson \"smacking me on the backside about as hard as he could and going, 'Oh, Romsey, you've got a lovely seat'.\"\nMs Nokes told the BBC's Emma Barnett that the reaction to her allegation had been \"good and bad\".\n\"I've had some amazing support from constituents and women in and around Westminster, and I've been sent to Coventry by some.\"\nThe phrase \"sent to Coventry\" refers to giving someone a frosty reception, or simply not talking to them.\nAsked why she hadn't reported the incident at the time, the MP said: \"I should have called it out then and there... it will forever be my regret that I didn't do that.\nShe added that, 20 years ago she wouldn't have known \"how or to whom to call it out... I do now, I have a platform and a voice\".\n\"I don't want other young women entering journalism, politics or any other career to go through what some of my contemporaries went through.\" \nResponding to Ms Nokes' allegations, Mr Johnson told Sky News: \"I have no recollection of Caroline Nokes at all - but there you go. And no reply... Hey ho, good luck and thanks.\"\nMs Nokes described the reaction as \"a bit gaslight-y\" adding: \"It wasn't memorable to him, it was to me.\"\nGaslighting refers to psychological manipulation to make someone question what's true or real.\nDetailing her own allegation, Ms Rea said she met Mr Johnson at a Conservative Party conference in 2019. \n\"I gave him a warm smile - because this was the prime minister's father, a nice older man, and someone I recognised,\" she wrote.\n\"He smiled back, but it became more of a leer.

I gain nothing from it either, except a marginally more difficult relationship with parts of the Conservative Party, and the discomfort of being a journalist in the story. \n\"But I see this as Stanley Johnson's problem... I have no doubt Stanley Johnson will attend many more receptions at Conservative conference. I just hope that, next time, he keeps his hands to himself. Hey ho.\" \nMr Johnson did not respond to a request for a comment from the BBC.\nAsked about the two women's accusations last week, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"Anyone who commits a criminal act we would not condone, but I'm not getting drawn in to allegations against an individual.\" "

      "tags": "SpaceX,Nasa,Space,Space exploration,Asteroids",
      "text": "A spacecraft has launched on a mission to test technology that could one day tip a dangerous asteroid off course.\nNasa's Dart mission wants to see how difficult it would be to stop a sizeable space rock from hitting Earth.\nThe spacecraft will crash into an object called Dimorphos to see how much its speed and path can be altered.\nIf a chunk of cosmic debris measuring a few hundred metres across were to collide with our planet, it could unleash continent-wide devastation.\nA Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dart spacecraft blasted off at 06:20 GMT on Wednesday from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\nIt is the first attempt to deflect an asteroid for the purpose of learning how to protect Earth, though this particular asteroid presents no threat.\n\"Dart will only be changing the period of the orbit of Dimorphos by a tiny amount. And really that's all that's needed in the event that an asteroid is discovered well ahead of time,\" said Kelly Fast, from Nasa's planetary defense co-ordination office.\nCommenting on the launch, she said: \"We're not out of the woods yet, we've got to get out to Dimorphos, but this is a huge step along the way.\"\nAsteroids are the left-over building blocks of the Solar System. In the extremely rare event that a space rock's path around the Sun crosses that of Earth so that the two objects intersect at the same time, a collision may occur.\nThe $325m (\u00a3240m) Dart mission will target a pair of asteroids that closely orbit each other - known as a binary. The larger of the two objects, called Didymos, measures around 780m across, while its smaller companion - Dimorphos - is around 160m wide.\nObjects of Dimorphos' size could explode with many times the energy of a typical nuclear bomb, devastating populated areas and causing tens of thousands of casualties. Asteroids with a diameter 300m and larger could cause continent-wide destruction, while those bigger than 1km would produce worldwide effects.\nAfter escaping Earth's gravity, Dart will follow its own orbit around the Sun. It will then intercept the binary as it approaches within 6.7 million miles of Earth in September 2022.\nDart will smash into the \"moonlet\" Dimorphos at a speed of around 15,000mph (6.6 km/s). This should change the speed of the object by a fraction of a millimetre per second - in turn altering its orbit around Didymos. It's a very small shift, but it could be just enough to knock an object off a collision course with Earth.\n\"There are a lot more small asteroids than there are large ones and so the most likely asteroid threat we ever have to face - if we ever have to face one - is probably going to be from an asteroid around this size,\" said Tom Statler, the mission's program scientist at Nasa.\nIn 2005, Congress directed Nasa to discover and track 90% of near-Earth asteroids larger than 140m (460ft). No known asteroids in this category pose an immediate threat to Earth, but only an estimated 40% of those objects have actually been found.\nDart is carrying a camera called Draco that will provide images of both asteroids and help the spacecraft point itself in the correct direction to collide with Dimorphos. \nAbout 10 days before Dart hits its target, the American spacecraft will deploy a small, Italian-built satellite called LiciaCube. The smaller craft will send back images of the impact, the plume of debris kicked up and the resulting crater.\nThe tiny change in Dimorphos' path around Didymos will be measured by telescopes on Earth. Tom Statler commented: \"What we really want to know is: did we really deflect the asteroid and how efficiently did we do it?\"\nA binary is the perfect natural laboratory for such a test. The impact should change Dimorphos' orbit around Didymos by roughly 1%, a change that can be detected by ground telescopes in weeks or months.\nHowever, if Dart were to slam into a lone asteroid, its orbital period around the Sun would change by about 0.000006%, which would take many years to measure.\nThe binary is so small that, to even the most powerful telescopes, it appears as a single point of light. However, Dimorphos blocks some of Didymos' reflected light as it passes in front, while the opposite occurs when the smaller object moves behind its bigger companion.\n\"We can measure the frequency of those dimmings,\" explained Dart's investigation lead Andy Rivkin, adding: \"That's how we know that Dimorphos goes around Didymos with a period of 11 hours, 55 minutes.\"\nAfter the impact, astronomers will take those measurements again. \"They'll happen a little bit more frequently - maybe it'll be two every 11 hours 45 minutes, maybe it'll be 11 hours, 20 minutes,\" said Dr Rivkin, who is based at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL) in Laurel, Maryland. \nThere's a degree of uncertainty over how Dimorphos will respond to the impact, in part because its interior structure isn't known. If Dimorphos is relatively solid inside, rather than full of spaces, it might produce lots of debris - which would give the object an extra push. \nDart's method for dealing with a hazardous asteroid is known as the kinetic impactor technique. However, there are other ideas, including moving the asteroid more slowly over time and even detonating a nuclear bomb - an option familiar from Hollywood movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "tags": "Global supply chain management,Transport Select Committee,Freight transport",
      "text": "Britain could face shortage of wine and spirits at Christmas, a drinks trade body has warned. \nIn a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) said rising costs and supply chain chaos have held up deliveries. \nImports were now taking up to five times longer than a year ago, it said.\nThe government said: \"We do not expect disruption to the supply of alcohol this Christmas\".\nThe letter was co-signed by 49 firms, including Pernod Ricard, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and the Wine Society. \nIt said the sector has been badly affected by the HGV driver shortage crisis, which the industry has blamed on factors including Covid and Brexit.\nThe letter said drinks businesses were still struggling, and further action was needed, particularly in the run up to Christmas - \"a critical trading period for our sector\". \n\"Unless urgent action is taken, we will fall deeper into delivery chaos,\" it added. \n\"Businesses like ours previously able to fulfil orders in two to three days now have to operate on a day one for day fifteen basis,\" the letter said. \nIn addition, businesses are reporting increased costs of around 7% - and often more - by freight forwarders to account for driver retention. \n\"This is particularly a concern for SMEs [small and medium sized enterprises] who are unable to compete with large businesses to attract drivers.\" \nIt said drivers and vehicles were \"increasingly unpredictable\" in their arrival times, which meant goods being either not ready or left waiting for collection.  \nIt warned that being unable to fulfil orders on time would mean lost business and could ultimately lead to increased costs for consumers. \n\"Government needs to be doing all it can to ensure British business is not operating with one hand tied behind its back over the festive season and beyond,\" said Miles Beale, WSTA chief executive. \nThe WSTA called for the temporary visa scheme for HGV drivers to be extended for a year. \nIt also wants the government to act to help smooth congested freight routes from ports, and to provide more regular updates on how many HGV driver licences are being processed by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. \nA government spokesperson said: \"The UK has a strong food supply chain and we do not expect disruption to the supply of alcohol this Christmas.\n\"The government acted quickly to tackle the challenges to our supply chains, which were brought on by global pressures including the pandemic and the international shortage of HGV drivers.\" \nIt has invested \u00a332.5m in roadside facilities for hauliers, put \u00a317m into creating new HGV skills bootcamps, and launched a review of training, the spokesperson said. \n\"These measures are working, cutting the backlog through a huge increase in vocational licences issued and HGV tests conducted compared to before the pandemic, and there is now spare capacity in the testing system.\"\nThe warning from the drinks industry comes as food distributors warned MPs that consumers could face less food choice this Christmas because of supply chain issues. \nShane Brennan, head of the Cold Chain Federation, said suppliers were scaling back plans to ensure they can deliver.\nThe Cold Chain Federation represents firms involved in the storage and distribution of chilled and frozen products, including food.\n\"It's about reducing the amount of goods you're expected to put on the shelves,\" Mr Brennan said.\nHe made the comments on Wednesday morning to the Transport Select Committee inquiry into the road freight supply chain.\n\"We are very good at piling high and selling it cheap at Christmas time,\" he said.\n\"What we're having to do is strategically scale that back, in order to basically meet the promise that there will be the stuff you expect to see on the shelves, but not necessarily all the extras.\"\nMr Brennan said the unpredictability of the past two years had made it the toughest period in members' memories, adding that there was a lot of tiredness in the industry and problems with retention.\nThe supply chain is facing a number of pressures, such as drivers leaving the industry and difficulties recruiting new ones, border issues and delays with the movement of shipping containers.\nGlobal shipping supplies are in \"an unprecedented period of stress\", Mr Brennan told the committee.\nHe said it was taking two or three days for fresh food arriving at UK ports to be delivered to stores, whereas this would normally happen on a same day or next day basis.\nFor frozen food, the timescale has increased from between one and three days to up to five and six days.\n\"We're seeing significant changes and having to re-plan on that basis,\" Mr Brennan said.\nIn September, Food and Drink Federation (FDF) boss Ian Wright warned that the UK was in for permanent food shortages.\nHe said: \"The UK shopper and consumer could have previously expected just about any product they want to be on the [supermarket] shelf or in the restaurant all the time.\n\"That's over. And I don't think it's coming back.\"\nAccording to the FDF, the food and drink industry is short of about half a million workers - or one in eight of the total workforce - which is leading to supply chain issues.\nSeveral companies including supermarkets, pubs and restaurants have blamed a lack of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) lorry drivers for causing problems in their supply chains, including shortages of some products.\nLorry driver shortages have also been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK.\nElizabeth de Jong, the director of policy at freight and haulage trade association Logistics UK, highlighted a lack of available lorry parking facilities as a key reason putting people off driving jobs. \nShe told the Transport Select Committee there had been evidence for years that there were far too few parking spaces, with people having to stay in their cabs at side of the road or on industrial estates, with no hygiene facilities. \nDuncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association, told the committee that many people loved lorry driving, but it was often it was the conditions that made them leave.  \nHowever, Mr Buchanan added that the extent of the lorry driver shortage has started to ease. \n\"We are seeing improved throughput in tests. We had tests suspended. Since April there's been a real uptick in the throughput of people undertaking and passing tests.\n\"We reckon the shortage has probably fallen by about 15,000. Much of that is to do with improved test performance and improved retention. And these things when you talk about the driver shortage, everything is estimates based on intelligence we get, hard numbers are very difficult. \n\"But our estimate is we've come back 15,000.  And that's substantial, over 6 months.\" "

That is a fundamental consideration.\n\"After detailed operational consideration the prison service now will be implementing this change.\" \nScotland consistently has the highest drug-death rate in Europe, with the problem said to be particularly acute in the country's prisons. \nThe Daily Record newspaper reported earlier this week that nine inmates at the maximum security HMP Shotts had been taken to hospital after suspected overdoses."

      "tags": "UK immigration,Gatwick Airport,Detention centres",
      "text": "A public inquiry into the mistreatment of immigration detainees has heard a BBC Panorama documentary revealed \"shocking\" treatment which had \"no place in a decent and humane\" system.\nThe inquiry into Brook House removal centre, near Gatwick, is examining mistreatment of detainees, as well as the attitudes and culture of staff. \nIt follows a series of investigations triggered by Panorama in 2017.\nAt the time, G4S ran the Sussex centre, but Serco took it over last year.\nAs the inquiry began, detainees told the BBC about conditions at Brook House now.\nIn the past two weeks, the BBC has spoken to half a dozen current and former detainees at Brook House, who are allowed access to phones. There were no allegations of violence, but the handling of Covid was a major concern. \nSeveral described how their wing was moved in with detainees from another area, allowing Covid to spread. \nThis has resulted in what they described as \"lockdowns\" where people on affected wings are not allowed to move freely around the centre and have less time to access its shop, gym and library. \nOne former prisoner, now held at Brook House and expecting to be deported, said there was a \"tense atmosphere\".\n\"Two nights ago everyone refused to go into their cells in protest. There are rumours of people wanting to go on a mass hunger strike,\" he said, claiming there had been at least 14 Covid cases. \nOthers complained about the length of time it took to resolve immigration cases.\nOne current detainee said he was desperate to be sent home. He claimed 20 out of 65 people in one wing would leave the country willingly but the Home Office had not allowed it. \nThe BBC was told Covid outbreaks mean detainees cannot be sent on deportation flights because even those testing negative are blocked from flying by airlines because they are in isolation wings.\nSerco, which now runs the centre, denied there were \"lockdowns\" but confirmed that detainees are allowed to move freely for up to two hours at a time, in rotation, as part of standard government Covid protocols. \nAnother continuing problem centred on the length of time it took to resolve immigration cases.  \nA former detainee and a convicted criminal said: \"If you are in prison you know the judge has given you a length of two or three years. In a detention centre you don't know when you're coming out. You can't handle it.\"\nHe said he had spent as long in three detention centres, including Brook House, as he had in prison.  \n\"I always felt I had to harm myself. I have to take my life away. I was sick in my head,\" he said. \"When I came out it took me one year to recover. Now I can feel that I'm normal.\"\nFive years ago, Callum Tulley, a former Brook House officer and now a BBC journalist, carried out secret filming for Panorama.\nThe programme revealed harsh treatment, widespread drug use and bullying and raised concerns about the mental health care given to detainees.\nCounsel to the inquiry Brian Altman QC said 109 hours of footage had been given to the inquiry and four hours identified as \"key evidence\".\nTen members of G4S staff were dismissed or resigned in the wake of the BBC broadcast.\nOn its first day, the inquiry heard there would be evidence on restraint techniques used and how staff responded to bullying.\nThe G4S contract is also of particular interest, as well as how the Home Office oversaw the operation of the centre.\nG4S was paid about \u00a31m a year by the Home Office, with penalties for poor performance including escapes, or detainees taking their own lives. \nMr Altman said short-staffing was an \"almost daily occurrence\". And the BBC footage captured \"bravado, mockery, macho behaviour and banter, which may have normalised disdain for and even violence towards detained persons\". \nThe centre, which holds foreign nationals who have served prison sentences and people whose asylum claims have been refused, can house more than 500 men and has the same security as a Category B prison.\nThe wider immigration system is not part of the inquiry's remit. \nThe first phase of public hearings began on Tuesday and will continue until early December.\nThe second phase of the inquiry will take place early next year and is expected to conclude by the spring.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "text": "At least 27 people headed for the UK have drowned in the English Channel near Calais after their boat sank. \nThe International Organization for Migration said it was the biggest single loss of life in the Channel since it began collecting data in 2014.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"appalled\" by what happened, adding the UK would leave \"no stone unturned\" to stop human trafficking gangs. \nFive women and a girl were among the dead, France's interior minister said.\nGerald Darmanin also said two people were rescued and one was missing. It was earlier reported 31 people had died, but the total was revised down overnight on Thursday.\nFour people had been arrested near to the Belgian border, he added, saying: \"We suspect that they were directly linked to this particular crossing.\"\nOn Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to step up joint efforts to prevent the crossings and stop the gangs putting people's lives at risk, Downing Street said.\nA fishing boat sounded the alarm on Wednesday afternoon after spotting several people at sea off the coast of France. \nFrench and British authorities are conducting a rescue operation by air and sea to see if they can find anyone.\nMr Johnson said the deaths were a \"disaster\", adding that it was vital to \"break\" the people trafficking gangs which, he said, were \"literally getting away with murder\".\nSpeaking after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting, the prime minister said more needed to be done to stop criminals organising crossings.\n\"It also shows how vital it is that we now step up our efforts to break the business model of the gangsters who are sending people to sea in this way,\" he said.\nHe also admitted efforts so far to stem the flow of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats \"haven't been enough\" and that the UK would offer to increase its support to France. \nDowning Street later said Mr Johnson and Mr Macron agreed on the importance of close working with neighbours in Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as other European countries, to tackle the problem before people reach the French coast. \u00a0\nThe UK has pledged to give France \u20ac62.7m (\u00a354m) during 2021-22 to help increase police patrols along its coastline, boost aerial surveillance and increase security infrastructure at ports.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel tweeted that the deaths were \"starkest possible reminder\" of the dangers migrants face attempting to cross the Channel.\nBy BBC Newsnight policy editor Lewis Goodall\nThe grim truth is today was predicted and predictable. \nWe had been told that many would attempt to cross the Channel overnight due to rapidly worsening weather. \nBut it became clear that the numbers involved and the quality of boats in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes made tragedy inevitable.\nPoliticians on both sides of the Channel have already blamed the smugglers, who are indifferent to loss of life. \nBut there will be questions for both governments. \nFor France on the conditions in the camps, with children living in the woods and streets. And for Britain the lack of legal routes for asylum to the UK, which critics says is one of the main reasons people accept the risk of taking to the seas.\nI've been told today people were still trying to cross the Channel earlier this afternoon. The terrible weather \u200bexpected in the coming days means people know this is their last chance to make it to the UK for a while.\nMr Macron said: \"France will not let the Channel become a cemetery.\"\nHe promised to \"find and condemn those responsible\" for the tragedy.\nMr Macron also called for an \"emergency meeting of European ministers concerned by the migration challenge\".\nHe said since the start of this year 1,552 smugglers had been arrested in Northern France and 44 smuggler networks dismantled.\nDespite this, 47,000 attempted Channel crossings to the UK had taken place this year and 7,800 migrants have been rescued, Mr Macron added. \nA number of people are believed to have reached the UK in small boats on Wednesday, with people seen being brought ashore in Dover by immigration officials.\nBBC Newsnight's policy editor, Lewis Goodall, said he understood about 25 boats had attempted the crossing so far during the day.\nIt comes amid record numbers of migrants making the crossing from France to the UK. More than 25,700 people have made the dangerous journey to the UK in small boats this year - more than three times the 2020 total.\nThe Dover Strait is the busiest shipping lane in the world and has claimed many lives of people trying to cross to Britain in inflatable dinghies.\nIt is thought at least 10 other people had died in the past few weeks while attempting to make the crossing.\nWere you in the area?

      "text": "Ministers are working towards making the unsolicited sending of obscene images via wi-fi or Bluetooth a criminal offence, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said.\nShe told MPs that \"cyber-flashing\" was likely to be \"within the scope\" of the upcoming Online Safety Bill.\nAnd she said that online platforms who failed in their duty of care for users would face criminal sanctions.\nThey must \"change their behaviours now\", Ms Dorries added.\nCyber-flashing involves the sending of obscene pictures using Bluetooth or peer-to-peer wi-fi networks.\nThis often happens while people are in public places, such as on trains or buses.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said last week that cyber-flashing \"should be illegal\" and the Law Society recommended, in July that a specific offence should be created.\nAsked about this when she appeared before the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee for the first time since entering the cabinet, Ms Dorries said: \"My information is that much of that is actually in the scope of the bill and included in the work that we're doing.\"\nCyber-flashing has been a criminal offence for more than a decade in Scotland, but is not yet one in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nQuestioned over whether digital platforms failing to exercise a duty of care for users should face criminal sanctions, Ms Dorries replied:  \"Absolutely, yes.\"\nShe added: \"It is the case that those online platforms can change their behaviours now. They can comply with their own terms and conditions now. They can remove harmful algorithms right now.\n\"They don't need to wait for this bill to come to the floor of the House [of Commons] to change the way they behave.\"\nDuring the two-hour evidence session Ms Dorries denied frequently using the terms \"snowflake\" and \"leftie\"\nAsked what her definition of a \"snowflake leftie\" was, she joked: \"Probably my kids.\"\nAnd then, asked what an \"Islington leftie\" was, she replied: \"Again, one of my kids.\"\nThe culture secretary also denied a recent story that she had threatened to cut the BBC's funding after Today programme presenter Nick Robinson told Prime Minister Boris Johnson to \"stop talking\" during an interview.\nThe Sunday Times had reported that Ms Dorries had told allies: \"Nick Robinson has cost the BBC a lot of money.\"\nBut she told the committee: \"I've never criticised Nick Robinson. I didn't hear the interview that I was supposed to have criticised and I never made the comment. It was attributed to me but nobody can actually say I said it.\"\nMs Dorries also described the decision to remove male and female categories at music's Brit Awards from next year as \"sad\".\nShe added that she was \"concerned in the future that women were not fairly represented in those awards\"."

      "tags": "Global supply chain management,Transport Select Committee,Freight transport",
      "text": "Britain could face shortage of wine and spirits at Christmas, a drinks trade body has warned. \nIn a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) said rising costs and supply chain chaos have held up deliveries. \nImports were now taking up to five times longer than a year ago, it said.\nThe government said: \"We do not expect disruption to the supply of alcohol this Christmas\".\nThe letter was co-signed by 49 firms, including Pernod Ricard, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and the Wine Society. \nIt said the sector has been badly affected by the HGV driver shortage crisis, which the industry has blamed on factors including Covid and Brexit.\nThe letter said drinks businesses were still struggling, and further action was needed, particularly in the run up to Christmas - \"a critical trading period for our sector\". \n\"Unless urgent action is taken, we will fall deeper into delivery chaos,\" it added. \n\"Businesses like ours previously able to fulfil orders in two to three days now have to operate on a day one for day fifteen basis,\" the letter said. \nIn addition, businesses are reporting increased costs of around 7% - and often more - by freight forwarders to account for driver retention. \n\"This is particularly a concern for SMEs [small and medium sized enterprises] who are unable to compete with large businesses to attract drivers.\" \nIt said drivers and vehicles were \"increasingly unpredictable\" in their arrival times, which meant goods being either not ready or left waiting for collection.  \nIt warned that being unable to fulfil orders on time would mean lost business and could ultimately lead to increased costs for consumers. \n\"Government needs to be doing all it can to ensure British business is not operating with one hand tied behind its back over the festive season and beyond,\" said Miles Beale, WSTA chief executive. \nThe WSTA called for the temporary visa scheme for HGV drivers to be extended for a year. \nIt also wants the government to act to help smooth congested freight routes from ports, and to provide more regular updates on how many HGV driver licences are being processed by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. \nA government spokesperson said: \"The UK has a strong food supply chain and we do not expect disruption to the supply of alcohol this Christmas.\n\"The government acted quickly to tackle the challenges to our supply chains, which were brought on by global pressures including the pandemic and the international shortage of HGV drivers.\" \nIt has invested \u00a332.5m in roadside facilities for hauliers, put \u00a317m into creating new HGV skills bootcamps, and launched a review of training, the spokesperson said. \n\"These measures are working, cutting the backlog through a huge increase in vocational licences issued and HGV tests conducted compared to before the pandemic, and there is now spare capacity in the testing system.\"\nThe warning from the drinks industry comes as food distributors warned MPs that consumers could face less food choice this Christmas because of supply chain issues. \nShane Brennan, head of the Cold Chain Federation, said suppliers were scaling back plans to ensure they can deliver.\nThe Cold Chain Federation represents firms involved in the storage and distribution of chilled and frozen products, including food.\n\"It's about reducing the amount of goods you're expected to put on the shelves,\" Mr Brennan said.\nHe made the comments on Wednesday morning to the Transport Select Committee inquiry into the road freight supply chain.\n\"We are very good at piling high and selling it cheap at Christmas time,\" he said.\n\"What we're having to do is strategically scale that back, in order to basically meet the promise that there will be the stuff you expect to see on the shelves, but not necessarily all the extras.\"\nMr Brennan said the unpredictability of the past two years had made it the toughest period in members' memories, adding that there was a lot of tiredness in the industry and problems with retention.\nThe supply chain is facing a number of pressures, such as drivers leaving the industry and difficulties recruiting new ones, border issues and delays with the movement of shipping containers.\nGlobal shipping supplies are in \"an unprecedented period of stress\", Mr Brennan told the committee.\nHe said it was taking two or three days for fresh food arriving at UK ports to be delivered to stores, whereas this would normally happen on a same day or next day basis.\nFor frozen food, the timescale has increased from between one and three days to up to five and six days.\n\"We're seeing significant changes and having to re-plan on that basis,\" Mr Brennan said.\nIn September, Food and Drink Federation (FDF) boss Ian Wright warned that the UK was in for permanent food shortages.\nHe said: \"The UK shopper and consumer could have previously expected just about any product they want to be on the [supermarket] shelf or in the restaurant all the time.\n\"That's over. And I don't think it's coming back.\"\nAccording to the FDF, the food and drink industry is short of about half a million workers - or one in eight of the total workforce - which is leading to supply chain issues.\nSeveral companies including supermarkets, pubs and restaurants have blamed a lack of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) lorry drivers for causing problems in their supply chains, including shortages of some products.\nLorry driver shortages have also been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK.\nElizabeth de Jong, the director of policy at freight and haulage trade association Logistics UK, highlighted a lack of available lorry parking facilities as a key reason putting people off driving jobs. \nShe told the Transport Select Committee there had been evidence for years that there were far too few parking spaces, with people having to stay in their cabs at side of the road or on industrial estates, with no hygiene facilities. \nDuncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association, told the committee that many people loved lorry driving, but it was often it was the conditions that made them leave.  \nHowever, Mr Buchanan added that the extent of the lorry driver shortage has started to ease. \n\"We are seeing improved throughput in tests. We had tests suspended. Since April there's been a real uptick in the throughput of people undertaking and passing tests.\n\"We reckon the shortage has probably fallen by about 15,000. Much of that is to do with improved test performance and improved retention. And these things when you talk about the driver shortage, everything is estimates based on intelligence we get, hard numbers are very difficult. \n\"But our estimate is we've come back 15,000.  And that's substantial, over 6 months.\" "

      "tags": "Calais migrant crisis,English Channel,Refugees and asylum seekers,Europe migrant crisis",
      "text": "At least 27 people have drowned crossing the English Channel by boat.\nRecord numbers of migrants have attempted the journey in recent months.\nThe UK sends Border Force ships out to spot small boats - but there is little they can do other than rescue people in danger. \nEarlier this week France announced an extra \u20ac11m (\u00a39.3m) worth of equipment and 100 vehicles to tackle smuggling along the coast. \nThat kit includes beach-ready quad bikes and zodiac boats, very fast small vessels favoured by the military. Teams have also been given more night-vision equipment to help identify people hiding in sand dunes. \nFrance has cancelled this weekend talks on the issue after Boris Johnson published a letter to President Macron. In it the PM said France should take back migrants who have crossed the Channel.\nFrance insists it's doing all it can to stop crossings. Interior minister Gerald Darmanin said the French authorities stopped 671 migrants on Wednesday alone.\nCalais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont told the BBC it wasn't realistic to think police officers could patrol 200-300km [125-186 miles] of coastline 24 hours a day, given \"it only takes five to 10 minutes to take a boat and fill it with migrants\".\nThe UK has pledged to give France \u20ac62.7m (\u00a354m) during 2021-22 to help increase police patrols, boost aerial surveillance and strengthen security at ports. It's being paid in instalments, which have started.\nThe two countries have also set up a joint intelligence group, which has contributed towards 94 investigations. \nThere have been 65 small boat-related prosecutions in England since 2020 - and nearly 300 arrests in France.  \nIn November more than 1,000 people arrived in a single day, for the first time.\nMore than 25,000 people have crossed the Channel so far this year - but that figure doesn't tell the whole story.\nNearly 45,000 people sought asylum in the UK in the most recent year for which we have data. So, the number who cross the Channel in boats are only part of the total.\nThe UK receives less than half of the asylum applications which France gets. \nMost refugees stop in the country bordering their own: there are about 3,700,000 displaced Syrian people in Turkey. The UK has taken in less than 1% of that number through resettlement or asylum from Syria since 2014. \nIf migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British port. \nIf they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take them. Each country has search-and-rescue zones.\nThe distance between Dover and Calais, where many migrants cross, is just 20 miles, and none of it counts as international waters. \nOnce migrants are in the UK, they are usually taken to short-term holding centres.\nUnder international law, people have the right to seek asylum in any country they arrive in. They don't have to seek asylum in the first safe country reached.\nHowever, an EU-wide law called Dublin III, allows asylum seekers to be sent back to the first member state they were proven to have entered. \nBetween 1 January 2019 and 1 October 2020, 231 migrants who crossed the Channel were returned to mainland Europe using Dublin III.\nHowever, the UK is no longer part of this arrangement since leaving the European Union. The UK has not agreed a scheme to replace it, making the transfer of migrants more difficult. \nImmigration minister Tom Pursglove told MPs on 17 November that only five people had been returned to mainland Europe so far in 2021.  \nPriti Patel has authorised Border Force officials to turn back boats carrying migrants to the UK in limited circumstances.\n\"Push back at sea\" is a tactic that is used in Australia. However, France has not co-operated with the UK's approach.\nAs soon as the boats leave French waters - which the UK authorities cannot enter without France's consent - and enter the UK's, they are subject to the protection of UK law, says Prof Andrew Serdy, a maritime law expert. \n\"If France doesn't want to take them back once they have left, it cannot be forced to do so and a stand-off ensues.\" \nA boat can also only be pushed back if it's clear that doing so won't endanger lives, which could be difficult to prove with a small dinghy.\nBut speaking in the House of Commons, the home secretary said she \"had not ruled anything out\" and gave the example of \"Greece in terms of push-backs\", adding that the Greeks use the military including special forces as well as the coastguard to achieve this.\nMany of the migrants crossing the English Channel claim asylum once they arrive in the UK. Asylum seekers hope to receive refugee status, meaning they can stay. \nThey must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation. \nTheir asylum application can include their partner and any children under 18, if they are also in the UK.\nDecisions are made by a caseworker. They consider things like the country of origin of the asylum seeker, or evidence of discrimination. \nThis is supposed to be done within six months, although most wait longer.\nAnyone granted refugee status can remain in the country with their dependants for five years. After that, they can apply to settle in the UK.\nAlternatively, they may get permission to stay for other humanitarian reasons. This means they do not qualify for refugee status but are nevertheless at risk of serious harm on return to their country of origin due to:\nFamily members not already in the UK can apply to join those with refugee status or humanitarian protection.\nThey may also be given permission to stay for other reasons - for example, if they are an unaccompanied minor or a victim of trafficking. How long they can stay will depend on their situation.  \nIn 2020, more than 36,000 people, including dependents, applied for asylum in the UK.\nAbout 10,000 were offered refugee status or other protections. \nBoth of these figures were down on the previous year, probably due to the impact of coronavirus. \nWhile an asylum claim is being processed, people are given financial help towards their living costs.\nAsylum seekers aren't allowed to work - or take formal unpaid positions such as internships - unless they have waited more than a year for a decision. They can, however, volunteer to help charities or community organisations.\nThis controversial rule is aimed at preventing people applying for asylum as a route to work in the UK. Critics say it prevents refugees integrating into communities and wastes the skills they have brought with them.\nAsylum seekers cannot choose where they live. Most are initially placed in hostel-type accommodation before moving to longer-term housing.\nMuch of this accommodation has previously been criticised by the immigration watchdog.\nAsylum seekers can get a cash allowance of \u00a339.63 per week for each household member, with extra support available for vulnerable groups such as children or pregnant women.\nAsylum seekers with an active application are entitled to free healthcare and children must attend school. \nIf asylum isn't offered and no other reason to stay in the UK is accepted, the person will be asked to leave the UK, either voluntarily or by force. \nThey can appeal against the decision. Around 30% of appeals were accepted between 2004 and 2020, meaning those individuals were allowed to stay.\nMigrants can receive legal aid for these appeals, which can sometimes take years, as well as continued financial and housing support.

      "tags": "Sulhamstead,Wallingford,Priti Patel,Sentencing in England and Wales",
      "text": "A campaign by PC Andrew Harper's widow to give mandatory life sentences to the killers of emergency service workers has been backed by the government.\nNewly-married PC Harper was 28 when he was dragged to his death by a getaway car in August 2019. Three teenagers were jailed for manslaughter.\nThe Ministry of Justice said it would aim to pass Harper's Law in England and Wales \"as soon as possible\".\nLissie Harper said she was delighted and her late husband would be proud.\nIf passed, the new law would introduce mandatory life sentences for those who kill on-duty emergency workers while committing a crime. \nIt includes police, prison officers, firefighters, and paramedics and will be applicable unless there are \"truly exceptional circumstances\".  \nSpeaking during a meeting with Justice Secretary Dominic Raab at his Westminster office on Wednesday, Mrs Harper said \"a lot of hard work\" had gone into her two-year campaign.\nShe told Mr Raab it had been a \"long, hard journey\" but she was \"relieved\" and \"really happy\" the government had backed the law change.\nThanking Mrs Harper for her campaign, Mr Raab said she had a \"huge amount of support in the country [and] the House of Commons\" and he was pleased the government could get Harper's Law into the existing Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill and onto the statute books \"in weeks and months\".\nIt means Harper's Law could become law by early next year.\nEarlier, Mr Raab said the government was \"on the side of victims and their families\" and wanted emergency workers to know \"we'll always have their back\".\nHe told BBC Breakfast the new law, if passed, would only apply to crimes and sentences \"going forward\" and would not be retrospective.\nMr Raab also voiced his concern about the \"scale\" of attacks on emergency workers, adding that there were about 10,000 convictions for assaults on emergency workers last year.\nThames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner Matthew Barber told BBC News it was \"right\" the government was offering greater protection to emergency workers.\nHe added: \"It's not - as some people have characterised it - about valuing the lives of police officers or emergency service workers more greatly than the rest of us, but it's about understanding their actions and valuing the actions they take where they are often running towards danger to protect the rest of us.\"\nPC Harper's killers were cleared of murder and instead sentenced for manslaughter.\nThe Thames Valley police officer died after being dragged along country lanes in Sulhamstead, Berkshire, while answering a late-night burglary call.\nHe had become entangled in a strap attached to a getaway vehicle as he tried to deal with three quad bike thieves.\nHis injuries were so catastrophic one of his colleagues could not recognise him.\nCausing a death by manslaughter - in other words, without intending murder - covers such a range of terrible incidents that judges have long been left to work out the precise sentence, based on the evidence before them.\nOur law says a sentence needs to take into account deterrence, reform and rehabilitation, public protection, reparations and punishment. \nAnd it's that last category - of making sure the punishment fits the crime - that many supporters of Harper's Law say matters. \nWill a mandatory life sentence for such a crime reduce attacks on emergency service workers?\nThe evidence indicates that longer sentencing tends to be associated with \"limited or no general deterrent effect\". \nThey are not my words, but those of a former justice minister Chris Philp in Parliament earlier this year.\nExperts say all the evidence seems to suggest that the most restraining factor on a would-be criminal is the simple question of whether they would be caught. \nAfter his death, Mrs Harper said she had found herself in a \"lost and endless world of numb despair\". \nHenry Long, the 19-year-old leader of the group, admitted manslaughter and was sentenced to 16 years. \nAlbert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both 18, were convicted of manslaughter after a trial at the Old Bailey and given 13-year sentences.\nLast year, the Court of Appeal rejected a bid by the attorney general to increase their sentences. \nCourts currently impose life sentences for murder, with a whole-life - or so-called \"life means life\" - order being the starting point if a police officer is murdered. \nThe Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018 brought in a statutory aggravating factor requiring judges to consider increased sentences for offences including manslaughter, grievous bodily harm (GBH) or sexual assault if the victim was an emergency worker.\nMrs Harper, from Wallingford in Oxfordshire, said her late husband \"would be proud to see Harper's Law reach this important milestone\".\nShe said she knew \"all too well\" how emergency workers are \"put at risk\" and she was \"delighted\" that Harper's Law would soon provide the \"extra protection\" they needed.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said people who sought to harm emergency workers represented the \"worst of humanity\" and that it was \"right that future killers be stripped of the freedom to walk our streets with a life sentence\"."

      "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are believed to have offered their Christmas concert to ITV instead of the BBC after a row with the corporation.\nThe couple are said to be unhappy with a new BBC documentary about the Royal Family's relationship with the media.\nThe carol concert in Westminster Abbey was originally due to be broadcast by the BBC, according to The Sun.\nBut the event has moved channels following BBC Two's The Princes and the Press documentary, the newspaper said. \nKate will reportedly host the concert and there is speculation that the couple's children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, may feature in the show. However, that has not been confirmed by Kensington Palace.\nThe programme is expected to be recorded in early December and will still be made by BBC Studios, the corporation's commercial production arm, despite the change in broadcaster.\nIt will be produced in addition to ITV's usual Carols at Christmas programme, which will be broadcast as usual in December.\nITV has not yet publicly confirmed that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's concert will feature in its festive schedule, but media reports have suggested it could air on 23 or 24 December.\nThe strained relationship between the Royal Family and the BBC follows the broadcast of The Princes and the Press, hosted by the corporation's media editor Amol Rajan.\nThe first episode of the two-part series aired on Monday and examined Prince William and Prince Harry's relationship with the media.\nIt featured interviews with journalists including Andrew Marr, Ian Hislop, Dan Wootton and Camilla Tominey, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's biographer Omid Scobie and the couple's lawyer Jenny Afia.\nMonday's episode included suggestions that negative stories about the Duchess of Sussex were leaked by courtiers and that there were rivalries between different royal households.\nThe second episode, due to be screened next week, is expected to delve into William and Harry's rift. Royal aides are reported to be concerned it will include claims that the brothers briefed against each other in the press through their advisers.\nIn response to the documentary, the royal households issued a joint statement, featured in the programme, which criticised the BBC for giving credibility to \"overblown and unfounded claims\".\nEarlier this week, the BBC said the programme was \"about how royal journalism is done and features a range of journalists from broadcast and the newspaper industry\".\nThe BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the Royal Family were unhappy that they did not have the opportunity to view the documentary in advance.\n\"There is undoubtedly irritation in the Royal households, but especially at Kensington Palace and especially on the part of Prince William,\" Witchell said. \"We must remember that he still feels really quite aggrieved at the BBC over the Panorama interview with his mother [Princess Diana].\n\"These feelings are very raw, and they have been exacerbated by these two programmes, the Princes and the Press.\"\nWitchell added: \"It appears that the BBC is to be punished.\"\nOn Wednesday, BBC chairman Richard Sharp was asked at the Voice of the Listener and Viewer's autumn conference about the reports that Kensington Palace had decided to switch the concert to ITV.\n\"The BBC is a national institution and we approach our relationships with the other national institutions with great care and thought,\" he said.\n\"The Royal Family is at the centre of our identity, its underlying importance is unequivocal. We have tremendous respect for all aspects of the Royal Family in what they undertake and do.\n\"From time to time, this organisation produces programmes which may or may not meet with full agreement with different parts of the establishment. Our job is to get that right, to be independent, to be respectful.\" \nRepresentatives for the BBC, BBC Studios, ITV and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge declined to comment. \nITV's royal editor Chris Ship quoted a source at the network as saying of the commission: \"It was unusual for it to come to us this late.\""

Here's what we know:\nA fishing boat sounded the alarm on Wednesday afternoon after spotting several people in the sea off the northern coast of France.\nThose who drowned were 17 men, seven women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children, France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.\nA joint search and rescue operation by British and French authorities was launched, and eventually called off late on Wednesday.\nTwo people were rescued and are in a critical condition with severe hypothermia in a French hospital. One of them is from Iraq, the other is Somali, Mr Darmanin told RTL radio.\nThe task of performing autopsies and identifying the victims will take place over the next few days in Lille, in northern France, the city's public prosecutor Carole Etienne confirmed.\nFrench media report that the dead are believed to be Iraqi or Iranian Kurds.\nThe cause of the accident remains unknown, but when the long inflatable boat the migrants were using was found by rescuers it was mostly deflated.\nMr Darmanin described the boat as a dinghy that was \"extremely fragile\".\nHe said \"it was like a pool you blow up in your garden\".\nIt is the kind of boat often used by people smuggling networks to get migrants across the channel, and has now been sent to Lille to be examined.\nFrench police say the boat set out from the Dunkirk area, east of Calais.\nFishermen in the area said calm weather had prompted more migrants than usual to attempt the crossing on Wednesday.\nThere are reports that about 25 boats had attempted the crossing during the day.\nFive alleged traffickers linked to the incident have been arrested in France.\nTwo people have already appeared in court and an investigation into aggravated manslaughter has been opened by prosecutors, Mr Darmanin said.\nHe said the boat used to cross the Channel, called a zodiac, was purchased in Germany. \nDespite Wednesday's tragedy, people have continued to attempt the dangerous 20 mile (32km) journey across the Channel. On Thursday two more boats arrived in Dover, carrying about 40 people, the BBC's Simon Jones says.\nThis is all happening a week after a large migrant camp near Dunkirk in northern France was dismantled and up to 1,500 migrants were evacuated from the site.\nMore than 25,000 people have made the dangerous journey from France to the UK across the Channel in small boats this year, which is more than three times last year's total."

      "tags": "NI Health,Care homes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The commissioner for older people Eddie Lynch has called for a Northern Ireland-based inquiry into the handling of care home residents during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nFormer employees of a Newtownabbey care home where 14 residents died during the first wave echoed the call. \nSpeaking to BBC Spotlight, one said the deaths had been \"pushed to the side\".\nThe Department of Health said its minister Robin Swann wanted a public inquiry \"as soon as is practicable\". \nFormer care workers Clara Wilson and Rhonda McKeown have spoken for the first time about their experience at Glenabbey care home in spring 2020.\n\"If these deaths had happened in a children's home I think there would have been an investigation a long time ago, but because it's the elderly it just seems to be pushed to the side,\" said Ms McKeown.\nThe Department of Health said the timing of an inquiry would have to take account of the entire health system being focused on fighting Covid-19 and the resultant pressures. \nAnd it said that central aspects of the pandemic response were on a UK-wide basis, including testing and vaccination supply.\nMr Lynch said he had spoken to political parties about the issue in recent weeks. \n\"Over the past year, we witnessed the incorrect recording of care home deaths, families having no access to loved ones, PPE supply problems, inappropriate use of do not resuscitate orders, the slow introduction of testing, the transfer of Covid-positive patients into care homes - the list goes on,\" he added.\nSpeaking to Spotlight, the former Glenabbey employees were critical of government policy on testing of people being discharged from hospital to care homes in the early days of the pandemic.\nOn 3 April 2020, a Health and Social Care Board official, writing to care home providers, stated: \"There is no expectation that patients are tested for Covid-19 before discharge\". \nThe policy was adopted by trusts across Northern Ireland. \nIt led to the Northern Health Trust and the Belfast Health Trust, both of which sent patients to Glenabbey in the first wave, discharging hundreds of patients who had not been tested, and a small number of people who were positive, to care homes between February and June 2020. \nAnother former Glenabbey care worker, 20-year-old Fiona Hopkin, told Spotlight one resident at the home was discharged from Antrim Hospital without being tested.\nThey then tested positive at the home soon after. \nMs McKeown, whose mother was a resident at the home, said the policy left the home \"exposed\". \n\"We need to know why that happened because carers were then put in a terrible situation and left to deal with that,\" she said.\nRoutine testing of people before they were discharged from hospital to care homes was introduced on 19 April 2020. \nThe Department of Health published a report last year which said evidence did not support a close link between hospital discharges and Covid-19 outbreaks in the first wave. \nPublic health expert Professor Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said he did not think the report's methods were comprehensive enough. \n\"If you want to understand why there is an outbreak in anywhere, a care home, a cruise ship, whatever you will do a detailed epidemiological analysis looking at where the cases came from and the pattern of transmission and that wasn't done,\" he added.\nThe Department of Health said its report's findings were consistent with studies by public health agencies elsewhere in the UK which found discharges were not associated with a significant risk of a care home outbreak - though a small risk could not be ruled out. \nIt said early in the pandemic it did not have the capacity to test patients that it has now. \nEarlier this year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged a UK-wide inquiry, but Scotland is in the process of setting up its own inquiry. \nMr Lynch said he wanted the Stormont Executive to also have its own inquiry.\n\"I urge the NI executive to conduct an inquiry which specifically looks at the care and management of residents and care homes and not to delay any longer in commencing what is likely to be a long process,\" he said.

      "text": "A senior doctor has warned that when people are being treated for more than 10 hours in ambulances, it means that emergency departments are \"effectively closed for some of those patients\".\nAndrew Dobbin, a consultant at the Ulster Hospital, said the stream of very sick patients turning up at the emergency department was \"relentless\".\nHe said hospital beds were \"at a premium\". \nStaff pleaded with the public to behave responsibly and \"save Christmas\".\nBBC News NI spent six hours in the Ulster Hospital's emergency department this week.\nThe numbers fluctuate but on Monday evening, at its peak, 134 people were there, including children. \nOf those, 50 needed to be admitted to a ward. The problem was finding beds.  \nTo allow new patients in, staff have to get people out of the hospital and back into the community.\nMarc Neil, the assistant director of unscheduled care at the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust, allocates beds for people in hospital as well as in the community. \n\"Every day is a continuous struggle to find enough beds for everyone who needs one,\" he said. \n\"Every hour of the day that we move a patient is a choice to put someone there and someone not. Trained professionals are making those choices but, yes, it is tough.\"  \nEach health trust is faced with a similar problem.  \nOn Monday night, more than 100 beds had been located in the community for hospital patients to be moved on. \nBut they were all declined because families said they were unsuitable for reasons such as where they were located or what facilities were offered.  \nMr Neil said \"difficult conversations\" had to take place but, he added: \"We would remind people that the conversation we are having with you is the same conversation that we had with the person who was in this bed before you.\n\"At the moment, there are 103 beds available in the community but we can't get people to move out of hospital and into those beds as they aren't close to their homes or within their health trust.\n\"We are pleading with the public to work with us.\"\nThe nurses move around, fixing blankets and pulling curtains to protect patient dignity.\nAt every turn, there is a sick person waiting to be seen or to be admitted onto a ward. \nAt the peak, 134 people were waiting - in a department that originally housed 65 bedded cubicles.   \nDue to Covid, there are now several separate areas under one roof.  \nSome patients sit in proper waiting areas - others are in corridors with babies wrapped in blankets on their laps, while others lie on trolley beds. \nOlder women peer out from under clutched blankets; younger patients scroll their phones.   \nPatients sit socially distanced alongside each other as staff scurry about delivering medication, applying IV drips and taking temperatures.\nEvery available space has been transformed into an additional waiting area - and everyone just seems to be waiting. \nIt is overwhelming to watch. \nRead more here.\nWhen we spoke to him, Dr Dobbin had worked eight consecutive shifts, including with the Air Ambulance.  \nHe said emergency departments across Northern Ireland were \"overwhelmed\".   \n\"We are delivering care but perhaps not in the space where we want to deliver it - I expect things to get continually worse over the winter months,\" he added.\nThings are precarious across the entire health and social care system. \nAccording to the health trusts' winter plans, even if things were to stand still over the next couple of months - something that is highly unlikely - an additional 500 beds could be needed. \nDr Dobbin said the figure of 500 was becoming \"a likely number\".\n\"Right now, in November, there are 220 patients in emergency departments that are waiting for a hospital bed - we need those hospital beds right now. \n\"So considering how things might escalate with Covid and the winter pressures that number of 500 is looking likely.\"  \nOne patient described the number of people coming in and out as \"mad\" and said she had been waiting so long she had seen three different shift changes. \n\"Staff are great, I have to give it to them - I sat here all last night with no sleep... looks like I will be here tonight again,\" she said.    \nLead emergency department nurse Jenny Nicholson said it was upsetting to see patients remaining in the department for several days. \n\"It's heartbreaking to leave them here in the ED knowing you are going to come back the next morning to see them again here,\" she said.\n\"While we are providing the care that they need, the plan is in place and we are following that plan, they are not in the bed where they should be, where they would get the right care from a specialist.\"\nDirector of hospital services David Robinson said that the sheer numbers of patients was having knock-on effects on the rest of the hospital - including on surgery. \n\"Some of our sickest patients require to be cared for in intensive care, so with every additional bed we've put up in intensive care, regrettably we have to close a theatre for that week, which means unfortunately, we have cancelled operations.\"\nHe appealed for everyone to get vaccinated and said that many of the Covid patients who were in the intensive care unit had not been. \n\"Just think about Christmas - it's for themselves, it's for their family, their neighbours but also for strangers - people they'll never meet, because for them, being in ICU means that surgery, unfortunately, has to be downturned.\"\nCovid and the pressures of dealing with it remain constant - just one corridor away from the general emergency department is a ward where people with the virus are treated. \nThe same doctors and nurses attend to them, pulling on additional items of personal protective equipment (PPE) as they move from one area to another, with a sense of organised calm.

      "tags": "Miscarriage,Pregnancy",
      "text": "Women who experience bleeding in early pregnancy and have had at least one miscarriage should be treated with the hormone progesterone.\nThe new guidance, from the health watchdog NICE, is based on research suggesting the treatment could lead to 8,450 more births each year in the UK. \nThe more miscarriages a woman had, the more effective progesterone was, the trial found.\nThe naturally occurring hormone helps prepare the womb for the growing baby.  \nAfter five miscarriages, Josie is now 15 weeks into her sixth pregnancy.\nIt is her longest so far - and while it is impossible to know for sure whether her progesterone treatment is the reason, it makes a big difference to how she feels.\n\"If this is what is going to make it OK for us\u2026 it's just miraculous,\" she says.\n\"All we've ever wanted is to become parents. \n\"So to actually get this far and to have the opportunity and have the progesterone, it gives us incredible hope.\" \nAbout one in five women experience bleeding, or spotting as it is sometimes called, in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. \nIt often causes no problems but they are advised to have it checked out with their doctor or midwife to be sure. \nSome may experience a \"threatened miscarriage\", where bleeding continues along with the pregnancy. \nMost are told to go home and wait and see what happens next.\nThe new National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends inserting progesterone pessaries into the vagina twice a day. \nDoctors at the Birmingham Women's Hospital prescribed it for Josie. \nA trial carried out by researchers at the Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriage Research which the new guidance is based on, found that progesterone didn't make much of a difference for women who just had bleeding and no previous miscarriages. \nBut the more miscarriages a woman had suffered, the more effective progesterone was. \nOne of those behind the Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriage Research research, Prof Arri Coomarasamy, from the University of Birmingham, said: \"This is a very significant moment. \n\"We have an intervention that works that can stop a miscarriage. \n\"This gives hope to thousands of couples throughout UK.\n\"But it's really important to appreciate that only some miscarriages can be prevented by progesterone. \n\"There are other causes for miscarriages. \n\"We still need to study them.\n\"We need to find other effective treatment.\"\nAbout one in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage - the vast majority in the first few months or trimester.\nRoyal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists president Dr Edward Morris said: \"It is positive that NICE has acknowledged the latest evidence. \n\"We do, however, still have a way to go before understanding the best treatments for women experiencing unexplained pregnancy loss and would welcome further research in this area.\"\nProfessor Gillian Leng, NICE's chief executive, said the research evidence \"is clear that progesterone will not be able to prevent every miscarriage\".\nBut she said it would be \"of benefit to some women, and as an inexpensive treatment option, can be made available to women on the NHS from today\".\nFollow Tulip on Twitter."

      "text": "When Andrew Williams was offered a placement at a family-run garage, it was only supposed to last a few weeks.\nBut the 49-year-old, who has Down's Syndrome, is now celebrating 30 years' work for the tyre fitter.\nHe has limited speech, and chats football with customers and jokes with suppliers, having found a role that suits his abilities.\nFigures show 54,000 people in Wales have a learning disability but, UK-wide, just 6% are in employment.\nLearning Disability Wales (LDW) wants the Welsh government to create a national job coaching service to support people into paid jobs. \n\"It's really important people have a job coach to support them through internships, apprenticeships and finally into permanent employment,\" chief executive Zoe Richards said.\nA Welsh government spokesman said it was determined to support more people with learning disabilities into work. \nMr Williams works at Heath Tyre Services every Tuesday, where part of his routine is clearing out waste bins and sorting recycling. \nAs a former member of the Great Britain Special Olympics canoeing team, he is physically strong and makes light work of manual tasks.\nHe is a popular member of the team and enjoys his role so much that, during lockdown last year, he video-called his boss every week to check whether the garage had reopened.\n\"They identified the correct student for the correct placement,\" said owner Andrew Evans about the decision of a social worker to send him.\n\"Andrew is quite accomplished. He can use many of the machines without us having to repeat any of the instructions to him.\n\"We always know when he has been here on a Tuesday as the workshop is spotless. Everything he does here is appreciated by other staff. He helps and pitches in.\"\nMr Williams lives on his own in supported accommodation but has difficulty communicating with people he does not know because of his speech.\nThe job is the sort of solid employment his family never expected him to have.\nHis mother, Anne Williams, thought the placement might only last a couple of weeks, but it became one of the pillars of his life.\n\"It's given him pride in himself,\" she said.\n\"He has some money which doesn't come from his benefits. He can spend it as he wants. It's made him sort of independent. He'll do anything to go to Heath Tyres to work.\"\nBut, as Mrs Williams readily admits, this sort of work opportunity for people with learning disabilities is not typical.\nLDW chief executive Ms Richards believes the Welsh government should implement quotas to make sure people with learning disabilities are fairly represented in the workforces of major employers like the Welsh NHS and local councils.\nShe said small and medium sized businesses were often better at taking on people with learning disabilities because of close community links.\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"We will publish a new employability strategy in the new year which will set out our plans to drive up employment rates even further.\n\"This will include working with key employers, such as the NHS, to improve the number of job opportunities available.\n\"We recognise the need for a job coaching approach and have been piloting a range of activities to support those with learning disabilities, such as our work on supported apprenticeships.\"\nHe added that between October 2020 and March 2021, \u00a3200,000 was made available for 16 to 18-year-olds to take part in specialist job coach services for six months. \n\"We have also supported a team of disabled people's employment champions who are in place to influence and strategically guide employers,\" the spokesman added.\n\"The champions are disabled people themselves who have lived experience of the barriers faced in gaining employment, and utilising their experience to advocate for employment of disabled people, promoting the social model of disability.\"\nFor the full story, watch Wales Live on BBC1 Wales at 22:30 GMT on Wednesday, or afterwards on BBC iPlayer."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nA bomb hoaxer who sent a suspicious package to a Covid vaccine plant has been jailed for two years and three months. Anthony Collins, 54, from Chatham, Kent, was convicted of posting the package to Oxford-AstraZeneca's factory in Wrexham, with the intention of making people believe it was likely to explode or ignite. Some 120 people had to stop manufacturing vaccines and bomb disposal teams found no explosives. \nPoland has recorded more than 25,000 daily infections for the first time since April, as much of Europe battles a fourth wave of the pandemic. There were 28,380 new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours - a 17% increase from cases reported a week ago - and 460 coronavirus-related deaths. The government has so far been reluctant to introduce more restrictions, citing street protests in the Netherlands and Austria. But earlier this week, Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said restrictions could be reintroduced if the infection rate did not begin to fall by mid-December.\nA Bill to create a legal process to settle disputes between commercial tenants and their landlords for rent arrears accrued during the pandemic has had its second reading the Commons. The Commercial Rent (Coronavirus) Bill is aimed at bringing a \"swift\" resolution to rent disputes after businesses in England and Wales were forced to close during the pandemic. The government is aiming for the Bill to become law by 25 March, when some temporary measures to help businesses falling behind on rent are due to expire.\nPeople in Northern Ireland have been urged to behave responsibly and \"save Christmas\" as emergency departments in the country come under heavy pressure. Andrew Dobbin, a consultant at Ulster Hospital, said the stream of very sick patients turning up at the emergency department was \"relentless\". The director of hospital services, David Robinson, urged people to get vaccinated, as many of the Covid patients in the intensive care unit had not been. \nConsumers could face a reduced food choice this Christmas because of supply chain issues, MPs have been warned. Shane Brennan, head of the Cold Chain Federation, said suppliers were scaling back plans to ensure they could deliver. The federation represents firms involved in the storage and distribution of chilled and frozen products. The coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes have been blamed for contributing to lorry driver shortages.  \nWhen should you get a test - and how do you get tested?

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nNew Zealand has unveiled plans to reopen its borders and allow foreigners to enter next year. Fully vaccinated visitors can enter from 30 April, but will have to self-isolate for seven days. More New Zealanders will be allowed to travel home from early next year as well, under similar rules. The move eases strict curbs that have locked out many citizens and tourists since the start of the pandemic. New Zealand is moving away from its ultra-strict \"Zero Covid\" strategy introduced in 2020.\nA further 700,000 people could die of Covid in Europe by March, the World Health Organization has warned. Some 1.5 million people have already died in the 53 countries inside the WHO's Europe region, which includes Israel, Russia and former Soviet countries in Asia. Now the WHO says that figure could hit 2.2 million if current trends continue.\nA gym owner has been fined for keeping her business open while coronavirus restrictions were in place last year. Michelle Meade-Wyatt, 46, admitted keeping The Ripped Gym in Harlow open in November last year. She was fined \u00a31,000 and ordered to pay costs at Colchester Magistrates' Court. Essex was in tier two restrictions at the time, which meant gyms were banned from operating.\nA 16-year-old girl who just missed out on being eligible for the Covid vaccine in August has urged other teenagers to have the jab, after being in hospital for four months. Areeb Khan, from Chadwell Heath in Essex, began having symptoms at the end of July. She now needs to re-learn how to walk and has been forced to delay taking her A-levels. \"I've been in hospital so long, I just want to do normal things,\" she says.\n\"The nurses move around, fixing blankets and pulling curtains to protect patient dignity.

      "tags": "Georgia,Racism,United States",
      "text": "Three white men have been found guilty of killing a black jogger last year in a case that became a rallying cry to racial justice protesters.\nAhmaud Arbery, 25, was shot on 23 February 2020 in a confrontation with Travis and Gregory McMichael and their neighbour, William Bryan.\nThe defendants said they acted in self-defence during a citizen's arrest; prosecutors said race was a factor.  \nThe men now face minimum sentences of life in prison.\nA mainly white jury of 12 people deliberated for about 10 hours before returning their verdict at around midday on Wednesday.\nThe trio were found guilty of murder, aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal intent to commit a felony. \nIn February the three men will face another trial in a federal hate crimes case, alleging that they targeted Arbery because he was black.\nArbery was out jogging in the afternoon on the outskirts of the coastal city of Brunswick in Georgia.\nThe elder McMichael, a neighbourhood resident, told police he believed Arbery resembled the suspect in a series of burglaries in the suburban community of Satilla Shores. \nPolice have said no reports were filed regarding these alleged break-ins, and no stolen property was found in Arbery's possession.\nThe McMichaels armed themselves with a pistol and a shotgun and pursued Arbery, who was unarmed, in a pickup truck through the neighbourhood. Bryan later joined the pursuit. \nThe jury heard a 911 call in which the elder McMichael told an operator: \"I'm out here in Satilla Shores. There's a black male running down the street.\"\nThe younger McMichael testified during the trial that he tried to talk to Arbery while the two were still in their truck and Arbery never responded. \nHe got out of the truck and fired his shotgun at Arbery during a struggle. Travis McMichael claimed self-defence, saying Arbery grabbed at his gun. \nThree shots were fired.\nA post-mortem examination showed Arbery had two gunshot wounds in his chest, and a gunshot graze wound on the inside of one of his wrists.\nGregory McMichael, 65, his son Travis, 35, and their neighbour William \"Roddie\" Bryan, 52, were arrested in May 2020. \nProsecutors alleged that Travis McMichael used a racial epithet and an expletive directed at Arbery as he lay on the ground. The men deny racism.\nBy Aleem Maqbool, BBC News\nIn making their case, prosecutors may have chosen not to overtly focus on the fact that Ahmaud Arbery was a black man and his killers were white, but it is not hard to see why this murder has been widely viewed through the lens of race. \nArbery's parents had been upset by the way defence lawyers portrayed their son as having been in the wrong for running away from the armed strangers and for turning to try to fight for his life when they cornered him.\nThe fact that these men viewed Arbery as a threat, though they had no evidence he had done anything illegal; that they felt they had the right to arm themselves and chase him; that when police officers arrived on the scene they comforted the killers, not immediately tending to the young man who lay writhing on the ground; the fact that no arrests were made for more than 10 weeks and only then after a video of the killing went viral, all look to many observers as vestiges of a brutal bygone age.\nOutside court on Wednesday dozens of people, some displaying Black Lives Matter signs, cheered as the verdicts were read.\nArbery's father, Marcus Arbery, was seen crying and hugging supporters.\n\"He didn't do nothing,\" the father said, \"but run and dream.\"\nHe also told reporters: \"We conquered the lynch mob.\"\nArbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, thanked the crowd and said she did not think she would see this day.\n\"It's been a long fight. It's been a hard fight. But God is good,\" she said. Of her son, she said: \"He will now rest in peace.\"\nArbery was enrolled at a technical college to study to become an electrician at the time of his death.\nThe Rev Al Sharpton, a civil rights figure and cable TV host, said outside court: \"Let the word go forth all over the world, that a jury of 11 whites and one black in the Deep South stood up in a courtroom and said that black lives do matter.\"\nAfter learning his fate, Travis McMichael turned as he stood to leave court and mouthed to his mother: \"Love you.\"\nProsecutor Linda Dunikoski said: \"The jury system works in this country, and when you present the truth to people and they see it, they will do the right thing.\"\nBryan's attorney, Kevin Gough, said his team was \"disappointed with the verdict, but we respect it\". \nUS President Joe Biden said the convictions showed that America's criminal justice system is \"doing its job\". \nBut he added that the killing was \"a devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country\".\nVideo was central to this case. \nThe first key piece of footage was a 36-second mobile phone clip showing Arbery's death.\nThat was filmed by William Bryan, who was in a vehicle following Arbery, and it surfaced publicly on 5 May 2020.\nThe clip shows Arbery trying to bypass a pickup truck ahead of him on the road and then struggling with Travis McMichael. There is muffled shouting and three gunshots are heard.\nThe elder McMichael is seen standing in the bed of the pickup as the pair struggle. \nThe clip sparked a nationwide outcry and was swiftly followed by criminal charges. \nFive days later footage from a surveillance camera emerged, showing a black man in a white T-shirt - believed to be Arbery - at a home construction site shortly before the shooting.\nHe is seen walking on to the site and looking around for a few minutes before jogging down the street.\nDuring the trial, the site's owner, Larry English Jr, testified that the man in question had not disturbed or damaged his property during the visit.\nMr English said cameras had spotted other people - including children and a white couple - trespassing on his property, but he never authorised the McMichaels to enter his property or confront anyone.\nJurors were also shown police bodycam footage from the aftermath of the shooting."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has been criticised after he lost his place in a speech to British businesses leaders and referred to the children's cartoon Peppa Pig.\nSpeaking to the CBI conference, the PM also quoted Lenin and performed an impression of a car.\nHalting his speech led to an awkward 21 seconds of apologies and paper shuffling from the Tory leader.\nLabour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, called the speech \"shambolic\".\nShe added: \"No one was laughing, because the joke's not funny anymore.\"\nA senior Downing Street source told the BBC: \"Business was really looking for leadership today and it was shambolic.\"\nThey added there was \"a lot of concern inside the building\" about Mr Johnson.\n\"Cabinet needs to wake up and demand serious changes otherwise it'll keep getting worse. If they don't insist, he just won't do anything about it.\"\nA Downing Street spokesperson pointed out that CBI head Tony Danker had welcomed the PM's words on the private sector working with the government.\nMr Johnson's 25-minute speech to assembled business leaders focused on levelling up, but also took some awkward turns as the prime minister tried to fuel enthusiasm for his green industrial revolution. \nAfter saying government \"cannot fix everything\" and that \"the true driver of growth is not government but the energy and dynamism and originality of the private sector\", Mr Johnson turned to CBI chief Mr Danker and said: \"Yesterday I went, as we all must, to Peppa Pig World.\"\nHe asked the audience for a show of hands for who had been to the Hampshire attraction, and after saying \"not enough\", the PM continued.\n\"I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,\" he said. \n\"Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. \n\"It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig.\"\nMr Johnson added: \"The real lesson for me going to Peppa Pig World... was about the power of UK creativity. \n\"Who would have believed a pig who looks like... a Picasso like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC, would now be exported to 180 countries and theme parks both in America and China, as well as in the New Forest and be a business worth at least \u00a36bn to this country and counting. \n\"I think that is pure genius don't you? No government in the world, no Whitehall civil servant, would have conceivably come up with Peppa.\"\nLiberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: \"Businesses are crying out for clarity. Instead, all they got was Boris Johnson rambling on about Peppa Pig.\n\"It is a perfect metaphor for Johnson's chaotic, incompetent government as it trashes our economy, but it is not worthy of a British prime minister.\"\nDuring the section in the speech on electric cars, accompanied by a potted history of his career as a motoring correspondent, Mr Johnson launched into a seemingly well-practised impression of a car. \n\"[Electric vehicles] may not burble like sucking doves,\" he said. \"And they may not have that 'vrrrom vrrrom raaah raaah' that you like.\n\"But they have so much torque that they move off the lights faster than a Ferrari.\"\nThe PM then moved onto his personal 10 point plan to support businesses going greener in the future. \nBut he made an ambitious jump when he appeared to compare himself to Moses as he \"came down from [Mount] Sinai and [told] my officials [about] the new 10 commandments\" - pledges including more investment in wind power and hydrogen technologies. \nThat was still less of a surprise than a Conservative prime minister, known for his quotations, turning to a Russian revolutionary to drive his point home.\n\"Lenin once said that the Communist Revolution was Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country,\" he told the crowd.\n\"Well, I hesitate to quote Lenin before the Confederation of British Industry, but the coming industrial revolution is green power plus the electrification of the whole country.\"\nAfter urging people back to office, saying there were \"reasons why Mother Nature does not like working from home\", the PM then lost his place in his speech\nWhat followed was 21 seconds of silence, filled with the occasional mumble of \"forgive me\" and much ruffling of papers.\nBut he returned to his script to talk about building up skills and the government's Integrated Rail Plan, which despite a raft of critical coverage, he claimed it would be \"transformatory\".\nAfter questions on other issues of the day - the government's announcements on rail, and criticism of plans for the social care cap - Mr Johnson left the stage.\nBut later, before heading back to Downing Street, the PM gave an interview to a reporter, who simply asked: \"Is everything OK?\"\nMr Johnson said he thought people had \"got the vast majority of the points\" he wanted to make and that the speech \"went over well\"."

      "text": "A bomb hoaxer who sent a suspicious package to a Covid jab plant has been jailed for two years and three months.\nAnthony Collins, 54, from Chatham, Kent, was convicted of posting an article to the factory in Wrexham, with the intention of inducing the belief it was likely to explode or ignite.\nThe parcel caused 120 people to stop manufacturing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine at the factory in January.\nHe denied the charge but was found guilty following trial.\nBomb disposal teams successfully detonated the parcel but found no explosive material. \nInstead, the package contained a calculator, a garden glove, four batteries, a \"yellow biohazard bar\", a service wipe and a quantity of paper.\nBut a supermarket receipt and a letter revealed Collins to be the culprit who sent the parcel.\u00a0\nCCTV also captured Collins buying the items and a transaction record was obtained by police. \nCollins admitted sending the package without being prompted to but denied intending to create a bomb scare, claiming he believed the items he was posting would be useful to workers at the factory.\nHowever, he did admit that he knew his actions might cause alarm.\nWockhardt, a global pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, was providing fill-and-finish services for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the final stage of putting the vaccine into vials.\nDet Insp Adam Marshall, of Kent Police, said: \"Collins was fully aware of the impact his actions would have and chose to impede the vaccine rollout when the programme was still in its infancy. \n\"Although the device he sent was not a viable explosive, the people at the site had every reason to believe there was a threat to their safety and they acted in a diligent and thoroughly appropriate way.\""

      "tags": "Calais migrant crisis,UK immigration,France,English Channel,People smuggling,Europe migrant crisis,Calais",
      "text": "Efforts are under way to identify 27 people who drowned crossing the English Channel. \nTheir deaths have raised questions about why so many people are attempting the journey despite the dangerous conditions.\nFor years, people smugglers have sent people to the UK in lorries. There have also been tragedies on these routes, including the 39 Vietnamese people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in 2019.\nBut security at the Port of Calais in France - where UK border controls are - has been tightened.\nThis means more attempts are being made to send people by boat, according to Tony Smith, former director general of UK Border Force.\nHe says Covid has also had a role, as fewer lorries have been travelling to the UK: \"Human smugglers have changed their tactics and they've now taken to this relatively new phenomenon of putting people into small boats and bringing them across in that way.\"\nIn the few studies that exist, family ties have been identified as the main reason migrants wish to travel from France to the UK.\nIn a survey of 402 people at the former Calais \"Jungle\" camp, researchers from the International Health journal found only 12% wanted to remain in France, while 82% planned to go to England. \nOf those that wanted to travel to England more than half (52%), said they already had a family member there.\n\"They have a connection to the UK, they speak some English, they have family, they have friends and people in their networks. They want to come and stay and rebuild their lives,\" says Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council.\nIt has been suggested the UK's jobs market often attracts migrants - a claim supported by the French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin. There aren't reliable surveys to support this though. \nMarley Morris, an immigration expert at the IPPR think tank says the UK has introduced policies that make it much harder to work illegally.\n\"These arguments were put forward 20 years ago, when people said the UK system was too generous. The UK responded by tightening up the rules. \n\"While we don't have ID cards, the policies introduced make it much harder to work illegally, [and] employers are fined for employing someone for not having the right to work.\" \nAs well as language and family ties, some Calais-based migrants told the BBC they wanted to come to the UK due to historic links with their own country. \nSome also expressed unhappiness at the way they are being treated in France, which can lead to more people attempting to make the crossing according to Rob McNeil, deputy director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University.\n\"Imagine you are being poorly treated in the country you are in. Your presumption is that the immediate environment is unpleasant and you want to get away from that\", he says.\nIt's unlikely that migrants choose to come to the UK because they feel they have less chance of being sent back compared to other European countries adds Mr McNeil.\n\"One thing we know is that the data suggests that people travelling to any country have very little knowledge of the laws and practices of enforcing immigration,\" he says.  \nDespite the dangers, some say they have already taken significant risks to get as far as Calais and are willing to take further ones to get to the UK. For example, the International Health journal study also found that two-thirds of people had experienced at least one act of violence during their journey or in Calais.\nMany migrants already choose to make an asylum claim in the first country they arrive in - such as Greece, Turkey or Italy - and only a minority choose to travel on to the UK.\nLast year, Germany had the highest number of asylum applicants in the EU (122,015 applicants), while France had 93,475 applicants.\nIn the same period the UK received the 5th largest number of applicants (36,041) when compared with countries in the EU (around 7% of the total). This represents the 17th largest intake when measured per head of population, according to UN Refugee Agency."

      "tags": "Social care",
      "text": "Boris Johnson said his speech to the CBI conference had \"gone over well\".\nReally? The prime minister has always played up the characteristics that set him apart from most politicians: gags, gaffes, informality, a shirt that's not quite tucked in. Given where he's ended up, with a historic majority, it hasn't exactly served him badly.\nIndeed for his backers it's precisely that personality that appeals to so many voters - he's not the same as the grey, managerial class of politician which provokes so many cries of \"They're all the same\".\nBut was his rambling appearance at the lectern on Monday any different? The prime minister lost his place in his notes, appeared to be side-tracked about his visit to Peppa Pig World and at one point seemed to compare himself to the Biblical figure of Moses.  It even prompted one reporter to ask Mr Johnson: \"Is everything OK?\"\nEveryone can have a bad day at the office, of course. And on a different occasion the Tories might have been able to laugh off what happened. But being asked how you are is not the kind of question that any prime minister would want to be posed.\nAnd many Conservatives are querying exactly what is going on in Downing Street at the moment.\nAfter a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Mr Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like.\nBut that is really not what panned out. If anything it gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place.\nOn Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable.\nThe vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. There is a tribe of Conservative MPs not angry enough to beat its political masters, but disappointed enough to withhold full support.\nThere is also tangible concern about what is going on in Downing Street. One senior MP and former minister, a friend of Mr Johnson, said there were \"amateurs\" in Number 10 and complained about shortfalls in the operation.\nOthers, even inside Downing Street, are urging cabinet ministers to insist on improvements, saying: \"There is a lot of concern in the building... It's just not working.\" \nMr Johnson's political style does not rely on things always going smoothly, and the idea that the huge commitments this government has made would be pushed through without political disquiet is nonsensical.\nBut the prime minister's list of problems seems only to grow. His party's faith in his power to fix them seems to be going the other way.\nWhat neither his backers or detractors can be sure of is whether this autumn is the beginning of a significant slide or a nasty, and perhaps predictable, case of mid-term blues."

      "tags": "Wisconsin,United States",
      "text": "A man accused of ramming a car into Christmas parade-goers in Wisconsin on Sunday is to be charged with six deaths after another victim - a child - died.\nDarrell Brooks, 39, wept in court as he was charged with five counts of intentional homicide. Prosecutors said further charges would be filed. \nPolice say Brooks drove in a \"zig-zag pattern\" to hit as many people as possible at the Waukesha parade. \nBail was set at $5m (\u00a33.7m) due to his extensive criminal background. \nThe boy killed was eight-year-old Jackson Sparks, who was hit alongside his 12-year-old brother, Tucker. \nHe had been marching with his baseball team when he was struck. A GoFundMe page said Jackson underwent brain surgery on Sunday and needed \"a miracle\". \nHis brother, who suffered a fractured skull, is expected by family members to recover. Tucker was among 62 people injured, 18 of whom are children. \nThe children's Waukesha Xtreme Dance Team said its dancers had suffered a \"multitude of serious physical injuries\", and five were in intensive care. \nDuring Tuesday's court appearance, Judge Kevin Costello said the $5m bail was due to the suspect's \"extraordinary\" criminal history and because he had fled previous charges in Wisconsin and Nevada. \n\"I have not seen anything like this in my very long career,\" Judge Costello said.\nThe other victims have been named as Virginia Sorenson, 79; LeAnna Owen, 71; Jane Kulich, 52; Wilhelm Hospel, 81; and Tamara Durand, 52. \nA medical examiner has concluded they died of \"multiple blunt force injuries\", according to a criminal complaint released on Tuesday.\nThe complaint said Brooks ignored officers' attempts to make him leave the parade route before accelerating his vehicle into the crowd.\nOne officer said the driver looked like he \"had no emotion on his face\".\nPolice said the red Ford Escape SUV \"appeared to be intentionally moving side to side\" and witnesses felt this was \"a direct intent to hit as many parade participants\".\nOne officer shot three rounds into the SUV, but failed to stop it. Brooks was not hit by the bullets, police have said.\nA local homeowner has told CBS news that, shortly after the attack, the suspect knocked on his door asking to come inside and use his phone. \nThe resident, who said Brooks looked \"thin and cold\", made him a sandwich and let him borrow a jacket, not yet knowing of the parade attack himself. \nDaniel Rider said he asked Brooks to leave after about 10 minutes,\u00a0when he started \"getting real nervous\" because a police car was driving up and down the street. \nDuring Tuesday's court appearance, Brooks wore an anti-suicide smock and cried as the judge informed him that each crime carries a sentence of life in prison. \nPolice have said Brooks had left the scene of a domestic dispute minutes before driving into the parade route.\nTwo days before the parade attack, he posted bail after being charged with running over the mother of his child in a domestic dispute earlier this month. \nMilwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm said he was reviewing that bail amount of $1,000 to determine if it was set \"inappropriately\" low. \nAt the time Brooks paid his bail for that allegation, he was already on bail awaiting trial for allegedly firing a gun at his nephew and another person during a dispute.\nRecords show that he has been charged with 10 crimes since 1997. \nWitnesses have told BBC News the attack has horrified the community of 72,000 people located to the west of Milwaukee.\nTailyr\u00a0Medrano, a Waukesha resident who was attending the parade with her one-year-old son, said at a vigil for victims on Monday night that she was \"feet\" away from getting hit. \n\"I watched people going down right in front of me and people fly off the hood of the car. Just images that I will never forget,\" she said.  "

      "tags": "Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's vaccine passport system will not be extended to more venues, Nicola Sturgeon has announced.\nThe first minister had been considering expanding the scheme to cover cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues.\nBut she told MSPs that it would not be proportionate to do so, with case numbers having fallen slightly.\nPeople will be allowed to present a negative test rather than proof of two jabs to enter venues that are already covered by the scheme from 6 December.\nThese include nightclubs and large events such as some football matches and concerts, and would bring Scotland's system into line with others in countries like Wales. \nMs Sturgeon said taking a lateral flow test before socialising with others over the festive period was a \"vitally important\" step in minimising the spread of the virus.\nA decision on adding more venues to the scheme had been expected for several weeks, with Ms Sturgeon previously telling MSPs that it could help \"get through what will be a challenging winter without having to reintroduce restrictions on trade\".\nThe government published an evidence paper which suggested Scotland faced a choice between either extending the vaccine passport system or closing down venues and limiting the number of people who can meet up.\nHowever, ministers ultimately decided to do neither after studying the latest data at a meeting of Ms Sturgeon's cabinet on Tuesday morning.\nThe first minister said that while Scotland was still in a precarious position, with \"significant and sustained\" pressure on the NHS, the data was actually \"more positive than we might have expected it to be\".\nMs Sturgeon said the spread of the virus had stabilised - with the average number of new cases recorded each day falling by about 3% over the past week.\nShe said that given the \"inevitable impact vaccine certification has on the operation of businesses\", ministers had concluded that extending the scheme would therefore not be proportionate.\nHowever, venues which remain covered by the scheme will be allowed to accept a negative lateral flow test instead of proof of vaccination from 6 December - as already happens in many other countries that have introduced vaccine passports.\nMs Sturgeon said this had originally been left out of the scheme to help drive up vaccination rates, but that high uptake rates meant testing could now be included as an alternative.\nThe first minister also urged people to get vaccinated before socialising over the festive period, saying: \"You could well be saving your own life, and the lives of your loved ones.\n\"You will be helping the NHS, and you will be maximising our chances of getting through this winter without the need for further restrictions.\"\nHospitality bosses had warned that pubs and restaurants could face an \"avalanche of cancellations\" if the certification scheme had been extended over the normally busy Christmas period.\nBusiness group CBI Scotland welcomed the decision not to do so, with director Tracy Black saying it \"strikes the right balance between managing the virus and protecting our economy recovery\".\nShe said: \"Many firms would have faced practical challenges and increased costs to implement measures at a time when bumper trading is needed to claw back lost or diminished revenues.\"\nThe Federation of Small Businesses described the decision as a \"relief\", saying firms \"will now have a weight off their shoulders\".\nAnd the Scottish Retail Consortium said businesses would be \"delighted to see a reprieve from further restrictions\", praising ministers for listening to representations from industry.\nNicola Sturgeon tends to signal well in advance what changes to Covid rules might be coming. Over the last two weeks, she and her deputy have made clear that extending the use of vaccine certification to further venues was a serious prospect.\nA Scottish government evidence paper went as far as to suggest that in order to suppress Covid more, ministers faced a choice between wider use of certification and lockdown-style measures.\nBut today's statement from the first minister has stopped short of taking either option at this stage, taking account of pushback from business and relatively stable case numbers.\nInstead, they are counting on continued use of existing measures like vaccination and mask wearing and an appeal for greater use of home testing to stop the NHS being overwhelmed.\nAccepting lateral flow tests as well as proof of vaccination for entry to venues that already require certification aligns the Scottish scheme more closely with Wales and Northern Ireland. \nOpposition parties - who have questioned whether vaccine passports are effective - said the move amounted to a government u-turn after weeks of speculation about the scheme being expanded.\nScottish Conservative health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane said ministers seemed to be \"making it up as they go along\".\nHe said: \"The uncertainty that this government has left hanging over businesses for the last two weeks has been unnecessary and unacceptable.\"\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the government had been \"determined to be seen to be doing something, rather than doing the right thing\".\nHe added: \"We have spent months pursuing the incorrect priority. The government's own evidence shows there is no real evidence of an increase in uptake of the vaccine, and transmission has not fallen.\n\"I welcome the change to include a negative test from now on but frankly we are in this position because the government couldn't accept it was wrong and move in the right direction.\"\nMs Sturgeon said Mr Sarwar was \"fundamentally wrong\", saying allowing the use of tests in the system earlier would have \"undermined the central primary objective of the scheme\", of driving up the vaccination rate.\nMeanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government's evidence paper was \"mince\", and claimed that ministers had caused \"weeks of uncertainty and panic\" for businesses."

      "text": "Sweden's first ever female prime minister has resigned just hours after she was appointed. \nMagdalena Andersson, was announced as leader on Wednesday but resigned after her coalition partner quit the government and her budget failed to pass. \nInstead, parliament voted for a budget drawn up by the opposition which includes the anti-immigrant far right. \n\"I have told the speaker that I wish to resign,\" Ms Andersson told reporters.\nHer coalition partner, the Green Party said it could not accept a budget \"drafted for the first time with the far-right\". \nMs Andersson said that she hoped to try to become prime minister again as a single party government leader. \n\"There is a constitutional practice that a coalition government should resign when one party quits,\" the Social Democrat said on Wednesday. \"I don't want to lead a government whose legitimacy will be questioned. \nThe speaker of parliament said he would contact party leaders on the next move. \nMs Andersson was elected as prime minister earlier on Wednesday because under Swedish law, she only needed a majority of MPs not to vote against her. \nA hundred years after Swedish women were given the vote, the 54-year-old Social Democrat leader was given a standing ovation by sections of the parliament, or Riksdag.\nHer election at the head of a minority government followed an 11th-hour deal with the opposition Left party, in exchange for higher pensions for many Swedes. She also secured the support of coalition partner the Greens.\nOf the 349 members of the Riksdag, 174 voted against her. But on top of the 117 MPs who backed Ms Andersson, a further 57 abstained, giving her victory by a single vote.\nA former junior swimming champion from the university city of Uppsala, she began her political career in 1996 as political adviser to then-Prime Minister Goran Persson. She has spent the past seven years as finance minister.\nBefore MPs backed Magdalena Andersson, Sweden was the only Nordic state never to have a woman as PM.\nBecoming the first woman prime minister in Swedish history should have been cause for a night of celebration for Magdalena Andersson, yet the sun had barely set when she handed in her notice. \nThe complexities of Swedish politics mean we can't assume we've seen the last of her, though. If there's another prime ministerial vote, Ms Andersson will probably get voted in again. This is because the Green Party has promised to support her, despite quitting as a formal coalition partner. But she'd end up in a vulnerable position at the helm of a fragile minority government, and would still have to stick to the right-wing budget already voted on by parliament.\nWhat all this political chaos has underlined is just how divided Swedish politics is right now. We'll have to wait and see whether voters break the deadlock with a significant shift to the right or the left at next year's elections."

It has enhanced security features, such as thermodynamic ink to prevent forgery, as well as a QR code, and will be valid for three months.\nA QR code verifier app was made available to venues, enabling staff to check a customer's QR code.\nThose who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons will be able to show a document confirming that they are exempt. While under-18s are exempt from the scheme, they may need to show proof of age.\nPeople coming from elsewhere in the UK can show their vaccination status with the NHS App (if from England or Wales) or the Covidcert NI app (if from Northern Ireland) - or via paper letters of certification.\nWhile initially there was no clear definition of what constituted a nightclub, the government later provided some clarification.\nThe vaccine certification scheme applies to any venue that meets all four of the criteria:\nPotentially, a 200-capacity nightclub could be asking for a vaccine passport while a pub next door, with a larger capacity and music playing into the early hours of the morning without dancing or a designated dance floor operating, avoids having to ask customers for their vaccine status.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that the rules will be applied in a spirit of pragmatism. As an example, she said a venue required to check vaccine certification at night would not have to check customers coming in for a pub lunch 12 hours earlier.\nThe scheme in England applies to the same venues that are covered in Scotland.\nPeople can only enter if they can show an NHS Covid Pass confirming they have received two doses of an approved vaccine (or a single-dose of Janssen vaccine); a negative PCR or rapid lateral flow test (LFT) result within the last 48 hours; or proof that they have a medical exemption or are taking part in a clinical trial.\nIn Wales, people need to show their NHS Covid Pass or a negative LFT result within the last 24 hours to gain entry to cinemas, theatres and concert halls.\nPrior to the current restrictions, the scheme also applied to nightclubs and comparable venues, unseated indoor live events for more than 500 people, unseated outdoor live events for more than 4,000 people and any event for more than 10,000 people.\nThe Covid passport scheme in Northern Ireland applies to pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres - as well as nightclubs and large events which are currently closed.\nPeople can either show proof of vaccination, proof of a negative lateral flow test taken in the previous 48 hours, or proof of a positive PCR test taken in the previous 30-180 days.\nThe COVIDCert NI app can be used to show proof of vaccination, or a paper version can be requested."

      "text": "Children as young as 11 are learning about sex from pornography, sexual health experts have said.\nThey say they are seeing an increasing number of young people who believe sex needs to be violent as a result.\nDr Kate Howells is concerned a lack of detail in plans for a new relationship and sex education (RSE) curriculum could see inconsistent teaching.\nThe Welsh government said \"online safety, consent and sexual health\" were all included in proposals.\nIf approved in the Senedd in December, details of the RSE code will be published in January.  \nIt would then be introduced to schools in September 2022 as mandatory learning for all pupils aged three to 16.\nDr Howells, an associate specialist in sexual health working in Bridgend, Swansea and Neath Port Talbot, believes the biggest change in teaching young people about sex education is access to digital devices.\n\"Pornography is often only one or two clicks away,\" she said.\n\"For those as young as 10 or 11, it might be their first sexual experience.\"\nResearch by the British Board of Film Classification also shows more than 60% of children aged 11 to 13 who had seen pornography said it was unintentional. \nA mother, who shared her experiences with the NSPCC, said she found hundreds of messages which were \"sexual in nature\" on her 13-year-old daughter's phone as well as \"pornographic cartoons and videos\".\nA 16-year-old said she was worried she had become addicted to porn after watching it every night since someone \"dared\" her to watch it in Year 7.\nDr Howells believes such experiences mean some children are learning about sex from porn without the context of being in a caring relationship.\n\"We are seeing more young people think that sex needs to be violent,\" she added.\n\"It's often exaggerated and unrealistic and it could have a massive detrimental effect on young people if it isn't addressed.\"\nDr Jasmin Khan Singh, associate specialist in sexual medicine and sexual health at Cardiff Royal Infirmary, said often many young people are in disbelief that pornography is not realistic.\n\"You have to tell them the world is very different to what they're seeing online. They haven't got the developmental capacity to make sense of it,\" she said.\nBoth experts have welcomed the fact online safety has been included in the draft guidance, but stress the importance of the curriculum tackling the effects of pornography and the dangers of digital devices.\nDr Howells said: \"I think sometimes young people view porn as their sex education if they feel like they're not getting the information they need from elsewhere, that's where they'll look too to learn.\nSophie Whitehead, a former secondary school teacher who now works with the School of Sexuality Education, helps provide in-school workshops across Wales, England and Scotland about sexual health, pornography and positive relationships. \nShe said: \"We teach the differences between what they see in pornography and what they can expect in their own sexual experiences.\" \nMrs Whitehead said access to digital devices has had an impact on what they now teach in lessons.\n\"In the last couple of years there's been probably an increase in experiences of receiving unsolicited explicit pictures,\" she added. \n\"We've started having more conversations about that and work with schools on how they approach it.\"  \nHowever, she said it was not always easy for teachers in schools to talk to children about these topics.\n\"It's so difficult and really challenging, especially for teachers who don't necessarily have these conversations in their own day to day lives,\" said Mrs Whitehead. \n\"There needs to be a real focus on training for teachers so that they can feel confident when teaching these topics.\"\nIn January it was confirmed parents would no longer be able to withdraw children from sex education classes.\n\"We believe that all young people should have the right to access information that keeps them safe from harm,\" a Welsh government spokesman said.\n\"High quality RSE will help increase safety and well-being for all learners, and understanding of safe, consensual, equitable and positive relationships.\"\nHe added it has been designed to \"recognise learners' needs and experiences\", adding: \"Online safety, consent and sexual health are all included in the code at developmentally appropriate stages and are handled in a sensitive way.\"\nFor the full story, watch Wales Live on BBC1 Wales at 22:30 GMT on Wednesday\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by any of the issues in this article, information and support is available via the BBC Action Line."

      "text": "A survivor of the Windrush scandal has said he and others will continue to fight for compensation, as MPs call for the Home Office to be stripped of running the payment scheme.\nJohnny Samuels suggested the Home Office could be waiting for survivors to die before they were compensated.\nMost who applied had yet to get a penny four years since the scandal emerged, a Home Affairs Committee report said.\nA Home Office minister said removing it from the scheme could add more delays.\nKevin Foster, minister for Future Borders and Immigration, said the Home Office was increasing the number of case staff working on the compensation scheme - from 80 to 114. It is also looking to work with community groups and expanding in-person drop-in sessions, he added. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, he said removing the compensation scheme \"from the department with the most expertise in this area\" would \"potentially just add further delays in the process\".\nMr Foster insisted the scheme was \"not an adversarial process about defending the Home Office against all claims\" but about \"working with the claimant to find out the impact on them\".\nThe Windrush scandal saw thousands of UK residents - most of whom were originally from the Caribbean - wrongly classed as illegal immigrants.\nIt resulted in thousands wrongly being denied healthcare, housing or the right to work - or being held detained or deported by immigration officials.\nIt affected people from the Windrush generation, who arrived in the UK from Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1971.\nThey were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971, but thousands were children who had travelled on their parents' passports.\nBecause of this, many were unable to prove they had the right to live in the country when \"hostile environment\" immigration policies - demanding documentation be shown - began in 2012.\nMr Samuels was eight when he moved from Jamaica to the UK in 1964, after his parents came to \"rebuild Britain\", he said. \nHe told BBC Breakfast he had been shocked to receive letters telling him he could no longer work and he had to leave.\n\"After 55 years in the UK, working and doing positive good, then the Home Office letter [arrived] telling me I'm an illegal immigrant and giving me six weeks to leave the country\", he said.\nThe \"embarrassment\" of being ordered to leave the country while he was at work is a \"stigma [that] doesn't go away\" he said, adding that colleagues believed he was an illegal immigrant.\nMr Samuels, who lives in Coventry, said he was \"still in limbo\" when it came to receiving compensation, adding: \"It really makes you wonder, is this carrot real, is it going to happen before we're put into the grave, and I think that sometimes that is what the Home Office is waiting for.\"\nHe vowed that \"justice delayed is not going to be justice denied\" and that Windrush survivors would \"keeping fighting until our last breath\", even if this meant marching in the streets.\nEchoing calls by MPs for the scheme to be removed from Home Office control, Mr Samuels called on the home secretary and the prime minister to act.\nHe said: \"Why is it taking so long for us... to receive justice?\n\"I am sick and tired of being sick and tired of this matter.\n\"Priti Patel, Boris [Johnson], do something, because we are not going to die.\"\nThe cross-party Home Affairs Committee found that an official scheme launched in 2019 to compensate people affected had now become a further trauma for people applying, with a \"litany of flaws\" in its design and operation.\nIt concluded there were excessive burdens on claimants, inadequate staffing and long delays - and many of those affected \"are still too fearful of the Home Office to apply\".\nThe MPs recommended an \"independent organisation\" should be handed responsibility for running the scheme, to \"increase trust and encourage more applicants\".\nThe scheme contains many of the same bureaucratic insensitivities that led to the Windrush scandal in the first place, the report concluded. \nThe Home Office took too long to engage at grassroots level to build trust in the scheme, it added.\nSuch delays mean that by September 2021, only one in five of an estimated 15,000 eligible claimants had applied to the scheme and only a quarter of these had received compensation.\nThe MPs highlighted the fact that 23 individuals died before receiving any compensation. \nThe politicians welcomed changes made to the scheme in December 2020 to speed up payments - but said these \"were long overdue\" and did not go far enough.\n\"It is truly shocking how few people have received any compensation for the hardship they endured at the hands of the Home Office,\" said Yvette Cooper, who is chairwoman of the committee. \n\"Urgent action is needed to get compensation to those who have been so badly wronged.\n\"It is staggering, given the failures of the Windrush scandal, that the Home Office has allowed some of the same problems to affect the Windrush Compensation Scheme too,\" she added.\nThe report urges the Home Office to: \nResponding to the report, the Home Office said: \"The home secretary and the department remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure that members of the Windrush generation receive every penny of compensation that they are entitled to. \n\"We continue to make improvements, such as simplifying the application process, hiring more caseworkers and removing the end date.\""

      "tags": "Social mobility,Universities",
      "text": "Universities will have to hit hard targets to ensure the poorest students get into high-paid jobs after they graduate, under new government plans.\nUniversities Minister Michelle Donelan is telling vice-chancellors to rewrite their access and participation plans, which they produce every five years.\nThose that miss their new targets will not be able to charge full fees.\nIt comes as a study shows selective universities do less well in helping poor students earn more.\nThe analysis - by the Institute of Fiscal Studies and the Sutton Trust education charity - compares how many pupils who were on free school meals attended each university, and went on to make it into the top 20% of earners at the age of 30.\nIt found newer universities with lower entry requirements help twice the rate of poor students (2%) to get top jobs later on, than the older, more selective institutions (1%).\nThe report suggests this is because they admit more students from poorer homes than universities with higher entry requirements, and can therefore help more disadvantaged students move into good jobs.\nAlthough less prestigious than the highly selective Russell Group of 24 institutions, these modern post-1992 universities are still turning large numbers of students into top earners. \nWhile students from low-income families who go to Russell Group institutions do very well in the labour market, these universities admit very few students who have been on free school meals in the past - this leads to what researchers call a lower \"mobility rate\".\nMs Donelan said: \"We need to be making getting on as important as getting in. Gone will be the days where universities were recruiting students onto courses that lead to dropping out, frustration and unemployment. \n\"A student's outcome after university needs to be as important to providers as a student's grades before university.\"\nIn 2017, the public accounts committee suggested the system of loans and fees had left many students with debts, and doubting their degree was \"worth the money paid for it\".\nThe shake-up is being announced as John Blake, a strategic director for academy chain Ark, is appointed The Office For Students' director of fair access and participation.\nAgreeing these new participation targets with universities will be his first task. It is expected they will be in place for September 2023.\nCurrently, all universities have targets for the proportion of disadvantaged students they must admit. \nThese are tied into their Access and Participation plans, which are approved by the Office for Students every four years, in return for the ability to charge maximum fees of \u00a39,250 a year.\nMs Donelan is now asking institutions to do more than increase the number of undergraduates from poor backgrounds.\nThey will be required to ensure these students study courses which deliver good outcomes for them, although there is little detail on this.\nBut the Department for Education says this means tackling drop-out rates, and supporting poorer students through university to graduation, and into high-skilled, high-paid jobs.\nCurrently, about one in 10 students from the poorest backgrounds drop out in their first year.\nUniversities will also be required to work more closely with schools and colleges, so that a broader range of students get better qualifications and have more options to choose from.\nMeasures could include running a summer school or offering students and lecturers to tutor pupils, the DfE said.\nAnd universities will have to offer more courses linked to skills and flexible learning such as degree apprenticeships, higher technical qualifications and part-time courses.\nDr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group, said the proportion of disadvantaged 18-year-olds joining its universities had increased every year for the last seven.\nHe added: \"Our universities look forward to building on their existing work with schools and colleges, offering a range of options to young people, including degree apprenticeships, and supporting them through university to graduation and beyond.\""

      "text": "Scotland's first minister has dismissed speculation about her future by saying she has \"no intention of going anywhere\".\nNicola Sturgeon said rumours she might soon be looking to leave frontline politics were \"wishful thinking\" by her opponents.\nAnd she said she would continue to govern as first minister for the full term of the Scottish Parliament.\nMs Sturgeon has served as first minister since 2014.\nShe was re-elected in May after the SNP won the Scottish Parliament election with a record share of the vote. \nBut she has regularly spoken about the emotional toll of leading the country through the Covid pandemic, leading to rumours that she may have one eye on her life after politics. \nThis was heightened when Ms Sturgeon said in a recent interview with Vogue magazine that she and her husband - SNP chief executive Peter Murrell - may wish to foster children in the future.\nSpeaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg ahead of the SNP's autumn conference, which begins on Friday, Ms Sturgeon said she intended to remain as first minister for the full five-year parliamentary term.\nReferring to speculation about her future, she said: \"It is almost as if my opponents have concluded they can't beat me or remove me from office themselves, so they're kind of crossing their fingers and hoping that I'll remove myself from office.\n\"But they are going to be really disappointed because I'm going to be around a lot longer.\n\"I was elected seven months ago, having asked people in Scotland to put their trust in me for a five year term as first minister. \n\"They gave me that trust and they re-elected me. We face serious times as a country and I intend to fulfil that mandate.\"\nMs Sturgeon, who is 51, added that she has \"no intentions of going anywhere right now as first minister\", but that she hoped to still be \"relatively young when I get to the point of contemplating other things\".\nThe SNP's manifesto ahead of the election said it would hold a second referendum on independence by the end of 2023, Covid permitting. \nMs Sturgeon said she would be taking the \"necessary steps\" to ensure that happens, with the Scottish government having recently resumed its plans for indyref2 after putting them on hold at the start of the pandemic. \nShe said this would include publishing a referendum bill in the Scottish Parliament.\nThe Scottish government will also set out the \"advantages and opportunities of independence\", which Ms Sturgeon said would include \"how we will navigate some of the more difficult issues\".\nMs Sturgeon said Scotland must decide what kind of country it wants to be after the pandemic is over, but stressed she does not want a referendum to be held \"while we are still worrying about face coverings and testing ourselves every day\".\nShe said she hoped the country would be out of the \"acute\" phase of the pandemic early next year, and that people's minds would be turning to the \"positive, optimistic task of how do we build a better country, how do we build a fairer, more equal, more prosperous country for the future\". \nThe first minister added: \"That means for Scotland getting to choose who's making these decisions, not having somebody like Boris Johnson imposed on us and deciding for ourselves.\"\nThe UK government has said the question of Scottish independence should not be on the table while the country is still dealing with the pandemic, with the prime minister saying it would be \"irresponsible and reckless\" to do so.\nAnd it has pointed to the UK-wide schemes such as the vaccine rollout and furlough as evidence that Scotland is better off as part of the UK.\nOpinion polls have suggested that Scotland remains split almost 50-50 on the question of independence - although support for remaining in the UK has been slightly ahead on average over the past six months. \nMs Sturgeon acknowledged that her side of the debate has \"still got a job to do\" to persuade a majority of Scottish voters that the country should become independent. \nShe added: \"I think we are much closer to that than ever before, but are we there yet? No.\""

      "tags": "NI economy,Childcare",
      "text": "One in three childcare providers in Northern Ireland is planning to put up prices as they struggle with rising costs, a survey has suggested. \nThe survey was carried out by social enterprise Employers For Childcare and received more than 2,200 responses from parents and childcare providers. \nIt found almost a third of childcare providers described their current financial position as \"distressed\".\nSome said that they were facing immediate risk of closure.\nAt the same time, about a quarter of families - 28% - said they were struggling to find and pay for the childcare they need. \nThe research suggested the average cost of a full-time childcare place in Northern Ireland was \u00a3170 per week - the equivalent of 34% of the median weekly household income in Northern Ireland.  \nAoife Hamilton, the enterprise's head of charity services, said: \"Childcare providers are facing unprecedented challenges - in recruiting and retaining staff and meeting salaries, particularly with the increase announced to the National Living Wage, as well as rising food and energy costs and uncertainty over numbers and occupancy levels.\n\"We have been reporting on childcare in Northern Ireland for over a decade and for many years, parents and childcare providers have been telling us about the issues they face, but this is the most worrying picture yet.\" \nThe affect of Covid-19 on the sector means one in two parents (51%) who took part in the survey said the pandemic had changed their childcare requirements. \nIn 2021, families reported using an average of 39 hours of childcare per week, down from 42 hours in 2020. \nAlicia Lappin is among the working parents who are concerned about rising childcare costs.\nThe mother of four from Portadown, County Armagh, would like to return to work full time, but said \"the cost of childcare doesn't allow me to do it\".\n\"Year on year, it seems that my pay packet goes up pennies but the childcare seems to go up pounds... every single year it's a bit more,\" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"It's got to the stage where I've had to make my hours part time in order to be able to cover the cost of childcare - it doesn't financially pay me to be there full time.\"\nHer children are aged nine, seven, four and 15 months.  With the eldest three in school or nursery, she currently pays for day care for her youngest child.\nShe pays about \u00a375 for him for 15 hours a week while she is at work.\nThe centre is run by a social enterprise and Ms Lappin admits it is \"relatively cheap compared to what other people are paying\" but the bill is still a \"huge proportion\" of her part-time wage.\nBy the time she factors in other work-related outgoings such as fuel costs, parking and tax, there is very little left.\n\"I don't work for the money at the minute.  I'm working because I want my foot in the door, I don't want to lose my position and I'm working because I love what I do,\" she said. \nSpeaking on the same programme, childcare provider Diane Koplewsky said her industry was facing rising costs and currently has no choice but to pass them on to customers.\nShe is the co-owner of the Sleepy Hollow Group which is one of Northern Ireland's biggest childcare companies, operating across 18 locations. \n\"As household costs increase, so do business costs,\" she said.\n\"Our PPE, cleaning, hygiene costs have all increased and ironically, so has our insurance even though insurers didn't pay out when we had to close.\n\"So the cost of operating a childcare business has never been higher.\"\nMs Koplewsky called for more government support for her industry so that childcare costs are no longer a barrier to employment for parents.\n\"Childcare needs to be valued as essential element of the economic infrastructure and we need to fund it as such,\" she said.\n\"We aren't seeing any level of investment in childcare here - working parents deserve it, childcare providers deserve it and so do our workforce. \n\"Our workforce need to be valued for their role in care, we need to be valued as early educators.\"\nMs Koplewsky said childcare providers \"do not want to increase fees\" because they know the challenges facing working parents.\nHowever, she said their only source of income at the moment is parents' fees and these may have to rise if there is no government investment.\n\"Nobody wants to increase costs but what else are we to do if we don't get funding from the executive?\"\nMaria McDonagh who owns Adventures Day Nursery in west Belfast said she has been left with no other choice but to increase fees. \nShe said: \"For us to be able to remain in business, we are probably looking at up to a 15% increase - 10% should cover wage increases and increases in the cost of providing food and activities and resources, but the energy costs will be the remaining hike that we have to look at this year.\"\nDad-of-two Liam Mahaffy saw his childcare provider close its doors last month.\nHe said: \"It's very sad for my son, the friends he had made there, they are all going to separate places now so it will be hard to maintain those friendships. It is very upsetting for the staff, they were absolutely brilliant the whole time.\"\nHis partner is currently on maternity leave so while their current bill is significant, it is likely to increase next year.\nHe said: \"It literally is, for us, a second mortgage, and that's just for three days a week. In another seven months' time, there will be a second one going into childcare so hopefully that's not a third mortgage.\n\"When my partner goes back after maternity leave, she might have to reduce her hours. I will be looking after them two days a week. It definitely does impact more, unfortunately, on women's employment prospects.\""

Mr Joslyn denied the allegations.\nNow Gwent Police has gone a step further, issuing a public apology for the way it handled complaints from two of its own officers.\n\"We just felt like we were being ignored, that we did not matter, that maybe we were not even being believed,\" Jodie said.\n\"But I think for them to actually give an apology shows us that they have finally listened after all these years to what we had to say.\"\nGwent Police has been accused of failing to take steps to protect its female staff and of ignoring warnings about the conduct of one of its officers.\n\"What I found hard was, I was a response officer at the time and I was dealing with things that were not as serious as what I was going through. But when it came to myself, nothing was being done,\" Jodie said.\nThe charity the Centre for Women's Justice, which represented Jodie, said her case raised \"systemic\" issues about a culture of policing beyond the Gwent force. \n\"It's about the lack of procedures in place to ensure independent investigation where things go wrong, where officers are accused of abusing their position,\" said Kate Ellis, a solicitor with the charity.\n\"Until police forces confront the scale of the issue, we are not going to see meaningful systemic change.\"\nThe conduct of some male officers towards women and the ability of forces to investigate them adequately has been given a renewed focus with the conviction of the Met Police officer Wayne Couzens for the murder of Sarah Everard.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has said she will launch an inquiry into issues raised by the case.\nBut campaigners, including the Centre for Women's Justice, have called on her to widen the inquiry's scope to include other examples of abuse by police officers.\nJodie said cases like hers showed that investigations into the conduct of officers should be independent and not carried out by colleagues from the same force.\nShe was also frustrated that by the time her abuser's misconduct was proven, he was no longer serving.\n\"When it had been pushed as far as it was going to go and he knew that he was going to be found guilty of gross misconduct, he actually resigned. He had the last element of control there,\" she said.\n\"I think if somebody has been investigated for gross misconduct, they should definitely not be allowed to resign,\" she said.\nGwent Police Deputy Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman said she had met both women in the case to hear their experiences and to apologise. \n\"I am extremely sorry that at a time when they felt most in need of our support that we let them down.\"\nShe said the force had \"listened, reflected and taken the actions needed to get this right in future\".\nMs Blakeman added: \"We take any allegations of this nature very seriously and they will be thoroughly investigated, and action taken. We will also work with individuals raising concerns to make sure they have the support they want and need.\n\"Public expectations around our standards of behaviour are quite rightly very high. There is no place in our force for inappropriate workplace behaviour or the abuse of an individual's position to exploit others. \n\"We expect everyone within Gwent Police to maintain high standards of professional behaviour - the vast majority of our employees work tirelessly to serve our communities with professionalism, honesty and integrity.\n\"We are committed to identifying and taking action against those individuals who breach these standards. The public must have the utmost confidence in the integrity of our officers, and we are very clear that anyone who undermines the public's trust will have no future in this force.\"\nThe force said all cases involving officers where a position of trust was abused were reported to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC). The IOPC would then look into whether an independent investigation was needed. "

She materially improved it.\"\nBBC Media Action is the corporation's international charity focussed on using media and communication to address inequality around the world.\nMs Mitchell, who grew up in Whitley Bay in the north-east of England, most recently worked for the charity's office in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. \nShe was found dead at a hotel in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Friday.\nSpeaking to the BBC, her brother said: \"Everywhere she went from Zambia, South Sudan, Nigeria, Ethiopia, she was always managing projects and securing funding and making things work.\"\nHe said his sister had a \"supernatural ability to charm people and become everyone's friend\".\n\"Everyone has been very supportive,\" he said. \"She had friends all around the world - I'm hearing from people I have never heard of... who loved her.\"\nMr Mitchell remembered his sister as having a particular interest in refugees, the health of women and their welfare, and young people.\nShe was, he said, an \"enormously courageous person always willing to do the hardest possible jobs in some very hard places\".\nThe last funding application Ms Mitchell made was successful and will benefit an education project in Ethiopia.\nMr Mitchell said: \"She sadly didn't get to hear that she got that grant. It came through over the weekend after she died. But that's a small final victory.\" \nMr Mitchell earlier urged people to ignore speculation in the press and on social media about his sister's death.\nHe said he last spoke to his sister, along with their mother, a few days before her death.\n\"For us the priority is bringing Kate home,\" he added. \"Everyone in the community has been wonderful. We've had more food dropped on our doorstep than we can even eat - we are receiving miles of flowers and cards.\"\nIn a statement, BBC Media Action CEO Caroline Nursey said Kate was a much-loved member of staff and had been with the charity for 14 years. \nShe said she was well known across the whole organisation, especially by teams in Ethiopia, South Sudan, Zambia and London."

      "tags": "Germany,Olaf Scholz",
      "text": "Olaf Scholz will head a three-party coalition with broad plans for Germany's transition to a green economy, under a deal to end 16 years of government led by Angela Merkel.\nAlmost two months after his Social Democrat party won federal elections, he will go into power with the Greens and business-friendly Free Democrats.\nClimate protection forms a big part of the coalition deal.\nThe parties aim to phase out coal use by 2030, eight years ahead of schedule.\nThey will also seek to use 2% of German territory for wind power and focus on hydrogen-based energy too. By 2030, the parties want 80% of electricity to be sourced from renewable energy and 15 million electric cars to be on German roads.\nThere are also plans to legalise the sale of cannabis in licensed premises, with controls on the quality and distribution of the drug.\nGermany is Europe's biggest economy, so decisions taken by the new government will have a big effect on its neighbours.\nIn a news conference, Mr Scholz, 63, said \"sovereignty of Europe is a cornerstone of our foreign policy\". He highlighted Germany's friendship with France and partnership with the US.\nHe spoke of daring to make greater progress in a coalition \"on equal terms\". He also pointed out that the three parties' wider memberships still had to approve what has been labelled a \"traffic-light\" coalition, because of the parties' red, yellow and green colours. \nHe will only take over as chancellor from Mrs Merkel after a vote in the Bundestag, expected between 6 and 9 December.\nMr Scholz will enter office during a difficult period of the Covid-19 pandemic, with Germany one of several European countries where infections have skyrocketed to record levels in recent weeks.\nOn Wednesday, he said the coalition would ramp up vaccinations and consider making jabs compulsory for health staff and other essential worker.\n\"The situation is bleak,\" Mr Scholz said. \"The coronavirus is still not vanquished.\"\nThe Social Democrats won the 26 September vote, ahead of Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrat alliance, which saw its worst-ever election result. The Greens achieved their best-ever result, under candidate Annalena Baerbock, who spoke of an ambitious alliance aiming to start a paradigm shift to transform the economy.\nDescribing the climate crisis as the biggest challenge of our time she said: \"We can transform our economy so it becomes climate neutral. We have an agreement where climate neutrality is a common denominator.\"\nMs Baerbock is expected to become foreign minister in the new government, while her Greens co-leader Robert Habeck gets the role of vice-chancellor as well as overseeing energy transition.\nThe new finance minister is set to be Christian Lindner, the Free Democrat leader whose party has a wide following of young voters. \"The younger generation has given us this job to overcome the status quo of recent years,\" he said.\nMaking Germany climate neutral by 2045 is a big focus of the deal, entitled \"Daring more progress\". Phasing out coal will take place \"ideally\" by 2030, and solar energy will become compulsory on the roofs of new commercial buildings and the general rule for new private homes. The 16 states will have to provide 2% of their area for wind power. The goal to phase out cars with internal combustion engines remains the EU's target of 2035.\nMinimum wages will rise to \u20ac12 (\u00a310) an hour and another 400,000 new apartments will be built every year, a quarter of which will be social housing, to tackle Germany's housing crisis.\nThe voting age will be lowered from 18 to 16, with plans to reform electoral law to bring an end to ever-increasing numbers of MPs. The new Bundestag has 735 seats. Changing the voting age for European elections requires a simple parliamentary majority, but for federal elections it would need two-thirds support.\nImmigrants will be able to apply for German citizenship after five years. They will also be allowed dual citizenship under the coalition's plans. This would transform the lives of millions of immigrants, many of who remain foreign nationals despite having lived in Germany for decades.\nA Covid crisis team will be set up at the chancellery to focus on the pandemic. Mr Scholz said vaccination was the way out of the pandemic and in some care settings involving vulnerable people it should be made compulsory. Mr Scholz said the coalition had agreed to invest \u20ac1bn in bonuses for health workers.\nOn foreign policy, the parties said they wanted \"to raise Europe's strategic sovereignty\", which effectively means more independence on energy, security and other international issues. However, Germany's relationship with the US and its membership of the Nato alliance will remain central to its security.\nGermany's no-new-debt rule was lifted during the pandemic as more funds were needed to address the crisis. But by 2023, the coalition says it wants to bring back the debt brake which is enshrined in Germany's constitution.\nA ban on doctors advertising that they carry out abortions will be lifted, to enable public information to be provided about the method without fear of prosecution."

      "text": "People who test positive for Covid at home no longer need to take a PCR test to confirm the result.\nMany people are still struggling to get hold of tests due to high demand.\nIf you have no symptoms:\nAcross the UK, if you test positive for Covid with a lateral flow test (LFT), there is no longer any need to book a PCR test to confirm that result. \nYou should report your result online or by calling 119, and self-isolate immediately. You will be contacted by the relevant tracing service so your contacts can be notified.\nYou can leave self-isolation seven days after the date of your first positive test (five full days in England), as long as you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart. \nThe guidance that positive LFTs don't need a confirmatory PCR will remain in place while Covid case levels are high. Under these conditions, the vast majority of people with positive LFT results are extremely likely to have coronavirus. \nPeople who are eligible for the \u00a3500 test and trace payment in England will be asked to take a PCR so they can access financial support.\nClinically vulnerable people in Wales and Northern Ireland are also still advised to take a PCR test after a positive LFT.\nIf you have symptoms:\nIf you have Covid symptoms - a cough, a fever or a loss of taste or smell - you should take a PCR test as soon as possible, and self-isolate while you wait for the result. \nYou must then continue to self-isolate if the PCR test is positive, even if you previously had negative LFT results.\nHowever, if you have already tested positive on a LFT, you should self-isolate and do not need to take a follow up PCR.\nAnyone without Covid symptoms can order LFTs online using their NHS login. \nYou can also collect LFTs from pharmacies, vaccination hubs and test centres. \nYou should report your LFT result online or by calling 119. \nYou can order a PCR test kit to be sent to your home or book an appointment at a walk-in or drive-through test site.\nThe main government website still regularly says no LFTs are available for home delivery, and many pharmacies have limited stock. \nPCR test appointments are also sometimes in short supply across much of the UK, although home PCR kits are generally available. \nAnyone who needs a PCR test is advised to keep checking the website, as slots are released throughout the day.\nAnnouncing the reduction in the self-isolation period for England, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs that LFT supplies had risen sharply from pre-Omicron levels, with 400 million available in January, compared to 120 million in November. \nThe testing rules are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or for 10 days after your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to people under-18s (18 and four months in Scotland; 18 and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test, but don't need to take a confirmatory PCR test. \nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. In Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nAcross the UK, NHS and education staff are asked to test twice a week. Secondary pupils should test twice a week during term time (three times a week in Wales). \nThere is separate testing guidance for prisons and hospital patients, as well as care home staff in Scotland. \nThe government has said it will provide 100,000 critical workers in England with free daily LFTs, initially for five weeks.\nCritical workers deliver essential services such as transport and food distribution, and cannot work from home so are at risk of infection.\nIn addition, everyone is asked to test before socialising with those who are at most risk from Covid, or spending time in crowded settings or places with poor ventilation. \nPeople can also provide a recent negative LFT or PCR result instead of proof of vaccination to enter venues that are covered by Covid passport schemes in place in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nYou may also need to test before or after travelling abroad. You must buy private tests for this - you cannot use free NHS tests. \nLFTs and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests do different things:\nBoth tests involve swabbing your nose and/or throat. LFTs can be done at home, and show results in 20-30 minutes. \nPCR test swabs must be sent to a lab for analysis, with results provided in 24-48 hours, although it can take longer to confirm a particular Covid variant.\nBeing vaccinated against Covid cannot cause you to test positive on either an LFT or PCR test.\nWhen LFTs were first introduced, they were criticised for being much less accurate than PCRs.\nHowever, in October UCL researchers found LFTs were more than 80% effective at detecting any level of Covid-19 infection, which was much higher than previously thought.\nLFT results are also more reliable during a period of high Covid cases, because the small number of false positives is much less significant.

      "tags": "Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's vaccine passport system will not be extended to more venues, Nicola Sturgeon has announced.\nThe first minister had been considering expanding the scheme to cover cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues.\nBut she told MSPs that it would not be proportionate to do so, with case numbers having fallen slightly.\nPeople will be allowed to present a negative test rather than proof of two jabs to enter venues that are already covered by the scheme from 6 December.\nThese include nightclubs and large events such as some football matches and concerts, and would bring Scotland's system into line with others in countries like Wales. \nMs Sturgeon said taking a lateral flow test before socialising with others over the festive period was a \"vitally important\" step in minimising the spread of the virus.\nA decision on adding more venues to the scheme had been expected for several weeks, with Ms Sturgeon previously telling MSPs that it could help \"get through what will be a challenging winter without having to reintroduce restrictions on trade\".\nThe government published an evidence paper which suggested Scotland faced a choice between either extending the vaccine passport system or closing down venues and limiting the number of people who can meet up.\nHowever, ministers ultimately decided to do neither after studying the latest data at a meeting of Ms Sturgeon's cabinet on Tuesday morning.\nThe first minister said that while Scotland was still in a precarious position, with \"significant and sustained\" pressure on the NHS, the data was actually \"more positive than we might have expected it to be\".\nMs Sturgeon said the spread of the virus had stabilised - with the average number of new cases recorded each day falling by about 3% over the past week.\nShe said that given the \"inevitable impact vaccine certification has on the operation of businesses\", ministers had concluded that extending the scheme would therefore not be proportionate.\nHowever, venues which remain covered by the scheme will be allowed to accept a negative lateral flow test instead of proof of vaccination from 6 December - as already happens in many other countries that have introduced vaccine passports.\nMs Sturgeon said this had originally been left out of the scheme to help drive up vaccination rates, but that high uptake rates meant testing could now be included as an alternative.\nThe first minister also urged people to get vaccinated before socialising over the festive period, saying: \"You could well be saving your own life, and the lives of your loved ones.\n\"You will be helping the NHS, and you will be maximising our chances of getting through this winter without the need for further restrictions.\"\nHospitality bosses had warned that pubs and restaurants could face an \"avalanche of cancellations\" if the certification scheme had been extended over the normally busy Christmas period.\nBusiness group CBI Scotland welcomed the decision not to do so, with director Tracy Black saying it \"strikes the right balance between managing the virus and protecting our economy recovery\".\nShe said: \"Many firms would have faced practical challenges and increased costs to implement measures at a time when bumper trading is needed to claw back lost or diminished revenues.\"\nThe Federation of Small Businesses described the decision as a \"relief\", saying firms \"will now have a weight off their shoulders\".\nAnd the Scottish Retail Consortium said businesses would be \"delighted to see a reprieve from further restrictions\", praising ministers for listening to representations from industry.\nNicola Sturgeon tends to signal well in advance what changes to Covid rules might be coming. Over the last two weeks, she and her deputy have made clear that extending the use of vaccine certification to further venues was a serious prospect.\nA Scottish government evidence paper went as far as to suggest that in order to suppress Covid more, ministers faced a choice between wider use of certification and lockdown-style measures.\nBut today's statement from the first minister has stopped short of taking either option at this stage, taking account of pushback from business and relatively stable case numbers.\nInstead, they are counting on continued use of existing measures like vaccination and mask wearing and an appeal for greater use of home testing to stop the NHS being overwhelmed.\nAccepting lateral flow tests as well as proof of vaccination for entry to venues that already require certification aligns the Scottish scheme more closely with Wales and Northern Ireland. \nOpposition parties - who have questioned whether vaccine passports are effective - said the move amounted to a government u-turn after weeks of speculation about the scheme being expanded.\nScottish Conservative health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane said ministers seemed to be \"making it up as they go along\".\nHe said: \"The uncertainty that this government has left hanging over businesses for the last two weeks has been unnecessary and unacceptable.\"\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the government had been \"determined to be seen to be doing something, rather than doing the right thing\".\nHe added: \"We have spent months pursuing the incorrect priority. The government's own evidence shows there is no real evidence of an increase in uptake of the vaccine, and transmission has not fallen.\n\"I welcome the change to include a negative test from now on but frankly we are in this position because the government couldn't accept it was wrong and move in the right direction.\"\nMs Sturgeon said Mr Sarwar was \"fundamentally wrong\", saying allowing the use of tests in the system earlier would have \"undermined the central primary objective of the scheme\", of driving up the vaccination rate.\nMeanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government's evidence paper was \"mince\", and claimed that ministers had caused \"weeks of uncertainty and panic\" for businesses."

      "text": "The foreign secretary has admitted that Parliament and the public were misled for decades about a British Airways flight which landed in Kuwait during an Iraqi invasion in 1990.\nThe passengers and crew of BA 149 were taken hostage, with many mistreated. \nNewly released files reveal that the British ambassador in Kuwait warned the Foreign Office about the invasion, but BA was not told.\nThe government kept the warning secret for three decades.\nHowever, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss reiterated earlier denials that the flight was being used for a secret intelligence mission.\nFor 30 years, successive governments have covered up the fact there was a warning Kuwait was being invaded before BA 149 landed in the country and that this was not passed on.\n\"This failure was unacceptable,\" Ms Truss said in a written statement. \"I apologise to the House for this, and I express my deepest sympathy to those who were detained and mistreated.\"\nBA 149 took off from London at 18:04 GMT on 1 August, two hours late, and was due to stop briefly in Kuwait before heading on to Asia. \nBut files released today to the National Archives show the British Ambassador called the resident clerk at the Foreign Office around midnight with reports that an invasion of Kuwait had begun. \nThis was passed to the Foreign Office Middle East department and to Downing Street, as well as MI6, the Cabinet Office and Ministry of Defence. But British Airways was not told. \nThe call was not publicly acknowledged or disclosed until now.\nThe plane landed in the early hours of the morning. Less than an hour later, the airport was closed and the passengers and crew were trapped. Many were taken hostage. \nSome were mistreated, sexually assaulted and kept in near-starvation conditions before they were released that December.\nThere was no formal mechanism for passing on such information to British Airways at the time, but the Foreign Office says there is a procedure to deal with situations and inform the airline industry now.\nA British Airways spokesperson said the records \"confirm British Airways was not warned about the invasion\".\nThe files suggest the British ambassador was unclear whether the Iraqi incursion was limited or large-scale. The invasion also swept through Kuwait far faster than many expected when it first began.\nThe episode has aroused particular controversy because of persistent reports that a team of undercover operatives were on board the plane as part of a mission to be inserted into Kuwait to carry out surveillance. \n\"I am convinced that the military intelligence exploitation of British Airways Flight 149 did take place, despite repeated official denials,\" Anthony Paice, who was serving at the British Embassy at the time and has been previously named as an MI6 officer, said earlier this year.\nClive Earthy, the BA cabin services director on the flight, also told the BBC that he remembers a man in military uniform escorting a group of 10 men off the flight - who were then never seen again.\nHowever, the Foreign Office says the newly released files are \"consistent\" with a statement made in 2007 that the government \"did not attempt in any way to exploit the flight by any means whatever\".\nBarry Manners, a passenger on the flight, said he was disappointed the government had not used the opportunity to acknowledge the \"irrefutable\" evidence that the flight was used for an intelligence mission. \n\"This was a deliberate act by the British government to use a civilian airliner as a military transport into what turned out to be a live-fire war zone,\" he said."

      "text": "Met Police officer Wayne Couzens has been sentenced to a whole-life term for the murder of Sarah Everard, in a case that sparked national outrage and calls for more action to tackle violence against women. \nCouzens admitted the kidnap, rape and murder of the 33-year-old marketing executive when he appeared in court several months ago.\nBut it was only during his sentencing that the full details of his crimes emerged. \nMs Everard was walking home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, at about 21:30 BST on 3 March when she was abducted. \nCouzens' choice of victim was random, but the attack was planned. \nIn his sentencing remarks, Lord Justice Fulford said there had been \"significant planning and premeditation\" by Couzens.\nThe police officer had \"long planned to carry out a violent sexual assault on a yet-to-be-selected victim\" who he intended to coerce into his custody, noted the judge. \nCouzens spent at least a month travelling to London from Deal, Kent, where he lived, to research how best to carry out his crimes. \nSeveral days before the attack, he booked a hire car, which he would use for the abduction, as well as a roll of self-adhesive film advertised as a carpet protector on Amazon.\nAfter finishing a 12-hour shift at the US embassy that morning, Couzens, a parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, went out \"hunting\" for a lone, young woman to kidnap and rape, the prosecution said.\nThe court heard how Couzens used the knowledge he had gained from working on Covid patrols in January and his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card to trick his victim under the guise of a fake arrest for breaching coronavirus guidelines. \nThe 48-year-old, who had been a police officer since 2002, handcuffed her before bundling her into the car and driving away. \nThe abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car - but they believed they had seen an undercover police officer carrying out a legitimate arrest, so did not intervene. \nThe whole kidnapping took less than five minutes.\nCouzens then drove to Dover in Kent, where he transferred Ms Everard to his own car, before travelling to a remote rural area nearby. \nIt was there that he raped and murdered his victim - strangling her with his police belt. \nBy 02:31 Couzens had left the scene and was spotted at a service station buying drinks. \nHe visited the site where Ms Everard's body was dumped twice, leaving just before dawn. \nThe next day, as the search for her escalated, Couzens bought petrol, which he used to burn her body inside a fridge. \nHe also purchased two green rubble bags, which he used to dump the remains in a pond near an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, Ashford. \nA week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream, just metres from land owned by Couzens.\nMeanwhile, Couzens returned to normal life, carrying out mundane activities like calling a vet about his dog. \nDays later, he even took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods where he had burnt his victim's body. \nHowever, on the 8 March, the day he was due to return to work, he reported in sick. \nThe following day he was arrested at his home in Deal.\nIn a brief police interview, he told a false story about being threatened by an Eastern European gang, claiming they had demanded he deliver \"another girl\" after he had underpaid a prostitute a few weeks before. He then claimed he kidnapped Ms Everard, drove out of London and handed her over to three men in a van in a layby in Kent, while she was alive and uninjured.\nBut after Ms Everard's body was discovered in a pond just 130 metres from land owned by Couzens, he was charged. \nCouzens has since been sacked by the Met, but the force is still facing questions over whether chances were missed to prevent his predatory behaviour. \nAfter Ms Everard's murder, the police watchdog announced it was probing alleged failures by the Met to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February. \nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate a flashing incident linked to Couzens in 2015. \nCouzens transferred to the Met in 2018, from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011. \nTwo years later he began working for the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command as an authorised firearms officer at diplomatic premises around central London.\nIn July, appearing by video link from Belmarsh high security jail, Couzens pleaded guilty to murder at the Old Bailey. \nOn Wednesday he appeared in court again - this time in person - for a two-day sentencing hearing. \nThere, he faced Ms Everard's mother, father and sister, who described to the court the torment of losing their loved one in such horrendous circumstances. \nHer father, Jeremy, demanded that Couzens looked at him as he told the murderer he could never forgive him for taking away his daughter. \nHer mother, Susan, said she was \"tormented\" at the thought of what her \"precious little girl\" had endured. \n\"I go through the sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger,\" she told the court. \n\"Burning her body was the final insult. It meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye.\n\"Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled.\""

      "text": "One hundred people with learning disabilities and autism in England have been held in specialist hospitals for at least 20 years, the BBC has learned. \nThe finding was made during an investigation into the case of an autistic man detained since 2001. \nTony Hickmott's parents are fighting to get him housed in the community near them. \nBBC News overturned a court order which had prevented reporting of the case.\nMr Hickmott's case is being heard at the Court of Protection - which makes decisions on financial or welfare matters for people who \"lack mental capacity\".\nSenior Judge Carolyn Hilder has described \"egregious\" delays and \"glacial\" progress in finding him the right care package which would enable him to live in the community. He lives in a secure Assessment and Treatment Unit (ATU) - designed to be a short-term safe space used in a crisis. It is a two-hours' drive from his family.\nThis week, Judge Hilder lifted the anonymity order on Mr Hickmott's case - ruling it was in the public interest to let details be reported. She said he had been \"detained for so long\" partly down to a \"lack of resources\".\nLike many young autistic people with a learning disability, Mr Hickmott struggled as he grew into an adult. In 2001, he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. He is now 44. \n\"Nine months we were told he'd be away, until they found him a suitable place in the Brighton area,\" says his father, 78-year-old Roy.\nMr Hickmott was finally declared \"fit for discharge\" by psychiatrists in 2013, but he is still waiting for the authorities to find him a suitable home with the right level of care for his needs. \n\"If he'd murdered someone he'd be out now. He's lost his family, he's lost his home,\" says his mother Pam, who is 81. \"He's just a shadow of the human he used to be. There are so many families like us - crying and screaming. We are our children's voices.\" \nHis Assessment and Treatment Unit care is paid for by the NHS - but the cost of housing and caring for him in the community with trained staff would fall to Pam and Roy's local authority, Brighton and Hove, and local NHS commissioners. That process has been bogged down in delays and wrangles. Pam believes the delays are over funding. \n\"We've got judges telling them to get on with it but they're still not doing it, they're still fighting over the money.\"  \nFinding suitable housing with skilled support staff can be a complicated process. But Mr Hickmott's family argue it should have been put in place a long time ago.\nPam and Roy's home is full of photographs showing their son in happier times. Birthday parties, smiling with his two sisters, holidaying with his mum and dad. The couple used to visit him twice a week - although, now they are that bit older, they just travel up on a Thursday. \n\"I've gone through three cars traveling to and fro,\" says Roy. \"Sometimes Pam and I travel back and pull in at the side of the road and we just cry.\" \nSix evenings a week - at 17:00 - they speak to their son on the phone.  \n\"He describes all the rooms in our house. His memory of his home is all he's got,\" says Pam.  \nDuring past visits to the ATU, Pam says they drew pictures of a house with a garden by the sea. She would tell her son he would be home soon. \n\"He doesn't believe us any more. He doesn't believe he's coming home.\" \nIn addition to the 100 patients, including Mr Hickmott, who have been held for more than 20 years - there are currently nearly 2,000 other people with learning disabilities and/or autism detained in specialist hospitals across England.\nIn 2015, the Government promised \"homes not hospitals\" when it launched its Transforming Care programme in the wake of the abuse and neglect scandal uncovered by the BBC at Winterbourne View specialist hospital near Bristol. But data shows the programme has had minimal impact.\nMinisters pledged to reduce the number of patients in such hospital settings by 35% by March 2020, with the aim of people being back in their communities with tailored support packages. But, by March last year, there were only 300 fewer patients detained - a reduction of just 13%.\nThe 35% target has now slipped to 2023/24.\nIt was further BBC News analysis of this official data which revealed that of 350 people detained for more than a decade, 100 of them have been in hospital settings for more than two decades. \nNumbers of people with learning disabilities and/or autism in inpatient units in England:\nSource: NHS Digital\nLast month, crossbench peer Baroness Hollins - who has been reviewing long-term segregated care - told the House of Lords it was time to \"end the scandals\" and give people back their lives. But she also spoke of another man - Mr W - held largely in solitary confinement for 20 years but who, for the past three years, had lived around the corner from his parents. \n\"Despite still recovering from the trauma, he is now happy,\" she said.\nThis is what Roy and Pam Hickmott want.  \nThe author of the Serious Case Review into what happened at Winterbourne View, Dr Margaret Flynn told us the \"institutions\" detaining people like Tony should not exist.\n\"It's appalling. These people are not criminals. They are stuck, just as people used to be stuck in long-stay institutions.\" \nShe says there is so much testimony from people with a learning disability and/or autism - and their families - about \"harmful experiences\" when they are removed from \"all that is familiar to them\".  \nJudge Hilder - who has allowed Tony Hickmott's case to be reported following an application by the BBC and Sky News - has ordered the authorities involved in his care to work together to move him back to Brighton by May.\nIn a statement, Brighton and Hove Council said: \"Tony has extremely complex needs. We've tried on a number of occasions to find a sustainable solution nearer to Brighton\u2026 these were not successful.\" The council says it is working with the NHS and Mr Hickmott's family to find other options.  \nNHS England in the South East says it is continuing to work with partner organisations - and Roy and Pam Hickmott - to ensure \"appropriate care and support is in place\".\nThe Department for Health and Social Care told us it was determined to keep reducing the number of autistic people, and those with a learning disability, in specialist inpatient units - and that it was providing an extra \u00a390m of funding this financial year.\nIts national strategy, it said, was to make life \"fundamentally better for autistic people, their families and carers\"."

      "tags": "Ministry of Justice,Crime,Prisons,Sentencing in England and Wales,UK prisons",
      "text": "New laws to ensure the most dangerous criminals spend longer in custody have been announced.\nSo, who decides which crimes require time in prison and how long that should be?\nIn the Queen's Speech, the government said it would toughen sentences for the most serious violent offenders, including terrorists. \nAutomatic early release at the half-way point of their sentence would be scrapped. Those given sentences of four or more years for serious violent crimes would be made to serve a minimum two-thirds of that time in prison before being released. \nThey would also increase the number of people who could spend the rest of their life in jail. The minimum for serious terror offences would increase to 14 years. \nThe changes follow the killing of two people at London Bridge, by convicted terrorist Usman Khan, who had served half of his sentence.\nAbout one in 10 people convicted in court receives a prison sentence - with the rest given fines, community service or other punishments. \nGenerally, the maximum sentence for a crime is enshrined in law. \nFor example, someone convicted of burglary could face 14 years in jail. \nHowever, very few burglars will end up in prison for that long, if at all.  \nTo help judges be consistent, they refer to sentencing guidelines. \nThese help ensure similar offences are given similar punishments, across all the courts in England and Wales. \nBoth Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own sentencing guidelines. \nJudges will look at, among other things, whether the burglary involved any violence or if it was by a repeat offender. \nSo, a serial burglar who ties up victims could expect a lengthy prison sentence. \nA genuinely sorry, first-time offender who stole through an open window would be treated more leniently - perhaps through community service. \nNot necessarily. \nMany prison sentences require a portion of time is spent behind bars, with the rest served on licence in the community. \nThese licences require offenders to abide by a set of rules, which could include bans from certain areas, or substance rehabilitation. If the conditions are broken, offenders can be sent back to jail.\nHowever, some prison sentences, known as suspended sentences, involve no time in prison at all. \nFor the entirety of a suspended sentence, the offender must abide by certain conditions outside prison, with the threat of imprisonment if these are breached.\nThose placed in immediate custody by the courts go straight to jail. \nFor about 90% of such sentences, an automatic release is granted half-way through the sentence. \nThe offender is then on licence for the remainder of it. \nFor example, if someone is given a four-year sentence for robbery, they will spend two years in prison and two years outside. \nEarly release has been around for a number of decades. It is intended to allow some rehabilitation in the community, while keeping release dates consistent and prison numbers down. \nThose guilty of more serious crimes - such as serious sexual assaults or grievous bodily harm - will spend a greater part of their sentence in jail. This will normally be two-thirds of their sentence and they will require approval from the parole board to gain early release. \nThe parole board will decide whether or not the offender is safe to return into society. This decision is based on evidence from victims, health professionals, prison staff and the offender themselves.\nA life sentence rarely means life in prison. On average, those sentenced to life spend 17 years in jail. \nHowever, these offenders will be on licence until they die and expected to meet certain conditions.\nThose convicted of murder will always be given a life sentence. The judge then sets the minimum amount of time they must serve before being considered for parole.\nThe minimum the judge sets depends on the nature of the murder. \nTypical minimum prison terms for murderers over the age of 21 include: \nJudges can increase or decrease these set terms based on factors including whether the murderer was provoked or if the crime was premeditated.  \nYes, for the most extreme murder cases. \nCurrently, a whole-life order is also used for the murder of a police officer or a political killing.  \nThey are also used when a child has been killed in the most extreme circumstances.\nThere are currently 63 people serving whole life sentences, including Rosemary West, who was convicted of murdering 10 people with her husband, Fred West, and the murderers of Labour MP Jo Cox and  Fusilier Lee Rigby."

      "tags": "Parole Board,Narborough,Enderby",
      "text": "Justice Secretary Dominic Raab has suggested he would like to see a more cautious approach to future parole decisions following the arrest of double child killer Colin Pitchfork.\nPitchfork, who raped and murdered two teenage girls in the 1980s, was recalled to prison last week, two months after being released.\nIt followed concerns by probation staff about his behaviour.\nMr Raab said a \"root-and-branch\" review of the parole system was under way.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast earlier, he said: \"One of the problems in cases like this is there is, if you like, a presumption that unless it can be determined that the individual presents a risk, that they will be released.\n\"I want to look at that again because actually I think that presumption is the wrong way.\n\"If you take, for example, climate change and environmental law, we have what is called a precautionary principle because of the risk involved.\n\"I think in cases like this, where there is a serious question about risk to the public, and public protection, I think we should have a more precautionary approach.\"\nThe Parole Board told the BBC its reviews were done with \"extreme care\".\nMeanwhile, Pitchfork has been branded a remorseless psychopath who should never have been released from prison, by the detective who originally caught him.\nDavid Baker, formerly a detective chief superintendent for Leicestershire Police, believes Pitchfork was able to deceive the Parole Board into thinking it was safe to free him.\nHe said he was not at all surprised when Pitchfork then broke his licence conditions by approaching young women.\n\"I don't think he should ever be released,\" Mr Baker, speaking after Pitchfork was recalled to prison, said.\n\"I expected he would breach his parole once they let him out, because he is in the environment again where he's meeting people.\n\"Of course young girls and young women are available to him, and that's exactly what's happened.\"\nPitchfork raped and strangled 15-year-old Lynda Mann in 1983 and did the same to 15-year-old Dawn Ashworth in 1986.\nHe was the first murderer to be caught and convicted as a result of DNA profiling, a forensic technique that has now been used in countless murder investigations around the world.\n\"He admitted the offences straight away but he didn't show any remorse whatsoever,\" Mr Baker said.\n\"The majority of people are remorseful when they are caught.\n\"He's got to be a psychopath.\"\nPitchfork breached his licence conditions just two months after being released from prison, where he had been for 33 years.\nHe is understood to have approached young women on multiple occasions while out on walks from the bail hostel where he was living.\nMr Baker believes Pitchfork is capable of fooling the authorities, in the same way he fooled his wife and family in between the two murders.\n\"Pitchfork was able to switch off from being a murderer to an ordinary individual, he was quite a calculating individual,\" he said.\n\"He could switch off and suddenly the spark would ignite and he would be off on his murderous scheme again.\"\nMr Baker said police used DNA profiling to catch Pitchfork after he fortuitously read about it in a local newspaper. The article featured Alec Jeffreys, the genetics researcher at the University of Leicester who developed the technique.\nHowever, Pitchfork almost evaded capture by persuading a colleague to give a blood test in his place.\n\"He tried to deceive us in the first instance by getting somebody else to take his blood,\" said Mr Baker.\n\"He's a schemer and there's no doubt he was scheming his way through his prison sentence.\"\nThere have been concerns Pitchfork has been trying to cheat lie detector tests, and the BBC has been told he was doing this by using breathing techniques.\n\"I don't know anything about lie detectors but it's typical of Pitchfork to try that,\" Mr Baker said.\n\"I think he showed a persona in prison which was acceptable to the prison authorities and Parole Board and they accepted it and didn't see through him.\"\nA Parole Board spokesperson said: \"Parole Board panels rely heavily on the evidence of professional witnesses who have the benefit of monitoring and working closely with an offender throughout their sentence.\n\"The Parole Board's judicial decision to release Mr Pitchfork was made in May and followed consideration of extensive evidence from his community probation officer, prison probation officer and prison psychologist, who all supported his release.\n\"Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care.

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People in Northern Ireland are being urged by Stormont ministers to work from home \"where possible\" in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19.\nCurrent advice already states that people should work from home where they can but ministers said they were \"strengthening\" that message.\nIt follows an executive meeting about how to tackle rising infections.\nMinisters are also advising the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings.\nNorthern Ireland's infection rate has been climbing over the past week or so - it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland.\nIn England, since Covid restrictions lifted on 19 July, people have no longer been asked to work at home but businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to staff and customers.\nMost Covid restrictions have also been lifted in Wales, but employers are still encouraged to let people work from home where possible. \nIn Scotland, most restrictions have been lifted, but working from home where possible is advised. The government wants employers to consider long-term \"hybrid\" working models.\n\"Hospital admissions are rising and modelling indicates that admissions will increase further in the coming weeks,\" Stormont executive ministers said.\n\"The clear advice from public health experts is that an intervention is now required.\"\nIn a joint statement after Tuesday's meeting, Northern Ireland ministers said Covid-19 had \"once again taken a firm grip across our society\".\nMinisters said that if more people worked from home it would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace.\nHowever, they stopped short of ordering employers to facilitate home working, saying they \"recognise that this may present challenges in some work areas\".\nInstead, ministers said they were asking employees \"to work from home where they can and advise employers to support this where possible\".\nThe statement followed a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), who had recently said he believed anyone working from home last year when the pandemic began should do so again.\nHe has warned hospitality businesses may have to close over Christmas unless coronavirus transmission rates fall.\nFollowing Tuesday's meeting, ministers urged the public to take up the offer of vaccines and booster jabs, saying statistics were stark.\n\"Unvaccinated adults aged under 50 are almost 11 times more likely to need hospitalisation from Covid-19,\" they said.\n\"Unvaccinated individuals aged 50 and over are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those who are fully vaccinated.\"\nSpeaking after the meeting, First Minister Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was aware that restrictions had been \"acutely\" felt by the hospitality industry.\n\"We have to protect both lives and livelihood so we are working on the basis of having things open and safe,\" he said.\n\"No-one wants to be faced with a situation where business have to close,\" he added.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn F\u00e9in, said following the guidance was \"our best chance to avoid restrictions down the line\".\nShe appealed to those who can work from home to \"please work from home and for employers to facilitate that\".\n\"We want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,\" she added.\nWhat we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. \nWe know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required. \nThere was no mention of a return to lockdown from ministers today, but they also can't rule anything out. \nThe health minister has already warned that if we don't get a grip on Covid in the next two to three weeks, hospitality could again face closure at Christmas.\nThat, it must be said, remains the worst, worst case scenario and ministers will be reluctant to go there.\nThey'll hope the vaccination programme and ramping up of the booster programme in the next few weeks will help. \nMinisters are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year.\nThe executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. \nIn addition to promoting the vaccine message, ministers urged the public to \"make safer choices\" when coming in to contact with other people.\nThis advices includes meeting people outdoors in preference to indoors, wearing face coverings and ensuring good ventilation of indoor settings. \nIt is understood the Stormont executive has asked its Covid taskforce to examine issues around enforcement of wearing face masks.\nThe taskforce will also look at the potential of setting up a scores-on-the-doors type system to rate businesses on their compliance with rules and mitigations.\nMr Givan tweeted that the executive had \"engaged constructively and agreed a number of measures that will step up our collective efforts against the spread of Covid\".\nEarlier, Justice Minister Naomi Long said Stormont ministers may have to reintroduce some Covid-19 restrictions if there are \"no alternatives\".\nShe said the executive was \"looking for ways that we can avoid having to take those drastic measures\" by focusing on measures such as the vaccine booster programme and Covid certification \"to make high-risk venues as safe as possible\".\nMrs Long, the Alliance Party leader, said on Monday that ministers were \"not planning for Christmas closures\".\nOn Tuesday, she told BBC News NI that there was a \"critical period\" ahead and \"we still have it within our gift\" to avoid the need for restrictions.\nHowever, Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster, which represents the hospitality industry, said the \"rhetoric\" coming from Stormont was unhelpful.\n\"I appreciate that planning has to go on behind closed doors,\" he said, but added that politicians were making \"half statements\" with no promise of support if tighter restrictions are imposed.\n\"Those statements say to our workers: 'You might not have a job before Christmas' and it says to customers: 'Stay away'.\"\nThe executive met on Tuesday amid a high number of cases of Covid-19.\nOn Tuesday, four Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland and a further 1,476 new cases.\nLast week ministers voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports being introduced in Northern Ireland.\nThe proof of certification scheme will require people to provide a passport or proof of a negative Covid test result to access venues such as nightclubs, pubs and restaurants.\nBBC News NI understands that a debate on the Covid passport regulations could happen at Stormont on 6 or 7 December. \nThe measure is due to take effect from 29 November.\nBut it will not be enforced until 13 December, as a two-week grace period will take place to allow time for businesses and customers to adjust to the change. \nThe DUP - which voted against the plan coming into place - had asked for the assembly to be allowed to debate the regulations.\nIn his paper to executive ministers last Thursday, Mr Swann then recommended allowing a debate in the assembly on the issue.\nOrla Smyth, who owns a cafe in Belfast, told BBC News NI that speculation about future measures was not \"helpful for public confidence in using services\".\nShe explained it also made it difficult for \"business owners being able to function\".\nOn Tuesday, Mrs Long said she did not have a \"crystal ball\" about how the coming weeks will unfold, but said she believed \"people have become slightly complacent because of the vaccine\".\nWhen asked about the number of people who do not wear mandatory face coverings in retail settings, she said it was not the \"primary responsibility\" of the police to enforce this.\nRather, she added it was one of a number of agencies who have a role to play."

      "text": "Boris Johnson batted away opposition calls for him to stand down and defended himself against accusations of \"broken promises\" at PMQs.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM on social care funding, rail investment and tax.\nPicking up on reports of Tory disquiet after the PM's chaotic speech to business leaders, he asked: \"Is everything OK, prime minister?\"  \nThe PM said the government was \"delivering for...working people\".\nThe Conservative benches were packed for the exchanges, in contrast to last week's session.\n\"I see they have turned up this week prime minister,\" said Sir Keir, prompting uproar on all sides and an intervention from Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who ordered MPs to calm down.\nSeveral MPs have told the BBC that they were urged by party managers, via text or phone call, to attend Prime Minister's Questions to support Mr Johnson.\nSir Keir repeatedly claimed the government's plans for social care funding broke a Conservative manifesto pledge that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care.\n\"He's picked the pockets of working people to protect the estates of the wealthiest,\" said the Labour leader, adding: \"How could he have devised a working class dementia tax?\"\nMr Johnson said homes will not be included in the cap on costs, adding that Labour did not have a plan to solve the problem.\nThe prime minister said the government's \"huge investment\" in health and social care meant people will be able to insure themselves against the \"catastrophic cost\" of suffering from diseases such as dementia.\nSir Keir also accused Mr Johnson of breaking a promise not to raise taxes - and to deliver a \"rail revolution\" in the North of England, despite now cancelling the northern leg of HS2.\n\"Who knows if he'll make it to the next election, but if he does, how can he expect anyone to take his promises seriously?,\" asked the Labour leader. \nMr Johnson insisted there would be a rail revolution, and claimed the government was spending \u00a396bn on upgrading links.\nAnd he said Sir Keir had campaigned against HS2 - which runs through his Holborn and St Pancras constituency - adding that he had backed the new high speed rail link even though it affected his own constituents, because it was in the national interest. \n\"How can they trust that man?\" he asked.\nTalk of ousting the PM seems fanciful. He has a track record of bouncing back from adversity.\nBut it is worth noting that loud cheers from a leader's own side does not mean that underlying concerns have evaporated.\nThe former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, was greeted by regular, co-ordinated standing ovations at his party conference, but that didn't prevent MPs quietly but definitively submitting letters of no confidence.\nThe mood at the moment though seems to be for the current Conservative leader to get a grip rather than to get out.\nWhile Mr Johnson was on the back foot at PMQs, he nonetheless managed to step up attacks on the Labour leader too - the most effective of which was to suggest that HS2 would never have been built at all if Sir Keir Starmer had got his way.\nBoris Johnson's premiership has looked juddery recently, but hasn't yet been derailed.\nThe SNP's Westminster Leader, Ian Blackford, also seized on reports of Tory disquiet with the PM's recent performance, accusing him of \"floundering in failure\" and asking him if he had \"considered calling it a day\".\n\"In the real world, people are suffering a Tory cost of living crisis, Brexit is hitting the economy hard, but the prime minister can't even give a coherent speech to business leaders,\" he added.\nHe asked why Mr Johnson was \"clinging on when he quite clearly isn't up to the job\".\nThe prime minister said the British public wanted to hear less about politics and more about what the government is doing \"for the people of Scotland\".\nEarlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab praised Mr Johnson's \"ebullient, bouncy, optimistic, Tiggerish character\", saying it \"livens up\" his speeches. \nHe said there was a \"steeliness\" to the prime minister, adding: \"We work as a team\", and he dismissed the criticism as Westminster \"tittle tattle\".\nMr Johnson appeared before the CBI conference earlier this week to make his pitch for a \"green industrial revolution\" to business, including support for electric cars, investing in wind power and the government's integrated rail plan. \nBut it drew more negative attention after his impression of a car and his personal anecdote from a trip to Peppa Pig World. \n\"I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,\" he told the conference. \"Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place.\n\"It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig.\"\nAsked after the speech, \"is everything OK?\", Mr Johnson said he thought people had \"got the vast majority of the points\" he wanted to make and that the speech \"went over well\".\nIt comes after a few weeks of turbulence at Westminster.\nThe PM backed attempts to overhaul the standards system for MPs' conduct, blocking the suspension of Tory MP Owen Paterson - who had been found to have broken lobbying rules. \nNo 10 performed a U-turn on the move following a furious backlash from MPs, including some Conservatives.\nBut the fall-out led to accusations about sleaze, and wider questions about MPs' second jobs.\nThe PM came under further pressure this week over the cost cap element of his social care plan, which charities warned could unfairly hit people with fewer assets. \nMPs backed the proposals, but it was only a narrow victory for Mr Johnson thanks to a significant Tory rebellion.

      "text": "When relationships end it might be because the spark has disappeared, or maybe you just can't make time for one another.\nBut can climate change cause break-ups? \nIt might do, according to a new study which suggests albatrosses - some of the world's most loyal creatures - are \"divorcing\" more.\nResearch published in the Royal Society journal looked at 15,500 breeding pairs in the Falkland Islands over 15 years.\nAlbatross divorce is basically just cheating, in human terms. It's when one part of a couple mates with a different individual.\nLike humans, albatrosses also have an awkward growing-up phase, trying (and sometimes failing) to figure out the best way to get into a relationship.\nBut ultimately, when they find a good match, they normally stick together for life.\nJust 1% of albatrosses separate after choosing their life partner - much lower than the human divorce rate in the UK.\n\"Monogamy and long-term bonds is very common for them,\" says Francesco Ventura, researcher at the University of Lisbon and co-author of the study.\nBut in the years covered by the study with warmer water temperatures, up to 8% of albatross couples split up.\nThe study says \"environmentally-driven divorce may be an overlooked consequence\" of climate change.\nNormally, albatross divorce is triggered when a pair fail to breed, so they find new partners in the next breeding season.\nBut the findings showed pairs were divorcing even if they'd had a successful breeding season.\nFrancesco says there are two possible theories for the rise - the first one being linked to the struggles of a long-distance relationship. \nWarming waters force the birds to hunt for longer and fly further. \nIf birds then fail to return in time for a breeding season, their partners may move on with a new partner. \nAnother theory is albatross stress hormones go up in harsher environments, such as when waters are warmer. \nWith tougher breeding conditions, and food scarcity, it can cause more stress and a partner can be blamed for their \"poor performance\" - which can ultimately trigger divorce, Francesco says.\nThe research comes as many international albatross populations are in trouble.\nSome data from 2017 suggests the number of breeding pairs of the species are a little more than half of what they were in the 1980s.\nFrancesco says in the Falkland Islands, it's not an immediate concern for the population - but in other areas where the population of albatross is limited, it is a worry.\n\"Temperatures are going up and will go up, so this might introduce more disruptions,\" he says.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "text": "Bulb has been handed about \u00a31,000 per customer from the UK government to enable it to continue supplying energy.\nThe firm was put into special administration on Wednesday, which will allow it keep trading for the moment.\nBulb will be run by administrator Teneo until a buyer can be found or until its customers have moved.\nThe government loan of nearly \u00a31.7bn will mean the administration is managed in a way that the lights stay on for Bulb's 1.7 million customers.\nTeneo estimates it will cost around \u00a32.1bn to keep Bulb trading until the end of April next year. \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng can provide more money for the company if needed.\nWithout the cash, Bulb would not have been able to keep going past the middle of December, court documents show.\nDue to its size, Bulb will be run as normal for the time being, rather than its customers being immediately transferred to other suppliers, as has happened with other failing energy providers.\nBy April, the cap on energy prices may have increased significantly, which would mean higher revenues for the business.\nThe company is three times larger than any other energy supplier that has failed in recent years.\nNormally regulator Ofgem lets a firm fail and moves its customers to a new supplier.\nAt the High Court in London, Justice Adam Johnson said that if left unresolved uncertainty over Bulb would be \"bound to have an effect on customers, employees and suppliers\".\nHe said that the administration was designed \"to keep the energy supply company going, with a view to it being rescued if that is possible\".\nHe added that an alternative would be to appoint a supplier of last resort, adding: \"That is thought to be impractical here, given the size and importance of Bulb as a supplier\".\nThe judge said that the \u00a31.7bn would be \"of existential importance to Bulb\".\nEarlier in the day, Mr Kwarteng said the special administration regime was a temporary arrangement to provide \"an ultimate safety net to protect consumers and ensure continued supply\".\nHe told the House of Commons: \"We do not want this company to be in this temporary state longer than is absolutely necessary.\"\nFor Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: \"With so many companies going bust in just two months, something not happening anywhere else in the world, it points to a systemic failure of regulation. \n\"Firms took risky bets and were allowed to do so and the government and Ofgem significantly deregulated the conditions of operation in 2016.\nMr Miliband called for \"a proper external review of the regulation of the market\".\nAs a result of a cap limiting what companies can charge their customers, some businesses have been forced to sell energy for less than they bought it for.\nBigger companies tend to buy their gas further in advance, helping them avoid large hits from the price spike. However smaller firms that are less able to do that have come under pressure.\nSince the beginning of September, 22 energy suppliers have failed following a spike in gas prices.\nLabour MP Alex Sobel said: \"We're moving back to an oligopoly of energy companies who are increasing their profits whilst the supplier of last resort is socialising losses.\nMr Kwarteng replied: \"I've always maintained that competition is absolutely essential in this market.\n\"What's happened is there's been a huge mismatch between the wholesale price and the retail price cap, and the retail price cap is there to protect consumers.\"\nLiberal Democrat MP Layla Moran suggested a \"Northern Rock-style energy company to take on customers of companies that have gone under\" if the current process is not working.\nConsumer group Which? said the support \"should provide reassurance\" to Bulb customers.\n\"We recommend Bulb customers to do nothing and wait for more information about the special administration process,\" said Which? home products and services editor Lisa Barber.\n\"Its customers will continue to see their bills limited by the price cap, which is likely to be the best deal for them at the moment.\n\"There are few savings to be made by switching and some suppliers are not taking on new customers due to high wholesale gas prices,\" she added."

If you do not want to know the result of the Great British Bake Off final, please look away now...\nGiuseppe celebrated victory on Tuesday after what judges on the Channel 4 show described as the closest finale yet.\nThe 45-year-old Bristol resident pipped this year's fellow finalists Chigs and Crystelle, who all had to make food for a Mad Hatter's Tea Party.\n\"There are no words, I am speechless for once,\" said the show's first Italian winner.\nIn the final episode, he made dough filled with chocolate and hazelnuts, shaped in the form of a giant mushroom. He also produced mango and passion fruit panna cottas, orange and fig heart-shaped muffins, and asparagus and pea-filled choux pastries shaped like a caterpillar. \nSeries 12 of the show saw a dozen bakers initially enter the Bake Off bubble at the start of the competition in September, before judges Paul Hollywood and Dame Prue Leith turned the heat up on them with a series of knock-out challenges over 10 episodes.\nThey set the final three bakers three tasks: to make carrot cake, produce Belgian buns and recreate a Mad Hatter's Tea Party, while showing four different baking disciplines.\nThe victorious Giuseppe dedicated his win to his parents. \"All I can think of is the reaction from my mum and dad,\" he continued. \n\"The fact is that everything I have done to deserve this comes from his [my dad's] heritage, it's the best thank you note I can possibly send him.\n\"He is going through a very bad time health-wise, so I think this is going to be a great boost.\n\"I don't say often or lightly that I am proud of what I do, but in this case I am really proud of what I have done.

Dell'Anno is my surname which translates in English to 'of the year' - and I feel this has certainly been my year.\"\nHollywood said he had \"done an incredible job\". \n\"The first time I walked into the tent and in the first signature I saw his mini rolls, I thought that looks like our winner, you could see the heart and soul going into his baking,\" declared the judge.\nFellow judge, the recently-honoured Dame Prue added: \"He is such a classic beautiful baker and he represents a long tradition of classic Italian baking. He has done it brilliantly all the way through.\n\"I am going home to make much more Italian cakes because they really are good.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People in Northern Ireland are being urged by Stormont ministers to work from home \"where possible\" in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19.\nCurrent advice already states that people should work from home where they can but ministers said they were \"strengthening\" that message.\nIt follows an executive meeting about how to tackle rising infections.\nMinisters are also advising the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings.\nNorthern Ireland's infection rate has been climbing over the past week or so - it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland.\nIn England, since Covid restrictions lifted on 19 July, people have no longer been asked to work at home but businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to staff and customers.\nMost Covid restrictions have also been lifted in Wales, but employers are still encouraged to let people work from home where possible. \nIn Scotland, most restrictions have been lifted, but working from home where possible is advised. The government wants employers to consider long-term \"hybrid\" working models.\n\"Hospital admissions are rising and modelling indicates that admissions will increase further in the coming weeks,\" Stormont executive ministers said.\n\"The clear advice from public health experts is that an intervention is now required.\"\nIn a joint statement after Tuesday's meeting, Northern Ireland ministers said Covid-19 had \"once again taken a firm grip across our society\".\nMinisters said that if more people worked from home it would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace.\nHowever, they stopped short of ordering employers to facilitate home working, saying they \"recognise that this may present challenges in some work areas\".\nInstead, ministers said they were asking employees \"to work from home where they can and advise employers to support this where possible\".\nThe statement followed a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), who had recently said he believed anyone working from home last year when the pandemic began should do so again.\nHe has warned hospitality businesses may have to close over Christmas unless coronavirus transmission rates fall.\nFollowing Tuesday's meeting, ministers urged the public to take up the offer of vaccines and booster jabs, saying statistics were stark.\n\"Unvaccinated adults aged under 50 are almost 11 times more likely to need hospitalisation from Covid-19,\" they said.\n\"Unvaccinated individuals aged 50 and over are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those who are fully vaccinated.\"\nSpeaking after the meeting, First Minister Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was aware that restrictions had been \"acutely\" felt by the hospitality industry.\n\"We have to protect both lives and livelihood so we are working on the basis of having things open and safe,\" he said.\n\"No-one wants to be faced with a situation where business have to close,\" he added.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn F\u00e9in, said following the guidance was \"our best chance to avoid restrictions down the line\".\nShe appealed to those who can work from home to \"please work from home and for employers to facilitate that\".\n\"We want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,\" she added.\nWhat we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. \nWe know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required. \nThere was no mention of a return to lockdown from ministers today, but they also can't rule anything out. \nThe health minister has already warned that if we don't get a grip on Covid in the next two to three weeks, hospitality could again face closure at Christmas.\nThat, it must be said, remains the worst, worst case scenario and ministers will be reluctant to go there.\nThey'll hope the vaccination programme and ramping up of the booster programme in the next few weeks will help. \nMinisters are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year.\nThe executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. \nIn addition to promoting the vaccine message, ministers urged the public to \"make safer choices\" when coming in to contact with other people.\nThis advices includes meeting people outdoors in preference to indoors, wearing face coverings and ensuring good ventilation of indoor settings. \nIt is understood the Stormont executive has asked its Covid taskforce to examine issues around enforcement of wearing face masks.\nThe taskforce will also look at the potential of setting up a scores-on-the-doors type system to rate businesses on their compliance with rules and mitigations.\nMr Givan tweeted that the executive had \"engaged constructively and agreed a number of measures that will step up our collective efforts against the spread of Covid\".\nEarlier, Justice Minister Naomi Long said Stormont ministers may have to reintroduce some Covid-19 restrictions if there are \"no alternatives\".\nShe said the executive was \"looking for ways that we can avoid having to take those drastic measures\" by focusing on measures such as the vaccine booster programme and Covid certification \"to make high-risk venues as safe as possible\".\nMrs Long, the Alliance Party leader, said on Monday that ministers were \"not planning for Christmas closures\".\nOn Tuesday, she told BBC News NI that there was a \"critical period\" ahead and \"we still have it within our gift\" to avoid the need for restrictions.\nHowever, Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster, which represents the hospitality industry, said the \"rhetoric\" coming from Stormont was unhelpful.\n\"I appreciate that planning has to go on behind closed doors,\" he said, but added that politicians were making \"half statements\" with no promise of support if tighter restrictions are imposed.\n\"Those statements say to our workers: 'You might not have a job before Christmas' and it says to customers: 'Stay away'.\"\nThe executive met on Tuesday amid a high number of cases of Covid-19.\nOn Tuesday, four Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland and a further 1,476 new cases.\nLast week ministers voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports being introduced in Northern Ireland.\nThe proof of certification scheme will require people to provide a passport or proof of a negative Covid test result to access venues such as nightclubs, pubs and restaurants.\nBBC News NI understands that a debate on the Covid passport regulations could happen at Stormont on 6 or 7 December. \nThe measure is due to take effect from 29 November.\nBut it will not be enforced until 13 December, as a two-week grace period will take place to allow time for businesses and customers to adjust to the change. \nThe DUP - which voted against the plan coming into place - had asked for the assembly to be allowed to debate the regulations.\nIn his paper to executive ministers last Thursday, Mr Swann then recommended allowing a debate in the assembly on the issue.\nOrla Smyth, who owns a cafe in Belfast, told BBC News NI that speculation about future measures was not \"helpful for public confidence in using services\".\nShe explained it also made it difficult for \"business owners being able to function\".\nOn Tuesday, Mrs Long said she did not have a \"crystal ball\" about how the coming weeks will unfold, but said she believed \"people have become slightly complacent because of the vaccine\".\nWhen asked about the number of people who do not wear mandatory face coverings in retail settings, she said it was not the \"primary responsibility\" of the police to enforce this.\nRather, she added it was one of a number of agencies who have a role to play."

The Netherlands saw several nights of rioting over a partial lockdown. \nIn its assessment, the WHO warned Covid was the top cause of death in its Europe region. \n\"Cumulative reported deaths are projected to reach over 2.2 million by spring next year, based on current trends,\" the WHO said on Tuesday. \nConfirmed Covid-related deaths recently doubled to almost 4,200 a day, it added. \nIn Russia alone, the daily death toll has been recently topping 1,200.\nA high number of unvaccinated people and the prevalence of the Delta variant in some countries were key factors behind high transmission rates in the Europe region, the WHO said.\nThe WHO Europe director, Dr Hans Kluge, urged those who were still unvaccinated to get the jab. \n\"All of us have the opportunity and responsibility to help avert unnecessary tragedy and loss of life, and limit further disruption to society and businesses over this winter season,\" he said.\nAs well as European nations, the WHO also considers Israel and ex-Soviet states like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan as making up the region. \nUnlike the UK - and England in particular - many parts of Europe kept major restrictions in place for much longer.\nWhereas England fully unlocked in mid-July, parts of Europe did not do this until the autumn, and in many places kept tougher restrictions in place even as they did.\nPart of this was to do with timing. The UK was hit by the more infectious Alpha variant and then Delta sooner, meaning it was in a position to push ahead with unlocking before others.\nBut it was also a conscious choice backed by the government's top scientists, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance.\nThe logic - along with the benefit of ending restrictions that themselves cause harm to health - was that it was better to have the rebound in infection, the so-called exit wave, in the summer.\nIt was felt the increase in the spread of the virus would be mitigated by the better weather, meaning more time spent outdoors, and would avoid the winter crunch when pressure on the health system increases across the board.\nRead more: Can UK avoid a Europe-style return to lockdown?"

      "tags": "Jonathan Ashworth,Social care,Sajid Javid",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion.\nThe Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new \u00a386,000 lifetime limit on costs.\nLabour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change.\nThe PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system.\nThe cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills.\nUnder the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023:\nOn Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246.\nNineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead.\nThe bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. \nDefending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win.\nPushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament.\nThe Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. \nMr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a \"step in the right direction\" and \"an improvement on what we have today\".\nBut he said its plans for calculating the cap were a \"big disappointment\" and \"not as generous as people like me wanted\".\nAfter a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like.\nBut that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place.\nAnd on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable.\nThe vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own.\nRead Laura's blog in full\nUnder the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit.\nThe threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to \u00a3100,000 able to qualify, rather than \u00a323,250 currently.\nThe government announced last week that only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap.\nLocal authorities will meet care costs beyond the \u00a386,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded through a new health and social care tax.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care.\nSally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was \"sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment\".\n\"The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,\" she said.\n\"It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this.\"\nWhen asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: \"I can't predict individual situations.\"\nAfter the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: \"Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care.\n\"Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected.\"\nBut the prime minister said the new system would be \"progressive\" and \"much better\" than the existing one.\n\"Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of \u00a323,000 or more - now you get support if you have \u00a3100,000 or less, so we're helping people,\" Mr Johnson said.\nHe added: \"We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country.\"\nLorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent \"every penny that she ever earned\" on care.\nDespite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of \u00a3140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. \nShe says for her mother, 83, selling her home was \"probably the worst thing ever\".\n\"She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,\" Lorraine adds. \n\"Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances.\"\nHow will you be affected by the cap on social care costs?

      "text": "An MP has said it \"has to be possible for politics and parenting to mix\" after being told she cannot sit in the Commons with her three-month-old son.\nLabour's Stella Creasy was informed it was against the rules to bring a child to a debate at Westminster Hall after doing so on Tuesday.\nSpeaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has asked a committee of MPs to review the rules.\nMs Creasy said she was \"pleased to hear this\" - as rules meant she could not be in the chamber for his statement.\nBut Conservative MP Scott Benton criticised her stance on Twitter, saying: \"Parents who get paid a fraction of what you do pay for childcare and juggle responsibilities so they can go to work. What makes you so special?\"\nAddressing the Commons, Sir Lindsay said it was \"extremely important\" for parents to be able to participate fully in the work of the House, which has a nursery.\n\"Rules have to be seen in context and they change with the times,\" he told the House. \nHe asked the Commons Procedure Committee to \"look into this matter\". The committee, chaired by Conservative MP Karen Bradley, makes recommendations on the practical operation of the House.\nMs Creasy told the BBC she had regularly taken her son - whom she is breastfeeding - and before him, her daughter, into the Commons chamber.\nBut after appearing with her son at the adjoining Westminster Hall on Tuesday, she received an email from the private secretary to the chairman of the ways and means committee, Dame Eleanor Laing, which said this was not in line with recently published rules on \"behaviour and courtesies\".\nDeputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said he had \"a lot of sympathy\" for Ms Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, and politicians needed to make sure \"our profession is brought into the modern world... [so] parents can juggle the jobs they do with the family time they need\".\nBut, while saying a baby in the Commons \"certainly wouldn't distract me or get in the way of me doing my job\", Mr Raab said it was for the House authorities to decide the \"right balance\".\nBoris Johnson's official spokesman said the PM wanted to see \"further improvements\" on making Parliament family-friendly, though any change to the rules was a matter for the Commons.  \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment while the Procedure Committee considered the matter.\nMs Creasy - who is encouraging more mothers to enter politics through a campaign called This Mum Votes - shared the email she was sent on Twitter, writing: \"Mothers in the mother of all parliaments are not to be seen or heard it seems...\"\nThe rule book, which was issued by the speaker and deputy speakers and applies to the chamber of the House of Commons and Westminster Hall, was updated in September.\nIt says: \"You should not take your seat in the chamber when accompanied by your child, nor stand at either end of the Chamber, between divisions.\" The same wording was also used in a previous version of the rule book.\nBut another MP, Alex Davies-Jones, said she had been assured by Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle that if she needed to breastfeed her child in the chamber she could do so.\nMs Creasy said this was \"not a system that works for anyone who isn't a man of a certain age from a certain background\".\n\"I don't have maternity cover - I don't have the employment rights to have maternity cover,\" she said, adding the situation as it stands \"is bad for our democracy\".\nAsked what needed to change to help MPs continue to work as new parents, she said: \"It's too late for me - so I am trying my best to make sure Walthamstow continues to be heard because it deserves to be heard.\"\nShe called for the MPs' rule book to be reviewed and has asked House authorities what she should do if she continues to bring her son to work.\n\"I've had a baby, I haven't given up my brain or capacity to do things and our politics and our policy making will be better by having more mums at the table,\" she added.\nWhile MPs are entitled to paid maternity leave for six months and a proxy vote, some have said it is difficult to obtain funding for adequate maternity cover.\nAnd MPs must be physically present at Westminster in order to represent constituents' views during Commons debates, for example.\nFormer Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was thought to be the first MP to cradle her baby during a debate in the Commons chamber in 2018. \nAlso that year, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern became the first world leader to take her baby to the floor of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\nA House of Commons spokesperson said it was vital all MPs were able to carry out their duties in and around Parliament. \nThey could consult with the Speaker, deputy Speakers, clerks and doorkeepers about their requirements while in the chamber or Westminster Hall at any time, they added.\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

      "tags": "Scottish government,UK government,Scotland drug deaths,Drug legalisation,Addiction,Drug use,Heroin,Glasgow",
      "text": "Scotland's latest drug death figures are to be published on Friday - with the country expected to still have the highest rate in Europe. \nPublic health minister Joe FitzPatrick lost his job after figures released last year showed that 1,264 people died in 2019, which was even worse than the year before.\nIn January, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced \u00a3250m in extra funding over five years to tackle the rising number of fatalities after admitting that her government should have done more.\nBut almost three years after the deaths were declared a public health emergency, what can be done to tackle the problem?\nOpposition parties have accused the Scottish government of cutting rehab programmes in previous years, which they say has had a big part to play in the recent upward trend in the number of deaths. \nThere are currently 408 rehab beds in Scotland, with the Scottish government pledging to spend \u00a320m a year for the next five years to increase that number across the country. \nCastle Craig rehab clinic, a private hospital near West Linton in the Scottish Borders, has treated people for alcohol and drug addiction for 30 years.\nOf its current patient list of 60, only two are NHS-funded. Around a quarter of its clients are Dutch - reflecting the value placed on its services by insurers in the Netherlands - with the remainder being privately funded or via health insurance.\nThe facility's medical director, Prof Jonathan Chick, said the proportion of Scottish patients - particularly those funded by the Scottish NHS - has fallen in recent years.\nThe weekly cost of treatment at the clinic ranges starts from \u00a32,500, which Prof Chick said was out of the reach of most families - but not out of the reach of health services.\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"They are providing quite expensive treatments for years and years and not looking at other opportunities.\"\nSeveral frontline charities and critics of the Scottish government's approach to tackling the crisis have backed the Scottish Conservatives' Right to Recovery Bill.\nThe Tories say it will enshrine in law individuals' right to their chosen drug treatment, including residential rehabilitation services, which the party says would help get people off drugs and recover rather than simply managing their addictions. \nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: \"This proposal has the backing of frontline groups and experts across the political spectrum. SNP MSPs are reportedly on board privately. We only need the government to wake up, stop stalling and support it.\"\nDrugs minister Angela Constance said the government was working hard to get more people into treatment that works for them as quickly as possible. \nShe added: \"Without treatment, there is little hope of recovery so we are funding as many community and third-sector initiatives as we can so that individuals have the widest possible choice and can opt for the support which suits them and their family.\"\nThe Scottish government set up a drugs deaths taskforce in response to the crisis, which met for the first time in September 2019.\nIt has spent time gathering evidence and proposing changes that it says could quickly save lives.\nThe main focus of this has been the distribution of Naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opiate-related overdose.\nUsers often die because they are unable to breathe and, if used in time, Naloxone can restore breathing and save their lives. \nDrug campaigners have been trying to get the kits into the hands of anyone who might have or be a witness to a drug overdose. This is mainly drug users and relatives but could also be anyone involved in services such as hostels or outreach workers. \nAlmost two-thirds of ambulance crews - who have been using Naloxone for many years - are now also able to distribute it to people who might need it, with the remainder due to be trained by the end of this year.\nPolice Scotland has also run a pilot project for its officers to carry Naloxone while on patrol.\nThe most significant harm reduction services are methadone and buprenorphine which are offered to heroin addicts to reduce the risk of fatal overdose.\nMethadone is controversial because it has been implicated in more drug-related deaths than heroin, the drug it is a substitute for.\nExperts point out that methadone is recognised by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine but say it is not always delivered effectively.  \nDavid Liddell, of the Scottish Drugs Forum, said there was a \"massive issue\" around people on too low doses. \n\"We estimated around half of those on methadone are on too low a dose, so what is happening for individuals is they are then forced to top-up on street drugs,\" he said.\n\"That's fuelling the poly-drug use problem that we have and leading to deaths as a result.\" \nHe also said there were problems around access to methadone services and retention of drug users within treatment.\nHe said some countries such as Norway had a policy of \"no unplanned discharges\" and they would actively seek to bring people back into treatment.\nEarlier this month, it was announced that Buvidal - an alternative to methadone that contains buprenorphine - would be rolled out across the country after a successful trial in prisons.\nIt allows patients to receive an injection every 28 days instead of having to visit a chemist every day to take their medication.\nIt is hoped this will allow patients to focus on improving their lives and overall health rather than managing their dependence.\nAll the experts who gave evidence to Westminster's Scottish affairs committee said the stigma around drug addiction was stopping people seeking treatment.\nProf Matheson said the people who needed help were the \"most marginalised in Scottish society\".\nShe said they were not willing, interested or engaged with services because they were stigmatised and did not want to come forward. \nProf Matheson said only about 40% of people who needed treatment were getting it.\nShe said: \"They don't want to go to their GP if they have health problems, they feel stigmatised if they have a criminal record and they are stigmatised about getting work. \n\"This is keeping people excluded from the help and the care they need.\"\nProf Matheson said that, as a result, older drug users - who have a range of respiratory, cardiac, liver and kidney issues - were not seeking treatment and were physically more vulnerable to an overdose. \nIt is now more than four years since Glasgow City Council first proposed allowing users to take their own drugs under the supervision of medical staff at a special facility in the city.\nThe idea is to encourage users who inject heroin or cocaine on Glasgow's streets to enter a safe and clean environment. \nIt is hoped the special room would encourage addicts into treatment, cut down on heroin needles on city streets and counter the spread of diseases such as HIV.\nThe so-called \"fix rooms\" are already operating in some overseas countries but this would be the first of its kind in the UK.\nThey have the support of the Scottish government but drug laws are reserved to Westminster.\nThe House of Commons committee that investigated Scotland's drug crisis recommended new legislation to provide for safe drug consumption facilities but it was rejected in the UK government's response to its report.\nThe UK government said: \"We want to do all we can to stop people having access to drugs that could ultimately kill them. No illegal drug-taking can be assumed to be safe and there is no safe way to take them.\"\nGlasgow announced Scotland's first scheme giving drug addicts diamorphine, a pharmaceutical-grade form of heroin, in November 2019.\nThe Enhanced Drug Treatment Service (EDTS) aims to use the medically-licensed drug to treat patients with the most severe, long-standing and complex addictions.Six ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis\nThey will have to attend the clinic, which has been licensed by the Home Office, twice a day, every day.\nIt is hoped the facility will help reduce street drug use, overdose deaths and the spread of HIV in the city.\nThe Daily Record newspaper launched a campaign two years ago calling for the decriminalisation of drug use. \nIt said Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Canada and, most notably, Portugal were among 25 nations to loosen the punitive attitude to drug possession to enable treatment programmes to succeed.\nThe Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (RCPE) has also recently called for the Scottish and UK governments to seriously consider decriminalising drug possession.\nChanging the law to \"decriminalise\" does not mean class A drugs would be legal, but people would not be prosecuted for possession for personal use.\nAll UK drugs misuse legislation is currently reserved to Westminster. \nThe 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act bans the possession, supply, manufacture, import and export of controlled drugs except by licence.\nA cross-party Westminster committee - chaired by SNP MP Pete Wishart but including four Conservative MPs, three Labour members, two Lib Dems and two other SNP MPs - found that decriminalisation was a \"public health\" approach that could cut the stigma around problem drug use and encourage people to seek treatment.\nSchemes elsewhere channel drug addicts committing low level crimes into treatment instead of jail.\nPolice Scotland's Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson called for radical reform, saying politicians should have the \"confidence and courage\" to decriminalise. \nHe said the criminal justice process was actually pushing people into a place where there was more harm.\nThe woman leading the Scottish government's drugs taskforce, Prof Catriona Matheson, told BBC Scotland the evidence for decriminalisation was strong.\nShe said: \"It is about not putting these marginalised drug users into prison because that further marginalises them and that makes the recovery all the more difficult.\"\nThe UK government later rejected the report's recommendation to reform the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act and decriminalise drugs for personal use.\nIt said decriminalisation would not \"eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence\".\nIt added: \"There is a strong link between drugs and crime, which is why we reject the assertion that the Department for Health and Social Care should lead on drug misuse. We know that people who regularly use heroin, cocaine or crack cocaine are estimated to commit around 45% of all acquisitive crime.\"\nThe Scottish Greens have called for both the UK and Scottish governments to admit that the so-called \"war on drugs\" has failed, and to instead focus on \"restoring people's dignity and treating their addiction, rather than criminalising them\"."

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

The problem was finding beds.  \nTo allow new patients in, staff have to get people out of the hospital and back into the community.\nMarc Neil, the assistant director of unscheduled care at the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust, allocates beds for people in hospital as well as in the community. \n\"Every day is a continuous struggle to find enough beds for everyone who needs one,\" he said. \n\"Every hour of the day that we move a patient is a choice to put someone there and someone not. Trained professionals are making those choices but, yes, it is tough.\"  \nEach health trust is faced with a similar problem.  \nOn Monday night, more than 100 beds had been located in the community for hospital patients to be moved on. \nBut they were all declined because families said they were unsuitable for reasons such as where they were located or what facilities were offered.  \nMr Neil said \"difficult conversations\" had to take place but, he added: \"We would remind people that the conversation we are having with you is the same conversation that we had with the person who was in this bed before you.\n\"At the moment, there are 103 beds available in the community but we can't get people to move out of hospital and into those beds as they aren't close to their homes or within their health trust.\n\"We are pleading with the public to work with us.\"\nThe nurses move around, fixing blankets and pulling curtains to protect patient dignity.\nAt every turn, there is a sick person waiting to be seen or to be admitted onto a ward. \nAt the peak, 134 people were waiting - in a department that originally housed 65 bedded cubicles.   \nDue to Covid, there are now several separate areas under one roof.  \nSome patients sit in proper waiting areas - others are in corridors with babies wrapped in blankets on their laps, while others lie on trolley beds. \nOlder women peer out from under clutched blankets; younger patients scroll their phones.   \nPatients sit socially distanced alongside each other as staff scurry about delivering medication, applying IV drips and taking temperatures.\nEvery available space has been transformed into an additional waiting area - and everyone just seems to be waiting. \nIt is overwhelming to watch. \nRead more here.\nWhen we spoke to him, Dr Dobbin had worked eight consecutive shifts, including with the Air Ambulance.  \nHe said emergency departments across Northern Ireland were \"overwhelmed\".   \n\"We are delivering care but perhaps not in the space where we want to deliver it - I expect things to get continually worse over the winter months,\" he added.\nThings are precarious across the entire health and social care system. \nAccording to the health trusts' winter plans, even if things were to stand still over the next couple of months - something that is highly unlikely - an additional 500 beds could be needed. \nDr Dobbin said the figure of 500 was becoming \"a likely number\".\n\"Right now, in November, there are 220 patients in emergency departments that are waiting for a hospital bed - we need those hospital beds right now. \n\"So considering how things might escalate with Covid and the winter pressures that number of 500 is looking likely.\"  \nOne patient described the number of people coming in and out as \"mad\" and said she had been waiting so long she had seen three different shift changes. \n\"Staff are great, I have to give it to them - I sat here all last night with no sleep... looks like I will be here tonight again,\" she said.    \nLead emergency department nurse Jenny Nicholson said it was upsetting to see patients remaining in the department for several days. \n\"It's heartbreaking to leave them here in the ED knowing you are going to come back the next morning to see them again here,\" she said.\n\"While we are providing the care that they need, the plan is in place and we are following that plan, they are not in the bed where they should be, where they would get the right care from a specialist.\"\nDirector of hospital services David Robinson said that the sheer numbers of patients was having knock-on effects on the rest of the hospital - including on surgery. \n\"Some of our sickest patients require to be cared for in intensive care, so with every additional bed we've put up in intensive care, regrettably we have to close a theatre for that week, which means unfortunately, we have cancelled operations.\"\nHe appealed for everyone to get vaccinated and said that many of the Covid patients who were in the intensive care unit had not been. \n\"Just think about Christmas - it's for themselves, it's for their family, their neighbours but also for strangers - people they'll never meet, because for them, being in ICU means that surgery, unfortunately, has to be downturned.\"\nCovid and the pressures of dealing with it remain constant - just one corridor away from the general emergency department is a ward where people with the virus are treated. \nThe same doctors and nurses attend to them, pulling on additional items of personal protective equipment (PPE) as they move from one area to another, with a sense of organised calm.

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Brain,Babies & toddlers,Parenting",
      "text": "Teaching teenagers the science behind babies' brain development gives them practical skills as future parents, a University of Oxford study has found. \nTeenagers in 21 schools took part in a pilot scheme, which is now being rolled out more widely. \nThe Duchess of Cambridge is backing the project and visited one of the schools involved earlier on Wednesday.  \nPrevious research has suggested only a quarter of adults understand how much the first few years shape life chances. \nAlmost 4,000 pupils have taken part in the special science lessons, designed by researchers from the University of Oxford. \nThey learned about the connections made in the developing brain during the first years of life, as babies experience the world around them. \nEach new experience can lead to new neural circuits in the brain, while stress can negatively influence development.\nThere are also practical tips in the lessons on how to engage with babies to encourage their speech and understanding of the world. \nPupils are also introduced to the idea of neuroplasticity, the capacity of the brain to go on changing throughout our lives.\nBexhill High Academy, is one of the schools in the pilot scheme, Year 9 pupil, Jack, said had never realised how much babies could understand. \"It's the foundation for their whole life, so I would treat them differently -  I would play with them.\"\nDivina, also in Year  9, said she took away practical tips: \"If you speak to babies in a singing sort of voice it makes them interact more and play more.\" \nThe Oxford academics found that after the lessons 90% of the pupils knew how best to speak to a baby, and 86% could name an activity that would help development.\nTeenage brains, like those of babies, also go through a phase of heightened plasticity as they develop and mature. \nDr Elizabeth Rapa, from the University of Oxford, said: \"In the same way we teach children about the risks of smoking or poor diet, they need to know about why experiences in our early years are so important.\"\nEarlier this year, the Duchess of Cambridge launched The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, with the aim of increasing awareness of how the first five years of life can influence future life chances. \nIt follows a large research study she commissioned which found only 24% of adults understood the contribution of early years. \nOn Wednesday, she visited one of the pilot schools in the science project to see what teenagers had learnt. \nFelicity Gillespie, from the charity Kindred\u00b2, which funded the Oxford research, said pupils could see the relevance of what they were learning. \n\"Even those who may not grow up to become parents themselves will have some contact with very young children as siblings, baby sitters, uncles and aunts.  So understanding how their brains develop is crucial.\"\nMany adults learn how important it is to stimulate and engage with babies only when once they have become parents for the first time. \nParents at a sensory session for babies in Sutton said they wish they had known more.\nMichelle Prince, who brought her baby, Joshua, to the session said she she would have liked to have known how important it is to stimulate her baby's brain in the early months.\n\"So many connections are being made. He's only a few months old but in the first year, the brain doubles in size. It's just the importance of making sure they're stimulated really,\" she said.\nBobby Sharman, who comes to the session with his baby cousin, Nora, said it was his favourite part of the day.\n\"You can see how she's learning, she's just developing really well. She's clapping, smiling, waving at people now.\"\nHe thinks the classes for teenagers are a great idea, because \"we all need to know how to look after babies\".\n\"If you're a nephew or a niece and you have to look after a little child. I think everyone should know how to look after a baby from as young as possible and how they develop.\"\nMore than 100 schools have expressed and interest in adopting the lessons as part of their science curriculum with the hope that more will follow.

      "title": "Covid: Can UK avoid a Europe-style return to lockdown?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid infection rates have started rising sharply in parts of Western Europe, prompting the introduction of fresh restrictions and lockdowns.\nIt has triggered fears the UK could follow suit. But there are plenty of reasons to believe Britain will escape the worst of what is being seen on the continent. In fact, the UK may well be in the strongest position of all to weather Covid this winter.\nTo understand why that could be the case, you need to look at the reasons why cases have started to take off in Western Europe.\nUnlike the UK - and England in particular - many parts of Europe kept major restrictions in place for much longer.\nWhereas England fully unlocked in mid-July, parts of Europe did not do this until the autumn, and in many places kept tougher restrictions in place even as they did. \nPart of this was to do with timing. The UK was hit by the more infectious Alpha variant and then Delta sooner, meaning it was in a position to push ahead with unlocking before others.\nBut it was also a conscious choice backed by the government's top scientists, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance.\nThe logic - along with the benefit of ending restrictions that themselves cause harm to health -  was that it was better to have the rebound in infection, the so-called exit wave, in the summer.\nIt was felt the increase in the spread of the virus would be mitigated by the better weather, meaning more time spent outdoors, and would avoid the winter crunch when pressure on the health system increases across the board.\nThe UK has, in effect, already had the wave the rest of Europe is seeing and has managed to avoid being swamped by it.\nThat is mainly because of the amount of immunity built up.\nA combination of good vaccine rollout, particularly among the older more vulnerable groups who are the ones most at risk of serious illness, and natural immunity from infection means there is likely to be a much smaller pool of vulnerable people for the virus to infect.\nResearchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been trying to quantify this by looking at what would happen if everyone was suddenly exposed to the virus in one go.\nThey modelled this for England - although there is nothing to suggest Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be any different - and 18 other European nations.\nIf this hypothetical situation happened, England would have by far the fewest people ending up in hospital - 62 per 100,000 people - because of immunity built up by vaccination and infection. That compares with more than 300 in Germany, largely because of their lower levels of infection to date, and more than 800 in Romania, which has struggled to convince its public to come forward for vaccination.\nThis was the picture at the end of October. If the same analysis was done at the end of November it is likely the situation would be even more favourable for England, says lead researcher Dr Lloyd Chapman.\nThat's because the UK is ploughing ahead faster than other nations with boosters. Again part of this is related to timing. As the UK was quicker off the mark with Covid vaccinations initially, there are greater numbers of people becoming eligible for a booster.\n\"We are giving those boosters to the very people who are most at risk at perhaps the best time - they will have the best protection in winter.\"\nBut Dr Chapman also points out this has come at a price - the high rates of infection have resulted in a greater amount of serious illness and death in recent months than many of our Western European neighbours.\nAnd he adds the research should not be seen as a guarantee we will escape the winter without seeing a surge in cases. \"We may be in the strongest position - but we could still see cases double and that would cause problems.\"\nBut is that likely? What is perhaps most remarkable about the UK is just how stable infection levels have been. Ever since the sharp rise seen in early summer peaked in mid-July, infection rates have bobbled along, small rises being followed by similar drops.\nThere is no other part of Europe that has seen Covid infections held so stable with very few restrictions in place.\nInstead, when other nations have seen cases surge restrictions have tended to be reimposed. This is happening now in parts of Western Europe and follows on from what happened in Eastern Europe early in the autumn.\nRomania, for example, saw a sharp rise in cases in September and October and reacted by introducing a night curfew, sending children home from school and introducing health passes for access to public venues.\nIt is telling that those nations that have had the most problems as winter arrives are the ones identified by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having the greatest pool of vulnerable people. How far this pattern spreads across Europe remains to be seen.\nBut immunity alone does not explain why the UK, and in particular England, has seen such stable rates, says Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the government's infectious disease modelling group.\nProf Medley, speaking in a personal capacity, believes it is more complex than that. \"I think we are seeing the public playing an important role.\"\nHe says a combination of limiting mixing and frequent use of rapid tests, which are more easy to access here than in many other countries, seems to be doing just enough to keep the virus in check.\n\"The government has passed the risk management to the public - and we've been able to do that better than other countries.\" \nThe big question is whether that will last throughout winter - Scotland and Northern Ireland are already talking about the possibility of tightening of restrictions. Prof Medley says it is \"delicately\" balanced, but with every passing week the chances are getting better.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "Scotland's prisons have seen a surge in drug seizures during the pandemic, new figures show. \nThere has been an 18-fold increase in stoppages of so-called street Valium in the space of a year, while seizures of psychoactive substances have nearly doubled.\nIllegal substances often get inside prisons through drug-soaked clothing or letters before being smoked.\nThe Scottish Prison Service said it has invested in new ways to detect drugs.\nOne expert said more prisoners may have turned to drugs during the pandemic as family visits were stopped. \nA spate of drug overdoses at HMP Shotts in North Lanarkshire in recent weeks have been linked to new psychoactive substances.\nThese substances, such as synthetic cannabinoid \"Spice\", and \"street\" benzodiazepines, such as Etizolam, are now thought to be the dominant drugs in prisons. \nOne serving officer at a large Scottish jail, speaking to BBC Scotland anonymously, said: \"The prisoners don't know the strength of this stuff from one batch to another, so it's proper Russian roulette territory. \n\"Detection is difficult when its sold in postage-stamp sized quantities and then cut up even smaller. \n\"It's hard to deal with at times, especially when prisoners are so unpredictable, but you have to remember it's no different to what you are seeing on schemes up and down the country.\" \nFigures released to BBC Scotland under freedom of information laws show there were 229 recoveries of suspected psychoactive substances across the prison estate in June 2020.\nIn June of this year there were 421 such seizures. \nFor Etizolam, there were 11 recoveries by wardens in jails across Scotland in June 2020 but 198 in the same month this year. \nThe quantities of drugs involved in each incident was not released. \nEtizolam is a benzodiazepine known as fake Valium and is many times stronger than prescription drugs.\nThese substances are a major factor in Scotland's wider drugs deaths problem and this is also reflected in prison fatalities. \nOf the 20 drug-related deaths in Scotland's prisons since 2016, 12 involved psychoactive substances and six Etizolam.\nDavid Mackie, a retired sheriff and chairman of penal reform charity Howard League Scotland, warned the drug trade in jails was having an \"impact way beyond the walls of the prison\".\nHe said: \"If somebody is in prison being supplied with drugs which are costing three to five times what they cost outside, how is that person paying for that drugs? Because he won't have the money in prison. \n\"It is almost certain that person's family may be put under pressure to either raise the money and pay for the drugs or do something for the organised crime groups.\"\nMr Mackie added that for \"those participating in the trade it seems to be quite a safe and lucrative occupation, there seems to be little risk of prosecution.\"\nA spokesman for the SPS said it treats the issue of smuggling drugs into prisons \"very seriously\" and the service had \"invested in technology to better detect suspicious substances and work closely with partner agencies to garner relevant intelligence\".\nHe added: \"The particular problem of psychoactive substances is impacting on the whole of our society, not just the prison system. These substances are sometimes difficult to detect and their use can be lethal. \n\"We have over the last few years pointed out on many occasions, to those in our care, the dangers of using such substances. If we suspect that an item many contain such materials, then we quarantine them and do not allow them to enter a prison.\"\nJoey McGuiness is a recovering cocaine addict being supported by the Glasgow-based Sisco charity which delivers drug recovery services for people in and out of the prison system. \nThe 34-year-old spent five weeks in the city's Barlinnie prison and said most of the people he met there had drug addiction issues. \n\"It's very easy to get drugs in prison,\" he says.\n\"I used to see people in the morning and they were alright but by lunchtime they were a completely different person. \nJoey admits he was tempted to take drugs in prison \"to escape\" but stopped himself as he was grappling with taking the first step to ending a cocaine problem which he says had taken over his life. \nA near fatal-overdose months after leaving prison in 2019 was the moment when Joey first admitted he was a cocaine addict and began his road to recovery. \nNow 10 months clean, Joey is enjoying life without drugs and repairing relationships with his family.\n\"My wee ma's proud of me today. First time I can say that,\" he says.\n\"When I used to go into my mum's house she used to have fear on her face but when I go in today it's a smile.\"\nLeeh Howell, of Sisco, says Joey's experience of drugs in prison is common and thinks the problems have got worse since the start of the Covid pandemic. \nHe said: \"It's not really stopped substances getting into the prison. \n\"I think with things like family visits being stopped, all the feelings and thoughts that they've been sitting with have been amplified and it's making it that much harder to not take substances.\""

It was recorded on an internal CCTV camera at the property. \nThe footage, previously played in court, shows the six-year-old struggling to pick up and put away his pillow and blanket after waking at 8:36am. \nJurors have heard he had 130 injuries all over his body, both old and new. \nHe did not have his own bed, and slept on the lounge floor without a mattress, they heard. \nThe prosecution allege Ms Tustin carried out the fatal assault, while Mr Hughes, of Stroud Road, Solihull, is accused of aiding the killing. He also faces three counts of child cruelty. He denies any wrongdoing.\nMs Tustin has admitted one count of child cruelty but denies two other similar charges and also denies murder. \nThe trial, since adjourned until later in the week, continues. \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Budget 2021,Universal Credit",
      "text": "Budget changes that boost the income of some working people on universal credit come into force from now, the government has announced.\nWorkers will now take home 8p more of any extra pound earned, owing to a shift in the so-called taper rate.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said in October's Budget that the change would take effect \"within weeks\" and no later than December 1.\nThe policy was announced amid debate over the benefit's suitability.\nAbout two million people will benefit by an average of \u00a31,000 following the move, the government said.\nHowever, the Resolution Foundation think tank calculated that 3.6 million families will remain worse off because the alterations failed to offset the loss of a \u00a320 a week uplift in universal credit provided during the pandemic.\nMost universal credit claimants lose some of their benefits if they earn more money. The rate at which they lose the benefits is known as the taper rate.\nFrom now, the taper rate is 55%, which means that if you earn an extra pound you lose 55p in benefits.\nPreviously, the rate was 63%, so workers will now take home 8p more of an extra \u00a31 earned.\nWorkers with responsibility for children or disabilities that limit their ability to work are allowed to earn a certain amount before they start losing their universal credit, which is called a work allowance.\nThe work allowances for eligible claimants has also now gone up by \u00a3500 a year.\nThey include two million households which are dependant on benefits and have nobody in work. \nMr Sunak had been under pressure from MPs, including some Conservatives, about the withdrawal in October of the temporary \u00a320-a-week universal credit uplift, and its effect on the finances of financially-stretched families.\nIn the Budget, he announced the move to reward those who worked and earned more, while still on universal credit.\nThe chancellor said on Wednesday: \"These changes come into force today and will mean that with Christmas approaching, hard-working families keeping an extra \u00a31,000 a year of what they earn.\"\nThe Department for Work and Pensions is encouraging people to check online benefit calculators to work out how their income could be boosted.\nThe changes mean that an extra 600,000 families, all in work, will become entitled to some universal credit payments, according to economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That takes the total to seven million, or 26% of working-age families.\nThe result was that those who were earning a significant income, perhaps even at the level of a higher-rate taxpayer, might still be entitled to some help through universal credit, said Tom Waters, senior research economist at the IFS.\nFor example, a lone parent with two children and monthly rent of \u00a3750 can now earn up to \u00a351,900 a year before losing all of their universal credit entitlement.\n\"Along with other recent reforms, it means that 2.7 million working households on benefits will be better off than under the 2015 tax and benefit system,\" said Mr Waters. \n\"However, 2.1 million will still be worse off as will almost all two million benefit dependent working age households with nobody in work.\"\nThe changes to universal credit take effect to a backdrop of the rising cost of living - with the inflation rate expected to peak next year - and tax increases in April.\nThat would negate any wage rises experienced particularly by middle-income earners. Low-income households would also feel \"real pain\" as the cost of living is set to increase faster than benefit payments, the IFS has said."

      "tags": "France",
      "text": "France and Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been found guilty of conspiring to blackmail a fellow French footballer with a sex tape.\nA judge handed Benzema a one-year suspended jail term and ordered him to pay a \u20ac75,000 (\u00a363,000; $84,000) fine.\nBenzema, 33, was one of five people put on trial last month over an attempt to extort Frenchman Mathieu Valbuena.\nThe scandal has stunned the football community in France and both players lost their national team places.\nThe case dates back to June 2015, when the two footballers were at a French training camp.\nAt the camp, Benzema put pressure on Valbuena to pay off the blackmailers, whom he had conspired with to act as an intermediary, prosecutors said.\nBenzema has always denied the allegations and insisted he was only trying to help Valbuena get rid of the compromising video.\nBenzema has since returned to the France team and is expected to start for Real Madrid on Wednesday night when they play FC Sheriff Tiraspol in the Champions League.\nBenzema was not present in court in Versailles for the verdict, nor was Valbuena, who plays for Greek club Olympiakos.\nFour of Benzema's co-defendants in the trial were also found guilty on Wednesday. They were handed jail sentences ranging from 18 months suspended to two-and-a-half years in prison.\nBenzema's lawyers said they would appeal his conviction. \"The reaction is ultimately an angry one to this judgment which is perfectly contradictory,\" his lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, told reporters outside court.\nBut when delivering the verdict, the judge said Benzema had \"implicated himself personally, through subterfuge and lies, to convince his teammate to submit to the blackmail\".\nBenzema made a surprise comeback to the French national team in May, five years after he was exiled from the side when the allegations first surfaced in 2015.\nBut last month, the French football federation said a guilty verdict would not necessarily jeopardise Benzema's position in the national side.\nSince being called back by France manager Didier Deschamps, Benzema has been in prolific form, scoring nine times in 13 games for his country. He's also scored 10 goals this season for his club, Real Madrid, who are yet to comment on the verdict.\nFor his performances on the pitch, Benzema was named a candidate for the Ballon d'Or footballer of the year award which will be announced next week.\nAnalysis by BBC Sport's European football expert Guillem Balague\nThere are two ways of dealing with the private lives of footballers and we have seen that in the case of Benzema. The story hasn't been given much importance in the sports media in Spain, but it has been hugely prominent in France.\nIn France, Benzema will be questioned professionally because of his behaviour off the pitch, much more so than in Spain. In France, private lives are more relevant, not just in sport but also in politics.\nBenzema - who is of Algerian descent - has suggested there was an element of racism in this case. He felt that, had he been a white player, he would have been treated differently.\nBut none of it affects his status at Real Madrid, at all. In Spain, there is a view that your private life is your private life, and there has even been a strong campaign in the Madrid media for him to win the Ballon d'Or.\nIt began in 2015 when Valbuena, now 37, asked a man in Marseille, Axel Angot, to upload the contents of his mobile phone to a new device.\nMr Angot found sexually explicit material on the phone. He and another defendant in the trial, Mustapha Zouaoui, were accused of trying to blackmail Valbuena by threatening to make the tape public.\nMr Zouaoui told reporters he had shared the tape, but there had never been an attempt to extort money.\nValbuena described being approached by another defendant, Younes Houass, who told the court he had warned the player about the issue without asking for money.\nWhen the footballer went to the police, they set up a sting operation involving an undercover agent.\nProsecutors said another defendant was then brought into the scam - Karim Zenati, who is a childhood friend of Benzema. At this point, Benzema was asked to act as a \"middleman\" in the scheme, prosecutors said.\nIn October 2015, Benzema approached his fellow France player in his room at the national team's training camp.\nBenzema said he had merely tried to help his teammate dispose of the x-rated video, warning him: \"Be careful, Math, they're big, big thugs.\"\nHe then offered to put him touch with someone he could trust - his childhood friend, Mr Zenati.\nPolice were by now tapping their phone calls and recorded Benzema telling his friend: \"He's not taking us seriously.\"\nMr Zenati is said to have replied: \"We're here to sort it out; if he doesn't want that he'll have to deal with the piranhas.\"\nGiving evidence at the start of the trial, Valbuena said he had never considered handing over money to stop the video getting out.\nUnlike his former teammate, Valbuena has not played for France since the scandal began.\nTestifying during the trial, Valbuena told the court that football was his life.\n\"I knew if that video got out it would make things difficult with the French team,\" he said."
