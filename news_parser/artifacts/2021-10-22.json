      "title": "Alice Morrow murder: Partner William Hutchinson jailed for 21 years",
      "tags": "Belfast",
      "text": "A man who \"cruelly and brutally\" beat his partner to death will spend 21 years in prison without parole.\nWilliam Stephen Hutchinson, 45, from Kilbroney House, east Belfast, admitted to murdering Alice Morrow.\nThe 53-year-old's body was found in her flat in Whincroft Way, in the Braniel estate, in March 2019.\nAt a tariff hearing at Belfast Crown Court on Friday, senior prosecution counsel Terence Mooney QC outlined the facts of the case.\nThe court heard that on 10 March, 2019 Hutchinson called 999 and told an operator he had just come in and found his partner in bed \"with bruising to her hands and face\" and \"did not seem to be breathing''.\nPolice arrived and noted no sign of forced entry to the property.\nMr Mooney told the court that police found Ms Morrow \"lying on the floor lifeless\" and the \"defendant was in the room and appeared to be weeping uncontrollably and in considerable distress\".\nHutchinson was taken to a police station to make a witness statement, but in the early hours of the following morning he was formally arrested by detectives on suspicion of murder.\nA post-mortem report stated that Ms Morrow died as a result of a \"combination of injuries to the head and chest\". \nMr Mooney told the court that the pathologist recorded that a weapon had been used to cause a number of the injuries.\nMs Morrow had received a total of 71 injuries, along with a head injury which could have rendered her unconscious, the court heard.\nDefence counsel Niall Hunt QC described the case \"as an absolute tragedy\" and \"as a nightmare for a whole host of people\".\nMr Hunt said that Hutchinson had shown remorse and said he \"misses Ms Morrow desperately\".\nThe defence made the case that murder was not premeditated and there may have been no intention to murder her, but rather to inflict grievous bodily injury.\nJudge Geoffrey Miller said the murder was both \"cruel and brutal\", adding that her horrific killing had caused \"huge pain and loss'' to her elderly mother, sister and her children.\nHe said that pain and loss had been exacerbated by the defendant's \"protracted efforts to drag out the legal process before finally admitting his guilt on the morning of his trial\".\n\"There were only two people present and we are only left with the defendant's account of how she sustained her catastrophic injuries and this has to be seen as entirely self serving.\n\"We do know that he subjected her to a prolonged and brutal attack and that she must have suffered grievously before she eventually died and he cried crocodile tears at the scene,\" he said.\nHanding Hutchinson a 21-year tariff, Judge Miller said that would be the minimum term he would have to spend before being considered for release.\nIn a statement following the sentencing, Ms Morrow's family said that \"no amount of time in prison is enough\".\n\"He violently took her life when she was scared and alone, and he left her while he tried to cover his tracks.\n\"Alice was more than just a victim of domestic violence, she was a mother, sister and a grandmother.\"\nThey appealed for anyone who is the victim of domestic violence to seek help. \nSpeaking after the sentencing of William Hutchinson, who is also known as Stephen, Det Ch Insp Ray Phelan encouraged anyone who has suffered from domestic abuse to come forward to police and \"please do not suffer in silence, speak out\".\n\"Alice, who was a mother of three and a grandmother of three, was subjected to a horrific assault at the hands of her boyfriend, Stephen Hutchinson, which ultimately led to her death,\" he said.\n\"Hutchinson has taken away the love and comfort of a devoted mother and grandmother.\n\"He has denied Alice's three grandchildren the joy of precious memories with their grandmother. He has denied Alice the right to see her grandchildren grow into adulthood.\n\"Today's sentencing won't bring Alice back to her family, but I hope it will bring comfort to them knowing that Stephen Hutchinson is now in prison.\"\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article, there are a list of organisations that may be able to help at BBC Action Line."

      "text": "A man who was set to stand trial for the second time accused of murdering his mother has been found dead in Spain.\nSean Flynn was cleared of killing Louise Tiffney after a trial in 2005.\nMs Tiffney, who was 43, was last seen outside her flat in the Dean Village area of Edinburgh in May 2002.\nFollowing extensive searches and repeated appeals from her family, her body was eventually found in 2017 in Longniddry, East Lothian.\nLast year prosecutors were given permission to bring fresh prosecution under double jeopardy laws, which mean someone can be tried again on the same charges.\nFlynn was accused of murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by concealing his mother's body in the boot of a car before driving to woods and disposing of it.\nA warrant for his arrest was issued earlier this week when he failed to appear in court.\nHis lawyer Aamer Anwar said he had been advised by police in Spain that Flynn, 37, had been found dead after taking his own life.\nHe said: \"Any loss of life is a tragedy. Sean Flynn's next of kin has been informed and there will be no further comment.\"\nPolice Scotland said it had been notified by Spanish police on Thursday about the death of a 38-year-old man in the Alicante region.\n\"Formal identification is still to be carried out. However, the family of Sean Flynn have been informed,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"We will continue to work with the Spanish police to establish the full circumstances, but at this time the death is not believed to be suspicious.\"\nThe Foreign Office said it was supporting the family of a British man who had died in Peniscola.\nLouise Tiffney's disappearance in 2002 sparked a murder hunt that become one of Scotland's most notorious unsolved cases.\nHer 18-year-old son Sean Flynn reported her missing the next day, and the search that followed was one of the largest in Scottish police history.\nMs Tiffney disappeared four days before Flynn was due to appear in court accused of causing the deaths of a cousin and friend by dangerous driving.\nHe admitted crashing a high-powered BMW while speeding through West Lothian and was sentenced to three years and nine months in a young offenders institution.\nBack seat passengers Paul Ross and Christopher Magee were killed, but Flynn and his front seat passenger, Mario Gagliardini, escaped with cuts and bruises.\nIt was initially thought that Ms Tiffney may have fled her home under the pressure of Flynn facing imprisonment and her sister Lulu grieving for her son.\nBut in the investigation that followed, it emerged that Flynn and his mother argued frequently - and had done so on the night that Ms Tiffney was last seen.\nFlynn claimed she had \"stormed out\" of their home, but she had not taken her keys, bank cards or cash, or made childcare arrangements for her six-year-old daughter.\nDuring their investigation, officers found blood matching Ms Tiffney's DNA in the boot of a car that Flynn drove, along with mud and vegetation.\nMobile phone records also showed he was in East Lothian when he claimed to be in Edinburgh.\nFlynn was still in Polmont Young Offenders' Institution in February 2004, serving his sentence for the fatal car crash, when he was charged with his mother's murder.\nDuring a 22-day trial at the High Court in Perth the following year, prosecutors alleged that Flynn snapped and killed Ms Tiffney after arguing with her over the driving case and over his relationship with an older woman.\nNeighbours told how they had heard noises on the night Ms Tiffney went missing.\nProfessional gambler Brian Rockall, 39, said he heard the sound of someone running across the floor of the flat above him.\nHe said: \"It seemed fairly loud, startling. It seemed like someone finally losing it at the end of an argument. It didn't sound like someone was being hurt.\"\nFlynn's defence team argued that Ms Tiffney could have taken her own life, and the jury found the charges against him not proven.\nAfter Ms Tiffney's body was found in April 2017, prosecutors sought permission to set aside the acquittal and prosecute Flynn again for her murder.\nThe discovery was made by a cyclist near Gosford House in East Lothian.\nPolice confirmed that the area around the stately home had been searched by officers during the original inquiry, but the specific area where the body was found had never previously been searched.\nOfficers had a theory that the killer had driven to Gosford House to bury Ms Tiffney's body in a shallow grave.\nMinute traces of leaves and flowers had been found in a car linked to the investigation, and officers enlisted botanical experts to try and establish where they came from.\nDespite an extensive search at Gosford House, the sheer size of the 60,000-acre estate prevented police from finding the body.\nAfter the discovery in 2017, Flynn was tracked down in Berlin, where he had made a new home, and he was returned to Scotland.\nThe laws on double jeopardy had been changed in 2011 to allow someone to be tried again on the same charges.\nIn January last year, three judges agreed to set aside the previous verdict and allow a fresh prosecution to take place.\nThat trial had been due to start earlier this week, but Flynn - who had denied the charges - failed to appear at the High Court in Livingston.\nThere is an incredible coincidence at the heart of this tragic case.\nLouise Tiffney's remains were found very close to a beach where the body of another murder victim was discovered 30 years previously.\nThat earlier crime led to a change in Scotland's law on double jeopardy, and that change paved the way for Sean Flynn's second trial over the murder of his mother.\nTwo teenage friends, Christine Eadie and Helen Scott, had vanished after a night out in the World's End pub in Edinburgh's Old Town, in October 1977. Their bodies were found the next day.\nDecades passed before DNA and dogged police work linked their killings to a convicted murderer, Angus Sinclair, but the first attempt to bring him to justice in 2007 collapsed when a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence and brought the trial to a halt.\nThe outcome caused uproar and the ancient law on double jeopardy was changed, allowing a retrial if there was compelling new evidence which substantially strengthened the original case against the accused.\nNew DNA evidence put Sinclair back in the dock a second time, in 2014.  He was found guilty, handed a 37 year jail sentence and died in prison.\nBoth Christine Eadie and Louise Tiffney were last seen alive in Edinburgh. They were found, thirty years apart, within a mile or two of each other, on the coast of East Lothian.\nSinclair had left Christine Eadie on the beach at Gosford Bay. Louise Tiffney was discovered in woods beside the road that runs alongside the beach.\nIt is just a coincidence, a twist of fate, but if the law had not been changed following the first trial over the World's End murders, Sean Flynn would not have faced a retrial.\nUnder the new rules on double jeopardy, the courts judged that the discovery of Louise's remains had substantially strengthened the case against him.\nThe World's End murders were solved nearly four decades after Christine and her friend were killed. We don't know what the outcome of Sean Flynn's trial would have been, but there will be no such resolution over the disappearance and death of Louise Tiffney."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new mutated form of coronavirus that some are calling \"Delta Plus\" may spread more easily than regular Delta, UK experts now say. \nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has moved it up into the \"variant under investigation\" category, to reflect this possible risk. \nThere is no evidence yet that it causes worse illness. \nAnd scientists are confident that existing vaccines should still work well to protect people. \nAlthough regular Delta still accounts for most Covid infections in the UK, cases of \"Delta Plus\" or AY.4.2 have been increasing. \nLatest official data suggests 6% of Covid cases are of this type.\nExperts say it is unlikely to take off in a big way or escape current vaccines. But officials say there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta. \n\"This sub-lineage has become increasingly common in the UK in recent months, and there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta,\" the UKHSA said.\nUnlike Delta, however, it is not yet considered a \"variant of concern\" - the highest category assigned to variants according to their level of risk. \nThere are thousands of different types - or variants - of Covid circulating across the world. Viruses mutate all the time, so it is not surprising to see new versions emerge.\nAY.4.2 is an offshoot of Delta that includes some new mutations affecting the spike protein, which the virus uses to penetrate our cells. \nThe mutations - Y145H and A222V - have been found in various other coronavirus lineages since the beginning of the pandemic.\nA few cases have also been identified in the US. There had been some in Denmark, but new infections with AY.4.2 have since gone down there.\nThe UK is already offering booster doses of Covid vaccine to higher risk people ahead of winter, to make sure they have the fullest protection against coronavirus. \nThere is no suggestion that a new update of the vaccine will be needed to protect against any of the existing variants of the pandemic virus. \nDr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UKHSA, said: \"The public health advice is the same for all current variants. Get vaccinated and, for those eligible, come forward for your third or booster dose as appropriate as soon as you are called. \n\"Continue to exercise caution. Wear a mask in crowded spaces and, when meeting people indoors, open windows and doors to ventilate the room. If you have symptoms take a PCR test and isolate at home until you receive a negative result.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid lockdown restrictions should not be brought back to help NHS Wales deal with winter pressures, a former health boss has said.\nDr Roland Salmon, former director of communicable diseases for Public Health Wales, said he believed such rules were only \"at best marginally\" beneficial.\nHe said efforts should be redoubled to vaccinate those most at risk.\nLatest hospital figures show a 20% rise in two weeks of patients with confirmed Covid, while bed occupancy has hit 90%.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan has said further Covid rules before Christmas are \"unlikely\" at the moment.\nThe latest figures show Wales' case rate hit a record high - 681.9 on Friday - although higher case rates have still produced relatively fewer hospital cases and deaths.\nBlaenau Gwent has the highest case rate in the UK (1,185 cases per 100,000), with the climbing case rates in Wales mostly concentrated in south Wales. Four Welsh local authorities are among the highest, with south-west English counties also featuring prominently. \nThe Office for National Statistics estimated 70,300 people have Covid-19 in Wales. \nThis is the highest infection estimate since it started its weekly swab survey in August last year.\nThat is the equivalent of one in 45 people or 2.31% of the population.\nInfections are estimated to be higher in school-age youngsters - and latest case figures also showed 27% of all positive tests were among the 10 to 19 age group.\nPublic Health Wales reported 11 further deaths - an average of eight deaths a day in the last week - although deaths were eight times higher at this point in the second wave.\nThe average number of confirmed Covid patients in hospital was 511 on Thursday, a 20% rise across Wales in two weeks. This is a third of the number we saw at the same point in January.\nOn Thursday, ahead of a difficult winter, the Welsh NHS recorded its worst performance figures ever.\nNHS Wales chief executive Andrew Goodall said the system was running \"at the hottest we've seen\" due to Covid.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Salmon said he was \"certainly concerned about the pressure on the NHS\" with staff shortages, high bed occupancy and Covid.\n\"However, one of my abiding hopes is that this doesn't lead to a re-imposition of wider social restrictions,\" he said.\n\"It doesn't seem to me that they actually worked the first time, or at best marginally in the short term.\"\nHe argued that such restrictions \"cost a lot\", not only financially but in terms of mental illness, domestic abuse, addiction, and delays to health treatment. \"I feel that there have to be other approaches to this,\" he added.\nDr Salmon said it would be more efficient for people working in vaccination centres to try to prioritise vaccinating those over 60, or clinically at-risk groups who have not yet had their second Covid jab, rather than chasing younger people to get jabbed.\n\"Some 90,000 of those have not yet had their second Covid injections. Some even have not had their first,\" he said.\n\"It would be a much better use of our vaccinators' time to try and find and persuade these people to accept the vaccination, than chasing a lot of younger people, particularly 12 to 15-year-olds,\" he said.\nBetween 92.4% and 96.3% of those in age groups over 60 in Wales have received two doses of vaccine.\nDr Eilir Hughes, a GP on Anglesey, said it was important to encourage every eligible person to get vaccinated, without focussing on specific age groups. \n\"We should put the same effort into everyone. Whoever comes forward should be vaccinated. We should offer it to them,\" he said. \n\"Everyone can be a carrier, everyone can infect others. And that is what we are fighting here, we need to try and control it\"\nOffice for National Statistics figures show that Covid accounted for 8.5% of all registered deaths in Wales, compared with with 6.6% of all deaths in England.\nThere were 253 deaths in September due to Covid, out of 289 which involved Covid in Wales.\nIt had been Wales' seventh leading cause of death in August.\nHeart disease and dementia were the two leading causes of death in Wales in September, with flu and pneumonia ranked eighth.\nIt also found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales last month was 89.6 deaths per 100,000 - significantly higher than the previous month and the highest rate since February.\nBut there were three health board areas with September mortality rates higher than the Welsh average - 122.5 per 100,000 in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, 115.1 in Swansea Bay and 107.8 in Betsi Cadwaladr.\nThere have been 7,267 deaths due to Covid in Wales over the 19 months.\nThere have been 322,591 Covid booster jabs given out in Wales, according to Public Health Wales.\nFigures available for the first time show 58% of care home residents and more than 61% of healthcare workers have so far had a third dose of the vaccine.\nNearly 47% of those over 80 have also had it and already more than a quarter of those in their 70s.\nLooking at the pace of the rollout in Wales, it appears that 59% of those eligible for a booster - six months and a week after their second dose - have had one so far in Wales.\nDr Dai Samuel, consultant hepatologist at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, described the situation in hospitals as \"extremely busy\".\n\"It feels like December and January time already,\" he said. \"That's the big concern really that we're going into this second winter, where everything is really up in the air at the moment.\"\nHe also said finding beds for patients was a \"big challenge\" in hospitals.\nLatest bed occupancy figures are more than 90% and Wednesday saw more patients in acute hospital beds than at any time over the pandemic.\nDr Samuel said many feel the best capacity for occupied hospital beds would be 85-90%, whereas he said the health board's hospitals were \"always running\" at 95-99%.\n\"A few of my colleagues have already been off sick with burnout, I certainly feel pretty burned out myself,\" he added.\nWales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan has pleaded with the Welsh public to \"play their part\" in keeping the virus at bay.\n\"As the head of the NHS has said, it's going to be the toughest winter ever in the history of the NHS,\" she said."

      "text": "Second-hand car prices are rising at \"unprecedented rates\", the AA has said, as more people consider buying used cars amid a low supply of new vehicles.\nResearch by the motoring group suggests the price of the UK's most popular cars have increased up to 57% since 2019.\nThree to five-year-old Ford Fiestas, the most popular on its AA Cars website, were now valued at \u00a39,770 compared to \u00a37,448 two years ago.\nIndustry figures said \"nearly new\" used cars were in particular high demand. \nPrice rises have been driven by a number of factors.\nA global shortage of computer chips used in car production, as well as other materials such as copper, aluminium and cobalt, has led to fewer new vehicles rolling off production lines.\nThat has meant more buyers turning to the used-car market.\nAA Cars, which compared the prices of three, four and five year-old cars between 2019 and 2021, said demand for some models was so strong that they are increasing in value with age. \nAnalysis from the motoring group's website found the price of a three-year-old Mini Hatch in 2021 was 57% higher (\u00a315,367) than a model of the same age in 2019 (\u00a39,811).\nMeanwhile, research said the price of a five-year-old Mini Hatch had jumped 15% compared to what a three-year-old model was worth in 2019, meaning the car gained in value despite getting two years older.\nAudi A3s saw the biggest jump in prices since 2019 (46.09%), followed by Ford Focuses (43.11%), which were the second most popular car on the AA's website.\nThe motoring group said the first easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions in summer 2020 had \"unleashed demand\" that had been \"pent up\" during the early stages of the pandemic. \nIt said a shortage of new cars for sale led many drivers to buy used rather than new, with \"demand pressures pushing up second-hand prices at unprecedented rates\".\nJames Fairclough, chief executive of AA Cars, said some popular cars were growing in value \"even as they sit on the driveway\".\n\"With the exception of houses and some classic cars, things rarely go up in value as they age,\" he said.\nMr Fairclough said despite the price growth in used cars, it was \"still possible to get a good deal\" if people shopped around.\nBesides new car supply issues, used-car dealerships have also experienced a shortage of stock as trade-ins have been reduced, according industry figures.\nThe rise of online dealers with large advertising budgets such as Cinch, Cazoo and We Buy Any Car has also changed the market.\nThe used-car price surge along with rising energy, grocery and transport costs has contributed to the UK's higher inflation rate.\nIt has led to the Bank of England warning it \"will have to act\", suggesting interest rates may rise soon.\nPeter Smyth, director of family business Swansway Car Dealers, told the BBC \"nearly-new cars\" were now a \"desirable product\" because of the slow supply of new ones.\nHe said \"the more expensive cars\" on his forecourts such as Audi Q7s and Land Rovers, were \"selling the fastest\".\n\"We are selling less cars for more money,\" he said. \"You cannot replace the stock you have got.\"\n\"We look at our prices of our cars on a daily basis and we move them with the market place.\"\nMr Smyth said he expected prices to remain high for the next six to 12 months. He added he had been told by manufacturers that next year was going to be \"tight\" due to the shortage of materials such as computer chips.\n\"What you will find is manufacturers will have more supply of luxury cars next year than lower end stuff,\" he said. \"They are going to put the chips in the high-value cars where they make the most margin.\"\nIn August, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said second-hand car sales in the UK had more than doubled.\nPetrol cars made up most of the sales, with Ford Fiestas, Vauxhall Corsas, Ford Focuses and Volkswagen Golfs being the most popular models.\nMike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said that while a buoyant used-car market was \"important, as strong residual values support new car transactions\", it was \"critical we have a healthy new car market to help accelerate fleet renewal by allowing motorists to replace older, less efficient vehicles with the latest, cleanest models\".

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "On Tuesday, the government set out a number of plans aiming to put the UK on course to achieve its climate goals. Funding for green cars, an end to gas boilers and tree-planting are some of the key announcements. But are they enough?\nLet's not be ungenerous: the government's great over-arching green strategy is, on the face of, it a remarkable achievement.\nPrevious governments have theoretically espoused the need to live in harmony with the planet - but none has laid down a roadmap as to how that would be achieved.\nIt is especially important as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to welcome world leaders to Glasgow for the vital climate conference known as COP26. \nMr Johnson will brandish his sheaf of eco-documents at delegates and offer a challenge: My friends - if we can do it, you can do it.\nBut huge uncertainties remain:\nLet's tackle one and two because they're both sides of the same question. \nMr Johnson, for instance, has gained widespread credit for his global leadership in calling a halt to petrol and diesel cars and to gas boilers for home heating. \nThe cars announcement has triggered a competitive rush in international car makers who've been preparing for this moment for decades. Motorists can just slip behind the wheel and drive away.\nBoilers is a different issue. Heat pumps are expensive and a hassle to fit. The Treasury has agreed to subsidise them at \u00a35,000 a time but the total pot for installations is far too low to make a difference - just 30,000 boilers a year for three years, a trifling number that's not remotely high enough to kick-start an entire industry.\nThe business department BEIS wanted to offer more support, but the Treasury ruled it out. \nWhat's even worse, from an environmental standpoint, is the lack of funding to help people insulate their homes - because heat pumps simply won't work unless homes are well-coddled.\nSo, the heat pumps policy looks like an illusion unless someone sorts out the finances.\nThat brings us on to question number two - who will pay for the strategy overall?\nThe Chancellor's own document, the Net Zero Review, accepts that the costs of inaction on climate change outweigh the costs of action. This is a significant conclusion.\nBut there's a sharp warning from the Treasury about the knock-on effect of the electric car revolution: it leaves an annual \u00a337 billion black hole in its finances because fuel duty will evaporate.\nSubstitute taxes such as road pricing would not fill the gap, Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned, saying that people might face additional taxes or spending cuts.\nNext year the Treasury will launch a review of how the green revolution can be funded fairly across society - this theme is regularly raised by members of the public. \nThe report warned that additional borrowing would be ruled out because it would be unfair to the future generations saddled with the bill.\nThat means innovative sorts of financing will be needed to fund that difficult but essential work to upgrade homes.\nThat could include loans from energy firms or conditions on mortgage lending. No details are provided.\nAnd finally the third question - are the new policies tough enough to help rein back climate change? The prime minister hopes to persuade others to help him freeze temperature rise at 1.5C.  \nWhen that target was first mooted, scientists considered it the threshold to dangerous climate change. After a year of freak weather events with just 1.1C warming the climate is heating faster than our attempts to control it.\nThat's what infuriates environmentalists so much. They say every lever in society must be pulled to face a global threat.\nAnd they are contemptuous of a clutch of government policy areas that will allow emissions to actually grow.\nThese include building the \u00a3120bn rail project HS2, with all its energy-intensive concrete; construction of \u00a327bn worth of roads; allowing the continued sale of gas guzzling SUVs; allowing aviation to grow even though the public wants it curbed; and allowing mining for oil, gas and coal drilling in defiance of international advice.\nAny one of these issues could undermine the PM as he touts his green revolution in Glasgow. \nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Advising people to work from home is likely to have the most impact on stopping Covid spreading this winter, scientists advising the government say.\nStricter virus restrictions should now be prepared for \"rapid deployment\", the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said.\nIt said \"presenteeism\" - or pressure to be in work - could become an increasing cause of infections in workplaces. \nAsked about working from home, the PM said all measures were under review.\nBoris Johnson added: \"We do whatever we have to do to protect the public but the numbers that we're seeing at the moment are fully in line with what we expected in the autumn and winter plan.\"\nMinisters in England are resisting calls to switch to their winter Plan B that would see measures like compulsory face coverings in certain places.\nCovid hospital admissions and deaths across the UK are rising slowly, and the UK has recorded over 40,000 new daily Covid cases for the past ten days.\nOn Friday, a further 49,298 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK, alongside 180 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nAny advice to work from home would only apply to those who are able to do their job away from the workplace.\nIn April 2020, at the height of the first pandemic lockdown, less than half of people in employment, some 46.6%, did some work at home, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nIn minutes of a meeting of scientific advisers on 14 October, published on Friday, they warn that acting earlier rather than later could reduce the need for stricter measures over a longer timeframe \"to avoid an unacceptable level of hospitalisations\".\nThey added that any measures introduced must be clearly communicated. \nThe advisers, led by Sir Patrick Vallance, say models forecasting the coming winter suggest Covid hospital admissions are \"increasingly unlikely\" to rise above the levels of January 2021 peak.\nBut they say they are unsure of the impact of \"waning immunity and people's behaviour\".\nThere has been a noticeable dip in people saying they are wearing face coverings and latest figures from the ONS suggest more than half of British working adults are now travelling to work.\nSage says making face coverings compulsory in some places is likely to help reduce the spread of Covid as well as other winter viruses, such as flu.\nIt also notes the risks of high levels of the virus circulating in the UK, compared with other countries.\n\"Cases and admissions are currently at much higher levels than in European comparators, which have retained additional measures and have greater vaccine coverage, especially in children,\" the scientists say.\n\"Reducing prevalence from a high level requires greater intervention than reducing from a lower level.\"\nAnother worry is the emergence of a new variant that becomes \"dominant globally\", which they call \"a very real possibility\".\nThe great Plan B debate for England has moved up another gear.  \nDemands for more widespread mask wearing, more working from home and vaccine passports have been growing - with the NHS Confederation and the British Medical Association throwing their weight behind measures which the government has branded its Plan B.\nMembers of the expert committee Sage, according to minutes of recent meetings, seem to favour acting sooner rather than later - \"earlier intervention may reduce the need for more stringent, disruptive and longer-lasting measures\".\nThey pointedly note that cases are much lower in European countries which have tougher rules on masks and vaccine passports. \nBoris Johnson said all measures were being kept under review but the focus was still on getting more people vaccinated.  \nThe government then is resisting pressure for Plan B in England.  \nBut the notably more cautious tone from Health Secretary Sajid Javid recently suggests that the views of official experts and advisers are having an impact. \nThe advisers warn that the prospect of people being infected with Covid, flu and other respiratory viruses this winter could be \"a significant challenge\".\nThey say people who show symptoms of an infection should stay at home to stop it spreading to others.\nThis message needs to come from government, employers, universities and schools to be most effective, they say.\nOne in 55 people in England was infected with coronavirus in the week ending 16 October, according to latest estimates from the ONS - more than at any time since the end of January.\nInfections continue to fall in Scotland, and remain flat in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe percentage of people testing positive remained highest for those in school years seven to 11, the ONS estimates showed, ahead of half term for many pupils in England.\nIn the week ending 16 October, 7.8% of people in that age group were infected - compared to less than 2% of people in all older age groups.\nOfficial government data, which tracks people testing positive, shows that nearly 1,000 people a day are being admitted to UK hospitals with Covid and more than 8,000 in total are in hospital with the illness.\nThese figures are way below where they were in January because of protection from the vaccines, but doctors and health leaders have voiced concerns over the lack of curbs to control any further rises. \nWhen Mr Johnson was asked on Friday whether a full lockdown, with \"stay at home\" advice and shops closing, was out of the question this winter, he replied: \"I've got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that's on the cards at all.\""

      "title": "Long delay for hundreds of rape cases, says report",
      "text": "The number of rape and sexual assault victims who have waited more than a year for their trial to go through the courts has soared, a report shows.\nThe number of such cases rose from 246 to 1,316 - a 435% rise - between March 2020 and June this year, figures in a National Audit Office report suggest.\nThe spending watchdog said the crown court backlog could remain a problem for years, severely affecting victims.\nThe government said the backlog in England and Wales was stabilising.\nIn a highly critical report, the National Audit Office (NAO) said neither the Ministry of Justice nor its courts agency were working together properly to solve the problems which had their roots in pre-pandemic cuts.\nLast week Justice Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC he did not know when the backlog would drop below pre-pandemic levels.\nAs of June, it was at a record high of nearly 61,000 cases. The NAO is warning there could still be significant delays in 2024. \nThe report says that keeping rape and sexual assault victims, witnesses and defendants waiting for more than a year for their cases to be heard puts them at risk of collapse if people withdraw their support.\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said prosecutions for rape and sexual violence were \"going wrong\" and he would \"stop at nothing to get more rapists behind bars\".\nHis comments came after the jailing of Wayne Couzens for Sarah Everard's kidnap, rape and murder raised questions about women's trust in the police and the criminal justice system.\nThis NAO report is a black-and-white explanation of the problem now facing criminal justice - and how there is a complete lack of certainty over whether the backlogs and delays can be reduced. \nWhen the spending watchdog spoke to judges, they said that defendants were more likely to plead not guilty if their trial was to be delayed. \nThat may be because they're gambling they're more likely to get off: the longer it takes a case to be heard, the more likely it is that memories fade, evidence is lost or becomes less credible and victims withdraw support. \nOne solution is to enlist more part-time judges, also known as Recorders. These are experienced lawyers who for years have been the backbone of a lot of Crown Court business - but their funding was massively cut before the pandemic. \nBut there is no guarantee that enough part-time judges are going to be available from next April to make inroads into the backlogs.\nWaiting times rose most in London, with the average age of a case increasing by 63% from 164 days to 266 days, the report said.\nHead of the NAO Gareth Davies said: \"Despite efforts to increase capacity in criminal courts, it looks likely that the backlog will remain a problem for many years. \n\"The impact on victims, witnesses and defendants is severe and it is vital that the Ministry of Justice works effectively with its partners in the criminal justice system to minimise the delays to justice.\"\nCrown court capacity was increased by 30% between September 2020 and July 2021 by opening temporary Nightingale courts and modifying existing buildings.\nAnd another Nightingale court is to open at a hotel in Warwick, taking the total in England and Wales to 23.\nBut the long-term recovery plan relies on funding from the Treasury, said the report, with the Ministry of Justice estimating it needs about \u00a3500m more for criminal courts and an extra \u00a31.7bn for legal aid, prisons and probation services.\nThe Bar Council, which represents barristers, said the findings were alarming and showed criminal justice was \"at breaking point\".\nIn response to the NAO report, David Lammy, shadow justice secretary, said the Tories were \"weak on law and order\" and \"offenders are getting away with it\". \nMr Lammy said \"the justice system is on the brink of collapse, and victims are paying for the price\".\n\"This report confirms that the Conservatives have no real plan to tackle the record backlog they have created,\" he added.\nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said the report recognised the speed of the government's response to Covid. \n\"This meant that - in a matter of months - our buildings were made safe, remote technology was rolled out across all courts, and Nightingale courtrooms opened up and down the country to increase the space available for trials,\" he said.\n\"We are already seeing the results, with outstanding cases in the magistrates' courts falling, and in the crown court the backlog stabilising.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Global supply chain management,Inflation,Car industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Second-hand car prices are rising at \"unprecedented rates\", the AA has said, as more people consider buying used cars amid a low supply of new vehicles.\nResearch by the motoring group suggests the price of the UK's most popular cars have increased up to 57% since 2019.\nThree to five-year-old Ford Fiestas, the most popular on its AA Cars website, were now valued at \u00a39,770 compared to \u00a37,448 two years ago.\nIndustry figures said \"nearly new\" used cars were in particular high demand. \nPrice rises have been driven by a number of factors.\nA global shortage of computer chips used in car production, as well as other materials such as copper, aluminium and cobalt, has led to fewer new vehicles rolling off production lines.\nThat has meant more buyers turning to the used-car market.\nAA Cars, which compared the prices of three, four and five year-old cars between 2019 and 2021, said demand for some models was so strong that they are increasing in value with age. \nAnalysis from the motoring group's website found the price of a three-year-old Mini Hatch in 2021 was 57% higher (\u00a315,367) than a model of the same age in 2019 (\u00a39,811).\nMeanwhile, research said the price of a five-year-old Mini Hatch had jumped 15% compared to what a three-year-old model was worth in 2019, meaning the car gained in value despite getting two years older.\nAudi A3s saw the biggest jump in prices since 2019 (46.09%), followed by Ford Focuses (43.11%), which were the second most popular car on the AA's website.\nThe motoring group said the first easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions in summer 2020 had \"unleashed demand\" that had been \"pent up\" during the early stages of the pandemic. \nIt said a shortage of new cars for sale led many drivers to buy used rather than new, with \"demand pressures pushing up second-hand prices at unprecedented rates\".\nJames Fairclough, chief executive of AA Cars, said some popular cars were growing in value \"even as they sit on the driveway\".\n\"With the exception of houses and some classic cars, things rarely go up in value as they age,\" he said.\nMr Fairclough said despite the price growth in used cars, it was \"still possible to get a good deal\" if people shopped around.\nBesides new car supply issues, used-car dealerships have also experienced a shortage of stock as trade-ins have been reduced, according industry figures.\nThe rise of online dealers with large advertising budgets such as Cinch, Cazoo and We Buy Any Car has also changed the market.\nThe used-car price surge along with rising energy, grocery and transport costs has contributed to the UK's higher inflation rate.\nIt has led to the Bank of England warning it \"will have to act\", suggesting interest rates may rise soon.\nPeter Smyth, director of family business Swansway Car Dealers, told the BBC \"nearly-new cars\" were now a \"desirable product\" because of the slow supply of new ones.\nHe said \"the more expensive cars\" on his forecourts such as Audi Q7s and Land Rovers, were \"selling the fastest\".\n\"We are selling less cars for more money,\" he said. \"You cannot replace the stock you have got.\"\n\"We look at our prices of our cars on a daily basis and we move them with the market place.\"\nMr Smyth said he expected prices to remain high for the next six to 12 months. He added he had been told by manufacturers that next year was going to be \"tight\" due to the shortage of materials such as computer chips.\n\"What you will find is manufacturers will have more supply of luxury cars next year than lower end stuff,\" he said. \"They are going to put the chips in the high-value cars where they make the most margin.\"\nIn August, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said second-hand car sales in the UK had more than doubled.\nPetrol cars made up most of the sales, with Ford Fiestas, Vauxhall Corsas, Ford Focuses and Volkswagen Golfs being the most popular models.\nMike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said that while a buoyant used-car market was \"important, as strong residual values support new car transactions\", it was \"critical we have a healthy new car market to help accelerate fleet renewal by allowing motorists to replace older, less efficient vehicles with the latest, cleanest models\".

      "title": "Alec Baldwin: What are prop guns and why are they dangerous?",
      "tags": "Alec Baldwin,Firearms,Film,United States",
      "text": "On a film set, a real-life tragedy has happened. \nPolice say US actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza on a film set in New Mexico. They were working on the film Rust.\nTributes have been paid to Ms Hutchins, 42, while Mr Baldwin is said to be distraught. One local paper found him in tears outside Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office.\nAn investigation is under way and we don't exactly know yet what went wrong. A spokesman for Mr Baldwin said there had been an accident on the set involving the misfire of a prop gun.\nCourt submissions later showed an assistant director, Dave Halls, had handed the gun to Mr Baldwin. It contained a live round but Mr Halls said he did not know that, and indicated it was unloaded by shouting \"cold gun!\"\nAn incident like this is rare and the news has stunned the film industry. The use of firearms on set is subject to stringent safety standards.\n\"On the film I recently made, even my plastic gun, I had to sign out, sign in every day,\" said Australian actor Rhys Muldoon. \"So that's why this particular case is so incredibly baffling.\"\nDespite sounding innocuous, both prop guns and blanks can be dangerous. Here's what we know about them.\nBlanks are used in the film industry to imitate live ammunition. \nThe reason they are so convincing is that blanks are essentially modified real bullets. \nWhile the term \"bullet\" is commonly used to describe what is loaded into weapons, more properly it is a cartridge that is loaded: a self-contained ammunition package made up of a casing holding an explosive powder that when fired, blasts out a projectile, or bullet. \nBlanks differ because although they use explosive they don't use a projectile. \nHowever the wadding materials which are used to keep the gunpower in place can be expelled from the gun when it is fired, potentially causing injury or even death at close range.\nA prop gun could mean a range of items, from non-functioning weapons to cap guns. \nBut it can also mean a real weapon, or one adapted for firing blanks. \nTogether they add authenticity to productions - fire a blank using a prop gun and you'll get a loud bang, a recoil and what's known as a muzzle flash, the visible light created by the combustion of the powder.\nYes. You may remember Brandon Lee, the actor son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee.\nBrandon Lee died aged just 28 in 1993 while filming The Crow, when a prop gun which mistakenly had a dummy round loaded in it was fired at him. \nDummy rounds contain no explosive charge and in this case were used to film a close-up. When blanks were loaded part of the dummy round remained in the gun. \nAfter Lee was shot, the cameras kept rolling. It was only when he did not get up at the end of the scene that those on set realised something was wrong. \nIn another incident, in 1984, US actor Jon-Erik Hexum started joking around on the set of a television show after being frustrated by delays in filming.\nHe loaded a revolver with a blank, spun the chamber, put the gun to his temple and fired. \nUnlike Lee, he was not killed by a projectile, but rather the force of the blast was strong enough to fracture his skull. He died days later in hospital. \nHexum's death highlights a problem with blanks - even without a projectile they pack enormous power.\nAdding to the risk, some film sets use extra powder to make the visual impact stronger.\nFilm sets usually have strict rules about the use of prop guns. Specialists provide weapons for use on film sets and advise on their use.\n\"There's basic safety measures on every set,\" said Mike Tristano, an armourer who has worked with Alec Baldwin in the past. \n\"You never point a gun, even if it is not a firing gun, at anyone else. I'm at a loss how this could have happened and how it could have done that much damage.\"\nA common shot in film shows an actor firing into the camera and Steven Hall, who has worked on films such as Fury and The Imitation Game, says it only happens with safeguards.\n\"If you are in the line of fire... You would have a face mask, you would have goggles, you would stand behind a Perspex screen, and you would minimise the number of people by the camera, \" he said.\n\"What I don't understand in this instance is how two people have been injured, one tragically killed, in the same event.\"\nOthers working in film wondered why, at a time when gun effects can be cheaply added using computers, blanks are still being used at all. \n\"There's no reason to have guns loaded with blanks or anything on set anymore. Should just be fully outlawed,\" tweeted Craig Zobel, an actor and director whose credits include Westworld and Mare of Easttown. \n\"Prop guns are guns,\" TV writer David Slack tweeted. \"Blanks have real gunpowder in them. They can injure or kill - and they have. If you're ever on a set where prop guns are treated without proper caution and safe handling, walk away.\n\"No show or shot is worth risking people's lives,\" he added. "

      "text": "Every household should be given \u00a3320 to help with \"spiralling energy bills\", the Green Party of England and Wales have said at the start of their annual conference in Birmingham.\nIn a speech, the party's new leaders said the \u00a39bn plan could be paid for with a windfall tax on all landlords of private rented properties. \nCo-leader Adrian Ramsay argued this could help people avoid fuel poverty.\nThe policy announcement comes amid energy price rises.\nEarlier this month, around 15 million households saw their bills climb by 12%, as the energy cap was raised.\nThe energy regulator Ofgem has warned that the cap will go up again next April.\nAddressing Green Party activists in Birmingham, Mr Ramsay said their proposal was \"about keeping people safe\". \n\"It's about the state responding to market failure, it's about human dignity.\n\"Our proposal is what government should be doing to show leadership - it's an issue which shows how climate justice and social justice go hand in hand.\"\nThe party says it also wants to introduce a Green New Deal programme, spending \u00a3100bn on getting the UK to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 through insulation schemes and renewable energy.\nBy Political Correspondent Ione Wells\nThe Green Party have reasons to be optimistic - they have a record number of councillors, their sister party is in power in the Scottish government, and they're feeling positive about their polling. \nRising energy bills and COP26 have got all parties talking about the need to move away from relying on fossil fuels too. \nBut they still have only one MP, Caroline Lucas, in Parliament. And more radical green groups like Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain - who the new leaders have actively distanced themselves from - have been making more front pages than the party in the last few months. \nThe new leaders are adamant they want to be seen as a party not a pressure group - but with every major party now trumpeting green policies, standing out is a key challenge.\nMr Ramsay delivered the speech jointly with co-leader Carla Denyer, a Bristol city councillor.\nShe said people had \"grown tired of choosing the 'least worst' option, of being patronised, ignored and told what to think\". \n\"We are tired of a Tory government playing divide and rule, tired of out of touch policies which ride roughshod over people, tired of politics which amount to little more than an old boys' club serving the interests of its pals,\" she added.\nAnd she accused Labour of failing the public and failing to \"take a stand on the biggest issues of the day\". \nMs Denyer, a former engineer, said the Greens were committed to a pay rise for key workers, a universal basic income and ending the sale of arms to \"oppressive regimes\".\nSetting out her party's strategy, she told the conference the Greens could \"win elections in every corner of England and Wales...  there is nowhere we can't win\".\nMr Ramsay said he wanted to be part of the team that \"gets our second MP elected, and our fourth and our fifth\". \nThe pair concluded their speech by telling the audience this was \"the last chance for serious climate action\" and that \"we and only we have what it takes\".\nThe Greens are in government in Scotland with the SNP, but their sister party in England and Wales remains a minor voice at Westminster with just one MP.\nHowever they have had more success at the local level winning 80 more council seats during elections earlier this year.\nThey currently hold 447 seats on 141 different councils.

Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "US real estate heir Robert Durst has been charged in the 1982 disappearance of his ex-wife, authorities have said.\nKathie McCormack Durst's body was never found, and she was legally declared dead in 2017.\nA new criminal complaint accuses Durst of second-degree murder in connection with the case.\nLast week Durst, 78, was sentenced to life in prison for the 2000 murder of his best friend to stop her talking about his wife's disappearance.\nThe new criminal complaint against Durst - the subject of HBO crime documentary series The Jinx - was filed by a state police investigator in Lewisboro, New York. \nCiting sources familiar with the matter, the Associated Press has reported that a grand jury has begun hearing witness testimony.\nIn a statement sent to the BBC, the Westchester County District Attorney's Office confirmed that a complaint had been filed but provided no further comment.\nKathie McCormack Durst was 29 when she vanished in January 1982 following an argument with Durst, who had long claimed that he took her to a train station so that she could return to their Manhattan apartment.\nWhile he initially claimed that he spoke with her once she returned, he later admitted that was a lie. Durst divorced McCormack in 1990, citing abandonment.\nThe new complaint is based on \"conversations with numerous witnesses and observations of defendants, recorded interviews and observations of Durst's recorded interviews and court testimony in related proceedings\".\nThe BBC has reached out to attorneys representing Durst for comment. \nRobert Abrams, a spokesman for Kathie McCormack Durst's family, was quoted by the New York Times as saying they were \"unaware\" of the latest criminal complaint, but grateful for the work of the district attorney's office, and told the BBC that they \"are very happy with this development\".\nOn 14 October, Durst was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Susan Berman, who was found shot in the head in her Beverly Hills home. Authorities believe she was murdered to prevent her from talking to police about the McCormack case. Durst has denied killing his friend and his lawyers have said he intends to appeal. \nProsecutors believe that Durst has murdered three people: Berman, McCormack and Morris Black, an elderly neighbour who discovered Durst's identity in 2001 while he was hiding out in Texas. Durst was later acquitted in the Black case.\nJust days after his sentencing in the Berman case, Durst was hospitalised with Covid-19."

      "text": "A new mutated form of coronavirus that some are calling \"Delta Plus\" may spread more easily than regular Delta, UK experts now say. \nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has moved it up into the \"variant under investigation\" category, to reflect this possible risk. \nThere is no evidence yet that it causes worse illness. \nAnd scientists are confident that existing vaccines should still work well to protect people. \nAlthough regular Delta still accounts for most Covid infections in the UK, cases of \"Delta Plus\" or AY.4.2 have been increasing. \nLatest official data suggests 6% of Covid cases are of this type.\nExperts say it is unlikely to take off in a big way or escape current vaccines. But officials say there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta. \n\"This sub-lineage has become increasingly common in the UK in recent months, and there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta,\" the UKHSA said.\nUnlike Delta, however, it is not yet considered a \"variant of concern\" - the highest category assigned to variants according to their level of risk. \nThere are thousands of different types - or variants - of Covid circulating across the world. Viruses mutate all the time, so it is not surprising to see new versions emerge.\nAY.4.2 is an offshoot of Delta that includes some new mutations affecting the spike protein, which the virus uses to penetrate our cells. \nThe mutations - Y145H and A222V - have been found in various other coronavirus lineages since the beginning of the pandemic.\nA few cases have also been identified in the US. There had been some in Denmark, but new infections with AY.4.2 have since gone down there.\nThe UK is already offering booster doses of Covid vaccine to higher risk people ahead of winter, to make sure they have the fullest protection against coronavirus. \nThere is no suggestion that a new update of the vaccine will be needed to protect against any of the existing variants of the pandemic virus. \nDr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UKHSA, said: \"The public health advice is the same for all current variants. Get vaccinated and, for those eligible, come forward for your third or booster dose as appropriate as soon as you are called. \n\"Continue to exercise caution. Wear a mask in crowded spaces and, when meeting people indoors, open windows and doors to ventilate the room. If you have symptoms take a PCR test and isolate at home until you receive a negative result.\""

      "text": "The US Supreme Court will allow Texas to maintain a near-total ban on abortions, but will take up the case next month in a rare sped-up process.\nThe law, known as SB8, gives any person the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past six-weeks - before most women know they are pregnant.\nThe Supreme Court said it will focus on how the law was crafted and whether it can be legally challenged. \nIt is considered extraordinarily rare for the top US court to expedite cases. \nLower courts have yet to issue final rulings on the so-called Texas Heartbeat Act.\nThe controversial law - which makes an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for cases of rape or incest - bans abortion after what some refer to as a foetal heartbeat. \nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says that at six weeks a foetus has not yet developed a heartbeat, but rather an \"electrically induced flickering\" of tissue that will become the heart.\nThe Texas law is enforced by giving any individual - from Texas or elsewhere - the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week point. However, it does not allow the women who get the procedure to be sued.\nThe Biden administration has previously said it would ask the court to block the law. Since 1973's landmark Roe v Wade Supreme Court case, US women have had a right to abortions until a foetus is able to survive outside the womb - usually between 22 and 24 weeks into pregnancy.\nThe US is one of seven out of 198 countries to allow elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Washington Post.\nLawyers for the state of Texas asked the justices on the court to consider overruling the landmark Roe decision, as well as a separate case that affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion. The court did not accept that request.\nOral arguments in the case have been set for 1 November. The Supreme Court said that it would wait for those arguments to take place before taking any action. \nIn a written dissent, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the expedited timeframe would offer \"cold comfort\" for women in Texas who are hoping for abortion treatment. \nShe was the only one of the Supreme Court's nine judges to advocate blocking the law in the short-term. \n\"Women seeking abortion care in Texas are entitled to relief from this court now,\" she wrote. \"Because of the court's failure to act today, that relief, if it comes, will be too late for many.\"\nThe law came into effect in Texas on 1 September. \nAbortion providers and opponents of the law had called for it to be lifted until the Supreme Court took up the case. \nWhole Woman's Health, which operates four clinics in Texas, tweeted that \"the legal limbo is excruciating for both patients and our clinic staff\". \nExperts believe that the oral arguments may provide a glimpse into how the Supreme Court will approach other abortion cases. \nIn December, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a separate case regarding a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks."

      "tags": "Evolution,Mozambique,Poaching,Ivory trade",
      "text": "A new study suggests that severe ivory poaching in parts of Mozambique has led to the evolution of tuskless elephants. \nThe study published in Science magazine found that in Gorongosa National Park a previously rare genetic condition had became more common as ivory poaching used to finance a civil war pushed the species to the brink of extinction. \nBefore the war, about 18.5% of females were naturally tuskless. \nBut that figure has risen to 33% among elephants born since the early 1990s.\nSome 90% of Mozambique's elephant population was slaughtered by fighters on both sides of the civil war that lasted from 1977 to 1992. Poachers sold the ivory to finance the vicious conflict between government forces and anti-communist insurgents. \nAs in eye colour and blood type in humans, genes are responsible for whether elephants inherit tusks from their parents.\nElephants without tusks were left alone by hunters, leading to an increased likelihood they would breed and pass on the tuskless trait to their offspring.\nResearchers have long suspected that the trait, only seen in females, was linked to the sex of the elephant. After the genomes of tusked and tuskless elephants were sequenced, analysis revealed that the trend was linked to a mutation on the X chromosome that was fatal to males, which did not develop properly in the womb, and dominant in females. \nThe study's co-author, Professor Robert Pringle of Princeton University, pointed out that the discovery could have a number of long-term effects for the species. \nHe noted that because the tuskless trait was fatal to male offspring, it was possible that fewer elephants would be born overall. This could slow the recovery of the species, which now stands at just over 700 in the park. \n\"Tusklessness might be advantageous during a war,\" Professor Pringle said. \"But that comes at a cost.\"\nAnother potential knock-on is changes to the broader landscape, as the study has revealed that tusked and tuskless animals eat different plants.\nBut Professor Pringle emphasised that the trait was reversible over time as populations recovered from the brink of elimination. \n\"So we actually expect that this syndrome will decrease in frequency in our study population, provided that the conservation picture continues to stay as positive as it has been recently,\" he said. \n\"There's such a blizzard of depressing news about biodiversity and humans in the environment and I think it's important to emphasise that there are some bright spots in that picture.\""

Petrol stations reported strong sales during the last week of the month after warnings over delivery problems due to a shortage of lorry drivers.\nDespite coronavirus-related restrictions being lifted in the summer, shopping in-store remained subdued.\nHelen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said that shop owners would be \"concerned\" by the slump in sales in the run-up to the key Christmas trading period.\n\"For the sake of the UK's economic recovery, it is vital that retail sales bounce back as we near the festive season,\" she said. \nShe added that labour shortages across supply chains, warehouses, and factories were all putting pressure on retailers ahead of the festive season.\nThe proportion of online sales, however, rose to 28.1% in September, from 27.9% the month before - substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nDepartment stores also reported an increase in sales of 4.3%.\nTony Brown, chief executive of New Start 2020, which owns Beales department stores, told the BBC's Today programme that people's shopping habits had changed since restrictions had eased.\n\"There is not much browsing anymore - people come out, they know what they want, they spend and then they go. It is a different dynamic than what it used to be,\" he said.\nThe retailer also warned of a \"perfect storm\", saying that high shipping costs, additional customs checks because of Brexit, inflation and the cost of fuel increasing meant that additional costs had to be passed on to customers.\nBethany Beckett, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest figures suggested the \"economic recovery is fast running out of steam\".\nThe fifth monthly fall in sales in September marks the longest continuous drop since records began in 1996, although they remain about pre-pandemic levels.\nBut Ms Beckett added: \"Given the backdrop of continued shortages and rising Covid-19 infections, we suspect that retail sales growth will continue to be weak in the coming months.\"\nIn the run-up to Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget next week, trade organisations recently called for additional support.\nThe BRC, in a joint letter also signed by the CBI and UK Hospitality, called for the reform of business rates charged on non-domestic properties, saying that businesses needed help to rebuild after Covid."

The Concertgebouw said on Friday it mourned the loss of its \"beloved, honorary conductor\".\n\"When he takes up the baton it's as though the electricity is switched on,\" his wife Patricia once said. \"When it's over he's confronted with himself again.\"\nHaitink performed with almost all of the world's big orchestras, notably in the UK with the London Philharmonic, Royal Opera and Glyndebourne Festival Opera. \nThe Royal Opera House said he was best known during his period there from 1987-2002 for his interpretation of Wagner. Chief Executive Alex Beard spoke of a true gentleman whose \"quiet authority and profound care and respect for his fellow artists inspired and moved beyond words\".\nHaitink's first Prom at the Royal Albert Hall was Bruckner's 65-minute Seventh Symphony in 1966, and 53 years later he performed the same symphony there for the last time. \nHaitink was well known in the US for his time at the Chicago and Boston Symphony orchestras and in Germany for leading the Staatskapelle Dresden and the Berlin Philharmonic. \nStaatskapelle chief conductor Christian Thielemann said on Friday he was \"one of the most important conductors of our time\".\nThe Dutch royal family said in a statement that Haitink's \"drive and musical finesse are unforgettable\", revealing the soul of composers such as Mahler, Bruckner, Beethoven and many others."

      "text": "The government has blocked a new law to curb businesses' ability to lay staff off and take them back on different - often worse - pay and terms.\nThe practice - known as \"fire-and-rehire\" - has caused several industrial disputes.\nLabour's Barry Gardiner said the government was \"cowardly\" for using Parliamentary tactics to stop his bill in its tracks.\nBut No 10 said it wanted new guidance for companies, rather than a law.\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"Using threats of firing and rehiring is completely unacceptable as a negotiating tactic. We expect companies to treat their employees fairly. \n\"However, there is insufficient evidence to show legislation will stop the practice or will be effective.\" \nInstead, the government says it will ask the arbitration service Acas to \"produce more comprehensive clearer guidance to help all employers explore all the options before considering fire and rehire\".\nThe government ordered Conservative MPs to oppose the legislation.\nBut union chiefs said that amounted to siding with \"bad\" and \"bullying\" bosses.\nThe Labour Party ordered its MPs to support the bill, even though the party has said it would go further if it won power and ban fire-and-rehire completely.\nBefore voting on the bill itself, MPs voted on a closure motion - essentially a vote on whether to vote on the bill - and due to the government's opposition, it failed to get enough support by 188 votes to 251.\nAfter that, MPs were able to resume the debate but \"talked it out\" - meaning members opposing the bill stopped another vote happening by continuing to speak right up to the allotted finishing time for discussion. \nThis included 40 minutes at the dispatch box by Business Minister Paul Scully, who said legislation agreed in the context of a pandemic was not \"the right way to reflect the concerns for the long-term issue about workers' rights\", adding: \"We will legislate if we need to, but we'll do it as a last resort, not as a first resort.\"\nThe government also came under from its own MPs fire for scheduling a statement on health policy as Fridays are normally reserved for backbench members to put forward their bills. \nMr Gardiner's bill now falls to the bottom of the list and is unlikely to progress any further. \nSpeaking in the Commons, the Labour MP said: \"In politics, it's rare to find something that absolutely everyone agrees on and yet all the way from [former union leader] Len McCluskey to the prime minister himself, everyone agrees fire and rehire is wrong - so why is the government determined to block this Bill?\n\"The tactic of filibustering to talk the bill out is cowardly. It seems the government do not wish to be seen actually to vote against the bill itself. \n\"They would rather pretend under the cloak of a closure motion that they want to go on talking about it so it simply runs out of time.\"\nFire-and-rehire has existed for decades, but the practice has come under more scrutiny recently as more firms hit by the pandemic have used it to reduce their staffing costs.\nMr Gardiner's private member's bill said employees should be fully consulted on any fire-and-rehire plans.\nIf the employees agreed to it, they could be taken on under new terms, under the proposed new law.\nBut if a dispute occurred between staff and a company, an independent committee would decide on whether the fire-and-rehire could go ahead, the bill said.\nMr Gardiner told the BBC his plan was a \"practical\" way to deal with the \"worst excesses\" of fire-and-rehire - and said the proposals could become law quickly if supported by the government.\nOne Tory MP, Christian Wakeford, supported it in the Commons, telling the House: \"This policy isn't anti-business, it is anti-bad business leaders.\"\nBut others on the government benches criticised the bill, with Kevin Hollinrake warning: \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"\nTory MP Laura Farris said the rules on fire and rehire needed to be tightened up, but it had to be available as \"an option of last resort\" for companies facing insolvency.\nThe government move has led to criticism outside the chamber, with the TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady saying: \"The government has chosen to side with bad bosses by failing to take action to tackle fire and rehire today.\"\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham added: \"The antics of the Conservative Party today have been a disgrace.\n\"They have colluded to stand on the side of bullying bosses and against the interests of workers, showing their real colours, so the hypocrisy of the Tory party was on full display for all to see. They say one thing but do another.\"\nThe Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy has been asked for a comment."

      "tags": "Social care",
      "text": "There will be \"a tsunami\" of people without the care they need this winter unless staff shortages are tackled, England's care watchdog is warning.\nSocial care staff are \"exhausted and depleted,\" says Care Quality Commission (CQC) chief executive, Ian Trenholm. \nIn a report, the CQC urges immediate work to address the problem of rising numbers of unfilled care sector jobs. \nOn Thursday, the government announced an extra \u00a3162.5m to boost the adult social care workforce.\nThis is in addition to \u00a35.4bn earmarked for social care over the next three years from the government's health and social care levy, which already includes \u00a3500m to be spent on the workforce.\nThe CQC welcomes the money but has a warning: \"It must be used to enable new ways of working that recognise the interdependency of all health and care settings, not just to prop up existing approaches and to plug demand in acute care.\"\nIn its latest State of Health and Social Care in England report, the CQC confirms fears that social care providers are facing a staffing crisis, losing staff to better paid jobs in retail and hospitality, and unable to recruit replacements. \nAcross England, numbers of unfilled jobs are rising month on month, the researchers found, from 6% in April to more than 10% in September. \nLondon is worst affected with 11% of jobs vacant, followed by the East Midlands at 9.4% and the South West at 9.2%.\nThis means care providers are having to limit their services, the researchers found. \nIn Devon, Rebecca Marks, director of Ark Care Homes, says more than one in five of their beds are empty, because they cannot afford to staff them. \nShe says current staff are exhausted after the pandemic, and despite the company offering funding for training and qualifications, and paying joining bonuses, \"they are saying: 'You know, I'm going to go and work in a supermarket'\".\n\"We need help and we need it fast... whether it's funding to be able to pay our staff higher wages to represent the responsibility and the amazing job that they do, or something different. \n\"It's a very difficult place for care providers and care staff, and ultimately our residents.\"\nOona Goldsworthy, who oversees five care homes in the south-west of England, told BBC Breakfast she was \"literally throwing everything\" at the problem to try and fill vacancies - including increasing wages.\n\"We have to recognise paying carers the minimum wage is just not acceptable any more,\" she said.\nBy Alison Holt, social affairs editor\nIn the measured tones of a regulator, this report makes it clear that a staffing crisis in the long overlooked care system has much broader consequences. \nA \"tsunami of unmet need\" is more than a striking phrase. It represents a lack of support that can leave someone who is disabled or in the later years of their life struggling - alone or with family, facing grinding daily difficulties and too often deterioration that ends in crisis. \nIt is distressing for those at the heart of it and pressure on an overstretched NHS that with the right support might have been avoided. \nThe extra money the government has announced will help, but councils and care organisations have been quick to say it won't be enough. \nAnd the suggestion it could lead to tens of thousands of new care staff is likely to be greeted with a wry smile coming just 18 months after the last government recruitment campaign failed to do that.\nUnpaid carers who look after relatives at home are among those hit hard by the staffing squeeze. \nDorothy Cook cares for her husband Melvin, at home in Bristol. Melvin is in the advanced stages of a degenerative brain disease which has left him unable to wash, dress, shower or feed himself without her help. \nFollowing a fall in February, he was in hospital for six weeks, and then spent four months in a rehabilitation unit. \nMelvin is meant to have a care package at home but the provider ended it after five weeks, as his condition was too complex for them to manage.\nThat was 12 weeks ago, and Dorothy is struggling.\n\"It all falls on my shoulders, and I'm on my knees with exhaustion,\" she told the BBC.\n\"We both feel completely and utterly alone. We feel that nobody cares.\"\nCarers UK, which represents unpaid people like Dorothy, says a survey of 8,000 of its members suggests more than half (55%) have lost some or all of the support they need, since the pandemic. \nThe government says it will take steps to ensure that unpaid carers have the support, advice and respite they need, with more detail to be published later this year. \nCare companies say the main factors making it hard to find and keep staff are: \nIn its report, the CQC pays tribute \"to the professionalism and resilience of everyone that works in social care\", but according to chief executive Ian Trenholm: \"Those people cannot be expected to work any harder.\n\"If we're to get safely through this winter, there needs to be urgent action.\"\nHe says local leaders of health and social care services will need \"to make maximum use of everything they have at their disposal to get safely through the winter... If these things don't happen there is the genuine risk of a tsunami of unmet need, with many people not getting the care that they so desperately need this winter.\"\nHe believes the key is more collaboration between services and urges a rapid overhaul: \"We can't be in this position in a year's time. We need to be thinking about what systems will look like in the future.\n\"We are really clear, there are no silver bullets, there are no simple answers to what is a very, very complex problem.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care official said: \"We appreciate the dedication and tireless work of health and social care staff throughout the pandemic. \n\"We have provided record levels of investment to support them and will provide \u00a336bn over the next three years for health and social care across the UK. \n\"We are working on health and social care reform to ensure we can provide world-leading services and are committed to learning lessons from the pandemic, with a full public inquiry in the spring.\"\nShadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, called the report \"devastating\", saying the government's recent social care announcement would not help.\n\"Labour is calling for a ten-year plan of investment and reform,\" to include a new deal to transform pay, training and conditions for care staff, and a shift in focus towards prevention and early intervention, said Ms Kendall.

      "text": "SuperTed and Fireman Sam would never have been made without cash help from the government, the driving force behind the popular cartoons has said.\nIt comes as UK ministers consider if they will continue subsidising children's TV shows for Channel 5, E4 and the Welsh language channel S4C.\nSuperTed and Fireman Sam started on S4C before being broadcast in English.\n\"They would not have been made without subsidies,\" said Fireman Sam producer and SuperTed creator Mike Young.\nLeading presenters, including former Play School anchor Baroness Floella Benjamin, now a House of Lords peer, and former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq have expressed their concern for the future of children's programming if the UK government cut their Young Audiences Content Fund.\nIt was set up in 2018 and helps cover the cost of making children's shows for public service broadcasters and it has allocated more than \u00a344m over a three-year trial to support the production of shows on public serving broadcasting channels.\nBut there are fears future funding could affected by the UK government's ongoing spending review although the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said no decision had been made.\nMike Young, now a Hollywood-based Emmy and Bafta award-winning animator, said he was \"flabbergasted\" that cash for children's content could be cut because, although animation \"is there to be fun, it is at the same time incredibly educational\".\n\"It would be a very short-sighted decision and it's a minor investment when compared to some of the money that governments tend to waste in other areas.\"\nMr Young, who still makes animations and runs a Los Angeles-based production company, said children's shows were attractive to TV channels and streaming services because \"kids watch content more than adults\".\n\"A child will watch the same programme over and over again as part of their learning process,\" he said. \n\"Whereas adults will watch, say The Crown once and never watch it again.\"\n\"So children's TV shows have a new generation every three years or so, especially in the younger demographics.\n\"Plus they're long lasting and earn money from merchandising. I can go down the road now in LA and buy a Fireman Sam toy.\n\"If they [UK government] take these grants and subsidies away, it'll put the UK at a tremendous disadvantage to the rest of the world. It'll really set back an industry if this happens.\"\nMy Young started his career creating SuperTed, which was broadcast as S4C's first programme when the channel launched in November 1982.\n\"In the case of S4C, it's not just making shows for children, it's actually retaining a language and a culture - it goes beyond children's TV programmes,\" he added.\nMr Young also played an integral role in making Fireman Sam - Sam Tan in Welsh - a hit on S4C before both animations were translated into English.\nDespite both being TV staples for millions of children in the 1980s, well before the creation of the Young Audiences Content Fund, he said both were partly funded by government subsidies of the day.\nThe body representing independent TV companies in Wales said, without the government fund, it was \"very doubtful\" that dramas for young people and new animation series would have been commissioned.\n\"It is really short-sighted now when we are seeing some really good evidence from dozens of programmes who have been commissioned though this fund and to now look at stopping it is doesn't make sense to me,\" said Gareth Williams, chairman of Teledwyr Annibynnol Cymru.\nOne of the beneficiaries of the government fund is producer Nia Ceidiog, Fireman Sam's original scriptwriter, who is making a children's drama with a focus on mental health.\n\"It would have been impossible to produce this in the Welsh language had it not been for an award from the YAC fund,\" she said.\n\"Drama is expensive and S4C would not have been able to produce drama for children of that standard so having this award - 50% of the budget - is crucial\".\nS4C said the fund has helped the Welsh language channel \"invest in productions that otherwise would not have seen the light of day,\" including cult Welsh hit Sali Mali.\n\"Whilst S4C has done well from the YAC fund, and whilst S4C would not like to see the end of this important source of money for original content from Wales, its end would not have a negative impact on S4C's wider children's offering,\" it said.\n\"Even without the contribution of the YAC fund, S4C is the second biggest commissioner of children's TV programmes.\""

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The COP26 climate summit is under way in Glasgow - one of the biggest ever world meetings on how to tackle global warming. \nBBC News Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris answers some of your questions.\nYou can send a question using the form at the bottom of this page.\nHow is the average family going to find the extra \u00a320,000 needed to buy an electric vehicle?  Nicola Hippisley, London\nYou don't necessarily need an extra \u00a320,000 to buy an electric vehicle. \nOverall, electric cars have been more expensive than petrol or diesel ones for some time, but the difference has been narrowing. \nThe average cost of an electric car in the UK is about \u00a344,000, but you can buy a basic one for less than \u00a320,000. That's partly because the price of the batteries which electric cars use has fallen sharply in recent years. \nAt the moment, the price of raw materials is threatening to push battery prices up again, but the industry expects that as electric car sales increase, economies of scale will kick in. \nExperts predict that new electric and petrol/diesel cars will cost the same within the next five years. It is also possible to lease an electric vehicle, and there's a growing second-hand market as well, where vehicles are much cheaper. \nThe UK government currently offers a grant of up to \u00a32,500 as a discount on the price of certain brand new low-emission vehicles including some electric models. \nYou can also claim a grant of up to \u00a3350 to help meet the cost of installing a chargepoint at your house if you have dedicated off-street parking. This is available whether you lease your car or own it outright. \nSeparately, the Scottish government offers interest-free loans to help people buy brand new or used electric vehicles. \nHow will the decisions made at COP26 change our day-to-day lives? I want to know what I can do to help move these policies forward. Matthew Hadley, Harpenden\nThe decisions made at COP26 are part of the wider ambition to decarbonise our economies - and that will certainly have an impact on daily life. \nThe cars we drive and the way we heat our homes are going to change. Buying an electric vehicle, or getting a heat pump installed at home, is going to become more and more common. The hope - and for many the expectation - is that as these technologies become more established, the costs will come down. \nThere are also personal choices to be made about what we eat (the Climate Change Committee which advises the government recommends a 20% reduction per person by 2050 in the amount of beef, lamb and dairy we consume), and how often we fly. \nThen there are practical issues like recycling and cutting down on waste as much as possible. \nWhy are we still referring to 2050 as some sort of end goal, since very little has changed in the last two decades? Wouldn't 2040 or perhaps even 2030 put a little more urgency into every little step humanity takes? Jake Kettmann, Bega, NSW, Australia\nThe year 2050 is the target date set by many countries for reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. But you're not alone in thinking that 2050 is much too far in the future to force some politicians or companies to take action now. \nThat's why there are also plenty of interim targets, and the 2020s have been identified as a critical decade for climate action - it can't all be delayed until the 10 years leading up to 2050.\nMany of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases have now set targets for 2030, and the UN says overall emissions need to fall by 45% [by that date]compared to 2010 levels, if the aim of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is to remain realistic. \nAt the moment, though, the world is nowhere near achieving that, even with the new pledges made at COP26.\nIf scientists have already considered a 1.5C reduction goal will not be achieved, why don't we set up a new goal, which we may able to achieve? Ana, Vietnam\nQuite a few scientists think it may already be too late to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but they'd rather have an ambitious target to aim for. \nThe Paris Agreement in 2015 set the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C. So \"well below 2C\" is already written into law as a secondary target. \nThere's also a growing awareness of the need to take action which will make a difference in the next five to 10 years. That's why many of the agreements made at COP26 - to reverse deforestation, for example, or to cut global methane emissions by 30% - set 2030 as their target date. \nThe challenge now of course is to turn those promises into practice, and to deliver urgent change.\nHow can we be sure the claims made about greenhouse gas emissions can be verified? What independent observer is measuring different countries' attempts to reduce their fossil fuel usage? Lee Gary, Spain\nChecking claims made about greenhouse gas emissions is one of the biggest issues for negotiators at COP26. \nAt the moment, countries only have to review and update their pledges for cutting emissions every five years. Many people argue that's not often enough, and some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change want to turn it into an annual process to keep the pressure on. \nThe role of independent observer is supposed to be filled by UN scientists. But a recent investigation by The Washington Post found multiple examples of flawed or inaccurate data submitted to the UN by individual countries. It is another example of climate promises falling short of what is required, as a process which relies so heavily on data needs to ensure that the data is accurate.\nLast month, a UN-backed body launched a scheme to verify net zero claims made by big companies, to ensure that corporate pledges can be easily compared and properly scrutinised.\nIs there a way to force countries in the UN, especially China and India, to cut back to net zero by 2050? Can sanctions or similar trade restrictions be used against them? Diana Butungi, Kampala\nOnly a few countries have made their net zero pledges legally binding. Many of the national pledges are non-binding targets, but there is a hope that as momentum towards net zero begins to accelerate it will provide an incentive for others to follow. \nIt would be possible in theory to impose trade or other sanctions on countries that are moving more slowly, but that could be counter-productive. The focus of meetings like COP26 is to try to encourage international cooperation. \nIt's also unfair to put all the blame on countries like India and China for the majority of carbon emissions, even though China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world today and India is the third largest. China and India have huge populations, and much lower emissions per person than more developed countries.\nIn any case, it's important to consider the historical role played by European countries and the United States which are responsible for far more cumulative emissions than China or India. \nThe damaging effects of emitting CO2 into the atmosphere linger for hundreds of years, and the rich world has acknowledged that it has the primary responsibility for tackling climate change.\nAre there plans for governments and countries to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? If not, why? Bernath Bence, Netherlands\nThe trouble with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is that the technology that does exist, won't be rolled out fast enough to make any significant difference this decade, when greenhouse gas emissions need to fall significantly.  \nIn 2020, for example, the UK allocated \u00a31bn to a CCS infrastructure fund, with the ambition of capturing the equivalent of 10m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030. \nThat target has already been increased to capturing 20-30m metric tonnes by 2030. But, to put that in perspective, the UK is estimated to have produced the net equivalent of more than 450m metric tonnes of CO2 in 2019.\nGovernment investment varies hugely around the world. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia are relying very heavily on CCS to allow them to continue producing fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, but that means scaling up the technology in a way which has not yet been proven to work effectively.  \nHow do agricultural products like rice and sugar contribute to the increase of CO2? What can we do to help reduce emissions? Ng Wee Meng, Singapore\nMost forms of agriculture produce CO2 emissions in one way or another.  \nBeef is widely agreed to be the most carbon-intensive food to produce globally, but there are emissions from sugar and rice - these are connected with factors such as deforestation, animal feed, energy used in processing and transport, and packaging. \nOne study estimates that rice, for example, produces the equivalent of 4kg of CO2 emissions for every 1kg of rice produced. Given that 755 million tonnes of rice are produced every year around the world, that is a lot of CO2. On the other hand, rice is an essential staple food feeding billions around the world.  \nThe best way to help reduce emissions is to try to ensure you eat food which is produced as sustainably as possible - although many people may not have the luxury of that choice.\nWould enforcing quotas for meat consumption and flight travels be efficient and feasible? Anonymous, Geneva\nMeat eating (especially beef) and travelling by air both have a sizeable environmental impact. \nEating one or two hamburgers a week for a year creates the same amount of greenhouse gases as heating a UK home for 95 days.\nAnd a return economy flight from London to New York emits about 0.67 tonnes of CO2. That's 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK.\nIn theory, enforced quotas for meat consumption or flying would make a difference, but there's little political appetite or support for that to happen. Instead, the focus is on encouraging behavioural change. \nThe UK Climate Change Committee - which advises the government - has recommended that people should consume 20% less meat and dairy by 2030, and 35% less by 2050. People are also being urged to think about flying less. \nUsing taxation to make certain things more expensive would probably be a more realistic solution than trying to enforce quotas. \nWhy can't we have an international fund to help poorer countries attain zero carbon emissions? Robert Patterson, Darlington\nThat is partly what the current debate on climate finance is all about. \nIn 2009, rich countries said they would provide $100bn (\u00a373bn) every year to the developing world by 2020. But they have been unable to live up to their promise, and they are now suggesting they will only meet that target in 2023. \nPoorer countries need this money to help tackle the effects of climate change that they are already facing. But they also need it to make sure their economies become greener as they develop, on a path to net zero carbon emissions.   \nIf it is people causing climate change, what is being done to stop over-population ? Gaye Schmidt, Perth, Australia\nOverpopulation isn't the root cause of climate change. Rather, it's the excessive emission of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet up. And the richest one per cent of the world's population is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest fifty per cent. \nIt is true to say the population of the planet can't keep increasing indefinitely, because there is a finite number of resources available. But excessive consumption has played a larger role in climate change than a growing global population.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nIs the global capitalist model not at odds with climate change and the need for a greener way of life? Andrew, Exeter\nMatt McGrath writes:\nAccording to some experts, such as the economist Lord Stern, climate change can be seen as the great failure of the market. \nThis is because businesses have not generally had to pay for the damage they have caused to the environment.\nGlobal efforts to tackle climate change over the past two decades have focused more on harnessing capitalism to limit warming - for instance, putting a price on carbon and making the polluter pay, to ensure that emissions are ultimately restricted.\nMeanwhile, it's also the case that if there's consumer demand for greener products and services, capitalism will try to meet that demand.\nBut there's evidently still a lot of work to be done to make these approaches work.\nDoes COP26 really need 25,000 people there? They will generate a lot of CO2, so why can't many elements be online? David, Birmingham\nMatt McGrath writes:\nThe pandemic might be seen as the perfect moment for the UN to use technology for negotiations, and it was attempted during a preparatory meeting for COP in June, which ran for three weeks.\nUnfortunately, it didn't go well - time-zone and technology challenges made it almost impossible for countries with limited resources, progress was limited and decisions were put off.\nAs a result, many developing nations have insisted on having an in-person COP. They feel that it is far easier for their voices to be ignored on a dodgy Zoom connection.\nThey also bring a lived experience of climate change that it is critical for rich countries to hear first-hand.\nThere's some evidence that this works. In 2015, the presence of island states and vulnerable nations was key to securing the commitment to limit temperature changes to 1.5C in the Paris Agreement.\nWhat questions do you have about changes in our climate? \nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " Covid has severely affected healthcare staff and may have killed between 80,000 and 180,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. \nHealthcare workers must be prioritised for vaccines, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, and he criticised unfairness in the distribution of jabs.\nThe deaths occurred between January 2020 and May of this year. \nEarlier, another senior WHO official warned a lack of jabs could see the pandemic continue well into next year. \nThere are an estimated 135 million healthcare workers globally. \n\"Data from 119 countries suggest that on average, two in five healthcare workers globally are fully vaccinated,\" Dr Tedros said. \n\"But of course, that average masks huge differences across regions and economic groupings.\"\nFewer than one in 10 healthcare workers were fully vaccinated in Africa, he said, compared with eight in 10 in high-income countries. \nA failure to provide poorer countries with enough vaccines was highlighted earlier by Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior leader at the WHO, who said it meant the Covid crisis could \"easily drag on deep into 2022\".\nLess than 5% of Africa's population have been vaccinated, compared with 40% on most other continents.\nThe vast majority of Covid vaccines overall have been used in high-income or upper middle-income countries. Africa accounts for just 2.6% of doses administered globally. \nThe original idea behind Covax, the UN-backed global programme to distribute vaccines fairly, was that all countries would be able to acquire vaccines from its pool, including wealthy ones, writes BBC Global Affairs correspondent Naomi Grimley. \nBut most G7 countries decided to hold back once they started making their own one-to-one deals with pharmaceutical companies.\nDr Aylward appealed to wealthy countries to give up their places in the queue for vaccines so that pharmaceutical companies can prioritise the lowest-income countries instead.\nHe said wealthy countries needed to \"stocktake\" where they were with their donation commitments made at summits such as the G7 meeting in St Ives this summer.  \n\"I can tell you we're not on track,\" he said. \"We really need to speed it up or you know what? This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to.\"\nThe People's Vaccine - an alliance of charities - has released new figures suggesting just one in seven of the doses promised by pharmaceutical companies and wealthy countries are actually reaching their destinations in poorer countries. \nThe alliance, which includes Oxfam and UNAids, also criticised Canada and the UK for procuring vaccines for their own populations via Covax. \nOfficial figures show that earlier this year the UK received 539,370 Pfizer doses from Covax while Canada took just under a million AstraZeneca doses. \nOxfam's Global Health Adviser, Rohit Malpani, acknowledged that Canada and the UK were technically entitled to get vaccines via this route having paid into the Covax mechanism, but he said it was still \"morally indefensible\" given that they had both obtained millions of doses through their own bilateral agreements. \nThe UK government pointed out it was one of the countries which had \"kick-started\" Covax last year with a donation of \u00a3548m. \nThe UK has also delivered more than 10 million vaccines to countries in need, and has pledged a total of 100 million.\nThe Canadian government was keen to stress that it had now stopped using Covax vaccines. \nThe country's International Development Minister, Karina Gould, said: \"As soon as it became clear that the supply we had secured through our bilateral deals would be sufficient for the Canadian population, we pivoted the doses which we had procured from Covax back to Covax, so they could be redistributed to developing countries.\" \nCovax originally aimed to deliver two billion doses of vaccines by the end of this year, but so far it has shipped 371m doses."

      "tags": "Barry Gardiner,Keir Starmer",
      "text": "The government has blocked a new law to curb businesses' ability to lay staff off and take them back on different - often worse - pay and terms.\nThe practice - known as \"fire-and-rehire\" - has caused several industrial disputes.\nLabour's Barry Gardiner said the government was \"cowardly\" for using Parliamentary tactics to stop his bill in its tracks.\nBut No 10 said it wanted new guidance for companies, rather than a law.\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"Using threats of firing and rehiring is completely unacceptable as a negotiating tactic. We expect companies to treat their employees fairly. \n\"However, there is insufficient evidence to show legislation will stop the practice or will be effective.\" \nInstead, the government says it will ask the arbitration service Acas to \"produce more comprehensive clearer guidance to help all employers explore all the options before considering fire and rehire\".\nThe government ordered Conservative MPs to oppose the legislation.\nBut union chiefs said that amounted to siding with \"bad\" and \"bullying\" bosses.\nThe Labour Party ordered its MPs to support the bill, even though the party has said it would go further if it won power and ban fire-and-rehire completely.\nBefore voting on the bill itself, MPs voted on a closure motion - essentially a vote on whether to vote on the bill - and due to the government's opposition, it failed to get enough support by 188 votes to 251.\nAfter that, MPs were able to resume the debate but \"talked it out\" - meaning members opposing the bill stopped another vote happening by continuing to speak right up to the allotted finishing time for discussion. \nThis included 40 minutes at the dispatch box by Business Minister Paul Scully, who said legislation agreed in the context of a pandemic was not \"the right way to reflect the concerns for the long-term issue about workers' rights\", adding: \"We will legislate if we need to, but we'll do it as a last resort, not as a first resort.\"\nThe government also came under from its own MPs fire for scheduling a statement on health policy as Fridays are normally reserved for backbench members to put forward their bills. \nMr Gardiner's bill now falls to the bottom of the list and is unlikely to progress any further. \nSpeaking in the Commons, the Labour MP said: \"In politics, it's rare to find something that absolutely everyone agrees on and yet all the way from [former union leader] Len McCluskey to the prime minister himself, everyone agrees fire and rehire is wrong - so why is the government determined to block this Bill?\n\"The tactic of filibustering to talk the bill out is cowardly. It seems the government do not wish to be seen actually to vote against the bill itself. \n\"They would rather pretend under the cloak of a closure motion that they want to go on talking about it so it simply runs out of time.\"\nFire-and-rehire has existed for decades, but the practice has come under more scrutiny recently as more firms hit by the pandemic have used it to reduce their staffing costs.\nMr Gardiner's private member's bill said employees should be fully consulted on any fire-and-rehire plans.\nIf the employees agreed to it, they could be taken on under new terms, under the proposed new law.\nBut if a dispute occurred between staff and a company, an independent committee would decide on whether the fire-and-rehire could go ahead, the bill said.\nMr Gardiner told the BBC his plan was a \"practical\" way to deal with the \"worst excesses\" of fire-and-rehire - and said the proposals could become law quickly if supported by the government.\nOne Tory MP, Christian Wakeford, supported it in the Commons, telling the House: \"This policy isn't anti-business, it is anti-bad business leaders.\"\nBut others on the government benches criticised the bill, with Kevin Hollinrake warning: \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"\nTory MP Laura Farris said the rules on fire and rehire needed to be tightened up, but it had to be available as \"an option of last resort\" for companies facing insolvency.\nThe government move has led to criticism outside the chamber, with the TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady saying: \"The government has chosen to side with bad bosses by failing to take action to tackle fire and rehire today.\"\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham added: \"The antics of the Conservative Party today have been a disgrace.\n\"They have colluded to stand on the side of bullying bosses and against the interests of workers, showing their real colours, so the hypocrisy of the Tory party was on full display for all to see. They say one thing but do another.\"\nThe Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy has been asked for a comment."

      "text": "Fully vaccinated travellers returning to Wales from 31 October will no longer have to take a PCR test.\nInstead, they'll be able to take a lateral flow test (LFT) within two days of their arrival.\nThe same rule change will come into force in England a week earlier, on Sunday 24 October.\nWales' health minister said she \"remained concerned\" about the UK government's approach.\nLFTs can be fully carried out at home and are cheaper than PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, which are processed in laboratories.\nIf people have a positive LFT on their return from travelling overseas, they will be required to isolate for 10 days and take a follow-up PCR test. \nJay Noble-Wade, from Cardiff, is booked to fly to Egypt on 29 October with her husband Gareth and said she was happy she'd had the nerve to hold off booking a test until it was close to their travel date. \n\"I was looking to buy the PCRs for me and my husband this weekend, so I have probably saved around \u00a3100,\" she said.\n\"I do feel for the people travelling over half-term, who will still have to buy them,\" she added. \nPaula Reece from Rumney, in Cardiff, had been planning a holiday but said uncertainty over testing put her off.\n\"Now PCR tests won't be needed I feel much happier and am keen to book a holiday abroad in the next couple of weeks,\" she said.\n\"There is much less stress and more flexibility.\" \nHowever, she said the rules should come in at the same time as in England, adding: \"I think we should be in line together, it would be easier for people to understand the rules. \n\"It also means families who want to come together for holidays from England and Wales have the flexibility to do so.\"\nThe rules will apply to fully vaccinated travellers returning from countries that are not on the so-called red list.\nPeople will continue to have the option of booking and taking a PCR test as the required day two test.\nAll children - over the age of five and under the age of 18 - who are returning to Wales will need to take a post-arrival test.\nIf they are from Wales or a country whose vaccination programme is recognised by the UK, they will be able to claim fully vaccinated status and take a lateral flow test on their second day in the country.\nWelsh residents who are over 16 can use a Covid pass to show their vaccination status.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said in the Senedd: \"I think it's really important that I start by saying we are encouraging people not to travel abroad, while we're in a situation where there is a risk of importing a new variant that could cause havoc in our country.\n\"We're unhappy, frankly, with the situation that's happening in England, but the reality is we have an open border and most people who do travel abroad travel through English airports. So for us to have a different system would be extremely difficult.\n\"So the reason why lateral flow tests are coming in later in Wales compared to England is because the communication issues that we have had with the UK government.\"\nMs Morgan added the Welsh government \"remained concerned\" about the UK's government's approach and \"the speed at which it is opening international travel\", and that she had written to the UK Department of Health and Social Care requesting further assurances."

She and Prince Charles met primary school children during the event.\nThe following day, the Queen was more than 100 miles away in Edinburgh for the opening of the sixth session of the Scottish Parliament. \nIt was the first time she had attended the ceremony without Prince Philip, who died this year aged 99. During her speech, she spoke of her deep affection for Scotland.\nA few days later, the Queen held audiences with diplomats from Belize and Greece over video call.\nThe same day, she met members of the Canadian Army at Windsor Castle at an event to mark the 150th anniversary of the A and B batteries of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. She later had a telephone call with Boris Johnson.\nThe Queen then travelled to London to attend the launch of the Commonwealth Games baton relay at Buckingham Palace.\nIt was her first major event at Buckingham Palace since the Covid pandemic began and she was joined by her youngest son, Prince Edward.\nA few days later she attended a church service at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of The Royal British Legion.\nAccompanied by the Princess Royal, she was seen using a walking stick as she arrived via the Poet's Yard entrance.\nThe Queen welcomed pianist Dame Imogen Cooper to Buckingham Palace, presenting her with The Queen's Medal for Music for 2019.\nShe also held three other audiences.\nThe following day, the Queen travelled to Cardiff to open the sixth term of the Senedd.\nIt was her first visit to Wales in five years, and she praised the spirit of the Welsh people during the pandemic.\nWhile there, she was overheard appearing to say she was irritated by people who \"talk\" but \"don't do\" anything on climate change.\nBy Saturday she was back in England - attending Champions Day at Ascot racecourse in Berkshire.\nThe Queen held a virtual audience with the new governor-general of New Zealand Dame Cindy Kiro. The governor-general's role is to act as the Queen's representative in New Zealand.\nOn Tuesday she had two virtual audiences during the day with the Japanese ambassador and the EU ambassador.\nThen in the evening she was back at Windsor Castle hosting a reception for guests attending the Global Investment Summit, including billionaire business leaders like Microsoft's Bill Gates."

The eggs are then sent to an Italian lab for fertilisation, using sperm from two deceased males.\nTwelve embryos have been created so far, and scientists hope to implant them into surrogate mothers selected from a population of southern white rhinos.\nBioRescue, the scientific group leading the scheme, said it had weighed up several risks before deciding to stop harvesting Najin's eggs. \n\"Retiring one individual from a conservation programme because of animal welfare considerations is usually not a question to think about for long... but when one individual is 50 percent of your population, you consider this decision several times,\" said head veterinarians Frank G\u00f6ritz and Stephen Ngulu.\nAs well as her advanced age, ultrasound scans had revealed several small, benign tumours on Najin's cervix and uterus, and a cyst on her left ovary.\nBut BioRescue said she would remain part of the scheme in other ways, like providing tissue samples for stem cell research.\nIt's hoped she can also \"transfer her social knowledge and behaviour\" to future offspring.\nNorthern white rhinos been brought to the brink of extinction by poaching and loss of habitat.\nNajin was born in a Czech zoo but was moved a decade later to Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, where she has been living under armed protection."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "Substitute teachers have been asked to provide emergency cover in special schools due to a staffing crisis.\nThe appeal was made in an email from the Northern Ireland Substitute Teacher Register (NISTR).\nOne principal of a special school said a \"perfect storm\" of staff absences meant it had to close early for half-term.\nSome special schools have had to cancel classes and ask pupils to stay at home at short notice due to lack of staff.\nThe Education Authority (EA) said special schools were facing \"increased challenges in sourcing and recruiting staff\".\nNISTR is a database of all substitute teachers in Northern Ireland, which schools use to book staff to cover teaching absences.\nAn email to substitute teachers from NISTR earlier this week - obtained by BBC News NI - said there was \"currently a very high demand for qualified teachers to provide emergency cover in special schools\".\n\"If you have experience of working with pupils with complex needs OR have an interest in gaining experience in this area AND you have some immediate availability (ie in the next few weeks/months), we would like to hear from you,\" it said.\n\"We would also ask substitute teachers who remain registered but have not been actively working at this time to respond if willing to provide short-term emergency support to special schools.\"\nThe email asked teachers to contact the emergency resourcing team at the Education Authority (EA) if they were available.\nArvalee Special School in Omagh, County Tyrone, closed for the half-term break on Wednesday, two days earlier than planned.\nClifton Special School in Bangor, County Down, also told parents in a letter on 11 October that the school was experiencing \"high levels of staff absence due to a number of reasons: sick leave, bereavement, vacancies arising from late confirmation of staffing allocations, injury at work and Covid-related matters\".\n\"Until these staff recruitment issues are resolved, it will unfortunately be necessary to close some classes,\" said the letter.\nThe principal of Arvalee Special School, Jonathan Gray, told BBC News NI he was devastated that the school had to close early for half-term.\n\"We've stayed open for our pupils through two lockdowns and were open for them over some of the summer,\" he said.\n\"We have over 80 staff and on some days recently, almost half have been out of school.\n\"It's not just our teachers, our classroom assistants are also vital.\n\"We need staff who are trained to work in a special school, who can provide intimate care to a child if it's needed or who can recognise when a child might need medical help.\n\"I'm standing here in the school and there should be children here too.\n\"It's more than Covid, it's things like other staff sickness and reasons for absence but it's created a perfect storm.\"\nClaire Smyth said her son Daniel, who has learning difficulties, accesses \"all his main therapies in school\", including physiotherapy and speech and language therapy.\nHowever, on a number of days recently he has been informed he cannot go to his school, because it does not have enough staff.\n\"It has a huge impact on Daniel, we can see that his behaviour starts to worsen, he is very upset, difficult to settle at home,\" Ms Smyth told BBC Newsline.\n\"That poses huge challenges for us in terms of being able to continue to work and also to meet Daniel's needs at home.\"\nOne parent of a special school pupil told BBC News NI her son had been told to stay at home for more than a week this term due to school staff shortages.\n\"We don't know each day if he'll be going in the next,\" she said.\n\"I struggle to understand why a longer term plan can't be put in place.\n\"There's also always an underlying feeling that this simply would not be tolerated in mainstream schools.\n\"Time and time again, we're told all schools are facing a similar situation - but on the ground we've yet to hear of any other children not being able to go to school because their school doesn't have enough staff.\"\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the EA said \"special schools are currently facing increased challenges in sourcing and recruiting staff\".\n\"The limited availability of substitute teaching and non-teaching staff has, in some cases, resulted in a number of class closures,\" they said.\n\"Any decision to close a class is a difficult one for schools but it is done in an attempt to mitigate risk.\"\n\"EA recognises the difficulty for schools and families in this situation and has taken a range of measures to address the staffing deficit.\"\nBut Justin McCamphill, national official of the teaching union NASUWT, said it was not only special schools that were affected by staff shortages.\n\"We are receiving regular reports from principals that they cannot get substitute teacher cover for absent teachers,\" he said.\n\"The main factors are increased demand due to Covid absence, older teachers not wanting to return to the workplace due to fear of catching Covid, but increasingly the reason is that younger teachers are being attracted by secure jobs with better salaries elsewhere.\"\n\"The minister of education needs to get a handle on this situation to ensure that the education system can continue to function.\"\nNational Association of Head Teachers NI President Graham Gault said he had been warning of a staffing crisis for some time.\n\"We predicted a perfect storm of circumstances that would come together to contribute to the serious difficulties that our schools are now facing: staff illness or isolation compounded by other factors, including the unavailability of substitute teachers,\" he said.\n\"Special schools will be the first affected, given the very limited numbers of specialist staff available to meet the needs of the children.\n\"The problem will, however, impact all schools.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 50,000 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK for the first time since 17 July.\nAmid calls for more restrictions, Boris Johnson urged people to come forward for booster jabs when their time comes.\nThe prime minister said those who become eligible for a third dose of vaccine should organise an appointment straight away.\nThe UK recorded 52,009 new Covid cases on Thursday - alongside 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMr Johnson said, despite high cases, the government was \"continuing with its plan\" and that things were much better now than a year ago.\nHe said that was in large part thanks to the rollout of the vaccine, which has weakened the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths.\nReported cases on 17 July were 54,674 and came several weeks after more households could mix together and indoor hospitality resumed. \nDoctors are demanding ministers trigger England's \"Plan B\" - which would reimpose rules such as mandatory face masks and working from home advice.\nSpeaking in Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson said that the numbers of infections and deaths being seen were \"within the parameters of what the predictions were... given the steps we've taken\". \nIt was also because the country was in an \"incomparably better position than last year because of vaccines\" that there was more confidence around the current plan in place,\" he said.\nHe also insisted that the \"most important thing people can do is get that booster jab\" and that \"when you get the call, get the jab\".\nThe PM appealed for 12 to 15-years-old to get their first vaccination because there was \"no shortage of supply\" and there were \"huge quantities\" of vaccine available.\nAn estimated 4.7 million booster doses - which come at least six months after second jabs - have now been delivered in the UK.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ministers were letting the \"security wall against the virus... crumble\" and the booster programme was \"stalling\".\nBut Prof Jeremy Brown, an adviser to the government on vaccines, said Sir Keir's criticism was \"not an accurate description of what's going on\".\n\"The problem at the moment [is] the people coming to hospital with severe Covid and ending up in intensive care and dying are those who've not had any vaccines,\" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.\nUnder the government's plan for tackling Covid in England over the winter, the strategy currently in operation is Plan A.\nIt involves offering booster jabs to about 30 million people and offering a single vaccine dose to healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, as well as encouraging ventilation for indoor gatherings, hand-washing and face masks in crowded places.\nDaily UK infections have been above 40,000 for nine days in a row.\nAnalysis by BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby\nDaily cases of coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen slightly.\nCases last went above 50,000 in mid-July and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being introduced.\nIt's possible that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening.\nThe current strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable, and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to increase protection among the population.\nFree testing is also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid rates in Europe.\nIn 10-19 year olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections could leak into other age groups.\nA change in people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on the NHS ahead of winter.\nScientists say it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination programme hadn't even started yet.\nCase rates are rising in all but one region of England, the UK Health Security Agency said, with the lowest rates in London.\nRates of Covid were highest in those aged 10 to 19-years-old, with the lowest seen in those over 80.\nThere were 8,142 patients with Covid in hospital as of Wednesday, the latest data showed, with 872 patients with Covid in beds equipped with ventilators.\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the doctors' union the British Medical Association, said it can \"categorically\" say that the \"time is now\" for starting Plan B.\nHe stressed that case numbers were comparable to March, when England was in lockdown, and were \"unheard of in similar European nations\".\n\"It is therefore incredibly concerning that [Mr Javid] is not willing to take immediate action to save lives and to protect the NHS,\" he said.\nAcross the UK, booster jabs are being offered to:\nThe dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination, and will typically be either Pfizer or Moderna.\nBut Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that \"at this point\" the government would not introduce its Plan B measures.\nHowever, he also warned insufficient vaccine uptake would make restrictions in England more likely.\nAnd he said infections could soon rise to around 100,000 per day.\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Green Party (England and Wales)",
      "text": "Every household should be given \u00a3320 to help with \"spiralling energy bills\", the Green Party of England and Wales have said at the start of their annual conference in Birmingham.\nIn a speech, the party's new leaders said the \u00a39bn plan could be paid for with a windfall tax on all landlords of private rented properties. \nCo-leader Adrian Ramsay argued this could help people avoid fuel poverty.\nThe policy announcement comes amid energy price rises.\nEarlier this month, around 15 million households saw their bills climb by 12%, as the energy cap was raised.\nThe energy regulator Ofgem has warned that the cap will go up again next April.\nAddressing Green Party activists in Birmingham, Mr Ramsay said their proposal was \"about keeping people safe\". \n\"It's about the state responding to market failure, it's about human dignity.\n\"Our proposal is what government should be doing to show leadership - it's an issue which shows how climate justice and social justice go hand in hand.\"\nThe party says it also wants to introduce a Green New Deal programme, spending \u00a3100bn on getting the UK to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 through insulation schemes and renewable energy.\nBy Political Correspondent Ione Wells\nThe Green Party have reasons to be optimistic - they have a record number of councillors, their sister party is in power in the Scottish government, and they're feeling positive about their polling. \nRising energy bills and COP26 have got all parties talking about the need to move away from relying on fossil fuels too. \nBut they still have only one MP, Caroline Lucas, in Parliament. And more radical green groups like Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain - who the new leaders have actively distanced themselves from - have been making more front pages than the party in the last few months. \nThe new leaders are adamant they want to be seen as a party not a pressure group - but with every major party now trumpeting green policies, standing out is a key challenge.\nMr Ramsay delivered the speech jointly with co-leader Carla Denyer, a Bristol city councillor.\nShe said people had \"grown tired of choosing the 'least worst' option, of being patronised, ignored and told what to think\". \n\"We are tired of a Tory government playing divide and rule, tired of out of touch policies which ride roughshod over people, tired of politics which amount to little more than an old boys' club serving the interests of its pals,\" she added.\nAnd she accused Labour of failing the public and failing to \"take a stand on the biggest issues of the day\". \nMs Denyer, a former engineer, said the Greens were committed to a pay rise for key workers, a universal basic income and ending the sale of arms to \"oppressive regimes\".\nSetting out her party's strategy, she told the conference the Greens could \"win elections in every corner of England and Wales...  there is nowhere we can't win\".\nMr Ramsay said he wanted to be part of the team that \"gets our second MP elected, and our fourth and our fifth\". \nThe pair concluded their speech by telling the audience this was \"the last chance for serious climate action\" and that \"we and only we have what it takes\".\nThe Greens are in government in Scotland with the SNP, but their sister party in England and Wales remains a minor voice at Westminster with just one MP.\nHowever they have had more success at the local level winning 80 more council seats during elections earlier this year.\nThey currently hold 447 seats on 141 different councils.

      "tags": "Florida",
      "text": "Human remains found in a Florida park on Wednesday are those of Brian Laundrie, the fianc\u00e9 of murdered blogger Gabby Petito, the FBI says.\nThe body of Mr Laundrie, who had been missing for over a month, was identified using dental records. \nMr Laundrie, who was a person of interest in Gabby Petito's death, returned to Florida last month from a joint road trip without his partner. \nHer body was later found in Wyoming, where the couple had been travelling. \n\"On October 21, 2021, a comparison of dental records confirmed that the human remains found at the T Mabry Carlton Jr Memorial Reserve and Myakkahatchee Creed Environmental Park are those of Brian Laundrie,\" the FBI said in a statement on Thursday.\nA lawyer representing Mr Laundrie's parents released a statement, saying: \"Chris and Roberta Laundrie have been informed that the remains found yesterday in the reserve are indeed Brian's. \n\"We have no further comment at this time and we ask that you respect the Laundries' privacy at this time.\"\u00a0\nOn Wednesday, officials said that the remains had been discovered in a part of the park that until recently had been underwater. Other items, including a backpack and notebook belonging to Brian, were also found during the search. \nAccording to NBC News, bones and a skull were discovered during the search. \nIn a short news conference on Thursday, Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno praised officials for working under \"treacherous conditions\" in the park. \nHe described the chest-deep water as being filled with rattlesnakes and alligators. \n\"It's not like you're searching a house or a car. These areas are huge and they are covered by water,\" he told reporters gathered outside the closed park. \nThe case of Ms Petito, 22, and Mr Laundrie, 23, sparked nationwide media attention.\nThe couple had spent their summer on a road trip through national parks, documenting their nomadic \"van life\" trip on social media.\nMs Petito's parents reported her missing on 11 September after they were unable to contact her since the end of August.\nIt eventually emerged that Mr Laundrie had returned to Florida without Ms Petito on 1 September. Her family repeatedly appealed for her fianc\u00e9 and his family to co-operate with investigators, but he then went missing himself.\nHis parents told police they last saw him on 13 September - when he went hiking alone and never returned.\nThe parents, who have been condemned by the Petito family for not doing more to aid investigators, joined the search party on Wednesday. Chris Laundrie, the father, was the person who discovered a bag belonging to his son, the family lawyer told US media.\nThe rapid discovery of Mr Laundrie's remains and other evidence following the participation of his parents in the search has led some to speculate that they may have planted his remains or evidence. \nHowever, Steve Bertolino, the couple's attorney, told CNN that any suspicion that his clients planted evidence at the scene was \"hogwash\".\nHe added that Chris Laundrie had made a chance discovery.\u00a0\nMs Petito's body was eventually discovered in Wyoming on 19 September. A coroner ruled last week that she had been strangled to death and left for weeks before her body was found.\nMr Laundrie was not charged with crimes relating to Ms Petito's killing. However, the FBI issued a federal arrest warrant and charged him with fraudulently using her debit card after her death."

      "text": "The French government has announced a one-off payment of \u20ac100 (\u00a384; $116) for each citizen whose monthly net income is \u20ac2,000 or less, to help counter the surge in fuel and energy prices.\nThe \"inflation allowance\" will go to about 38 million French people automatically, including those who do not drive a car or ride a motorbike.\nThe first payments will go to business employees in late December.\nCivil servants, students and pensioners will get theirs in early 2022.\nThe \u20ac100 payment will be tax-free and Prime Minister Jean Castex said it would cost the government \u20ac3.8bn (\u00a33.2bn; $4.4bn). That would be far less than the cost of cutting fuel duty, he said.\nEurope is facing widespread discontent after world energy prices spiked, largely a result of huge demand from businesses recovering from the long Covid paralysis. The energy market turmoil has had a knock-on effect, disrupting supply chains and causing some shortages of fuel and other consumer goods.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron is six months away from a presidential election and the spike in energy prices threatens to trigger a new wave of mass protests. \nThe \"gilets jaunes\" (yellow vest) protests in 2018 escalated from protests over fuel duty to a much wider anti-government movement.\nMr Castex said a cap on household gas prices would remain in place until the end of 2022, as world energy prices were expected to fall only gradually.\nSome 13 million pensioners and two-thirds of students will be among those who receive the \u20ac100. It will also go to about half of all workers, as \u20ac2,000 is the average net monthly income.\nMotorists have been hit by soaring fuel prices: diesel has risen to a record \u20ac1.56 per litre on average in France, and unleaded petrol to \u20ac1.62 per litre, the daily Le Monde reports.\nYou might also like:"

      "text": "A woman has died and a man has been injured after actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun on a New Mexico film set for the 19th Century western Rust.\nHalyna Hutchins, 42, was shot while working on the set as director of photography. She was flown to hospital by helicopter but died of her injuries.\nThe man, 48-year-old director Joel Souza, was taken from the scene at Bonanza Creek Ranch by ambulance.\nPolice said they were investigating and that no charges had been filed.\nA spokesman for Mr Baldwin, best known for his role as Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock and for his portrayal of Donald Trump on sketch show Saturday Night Live, said the incident had involved the misfiring of a prop gun with blanks.\nIn a statement to AFP news agency, a Santa Fe sheriff spokesman said Mr Baldwin had spoken to detectives.\n\"He came in voluntarily and he left the building after he finished his interviews,\" the spokesman said.\nPolice are trying to establish what type of projectile left the prop gun and how. Mr Baldwin was seen outside the sheriff's office in tears, local media reported.  \nThe actor is a co-producer of the film and plays its namesake, an outlaw whose 13-year-old grandson is convicted of manslaughter.\nThe eldest of four brothers, all actors, Mr Baldwin has starred in numerous TV and film roles since the 1980s.\nMs Hutchins was from Ukraine and grew up on a Soviet military base in the Arctic Circle, according to her personal website. She studied journalism in Kyiv, and film in Los Angeles, and was named a \"rising star\" by the American Cinematographer magazine in 2019.\nShe was the director of photography for the 2020 action film Archenemy, directed by Adam Egypt Mortimer.\n\"I'm so sad about losing Halyna. And so infuriated that this could happen on a set,\" Mr Mortimer said in a tweet. \nIn a statement, the International Cinematographer's Guild said Ms Hutchins' death was \"devastating news\" and \"a terrible loss\".\n\"The details are unclear at this moment, but we are working to learn more, and we support a full investigation into this tragic event,\" said guild president John Lindley and executive director Rebecca Rhine.\nPolice say sheriff's deputies were dispatched to Bonanza Creek Ranch, a popular filming location, at around 13:50 local time (19:50 GMT) after receiving an emergency call about a shooting on the set of Rust.\nIncidents such as Thursday's fatal shooting on the Rust film set are extremely rare, but not unheard of. \nReal firearms are often used in filming, and are loaded with blanks - cartridges that create a flash and a bang without discharging a projectile. \nIn 1993, Brandon Lee - the 28-year-old son of the late martial-arts star Bruce Lee - died on set after being accidentally shot with a prop gun while filming a death scene for the film The Crow. The gun mistakenly had a dummy round loaded in it.\nResponding to Thursday's news, Brandon Lee's sister Shannon tweeted: \"Our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and to Joel Souza and all involved in the incident on 'Rust'. No-one should ever be killed by a gun on a film set. Period.\""

      "tags": "CPR,NHS Wales,Cardiac arrest,First aid",
      "text": "Tens of thousands of defibrillators across the UK risk being unusable because 999 call handlers do not know about them. \nWhen someone has a cardiac arrest, ambulance staff can only direct bystanders to the nearest defibrillator if it is on a central register. \n\"That could be the difference between life and death,\" said Adam Fletcher, head of British Heart Foundation Cymru.\nA campaign to register defibrillators on The Circuit has now been launched.\nSales of defibrillators rose after footballer Christian Eriksen's cardiac arrest during Denmark's opening game of the European Championships in the summer.\nThe device - which gives a high-energy electric shock to the heart - was used as part of the emergency action that saved Eriksen's life after he collapsed on the pitch.\nOne was also used to help save a football fan who collapsed in the stands during Sunday's Premier League match between Newcastle United against Tottenham Hotspur at St James' Park.\nSurvival rates are low in the more than 30,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests each year in the UK, according to the British Heart Foundation (BHF) - with fewer than one in 10 people surviving.\nAndrew Barnett was 46 when he had a cardiac arrest in 2018 while playing in a parents v children football match. \nWhen he collapsed, leisure centre staff ran to his aid, with a defibrillator, including Sheila Mott, who opened the defibrillator box while her colleague started mouth to mouth on Andrew.\n\"The pads went on him and Ben [her colleague] started to do compressions - then the machine said to halt and it was analysing his body, so we stopped,\" said Sheila.\nSheila explained the machine then signalled that a \"shock\" was required.\n\"I just pushed the shock button, then it analysed the body again and said to start CPR, which Ben did and we didn't have to shock him again,\" she said.\nAndrew, who is involved in the BHF's campaign, added: \"I was really lucky - I was in the right place at the right time, with trained staff who knew where the defibrillator was and it was working.\n\"It's a bit of a lottery at the moment. You feel that you were the lucky one, and then you feel really sorry when other people aren't in that position.\"\nSheila has been doing first aid training for more than 30 years, and now trains others to use defibrillators, both with Girlguiding and the Royal Life Saving Society.\n\"I feel quite proud of myself. That's the first time I've used it for life - to save somebody,\" she said. \"But I've always practised every month with them.\n\"We do CPR training with Brownies and the older children learn to use the defib. I think it's very, very important it gets across to all age groups - if they cannot manage the compressions on an adult, they might be able to tell somebody how to do it.\"\nThe charity, the Resuscitation Council UK, St John Ambulance and Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said the UK's low survival rate was partly because defibrillators are used in fewer than one in 10 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.\nBHF said early CPR and defibrillation could double the chances of surviving and it was often down to 999 call handlers being aware that a defibrillator was nearby.\n\"If we don't know a defibrillator is there, we can't send somebody to get it, to potentially save somebody's life,\" said Carl Powell, the clinical support lead for cardiac care with the Welsh Ambulance Service. \nWhile the 14 UK ambulance services previously had their own databases, The Circuit will eventually replace these with a new national database.\nBut of the 5,500 in Wales that are registered, there is another challenge - more than half risk being redundant without a \"local guardian\" who looks after the defib and makes sure it works.\n\"We can't be 100% certain those defibrillators are rescue ready at any one time,\" Mr Powell said. \n\"If we deploy one of those defibrillators that doesn't have a guardian, we take it off the system until a guardian checks it.\" \nHe explained ambulance staff would make those physical checks when possible, but it was a resource-intensive task for a service already under pressure. \n\"It's a question of communities who have worked so hard to get public-access defibrillators, to actually look after them - to make sure the batteries are still functioning or the pads are within date - so that if they're needed in a medical emergency, they're ready to go,\" he said.\n\"Unfortunately we hear these stories, where it's turned out there was a defib maybe 100 yards round the corner,\" said Mr Fletcher. \n\"But because it wasn't registered, the call handler at the ambulance service couldn't direct that bystander to get it. And that's what we want to end.\n\"The current situation is tens of thousands of defibrillators are not currently registered, and the ambulance service don't know where they are which is obviously a big problem.\"\nThe Welsh government recently announced \u00a3500,000 additional funding for the Welsh Ambulance Service and Save a Life Cymru to buy nearly 500 defibrillators - a condition of which is that they must be registered on The Circuit, with a local guardian."

Petrol stations reported strong sales during the last week of the month after warnings over delivery problems due to a shortage of lorry drivers.\nDespite coronavirus-related restrictions being lifted in the summer, shopping in-store remained subdued.\nHelen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said that shop owners would be \"concerned\" by the slump in sales in the run-up to the key Christmas trading period.\n\"For the sake of the UK's economic recovery, it is vital that retail sales bounce back as we near the festive season,\" she said. \nShe added that labour shortages across supply chains, warehouses, and factories were all putting pressure on retailers ahead of the festive season.\nThe proportion of online sales, however, rose to 28.1% in September, from 27.9% the month before - substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nDepartment stores also reported an increase in sales of 4.3%.\nTony Brown, chief executive of New Start 2020, which owns Beales department stores, told the BBC's Today programme that people's shopping habits had changed since restrictions had eased.\n\"There is not much browsing anymore - people come out, they know what they want, they spend and then they go. It is a different dynamic than what it used to be,\" he said.\nThe retailer also warned of a \"perfect storm\", saying that high shipping costs, additional customs checks because of Brexit, inflation and the cost of fuel increasing meant that additional costs had to be passed on to customers.\nBethany Beckett, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest figures suggested the \"economic recovery is fast running out of steam\".\nThe fifth monthly fall in sales in September marks the longest continuous drop since records began in 1996, although they remain about pre-pandemic levels.\nBut Ms Beckett added: \"Given the backdrop of continued shortages and rising Covid-19 infections, we suspect that retail sales growth will continue to be weak in the coming months.\"\nIn the run-up to Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget next week, trade organisations recently called for additional support.\nThe BRC, in a joint letter also signed by the CBI and UK Hospitality, called for the reform of business rates charged on non-domestic properties, saying that businesses needed help to rebuild after Covid."

      "text": "Ed Sheeran will become the latest star to read a CBeebies Bedtime Story, telling a story about a boy who has a stutter, much like he did as a child.\nThe musician will read I Talk Like a River by Jordan Scott and Sydney Smith. \nThe book tells the story of a boy whose father helps him by explaining that the flow of his words is like a river. \nSheeran said he was \"delighted\" to read the tale, adding: \"I hope the story helps inspire and support other children who stutter.\"\nHe said: \"Growing up, I had a stutter like the boy in I Talk Like a River, so I'm delighted to be reading this story for CBeebies Bedtime Stories, especially as I'm a new dad myself.\"\nThe singer follows in the footsteps of several stars who have read CBeebies Bedtime Stories, including Dolly Parton,Reg\u00e9-Jean Page,Floella Benjamin,Chris Evans,Rob Delaney,Orlando Bloom,Tom Hardy, Josh Homme,Ryan Reynolds,David Hasselhoff, Joe Wicks,Ewan McGregor and Jodie Whittaker.\nCBeebies Bedtime Stories are broadcast weekdays at 18:50 BST on the CBeebies channel and are also available on BBC iPlayer. \nNME reported that Sheeran told a New York fundraiser for the American Institute Of Stuttering in 2015 that learning to rap like Eminem helped him get rid of his childhood stutter.\nHe said: \"My Uncle Jim told my dad that Eminem was the next Bob Dylan - it's pretty similar, it's all just storytelling - so my dad bought me The Marshall Mathers LP when I was nine years old, not knowing what was on it.\n\"I learned every word of it, back to front, by the time I was 10. He raps very fast and melodically and percussively, and it helped me get rid of the stutter.\"\nSheeran's story will air on Friday 5 November, following the release of his new album = (Equals).\nThe record, which follows his previous albums + (Plus), x (Multiply) and \u00f7 (Divide), will include Shivers and Bad Habits, both of which reached number one in the UK singles chart earlier this year.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Sajid Javid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 50,000 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK for the first time since 17 July.\nAmid calls for more restrictions, Boris Johnson urged people to come forward for booster jabs when their time comes.\nThe prime minister said those who become eligible for a third dose of vaccine should organise an appointment straight away.\nThe UK recorded 52,009 new Covid cases on Thursday - alongside 115 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nMr Johnson said, despite high cases, the government was \"continuing with its plan\" and that things were much better now than a year ago.\nHe said that was in large part thanks to the rollout of the vaccine, which has weakened the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths.\nReported cases on 17 July were 54,674 and came several weeks after more households could mix together and indoor hospitality resumed. \nDoctors are demanding ministers trigger England's \"Plan B\" - which would reimpose rules such as mandatory face masks and working from home advice.\nSpeaking in Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson said that the numbers of infections and deaths being seen were \"within the parameters of what the predictions were... given the steps we've taken\". \nIt was also because the country was in an \"incomparably better position than last year because of vaccines\" that there was more confidence around the current plan in place,\" he said.\nHe also insisted that the \"most important thing people can do is get that booster jab\" and that \"when you get the call, get the jab\".\nThe PM appealed for 12 to 15-years-old to get their first vaccination because there was \"no shortage of supply\" and there were \"huge quantities\" of vaccine available.\nAn estimated 4.7 million booster doses - which come at least six months after second jabs - have now been delivered in the UK.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ministers were letting the \"security wall against the virus... crumble\" and the booster programme was \"stalling\".\nBut Prof Jeremy Brown, an adviser to the government on vaccines, said Sir Keir's criticism was \"not an accurate description of what's going on\".\n\"The problem at the moment [is] the people coming to hospital with severe Covid and ending up in intensive care and dying are those who've not had any vaccines,\" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.\nUnder the government's plan for tackling Covid in England over the winter, the strategy currently in operation is Plan A.\nIt involves offering booster jabs to about 30 million people and offering a single vaccine dose to healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, as well as encouraging ventilation for indoor gatherings, hand-washing and face masks in crowded places.\nDaily UK infections have been above 40,000 for nine days in a row.\nAnalysis by BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby\nDaily cases of coronavirus in the UK continue to rise - now going past 50,000 - and hospital admissions are rising closer to 1,000 a day, but daily deaths have fallen slightly.\nCases last went above 50,000 in mid-July and then fell steeply without any further restrictions being introduced.\nIt's possible that could happen again now, but that's reliant on several things happening.\nThe current strategy is to speed up vaccinations - in the form of boosters to the most vulnerable, and first doses to young teens and the five million unvaccinated - to increase protection among the population.\nFree testing is also part of that plan, and one reason why the UK has one of the highest Covid rates in Europe.\nIn 10-19 year olds, these have reached a record high and there are concerns that infections could leak into other age groups.\nA change in people's behaviour now could bring cases down and reduce growing pressure on the NHS ahead of winter.\nScientists say it's difficult to predict what could happen over the next few weeks - but the UK is in a very different place to last autumn, when the Covid vaccination programme hadn't even started yet.\nCase rates are rising in all but one region of England, the UK Health Security Agency said, with the lowest rates in London.\nRates of Covid were highest in those aged 10 to 19-years-old, with the lowest seen in those over 80.\nThere were 8,142 patients with Covid in hospital as of Wednesday, the latest data showed, with 872 patients with Covid in beds equipped with ventilators.\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the doctors' union the British Medical Association, said it can \"categorically\" say that the \"time is now\" for starting Plan B.\nHe stressed that case numbers were comparable to March, when England was in lockdown, and were \"unheard of in similar European nations\".\n\"It is therefore incredibly concerning that [Mr Javid] is not willing to take immediate action to save lives and to protect the NHS,\" he said.\nAcross the UK, booster jabs are being offered to:\nThe dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination, and will typically be either Pfizer or Moderna.\nBut Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday that \"at this point\" the government would not introduce its Plan B measures.\nHowever, he also warned insufficient vaccine uptake would make restrictions in England more likely.\nAnd he said infections could soon rise to around 100,000 per day.\nIn other developments:"

      "text": "Northern Ireland is \"facing into the most difficult winter ever experienced\", Robin Swann has warned.\nThe health minister said there were \"unscheduled pressures\" facing the health and social care system.\nEarlier, Naomi Long said she feared relaxing rules on face coverings in nightclubs may cause a \"significant\" rise in the transmission of Covid-19.\nThe justice minister said she was concerned about a \"lack of clarity\" in health advice.\nOn Thursday, the executive agreed people will not need to wear masks while dancing in nightclubs when they reopen next Sunday.\nSocial distancing laws in hospitality venues will also be scrapped. \nHowever, Northern Ireland will not be following England and Wales in easing rules around testing for Covid-19 after international travel.\nFrom Sunday, those returning to England will only be required to take a lateral flow test after their arrival but those returning to Northern Ireland will still be required to pay for a more expensive PCR test.\nAny decision to move to lateral flow tests will require executive consideration and agreement.\nIn a written ministerial statement on Friday, Mr Swann updated assembly members on the pressures facing the health service.\n\"Over this summer and into the autumn, the Northern Ireland hospital system has consistently been operating above capacity, with many patients waiting on trollies for admission,\" he said. \n\"This situation is unheard of during the summer months and is an indication of the scale of unscheduled pressures likely facing the HSC system this winter.\"\nMr Swann detailed funding he had assigned to help support the system, saying he had tabled a bid for an additional \u00a330m from the October monitoring round to add to the \u00a331.5m secured in the June round.\nIt is understood Ms Long and Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon both raised concerns about the changes to Covid restrictions at Thursday's executive meeting.\nIn a letter to her executive colleagues, obtained by BBC News NI, the justice minister warned that the impact on messaging around the wearing of face coverings could have \"potential unintended consequences\".\nShe added: \"Given the extent of Covid transmission in the community, the risk posed by new variants and the high risk nature of nightclub settings, I fear that further relaxation in the wearing of face coverings, particularly when dancing, may lead to a significant increase in transmission.\"\nMs Long said she recognised making changes to allow people to stand to eat or drink without masks was \"necessary\", but said that with such relaxations it would be \"practically impossible to maintain high levels\" of enforcement.\nThe justice minister said she believed that as a result of the changes, it would be hard to justify \"continued requirements to wear masks in other lower risk settings as a consequence\".  \nShe also repeated her view that proof of full vaccination and testing should be \"mandatory\" requirements in high-risk environments such as nightclubs.\nIt is understood that work by Stormont's Department of Health on developing a vaccine passport digital system is \"well advanced\".\nBut Ms Mallon has said the executive was told if ministers agree to make the scheme mandatory, it could take five to six weeks to put in place the legislation enforcing it.\nShe said she was concerned that action from the executive would again be \"too little, too late\".\n\"We don't have five to six weeks, we need to be implementing it quickly so that when we need to, we can move on this,\" she said.\n\"I voted against reopening hospitality and nightclubs without mandatory passports\u2026 we should have this in place, we know vaccines help to protect us.\n\"You need to ask other ministers why they don't share that viewpoint in the face of overwhelming evidence.\"\nDr David Farren, the chair of the British Medical Association's (BMA) Consultants Committee said the the Executive's decision is \"madness\".\n\"I was quoted earlier this week as saying that I haven't seen a health service as busy as this in my 20 years of practice. I stand by that,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback.\n\"I don't care if people think we are scaremongering. The reason we are highlighting the data and the cases that are there at the minute is because we don't want to see this fall over.\n\"What happens if the health service gets overwhelmed, frankly, is that people will die.\"\nOn Thursday, First Minister Paul Givan said Northern Ireland was going to be able to \"move forward\" with further easing.\n\"We continue to monitor the way in which transmission is spreading, but also the way in which it is spreading in hospitals,\" he said.\n\"But nobody wants to go back to what we had before. There are consequences with lockdown, people's mental health and cases of domestic violence that took place.\n\"Lockdown is not a solution without consequences - it has very serious consequences, and we all want to avoid that.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow.\nAdvising people to work from home is likely to have the greatest impact on stemming the spread of coronavirus this winter, scientists advising the UK government have said. In minutes of a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on 14 October, published on Friday, experts said stricter Covid rules should now be readied for \"rapid deployment\". Ministers in England have been resisting calls to enact winter Plan B rules - such as mandatory face masks in certain places - amid concern over UK Covid case levels and a slow rise in hospitalisations and deaths. One in 55 people in England had Covid in the week ending 16 October, according to the latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics - more than at any time since the end of January. Boris Johnson has said all measures were under review.\nA new mutated version of the Delta Covid variant - dubbed by some as \"Delta Plus\" - may spread more easily than the regular strain, UK experts have said. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has moved \"Delta Plus\", or AY.4.2, up into the \"variant under investigation\" category, to reflect this possible risk. Although regular Delta still accounts for most UK cases, AY.4.2 cases have been increasing - with the latest official data suggesting 6% of infections are of this type. However, there is no evidence yet that it causes worse illness, and experts say it is unlikely to take off in a big way or escape current vaccines. \nAlthough most adults agree Covid measures such as social distancing and mask wearing are important to stem the virus's spread, fewer adults in Britain are still doing it, a survey by the Office for National Statistics reveals. The percentage of adults who say they always or often maintain social distancing has fallen - from 63% in mid-July to 39% in mid-October. Meanwhile, 82% say they wear a face covering now, down from 97% in mid-June. More than half of working adults are travelling to work, the survey found. It's the highest rate for a year. \nLanarkshire's health board has moved to the \"highest risk level\" as its three hospitals have hit maximum capacity. The military is already providing extra support at University Hospitals Hairmyres, Monklands and Wishaw, and the health board has said some elective cancer procedures have been cancelled. Laura Ace, deputy chief executive of NHS Lanarkshire, said: \"We are facing relentless pressures, bed shortages and staff shortages due to sickness, stress and self-isolation and University hospitals Hairmyres, Monklands and Wishaw are all at maximum capacity.\"\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel had to avoid shaking hands with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen at a Brussels summit in a bid to strictly stick to Covid rules. Mrs Merkel instead offered a fist bump, which Ms von der Leyen cupped in her hands. Watch the awkward scenes above.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWith cases rising the UK government has faced some criticism for not reintroducing rules requiring face coverings in certain places in England.

      "title": "How green politics are changing Europe",
      "text": "An ocean of conservative blue blankets the electoral map in Germany's southern state of Bavaria. \nAnd yet the conservative vote actually fell across Germany in last month's federal vote, while the Greens achieved their biggest success yet.\nIn an election dominated by climate change, a speck of green has made a ripple in Bavaria. For the first time a Greens candidate was directly elected to represent Bavaria in the federal parliament.\nIt is symbolic of the creeping rise in support for European green parties, from Hungary to Finland.\nThe new MP, Jamila Sch\u00e4fer, beamed with satisfaction when she recalled her surprise victory in Munich-South, by a wafer-thin margin of 0.8%. Only once before had the CSU lost the constituency since 1976.\n\"This is a major sign of change,\" Ms Sch\u00e4fer told the BBC.\nThe Greens won 14.8% of the vote nationwide, appealing beyond their eco-protest roots with Annalena Baerbock standing as candidate for chancellor. Now they are in talks to share power as part of a three-way coalition.\nMs Sch\u00e4fer, 28, is the Greens' deputy federal chairwoman and typifies a party that has undergone a national makeover after years of power-sharing in several German states (L\u00e4nder).\nShe rose through the ranks of Green Youth, taking part in school strikes against education reforms, long before Swedish activist Greta Thunberg made her name by skipping classes for climate protests.\nClimate change was consistently ranked as the most serious facing Germany in opinion polls ahead of the election. \nEven so, Ms Sch\u00e4fer targeted her \"close-to-the-people\" campaign in Munich-South on housing, pensions and taxes.\nOnce ridiculed by many as idealistic hippies, Green parties increased their vote share in 13 European countries at the most recent national elections. In six of those countries - Austria, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg and Sweden - green parties have a share of power in coalition governments.\nIn all those cases, the Greens are pressing their partners to adopt more ambitious targets for lowering carbon emissions. Elsewhere, the green mayors of Amsterdam and Budapest are aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050 and 2030 respectively - to balance the greenhouse gases emitted and absorbed by their cities.\nWhile in Scotland, the Green Party there is driving a \u00a333bn ($45bn) plan to decarbonise heating as part of a power-sharing deal in the country's devolved government.\nDespite last month's election success for the German Greens, even co-leader Ms Baerbock admitted they had failed to live up to early opinion poll ratings: \"We wanted more. We didn't achieve that.\"\nGiven the urgency of curbing emissions, what's holding the Greens back?\nOne explanation is that mainstream parties across Europe have elevated climate change to the top of their agendas. \n\"If you're concerned about the climate, it doesn't follow that you're going to vote green,\" Adam Fagan, a political scientist at King's College, London, said. \"It means you're going to scrutinise the manifestos of the main parties for their green credentials.\"\nGreen parties tend to do better in countries with more proportional systems, as used by the European Union for its parliamentary elections. For example, the Greens/EFA bloc gained 25 seats with 10.8% of the vote in the 2019 election to the European Parliament.\n\"People think putting the Greens in power [in the EU] is less dangerous,\" said Philippe Lamberts, co-president of the Greens/EFA. \n\"From the right and the left, there's always a question hanging over us: can you really trust the Greens with the economy?\"\nNational election results suggest the answer is no. \nTo reduce emissions, the Greens say big structural changes to the economy are needed. While those reforms are necessary, they scare people and put them off voting green, Ms Sch\u00e4fer said.\n\"They're worried they'll be the losers of big transformation,\" the MP said. \"It's a lack of control that people are afraid of. But we need to convince people that our politics is not about giving up control.\"\nIt's even more difficult in Southern and Eastern European countries, where support for green parties is fragmented or non-existent. Surveys show that climate change is far from a top priority in post-communist countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania.\nVoters and political parties there are generally more concerned about economic development or migration, leaving environmental issues to civil society groups.\nMr Lamberts believes voters find the message that their country's model is \"killing the planet\" unpalatable.\nUnlike in many of the other former Soviet-bloc states, green parties have made inroads in Hungary.\nThe green LMP party has won seats in three consecutive national elections since 2010, while Dialogue received 11.9% of the vote in an alliance with the Hungarian Socialists in 2018.\nDialogue's success came under the leadership of Gergely Karacsony, who was elected mayor of Budapest in 2019.\nHe defeated the nationalist incumbent by rallying opposition parties behind his liberal platform, and promising solutions not only to environmental issues, but economic and social ones too.\n\"In Hungary today, there are three different crises. A democratic crisis, a social crisis and an environmental crisis,\" Budapest's mayor told the BBC. \"The advantage of the green movement is that we have proposals for all three.\"\nHe linked green policies such as urban foresting and carbon-free public transport to Hungary's poor record on air quality and other environmental problems.\nParticularly in post-Soviet countries, the mayor said, social justice must go hand in hand with the green transition.\n\"We cannot put the costs of sustainability on disadvantaged segments of society.\" \nWhat worked in Budapest may not necessarily follow elsewhere, but green candidates have achieved electoral success where they have channelled voter discontent, united the opposition and diversified their offer beyond the environment.\nIf the Greens can build on these gains, there is a future for them in coalitions, Professor Fagan said. \n\"Green politics in Europe is getting bigger and stronger, and I'm sure it will grow in the coming years,\" Ms Sch\u00e4fer said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " Covid has severely affected healthcare staff and may have killed between 80,000 and 180,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. \nHealthcare workers must be prioritised for vaccines, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, and he criticised unfairness in the distribution of jabs.\nThe deaths occurred between January 2020 and May of this year. \nEarlier, another senior WHO official warned a lack of jabs could see the pandemic continue well into next year. \nThere are an estimated 135 million healthcare workers globally. \n\"Data from 119 countries suggest that on average, two in five healthcare workers globally are fully vaccinated,\" Dr Tedros said. \n\"But of course, that average masks huge differences across regions and economic groupings.\"\nFewer than one in 10 healthcare workers were fully vaccinated in Africa, he said, compared with eight in 10 in high-income countries. \nA failure to provide poorer countries with enough vaccines was highlighted earlier by Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior leader at the WHO, who said it meant the Covid crisis could \"easily drag on deep into 2022\".\nLess than 5% of Africa's population have been vaccinated, compared with 40% on most other continents.\nThe vast majority of Covid vaccines overall have been used in high-income or upper middle-income countries. Africa accounts for just 2.6% of doses administered globally. \nThe original idea behind Covax, the UN-backed global programme to distribute vaccines fairly, was that all countries would be able to acquire vaccines from its pool, including wealthy ones, writes BBC Global Affairs correspondent Naomi Grimley. \nBut most G7 countries decided to hold back once they started making their own one-to-one deals with pharmaceutical companies.\nDr Aylward appealed to wealthy countries to give up their places in the queue for vaccines so that pharmaceutical companies can prioritise the lowest-income countries instead.\nHe said wealthy countries needed to \"stocktake\" where they were with their donation commitments made at summits such as the G7 meeting in St Ives this summer.  \n\"I can tell you we're not on track,\" he said. \"We really need to speed it up or you know what? This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to.\"\nThe People's Vaccine - an alliance of charities - has released new figures suggesting just one in seven of the doses promised by pharmaceutical companies and wealthy countries are actually reaching their destinations in poorer countries. \nThe alliance, which includes Oxfam and UNAids, also criticised Canada and the UK for procuring vaccines for their own populations via Covax. \nOfficial figures show that earlier this year the UK received 539,370 Pfizer doses from Covax while Canada took just under a million AstraZeneca doses. \nOxfam's Global Health Adviser, Rohit Malpani, acknowledged that Canada and the UK were technically entitled to get vaccines via this route having paid into the Covax mechanism, but he said it was still \"morally indefensible\" given that they had both obtained millions of doses through their own bilateral agreements. \nThe UK government pointed out it was one of the countries which had \"kick-started\" Covax last year with a donation of \u00a3548m. \nThe UK has also delivered more than 10 million vaccines to countries in need, and has pledged a total of 100 million.\nThe Canadian government was keen to stress that it had now stopped using Covax vaccines. \nThe country's International Development Minister, Karina Gould, said: \"As soon as it became clear that the supply we had secured through our bilateral deals would be sufficient for the Canadian population, we pivoted the doses which we had procured from Covax back to Covax, so they could be redistributed to developing countries.\" \nCovax originally aimed to deliver two billion doses of vaccines by the end of this year, but so far it has shipped 371m doses."

      "text": "A Belfast woman who was sexually abused by her stepfather as a child has waived her anonymity to speak out about what happened to her. \nHaileigh Ashton Lamont said she wanted to tell her own story, in her own words, but also to share her experience of the prosecution process.\nShe said she did so in the hope it might help prepare other victims and survivors considering coming forward. \nHer abuser, Tommy Harris, 48, pleaded guilty to 42 counts of sexual assault. \nThe charges against Harris, who has an address at Wynchurch Road in Belfast, included rape, attempted rape, indecent assault and gross indecency with a child. \nThe abuse took place over a decade, from 1999 to 2009. \nIt started when Haileigh was seven, and didn't end until she was 18.\nLast year, after seeing her mental and physical health suffer under the strain, Haileigh reported what had happened to police. \nNow 30, she said: \"On the 7th of July I walked into a police station in Belfast. I was hysterical, I was panicking, I couldn't breathe.\n\"And that's when I said for the first time in my life: 'My stepfather sexually abused me when I was a child.'\n\"I thought once I said that out loud in a police station that would be enough. \n\"But since then, I've had to fight to get justice - and it has been a fight.\"\nHaileigh said her earliest and most thorough memory of the sexual abuse was when she was seven or eight.\nShe said she lived in fear all the time.\n\"If you can imagine the feeling of dread that you've had or the worst day of your life, that was my every day,\" she said.\n\"Whenever I was a young child, I didn't know why my skin was crawling, why I wanted to die, because it was a person in a position of trust, and I was too young to understand.\n\"And then the older I got, I was still a child, but I understood that it was sexual abuse that I was suffering, and so frequently, I had to live with all that, and pretend that I was OK - because I was so fearful of what he would do if I exposed him or somebody found out. \n\"While I was staying quiet I was protecting a paedophile, that's how I felt.\"\nHaileigh said she still feels an overwhelming urge to apologise to anybody she brought into her life because they were exposed to what had happened.\n\"But I was just so into survival mode that I didn't see it like that at the time,\" she said.\n\"I've managed to break it down to me versus him, and I chose myself.\"\nHaileigh wanted to waive the anonymity she is legally entitled to as a victim of sexual abuse in order to \"take control\" of her story \n\"You can't do what he done to me and get away with it. There has to be consequences,\" she said. \n\"If I can share my experience and it resonates with one person and they think that if they come forward they might have a better understanding of what to expect, it's worth it then for me.\"\nHaileigh said she wants justice - but what is justice to her now? \n\"If I'd have answered that back when I walked into the police station - I was so set on there needing to be a conviction,\" she said. \n\"I fantasised my whole life about justice. \n\"Justice to me now is the sound of my voice - being able to talk about this and to not be afraid any more after living my whole life in fear.\"\nHaileigh said she is now \"excited\" about her future - she's at university, studying to become a counsellor. \n\"I feel like I'm at the starting line, like I could do anything,\" she said. \n\"I am a prime example of not knowing what happens behind closed doors, because I know no-one would have suspected what I've been through or what I was keeping to myself.\"\nHarris will be sentenced next month. \nOn Thursday at Laganside court in Belfast, a judge told Haileigh she should \"hold her head high\", after reading her victim impact statement. \nHe said: \"You have done absolutely everything that could have been expected of you in bringing this case, and bringing it to a conclusion.\"\nHaileigh has this message to her abuser. \n\"I will not be remembered as the wee girl who was sexually abused,\" she said. \n\"I will be remembered as the young woman who boldly and bravely stood up for herself and exposed a paedophile.\n\"That is not a representation of defeat, that is victory.\" \nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this story, help and support can be found at BBC Action Line."

      "text": "Conservative MPs don't need to wear masks during debates because they know each other, Jacob Rees-Mogg has said.\nThe Commons leader said the party's \"convivial, fraternal spirit\" meant they were acting in line with government Covid guidance. \nThis guidance says people in England should cover their faces around \"people you don't normally meet\".\nTory MPs have largely ditched masks in recent months, but are being urged by opposition parties to wear them.\nOn Thursday, Labour's shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire said MPs should wear face coverings to set the \"best example to the public\".\nBut Mr Rees-Mogg responded that many Labour MPs had been pictured maskless at the the party's recent annual conference in Brighton.\nAnd he claimed they were more likely to cover up \"when there are television cameras around\". \nThe SNP's Pete Wishart told Mr Rees-Mogg all MPs should set an example by wearing masks - and that the difference between the Tory and opposition MPs on the issue had become \"comic\".\nMr Rees-Mogg joked that the SNP MP might not like \"mixing with his own side\" but the Conservatives \"have a more convivial, fraternal spirit and therefore are following the guidance of Her Majesty's government\".\nSpeaking on the BBC's Question Time programme, Conservative vice chairman Andrew Bowie acknowledged that his fellow Tory MPs had been criticised for not wearing masks in Parliament but said the situation with Covid had looked \"very different\" in the first weeks of autumn. \nHe said MPs had \"a responsibility to set the tone and set an example\" and that he was \"encouraged\" to see more of his colleagues wearing masks in the House of Commons. \nProfessor Robert West, a health psychologist advising the government as part of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), argued that MPs would set an example if they wore masks.\n\"Actually people who are ambivalent, it gives them a kind of excuse if you like, to say, 'If they're not doing it why should I do it?'\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.\n\"It's about leadership. And politicians often talk to members of the public and sports personalities and so on about setting a right example for the public and I do think it behoves them to do the same thing.\" \nMost MPs from opposition parties have been wearing masks in the Commons chamber since full in-person sittings resumed over the summer. \nThe government is still encouraging people in England to wear face coverings in \"crowded and enclosed spaces\", although it is no longer mandatory.\nOn Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said mask-wearing was one of several measures that could help lower Covid transmission over the winter.\nSpeaking at a Covid press conference in Downing Street, he warned restrictions were \"more likely\" to return if people \"don't wear masks when they really should\".\nHe said this included \"really crowded\" places \"with lots of people that they don't normally hang out with\".\nHis statement came just hours after MPs packed into the Commons chamber for Prime Minister's Questions. \nNearly all Conservative MPs, including government ministers, did not wear a face covering during the session. \nLiberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said: \"It is utter hypocrisy that the public are rightfully being advised to wear masks while Conservative MPs refuse to do so.\n\"Conservative MPs and ministers have a duty to lead by example and take precautions to protect themselves, their colleagues and staff.\"\nUnions representing parliamentary staff say their members have been told to wear masks in the chamber, and have called for Tory MPs to do the same.\nThe Prospect union has previously accused maskless MPs of \"recklessly undermining\" public health messaging, and urged mask-wearing to be more rigorously enforced. \nGMB and Unite have called on Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who enforces the parliamentary dress code, to refuse entry to maskless MPs. \nSir Lindsay has encouraged MPs to continue to wear masks during debates, but has said there is \"no meaningful way\" for him to enforce this as he does not have the right to stop elected MPs entering the Commons."

      "text": "The organiser of the flight in which footballer Emiliano Sala died ran a \"cowboy outfit\", a court heard.\nDavid Henderson, 67, of Main Street, Hotham, East Riding of Yorkshire, denies endangering the safety of an aircraft.\nSala and pilot David Ibbotson died in the crash in the English Channel in January 2019.\nMr Henderson told Cardiff Crown Court he did not know which flight qualifications his pilots had.\nDuring cross-examination, Mr Henderson was asked why.\n\"What sort of cowboy outfit were you running at this time that you didn't know if your pilot had his ratings or not?\" asked Martin Goudie QC, prosecuting.\nIn a message to Mr Ibbotson at the time, Mr Henderson advised the pilot they did not want to \"draw the attention of the [Civil Aviation Authority] CAA\".\nReferring to this message, Mr Goudie asked: \"Isn't the true situation that you didn't want anyone looking at how you were running these flights because you knew you were running them illegally?\"\nMr Henderson replied: \"There's probably some element of that, yes.\"\nRead more on this court case:\nEarlier on Friday, Mr Henderson told the jury he had \"definitely not\" pressurised the pilot to fly from Nantes to Cardiff.\nWhen it was put to him that he knew that Mr Ibbotson didn't have the qualifications to fly at night, Mr Henderson said: \"I made every attempt to persuade him to get one, but he would have told me if he'd got one.\"\nThe prosecution alleges Henderson was \"reckless and negligent\" in allowing Mr Ibbotson to fly because he was not qualified to fly at night and did not have a commercial pilot's licence.\nIn a statement made after he was arrested, Mr Henderson said the flights were due to take place during the day and that he expected Mr Ibbotson to comply with his obligations, the court heard.\nHe told the jury: \"If he didn't have the rating to fly, I would have expected him not to do so.\"\nMr Henderson said he accepted David Ibbotson only had a private pilot's licence rather than a commercial pilot's licence, which would have allowed him to accept money to fly.\nHe said Mr Ibbotson was the only one of his pilots who was in that position, but he was a pilot with significant experience of over 20 years.\nHe said he did not tell the football agent who had asked him to fly Sala from Nantes that Mr Ibbotson was not qualified to fly because he was confident he was an \"experienced pilot who was keen and enthusiastic and wanted to fly\".\nBut Mr Henderson also accepted he knew he was flying in breach of regulations every time Mr Ibbotson was flying as he was being paid when he didn't have a commercial licence.\nThe jurors have heard that messages sent by Mr Henderson after the crash included telling aircraft engineer David Smith to \"keep very quiet\", adding: \"Need to be very careful. Opens up a whole can of worms.\"\nMr Goudie said: \"We know why you said that, because Mr Ibbotson should never have been on that flight. This is about a cover-up, this text message, isn't it?\"\nMr Henderson told the court he was concerned with the wrong information being leaked to the press, and said: \"I was not covering up.\"\nThe trial continues.

He'd been chatting and laughing with locals outside the church before he was killed.\nHe died as he had lived, serving people, for nearly 40 years. He had known five prime ministers.\nSo many people I have met in the past few days have stories of how he had helped them. So many here considered him a friend.\nThis silence is the idea of businesses from the Belfairs area. There is a parade of shops here where he was so well known, just as he was across the town and the borough, and beyond.\nThere is sadness, and a deep shared sympathy with Sir David's wife and children.\nAmong those gathered was Father Jeffrey Woolnough, who had rushed to the church when he heard that Sir David, a devout Catholic, had been stabbed in the hope of giving him the last rites.\nHe was unable to deliver the sacrament as the area had become a crime scene.\nHe said Sir David spoke to people from all parties, races and religions, and \"it was such a great gift and it was tireless because it was sincere\".\nButcher Tony Phillips, who closed up his shop for the tribute, said: \"We are all just so very sad that he is no longer with us.\n\"We used to see him quite regularly. He used to come in to the shop every now and then to see if we had any problems. He will be sadly missed.\"\nEstate agent Rob Cooke said: \"Sir David was very much part of the community and obviously we are just gutted with what has happened. I just wanted to pay my respects and to think about him and his family.\n\"I think it is going to take quite a long time for the community to recover from what has happened.\"\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Kidney failure,Transplants,Organ donation,Pigs,United States",
      "text": "US surgeons say they have successfully given a pig's kidney to a person in a transplant breakthrough they hope could ultimately solve donor organ shortages. \nThe recipient was brain-dead, meaning they were already on artificial life support with no prospect of recovering. \nThe kidney came from a pig that had been genetically modified to stop the organ being recognised by the body as \"foreign\" and being rejected. \nThe work is not yet peer-reviewed or published but there are plans for this. \nExperts say it is the most advanced experiment in the field so far. \nSimilar tests have been done in non-human primates, but not people, until now. \nUsing pigs for transplants is not a new idea though. Pig heart valves are already widely used in humans.\nAnd their organs are a good match for people when it comes to size. \nDuring the two-hour operation at the New York University Langone Health medical centre, the surgeons connected the donor pig kidney to the blood vessels of the brain-dead recipient to see if it would function normally once plumbed in, or be rejected. \nOver the next two-and-a-half days they closely monitored the kidney, running numerous checks and tests. \nLead investigator Dr Robert Montgomery told the BBC's World Tonight programme: \"We observed a kidney that basically functioned like a human kidney transplant, that appeared to be compatible in as much as it did all the things that a normal human kidney would do.\n\"It functioned normally, and did not appear to be undergoing rejection.\"\nThe surgeons transplanted a bit of the pig's thymus gland too, along with the kidney. They think this organ might help stop the human body rejecting the kidney in the long term by mopping up any stray immune cells that might otherwise fight the pig tissue.\nA heart transplant recipient himself, Dr Montgomery says there is an urgent need for finding more organs for people on waiting lists, although he acknowledges his work is controversial.\n\"The traditional paradigm that someone has to die for someone else to live is never going to keep up. \n\"I certainly understand the concern and what I would say is that currently about 40% of patients who are waiting for a transplant die before they receive one. \n\"We use pigs as a source of food, we use pigs for medicinal uses - for valves, for medication. I think it's not that different.\"\nHe said it was still early research and more studies were needed, but added: \"It gives us, I think, new confidence that it's going to be all right to move this into the clinic.\"\nThe family of the recipient, who had wanted to be an organ donor, gave permission for the surgery to go ahead. \nUS regulator the FDA has approved the use of the genetically modified pig organs for this type of research use.\nDr Montgomery believes that within a decade, other pig organs - hearts, lung and livers  - could be given to humans needing transplants.\nDr Maryam Khosravi, a kidney and intensive care doctor who works for the NHS in the UK, said: \"Animal to human transplantation has been something that we have studied for decades now, and it's really interesting to see this group take that step forward.\"\nOn the ethics, she said: \"Just because we can doesn't mean we should. I think the community at large needs to answer these questions.\"\nA spokesperson for NHS Blood and Transplant, said matching more human donors remained the priority for now: \"There is still some way to go before transplants of this kind become an everyday reality.\n\"While researchers and clinicians continue to do our best to improve the chances for transplant patients, we still need everyone to make their organ donation decision and let their family know what they want to happen if organ donation becomes a possibility.\" "

      "tags": "China,Taiwan,United States",
      "text": "President Joe Biden said the US would defend Taiwan if China attacked, in an apparent departure from a long-held US foreign policy position.\nBut a White House spokesman later told some US media outlets that his remarks did not signify a change in policy.\nThe US has a law which requires it to help Taiwan defend itself. \nBut it pursues a policy of \"strategic ambiguity,\" where it is deliberately vague about what it would actually do if China were to attack Taiwan.\nChina has yet to respond to Mr Biden's comments.\nAt a CNN town hall event, a participant referred to recent reports that China had tested a hypersonic missile. He asked Mr Biden if he could \"vow to protect Taiwan\", and what he would do to keep up with China's military development.\nMr Biden responded: \"Yes and yes.\" He added there was no need to \"worry about whether they're going to be more powerful\", because \"China, Russia and the rest of the world knows we're the most powerful military in the history of the world\". \nHe was then queried a second time by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper if the US would come to Taiwan's defence in the event of an attack by China. Mr Biden replied: \"Yes, we have a commitment to do that.\"\nA White House spokesperson later appeared to walk back Mr Biden's comments, telling US media outlets that the US was \"not announcing any change in our policy and there is no change in our policy\".\nThis is not the first time this has happened. In August, Mr Biden appeared to suggest the same stance on Taiwan in an interview with ABC News. The White House had also said then that US policy on Taiwan had not changed.\nThe US has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but sells arms to it as part of its Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US must provide the island with the means to defend itself. \nIt has formal ties with China, and also diplomatically acknowledges China's position that there is only one Chinese government.\nTaiwan's presidential office has said it would neither give in to pressure nor \"rashly advance\" when it gets support.\n\"Taiwan will show a firm determination to defend itself,\" said presidential spokesperson Xavier Cheng, who also went on to acknowledge the Biden administration's continued show of \"rock-solid\" support for Taiwan. \nChina has not yet responded. But earlier on Thursday, before Mr Biden's town hall, China's UN ambassador Zhang Jun accused the US of  \"taking dangerous actions, leading the situation in the Taiwan Strait into a dangerous direction\".\nTensions have been rising between Taiwan and China in recent weeks after Beijing flew dozens of warplanes into Taiwan's air defence zone.\nWith all the recent talk of war for control of Taiwan, it's important to remember a few things.\nAny attempt by Beijing to retake the island by force would be a gruesome, difficult task.\nThis doesn't mean it will never happen but the Chinese leader who ordered an attack would be endorsing Han Chinese fighting Han Chinese in a bloody, ideological conflict with high-tech lethal weaponry.\nIt wouldn't matter how well the Chinese government may have believed it had prepared people on the mainland for such a conflict, pumping them with propaganda about Taiwanese splittists et cetera. \nIt wouldn't matter how gloriously the war mongering Global Times newspaper had portrayed the campaign; any images of distantly related enemy soldiers lying dead on the beaches of Kenting would be hard to whitewash.\nThen, after seizing Taiwan, there would also be the not inconsiderable challenge of retaining control of a territory where the vast majority of the 24 million-strong population are opposed to Communist Party rule.\nApart from being responsible for all this, the leader who ordered such an offensive would also be responsible for causing massive regional instability, potentially drawing in troops from the United States as well as other countries like Australia or even Japan.\nXi Jinping would clearly love to re-unite Taiwan with the Chinese mainland under his leadership but, when you add all this up, you can see how high the stakes are. \nDespite the increasingly fiery rhetoric coming out of certain Chinese media outlets you would have to think that cooler heads in the Chinese government would not be considering an imminent assault.\nHowever, with China's rising military power, these calculations could all change within a matter of years."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "It is widely accepted the UK needs to revamp its ageing and draughty housing if it is to reach its climate targets.\nWith Britain's buildings accounting for about a fifth of the country's carbon emissions, a raft of upgrades will be needed if the country has any hope of reaching its goal of net zero emissions by 2050.\nAfter the release of the government's Heat and Buildings Strategy, laying out plans to tackle the issue, we look at the key things we can do to reduce the carbon footprint of our homes, the cost, and what help the government is offering.\nNew homes will be banned from installing new gas and oil boilers by 2025 and the government wants to see no new boilers sold after 2035. \nThere are three main contenders to replace them - heat pumps, hydrogen and district heating.\nHomeowners in England and Wales will be offered subsidies of \u00a35,000 from next April to help them to replace old gas boilers with heat pumps.\nThe grants for 90,000 pumps are part of a \u00a33.9bn government plan to cut carbon emissions from heating buildings.\nHeat pumps currently cost between \u00a36,000 and \u00a318,000 - and they need high levels of insulation which aren't always possible in the UK's older, solid walled homes. \nThe government is also pioneering trials of hydrogen heating. But there are huge challenges and many believe hydrogen is unlikely to be produced in sufficient quantities to warm many people's homes.\nDistrict heating, where large pipes are laid in the ground to supply heat from a variety of sources is also a possibility in some areas.\nOne of the most effective ways of cutting your home's emissions is by reducing heat loss through the insulation of walls, roofs and floors.\nIn an uninsulated home, about a third of heat is lost through the walls, a quarter goes through the roof, about 15% through the floor and the rest out of windows and as a result of draughts.\nHow you go about reducing this will depend on the type of home you live in, says the Energy Saving Trust (EST).\nCosts and savings vary considerably, but a typical installation of cavity wall insulation in a mid-terrace house would cost about \u00a3390, with annual energy savings of \u00a395. \nMaking doors and windows more energy efficient will also reduce your carbon footprint.\nOne option is to fit double or triple glazing - windows with two or more glass panes in a sealed unit. \nThe costs of double glazing vary hugely. Windows for a semi-detached house that are A-rated, taking in as much heat as they let out, would cost about \u00a34,250, with energy bill savings of about \u00a375 per year.\nA cheaper option is to install secondary glazing - a second pane of glass inside an existing window - or using heavy curtains to reduce heat loss.\nDraught-proofing is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to save energy, according to the EST.\nTo draught-proof your home, you should block up unwanted gaps that let cold air in and warm air out.\nDraughts can be tackled in a number of places, most commonly around doors and windows, chimneys, skirting boards and loft-hatches.\nJust be sure not to block or seal any intentional ventilation needed to keep fresh air flowing.\nDraught-proofing around windows and doors could save you around \u00a325 a year, and draught-proofing an unused chimney could save around \u00a318 a year, according to the EST.\nEnergy-efficient lighting and appliances could also help lower your emissions.\nIf you replace all the bulbs in your home with LED lights, you could reduce your carbon dioxide emissions by up to 40kg a year - the equivalent emissions to driving your car around 140 miles, the EST says.\nWhen looking for new appliances, such as washing machines and dishwashers, make sure you only buy the size you need, as larger items will use more energy and end up costing you more.\nAlso consider the energy rating of your new appliance and look for the product with the best energy rating for the size you require.\nYou can also reduce energy use by using \"eco\" modes and turning off standby.\nEnvironmentalists and leaders across the housing and construction industries have pointed to the many barriers preventing people upgrading their homes.\nMPs on the Environment Audit Committee have highlighted obstacles that need to be overcome: cost, the age of the housing stock, worries about disruption, and the variety of households - all with different needs.\nThere is clearly a long way to go.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

More than 670 people have been arrested.\nAs Thursday's vote began, Representative Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the 6 January committee, said Mr Bannon was believed to have \"valuable\" information about the riot.\n\"What sort of precedent would it set for the House of Representatives if we allow a witness to ignore us flat out without facing any kind of consequences?\" said the Mississippi Democrat.\nIndiana Republican Jim Banks took to the floor of the House to slam the \"illicit criminal investigation into American citizens\" and said Mr Bannon had become a \"boogeyman\" for the Democratic party.\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland, who leads the justice department, testified earlier on Thursday to Congress about the likelihood of criminal charges for Mr Bannon.\nMr Garland said that the department will \"apply the facts and the law and make a decision, consistent with the principles of prosecution\".\nContempt of Congress cases are notoriously difficult to litigate - the last time such a prosecution took place was in 1983 against a Reagan administration official.\nMr Trump has urged former aides and allies to reject requests to testify before the 6 January committee, claiming that his communications from the time are protected by executive privilege - a legal principle that shields many White House missives. \nMr Bannon has yet to comment on the proceedings. His attorney has previously said that he will only co-operate if Mr Trump's executive privilege claim is legally resolved."

If it had gone ahead, this week's trip would have been her 26th visit.\nRoyal visits to Northern Ireland during its centenary year have included the first in line to the throne, Prince Charles who went to Belfast in May, and Prince William who visited Londonderry in September."

Further implied cuts to overseas aid at the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) would send a signal that the UK is neither committed to, nor serious about, enabling a green global recovery from the pandemic, nor improving the resilience of the most vulnerable to climate change.\"\nThe cuts would come as the result of complicated accounting changes planned by the Treasury for next week's Spending Review. \nOfficials want to broaden the definition of what counts as overseas aid. Specifically, they want to include complex currency handouts from the International Monetary Fund known as Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), and Covid vaccine donations for poorer countries. \nIf these counted towards the government's current overseas aid target of 0.5% of national income, it could mean more than \u00a31bn less is spent on humanitarian and development support.\nThe letter says the UK would \"maintain its credibility and maximise the chances of a successful summit\" if it did not classify SDRs and Covid vaccines as foreign aid.\nThe fear among climate campaigners is that developing countries will lose trust in the financial promises made by the UK - and other richer nations - to help them adapt their economies to climate change. \nMany poorer countries have already voiced their concerns about the UK's previously announced decision to cut aid by more than \u00a34bn this year. \nIn a recent report, the Overseas Development Institute warned a \"sleight of hand\" with foreign aid risked sabotaging negotiations in Glasgow.\n\"If the Treasury slashes budgetary commitments to climate finance days before COP26 starts, developing countries - which have typically contributed fewer per capita emissions - will rightly question why they should bear the costs of climate action and whether they can trust the pledges of developed countries.\"\nThe Friends of COP who have signed the letter include:\nA Treasury spokesman said the UK \"is and will remain a world leader in international development\".\n\"This year we provided over \u00a310bn towards poverty reduction, climate change and global health security - a greater proportion of our national income than the majority of the G7,\" he said, adding \"we will return to the 0.7% target when the fiscal situation allows\"."

      "text": "Piers Morgan has announced he is to stop hosting his ITV show Life Stories.\nIn a tweet on Thursday, the presenter revealed that his former Good Morning Britain colleague Kate Garraway will take over the programme.\nThe news comes seven months after Morgan left GMB after controversially criticising the Duchess of Sussex.\nLife Stories was his last remaining ITV project. He will now move to host a new global TV show for the Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp and Fox News Media.\nPiers Morgan's Life Stories began in 2009 and has seen him interview celebrities ranging from Sharon Osbourne and singer Cheryl to then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown.\n\"I'm quitting Life Stories after 12 years and 100 shows,\" he posted of the programme, which has also featured Captain Sir Tom Moore, Katie Price, Sir Richard Branson and Sir Keir Starmer.\n\"My final one will be with my fabulous friend Kate Garraway and she will then present the remaining three planned shows of the next series as I leave ITV to host my new global daily show. It's been a blast!\"\nIn March, Morgan caused a stir by storming off and then permanently leaving Good Morning Britain following a row over comments he made about the Duchess of Sussex.\nMedia regulator Ofcom received a record 58,000 complaints about Morgan's comments that he \"didn't believe a word\" Meghan had told Oprah Winfrey about her mental health in an interview.\nBut ITV was cleared by Ofcom, with Morgan saying it was \"ridiculous\" that he had lost his job, and that the ruling was \"a resounding victory for free speech\".\nThe presenter's new show will air on the newly-announced talkTV in the UK, Fox Nation in the US, and Sky News Australia.\nAn ITV spokeswoman said: \"We would like to thank Piers for over a hundred engaging, compelling and insightful Life Stories over the past 12 years where his interviewees have included the very best names in showbiz, business and politics.\n\"We wish him the very best of luck with all of his future ventures.

      "text": "Alison McDonald had always been taller than her daughter - so when she suddenly shrank below her height, the family knew something was wrong.\nThe mother-of-four had spent weeks with an \"excruciatingly painful\" back, but hospital doctors had put it down to nothing more than muscle aches.\nThen one day her daughter Vicci Hughes noticed she was \"towering over\" her mother. \nWhen they realised Alison was now about four inches shorter than before, she returned to hospital - and was eventually diagnosed with myeloma, an incurable blood cancer.\nThe 56-year-old, who lives in Edinburgh, told BBC Scotland how Vicci had noticed the height difference on Alison's birthday.\nAlison said: \"It was really weird. I was standing beside my daughter and she said: 'Mum you've shrunk... there is something not right.'\n\"So we got a measuring tape against the wall and sure enough I had dropped from 5ft 6in to 5ft 2in. My daughter is 5ft 5in.\n\"I got a pang of fright and then noticed part of my spine was sticking out of the middle of my back.\n\"I thought, this isn't muscular like they have been telling me, and I need to get help.\"\nBack at the hospital, an x-ray showed Alison had several breaks in her spine. She was walking with a stoop and had lost a stone in weight.\nShe was given a back brace, but pain in her ribs meant she had to take it off.\nIt was not until three months later that a GP intervened and said Alison needed more scans.\nAfter a CT scan in April and bone marrow tests, doctors discovered Alison had myeloma.\nShe has since had chemotherapy and is now undergoing stem cell treatment in an attempt to double her remission time.\nA spokeswoman for Myeloma UK said the condition was the third most common type of blood cancer, affecting more than 24,000 people in the UK.\nBut is it difficult to detect because the symptoms, which include back pain, easily broken bones, fatigue, weight loss and recurring infection, are often linked to ageing or minor conditions.\nThe other symptoms include:\nThe spokeswoman said: \"While it is incurable, myeloma is treatable in the majority of cases.\n\"Treatment is aimed at controlling the disease, relieving the complications and symptoms it causes, and extending and improving patients' quality of life.\n\"More than half of patients face a wait of more than five months to receive the right diagnosis and around a third are diagnosed through an emergency route. By that point, many of them are experiencing severe or life-threatening symptoms.\"\nAlison said she had three unexplained rib fractures 18 months ago, but had not realised that this could have been the start of myeloma.\n\"I'm very fortunate my daughter pointed out to me that I had shrunk, or I would have carried on thinking this very painful back was just muscular and I wouldn't have started on any treatment,\" she added.\nVicci, a police detective who lives in West Lothian, said: \"When I noticed my mum had shrunk I pushed for an x-ray because I could see it was something more than muscular.\n\"The x-ray showed breaks in her spine that were akin to something like a horse riding accident, they were severe fractures like in an accident.\n\"She then said she had been told her bones had lots of holes in them like Swiss cheese.\n\"I felt horrible that she had been carrying on and doing things when she had this. I couldn't believe it.\"\nVicci, who is going to have her hair shaved off on Sunday in support of her mum, added: \"My mum doesn't expect a lot out of life. She's not the big adventurer and doesn't go on big holidays.\n\"She's quite happy living a simple life with her family. I hope she has a long time left.\""

Her admittance is understood not to be related to coronavirus. \nThe overnight stay was said to be for practical reasons and the Queen was undertaking light duties back at Windsor on Thursday afternoon.\nIt is the first time the Queen has stayed in hospital since 2013, when she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis.\nThe King Edward VII's is a private hospital used by senior royals - including the Queen's husband, the late Duke of Edinburgh, who received treatment there earlier this year.\nThe news on Wednesday that the Queen would have to cancel a trip to Northern Ireland was always going to cause concern. \nDespite looking very well and happy at the numerous events she has attended over the past week, it cannot be forgotten that she is 95 years old. \nIt is a tricky balance for the palace to release enough details about the Queen's health to keep the public informed while maintaining the privacy to which she is entitled. \nIt was for this reason that the news that she had been taken to hospital for tests was not announced, until a report on the Sun newspaper's front page forced the palace's hand. \nPeople will be concerned, but the reassuring guidance remains that she is in \"good spirits\" on her return from hospital and is well enough to undertake some light duties.\nIt has been a busy period of official engagements for the Queen.\nAn official record of the Queen's diary showed at least 16 formal events during October, and there had been the plans for her to embark on the two-day trip to Northern Ireland this week.\nShe was pictured hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening alongside Mr Johnson.\nHowever, on Wednesday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said the monarch had \"reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days\".\nHe said the Queen was \"disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland\" - which would have involved an overnight stay.\nThe Queen began the month in Scotland, planting a tree with the Prince of Wales at the Balmoral Estate on 1 October and attending the opening of the sixth session of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh the following day.\nThe following week, she met members of the Canadian military at Windsor Castle on 6 October and attended the launch of the Commonwealth Games baton relay at Buckingham Palace on 7 October.\nLast week, on 12 October, she attended a church service to mark the centenary of The Royal British Legion at Westminster Abbey.\nShe then travelled to Wales to open the sixth term of the Senedd on Thursday.\nBy Saturday she was back in England - attending Champions Day at Ascot racecourse in Berkshire.\nAnd on Tuesday evening she was back at Windsor Castle hosting the Global Investment Summit.\nThe Queen is expected to lead a royal delegation to the Glasgow COP26 climate change summit in two weeks' time.\nIn reported remarks overheard at an event last week, she appeared to suggest she was irritated by people who \"talk\" but \"don't do\" when it came to protecting the environment.\nEarlier this week, the Queen declined a magazine's award of Oldie of the Year, saying \"you are only as old as you feel\".\nShe \"politely but firmly\" turned down the award, but sent the Oldie magazine a message with her \"warmest best wishes\"."

      "tags": "Aviation safety,COP26,Climate change,Travel & leisure industry,Aerospace,Air travel",
      "text": "Those wispy white lines that crisscross the skies after an aeroplane flies overhead are far less benign than their fluffy patterns might suggest.  \nUntil now governments and industry have firmly focused on cutting CO2 emissions from aircraft - with good reason, as the aviation sector is responsible for around 2.4% of global CO2 emissions and a single flight can emit as much CO2 as many people do in an entire year. \nBut some scientists are now warning that the impact of radiation caused by aircraft condensation trails (contrails) could even be more significant. \nContrails, which heighten the effect of global warming, may account for more than half (57%) of the entire climate impact of aviation.\nContrails are water vapour that condenses as ice onto soot particles emitted from aircraft engines. They don't always occur as it requires certain atmospheric conditions: the air must be very cold, humid and \"supersaturated\" for ice to form. \nThey trap and absorb outgoing heat which otherwise escapes into space. This worsens at night when it is colder and the contrail has a longer lifetime. They can also have a less significant cooling effect, blocking incoming sunlight - but only during daytime.\nContrails can last for seconds, hours or even a day in the atmosphere - and this determines the climate impact of a particular contrail will have. But recent research shows there could be a solution for this overlooked issue. \nDr Marc Stettler, transport and environment lecturer at Imperial College London, says changing the altitude of fewer than 2% of flights could potentially reduce contrail-linked climate change by a staggering 59%. \"Tweaking the flight elevation by just a thousand feet can stop some contrails from forming,\" he explains.\nAdjustments would mean an aircraft could avoid some of the regions of the atmosphere that are cold and humid enough to create contrails in the first place. \n\"A relatively small proportion of flights contribute to the majority of climate impact. So if we can alter these flights, we can significantly reduce the climate impact,\" says Dr Stettler. \nRecent research from Prof Christiane Voigt, head of the cloud physics department at Mainz University, Germany, underlines this. \nShe has been conducting trials with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) to measure and mitigate the impact of contrails. \nHer team use high-altitude long-range (HALO) G550 research aircraft to gather their data. The aircraft carries wing-mounted instruments measuring contrail properties and the light scattered by radiation. This allows them to evaluate their forecasts' accuracy and investigate the impact of radiation.\n\"Our results have been really positive. We were able to predict and avoid around 80% of the contrails with little cost,\" she says. Prof Voigt adds that very few flights would have to be deviated to win a \"large climate impact\". \nWhile there were some uncertainties, her team were able to track down most of the contrails and avoid the correct areas. \n\"We are at the beginning of a race to avoid them. And I have the impression that [companies] such as Lufthansa and Airbus, are really interested, as it is low cost and effective,\" she says.\nRoyal Aeronautical Society fellow, Prof Keith Hayward, is optimistic it may only need a software tweak to adjust many flight plans to avoid contrail creation, and that this could be done at a relatively low cost. \nCompared to the typical $200m cost of a passenger aircraft or engine changes which can run to $12m, a software change is relatively inexpensive, he says.\nProf Hayward says the next challenge is for airlines to work out how altitude changes of a \"few thousand feet\" can be made mid-flight to avoid contrails while also not disrupting passengers' comfort. A pilot would need to spot these in \"sufficient time for an aircraft to adapt gracefully\", he adds.  \nBut Prof Voigt does not believe this is necessarily a problem. She thinks flight comfort could improve as flight paths would avoid some of the sky's water vapour areas - which both form contrails and cause bumpy turbulence.\nRaimund Zopp, former pilot and co-founder of Austrian flight services software company, Flightkeys, is working on contrail visualisations to programme into flight plan technology. The company plans to include contrail avoidance in their airline customers' flight plan trajectories by 2023. \n\"Only a very small portion of flights are causing the problem so you only need to change a few flight plans to have a huge effect,\" he says.  \nAs a former pilot, Mr Zopp says that from a flight procedure perspective, adding this information would be easy. \"The flight plans get programmed into the navigation of the plane system, but pilots need training on this new contrail aspect of the flight plan profile\".\nAny action on climate change that doesn't relate directly to cutting emissions is lower down the priority list for governments and industry, because CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas for most sectors. \nYet unlike other sectors, aviation also has very significant non-CO2 impacts. \nDr Stettler believes that people have hesitated to reduce contrails by diverting flights because of fears it would be completely unfeasible - that all flights might have to be changed or it would hugely increase fuel consumption. This latest research shows this is not the case. \nDr Jarlath Molloy, senior environmental affairs manager at the air traffic service provider, NATS, agrees that up until now, there has been a lack of focus on non-CO2 problems from the entire industry.\nYet from an operational perspective, tackling contrails is \"just one extra element the aircraft would have to compute\", he says, and it could even be managed in a similar way to how authorities already orchestrate groups of flights to avoid big winter storms. \n\"We're exploring the feasibility of it and what we'd have to do to manage flights looking for the same routes\" Dr Molloy adds.\nThe Department for Transport says it is \"currently considering\" a range of responses to its Jet Zero consultation on how to \"make the sector cleaner and greener\", and that this strategy \"will aim to address\" aviation's non-CO2 impact.  \nMeanwhile atmospheric scientist Prof Ken Caldiera, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, makes a compelling case. He estimates preventing most of the damaging climate impact of contrails would cost less than $1bn (\u00a3720m) a year and the net value of the benefit could be more than a thousand times that.\n\"We know of no comparable climate investment with a similarly high likelihood of success,\" he wrote in the scientific journal Nature.\nSo could a financial penalty focus minds in aviation more quickly? Dr Andrew Gettleman of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research says while more research is needed, a contrail tax or avoidance rebate could be introduced if a carbon tax were approved. \n\"We haven't seen the overall regulatory scheme yet for carbon in aviation, but once we get a larger regime in place for mitigating climate change and reducing carbon - then we can tackle the contrail problem properly.\""

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPersonal accounts of the pressure on the social care system are emerging as a report from England's watchdog - the Care Quality Commission - says the sector faces \"a tsunami of unmet need\", with the workforce \"exhausted and depleted\" by the pandemic. The director of one care home group tells us staff are leaving to get better pay in supermarkets. Meanwhile, Dorothy Cook says the care package to support her husband, Melvin, was ended after five weeks, as his condition was too complex for hard-pressed care providers to manage.\nThe number of rape and sexual assault victims waiting more than a year for their trial to go through courts has soared during the pandemic, from 246 to 1,316 between March 2020 and June this year. The National Audit Office says the Ministry of Justice and its courts agency have not been working together properly to solve the problems, which had their roots in pre-pandemic cuts. The government says the backlog in England and Wales is stabilising.\nThe prices of second-hand cars are soaring, thanks to a combination of pent up demand being \"unleashed\" after the first lockdown and a dearth of new cars caused by the global computer-chip shortage. Motoring group the AA suggests the prices of the UK's most popular \"nearly new\" cars have risen by up to 57% since 2019, with three to five-year-old Ford Fiestas - the most popular models on its AA Cars website - valued at \u00a39,770, up from \u00a37,448.\nThe number of people being home-schooled has shot up in the last two years, with some parents saying the pandemic made their decision easier. On the back of a 60% rise in the number of home-educated children to 4,002, BBC Wales hears how parents manage things.\nLoneliness, loss, anxiety, broken sleep... most of us have suffered some side-effect of the pandemic.

      "text": "Five police officers are facing misconduct proceedings over messages sent about Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens.\nThe police watchdog said it had carried out two investigations into messages sent on WhatsApp and Signal. \nThe officers are from four forces: the Metropolitan Police as well as Sussex, Dorset, and Avon and Somerset.\nIf proven, the claims could further undermine people's confidence in policing, the watchdog warned.\nCouzens, a former Met Police officer, was given a whole life sentence for Ms Everard's murder last month. He abducted her as she walked home from a friend's house in March.\nThe murder sparked a discussion over trust in the police, with the Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick saying she was determined to rebuild public confidence.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct - which handles complaints about forces in England and Wales - said it had run two separate investigations into social media messages, and found that a total of five police officers had cases to answer. \nIn the first investigation, it looked at claims that a probationary Met officer had shared an \"inappropriate graphic depicting violence against women\" with colleagues on WhatsApp.\nThe IOPC said the graphic was intended to refer to Ms Everard's kidnap and murder. Although the officer was off duty at the time, they later worked at a police cordon as part of the search.\nThe image was \"highly offensive\" and the officer will now face a misconduct meeting, the IOPC said.\nAnother probationary officer, also from the Met, will also face a misconduct meeting for allegedly sharing the graphic and not challenging it.\nA misconduct meeting is for cases which could result in a final written warning. It is different to a misconduct hearing, which is for more serious cases of gross misconduct which could result in the officer being dismissed from the force.\nThe IOPC also carried out a second investigation, looking at claims that seven officers from different forces shared information about Couzens' prosecution in a chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal.\nOne officer from Dorset Police was accused of sharing details of an interview given by Couzens under caution, which was not yet allowed to be reported. That officer will face a gross misconduct hearing.\nTwo other officers - from Sussex Police, and Avon and Somerset Constabulary - were also in the Signal conversation and were accused of making unprofessional remarks about Couzens and endorsing comments made by others.\nThe Sussex officer had a meeting this week and misconduct was not proven - although the officer was told to undergo \"the reflective practice review process\", the IOPC said.\nThe officer from Avon and Somerset Constabulary will face a misconduct meeting in due course.\n\"In April this year we warned about the unacceptable use of social media by officers based on a number of cases involving the posting of offensive and inappropriate material,\" said Sal Naseem from the IOPC.\n\"We wrote to the National Police Chiefs Council, asking them to remind forces and officers of their obligations under the police Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Behaviour.\n\"The allegations involved in these two investigations, if proven, have the capacity to further undermine public confidence in policing. They also once more illustrate the potential consequences for officers and come at a time when policing standards and culture have never been more firmly in the spotlight.\"\nThe IOPC said it was continuing to investigate the conduct of five other officers relating to messages sent in a WhatsApp chat group in 2019. The messages were recovered from an old mobile phone discovered during the police investigation into Ms Everard's murder, the IOPC said.\nThe IOPC is also still looking into how Kent Police in 2015, and the Met this year, handled allegations of indecent exposure which have been linked to Couzens.

      "text": "The head of the Irish Catholic Church has said partition causes him \"a deep sense of loss and sadness\".\nArchbishop Eamon Martin was addressing a service to mark the centenary of Ireland being divided and the formation of Northern Ireland. \nIn 1921, the island was divided into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson joined 150 guests from both sides of the border at the event on Thursday. \nArchbishop Martin said for the past 100 years, partition had \"polarised people on this island\". \n\"It has institutionalised difference, and it remains a symbol of cultural, political and religious division between our communities,\" he said.\nHe told the service in Armagh's Church of Ireland Cathedral that he also felt churches could have gone further.\n\"I have to face the difficult truth that, perhaps, we in the churches could have done more to deepen our understanding of each other and to bring healing and peace to our divided and wounded communities,\" he said.\nSpeaking afterwards, the prime minister said: \"It has been very moving to be here today and see the way in which people from very different perspectives have come together.\"\nMr Johnson said Northern Ireland was \"an incredible part of the country\" and had \"an amazing future\".\nThe prime minister added: \"I am a passionate unionist and, of course, I believe the future is within the United Kingdom.\"\nThe Queen had been due to attend the service but was unable to travel for medical reasons. \nIrish president Michael D Higgins declined an invitation.\nThe Armagh church service was organised to \"mark the centenaries of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland\".\nPresident Higgins said the title of the service made it \"inappropriate\" for him to attend as head of state.\nSinn F\u00e9in, including Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, also decided not to attend.\nHowever, Colum Eastwood, the leader of Northern Ireland's other nationalist party, the SDLP, was present.\nAmong others at the service were Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP); DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson; Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie; Alliance leader Naomi Long; Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride.\nTwo representatives from the Irish government were also present - Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, from the Fine Gael party, and chief whip Jack Chambers, from Fianna F\u00e1il.\nWith Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey, a Sinn F\u00e9in member, not attending, deputy speaker Roy Beggs formally represented the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nThe event, titled \"A Service of Reflection and Hope\", was organised by the leaders of the main Protestant and Catholic Churches. \nIt began with the ringing of the cathedral bell before the Dean of Armagh, Rev Shane Forster, sent his good wishes to the Queen.\nWelcoming the congregation in both English and Irish, he said: \"Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has divided us. And, yet, it has also, on occasion, brought us together.\"\nThe leaders of Ireland's main churches delivered their personal reflections on the creation of Northern Ireland.\nThe Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr David Bruce, said: \"I grieve the times when fear has held us back from building relationships with those with whom we differ.\n\"If we are to build a better future, then we must recognise our own woundedness and our responsibility to care for the wounds of one another.\"\nDr Ivan Patterson, the president of the Irish Council of Churches, said \"we need to learn\" from the example of young people.\n\"They are a generation who want to build peace, a generation who respect and care for this planet in solidarity with the poorest and most vulnerable here and around the world.\"\nChurch of Ireland Primate Rev John McDowell said:  \"I am hopeful. Hopeful in a new generation who know that the big problems we've landed them with, especially climate change and economic inequality, can only be tackled together.\n\"I think there are already signs that the next generation will see the things that we obsessed about as secondary and place their priorities elsewhere.\n\"As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light-filled, prosperous and peaceful future.\"\nThe main sermon was given by the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu, who told the congregation: \"We have come a long way - not just a century but centuries. \n\"During that time people have cared for one another and made efforts to build community.\"\nBut he added: \"We have also been blighted by sectarian divisions, terrible injustices, destructive violence, and by win-lose political attitudes. And for this, we have cause to lament.\"\nDr Yambasu said Thursday's service was an opportunity \"to give thanks and, also, lament; to imagine what could be, and to choose the way forward that can be mutually beneficial\".\nThe service included an opening prayer in Irish led by Linda Ervine and Se\u00e1n Coll. \nIntercessions were offered by Prof Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the Troubles.\nChildren carried a lantern to the altar, a symbol of light and hope for the future.\nNorthern Ireland was established in May 1921 after the partition of Ireland.\nIt followed decades of turmoil between nationalists, who wanted independence from British rule, and unionists, who wanted to remain in the United Kingdom.\nThe border divided the 32-county island into two separate jurisdictions - six counties in the north-east became Northern Ireland, which is still part of the UK. The other 26-county territory became the Irish Free State, but is now the Republic of Ireland.\nNationalists, north and south of the border, were infuriated by partition and continued to campaign for independence for the whole island.\nMany unionists were also bitterly disappointed, especially those who lived on the southern side and woke up to find themselves in a new state on 3 May 1921.\nThe BBC News NI website has a dedicated section marking the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland and partition of the island. \nThere are special reports on the major figures of the time and the events that shaped modern Ireland available at bbc.co.uk/ni100.\nYear '21: You can also explore how Northern Ireland was created a hundred years ago in the company of Tara Mills and Declan Harvey.\nListen to the latest Year '21 podcast on BBC Sounds or catch-up on previous episodes."

      "text": "Ex-Labour MP Frank Field has announced his support for assisted dying and revealed that he is dying himself.\nLady Meacher read out a statement from Lord Field in the House of Lords, where peers are debating a new bill to legalise terminally ill adults seeking assistance to end their lives.  \nIt said that he had recently spent time in a hospice and that he was not well enough to attend debates. \nLord Field urged other members to back the bill in his absence. \nThe 79-year-old spent 40 years as the MP for Birkenhead, and briefly served as minister for welfare reform in Tony Blair's first term in government.\nHe built a reputation as one of the most effective backbenchers in the House of Commons, with campaigns against poverty and for curbs on EU immigration.\nHe quit Labour's group in Parliament in 2018, saying Jeremy Corbyn's leadership had become \"a force for anti-Semitism in British politics\".\nHe was made a non-affiliated, crossbench peer by the Conservative government in 2020, after campaigning in favour of Brexit. \nA number of MPs have sent their best wishes to Lord Field, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid calling him \"an amazing, compassionate man\".\nHis sentiments were echoed by Tory peer and minister Zac Goldsmith, who described Lord Field as \"a man of immense courage and integrity\", as well as \"an extraordinarily effective and independent-minded parliamentarian\".\nLady Meacher told peers: \"Our colleague, Lord Field, who is dying, asked me to read out a short statement.\"\nIn the statement, he said he \"had just spent a period in a hospice and I am not well enough to participate in today's debate. Had I been, I would have spoken strongly in favour\". \nIt also explained his change of heart on the issue, saying: \"I changed my mind on assisted dying when an MP friend was dying of cancer and wanted to die early before the full horror effects set in, but was denied this opportunity.\"\nLord Field said one particular argument against the bill was \"unfounded\", adding: \"It is thought by some the culture would change and people would be pressured into ending their lives.\n\"[But] the number of assisted deaths in Australia and the US remains very low - under 1% - and a former supreme court judge in Victoria, Australia, [talking] about pressure from relatives has said it just hasn't been an issue.\"\nHe concluded: \"I hope the house will today vote for the assisted dying bill.\"\nThe new bill has been proposed by Lady Meacher - a crossbench peer - and would give patients of sound mind, with six months or less left to live, the right to die by taking life-ending medication.\nThe person wanting to end their life would have to sign a declaration that was approved by two doctors and signed off by the High Court.\nThe bill passed its first stage - known as its second reading - unopposed and will undergo further scrutiny in the House of Lords at a later date. \nBut even if it was passed in the Lords, it would not become law unless it was backed by MPs in the Commons, and the government.\nLady Meacher and Lord Field are among the peers in favour of the changes, but others have spoken out against the bill, including the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who told BBC Breakfast vulnerable people could face \"intangible\" pressure to end their lives.\nSpeaking in Friday's debate, another crossbench peer Lord Curry, also opposed the bill, describing how it would have been a \"tragedy\" if his daughter - who had a learning disability and died aged 42 - had had her life cut short. \n\"She breathed her last while we held her hands, a very emotional and precious moment for us,\" he said.\n\"If someone at that time had offered an assisted dying, assisted suicide option, I firmly believe that in that heightened emotional state we were in, not thinking rationally, we may have been tempted to agree to her premature death. Had we done that, it'd have troubled us for the rest of our lives.\""

      "tags": "Social care",
      "text": "There will be \"a tsunami\" of people without the care they need this winter unless staff shortages are tackled, England's care watchdog is warning.\nSocial care staff are \"exhausted and depleted,\" says Care Quality Commission (CQC) chief executive, Ian Trenholm. \nIn a report, the CQC urges immediate work to address the problem of rising numbers of unfilled care sector jobs. \nOn Thursday, the government announced an extra \u00a3162.5m to boost the adult social care workforce.\nThis is in addition to \u00a35.4bn earmarked for social care over the next three years from the government's health and social care levy, which already includes \u00a3500m to be spent on the workforce.\nThe CQC welcomes the money but has a warning: \"It must be used to enable new ways of working that recognise the interdependency of all health and care settings, not just to prop up existing approaches and to plug demand in acute care.\"\nIn its latest State of Health and Social Care in England report, the CQC confirms fears that social care providers are facing a staffing crisis, losing staff to better paid jobs in retail and hospitality, and unable to recruit replacements. \nAcross England, numbers of unfilled jobs are rising month on month, the researchers found, from 6% in April to more than 10% in September. \nLondon is worst affected with 11% of jobs vacant, followed by the East Midlands at 9.4% and the South West at 9.2%.\nThis means care providers are having to limit their services, the researchers found. \nIn Devon, Rebecca Marks, director of Ark Care Homes, says more than one in five of their beds are empty, because they cannot afford to staff them. \nShe says current staff are exhausted after the pandemic, and despite the company offering funding for training and qualifications, and paying joining bonuses, \"they are saying: 'You know, I'm going to go and work in a supermarket'\".\n\"We need help and we need it fast... whether it's funding to be able to pay our staff higher wages to represent the responsibility and the amazing job that they do, or something different. \n\"It's a very difficult place for care providers and care staff, and ultimately our residents.\"\nOona Goldsworthy, who oversees five care homes in the south-west of England, told BBC Breakfast she was \"literally throwing everything\" at the problem to try and fill vacancies - including increasing wages.\n\"We have to recognise paying carers the minimum wage is just not acceptable any more,\" she said.\nBy Alison Holt, social affairs editor\nIn the measured tones of a regulator, this report makes it clear that a staffing crisis in the long overlooked care system has much broader consequences. \nA \"tsunami of unmet need\" is more than a striking phrase. It represents a lack of support that can leave someone who is disabled or in the later years of their life struggling - alone or with family, facing grinding daily difficulties and too often deterioration that ends in crisis. \nIt is distressing for those at the heart of it and pressure on an overstretched NHS that with the right support might have been avoided. \nThe extra money the government has announced will help, but councils and care organisations have been quick to say it won't be enough. \nAnd the suggestion it could lead to tens of thousands of new care staff is likely to be greeted with a wry smile coming just 18 months after the last government recruitment campaign failed to do that.\nUnpaid carers who look after relatives at home are among those hit hard by the staffing squeeze. \nDorothy Cook cares for her husband Melvin, at home in Bristol. Melvin is in the advanced stages of a degenerative brain disease which has left him unable to wash, dress, shower or feed himself without her help. \nFollowing a fall in February, he was in hospital for six weeks, and then spent four months in a rehabilitation unit. \nMelvin is meant to have a care package at home but the provider ended it after five weeks, as his condition was too complex for them to manage.\nThat was 12 weeks ago, and Dorothy is struggling.\n\"It all falls on my shoulders, and I'm on my knees with exhaustion,\" she told the BBC.\n\"We both feel completely and utterly alone. We feel that nobody cares.\"\nCarers UK, which represents unpaid people like Dorothy, says a survey of 8,000 of its members suggests more than half (55%) have lost some or all of the support they need, since the pandemic. \nThe government says it will take steps to ensure that unpaid carers have the support, advice and respite they need, with more detail to be published later this year. \nCare companies say the main factors making it hard to find and keep staff are: \nIn its report, the CQC pays tribute \"to the professionalism and resilience of everyone that works in social care\", but according to chief executive Ian Trenholm: \"Those people cannot be expected to work any harder.\n\"If we're to get safely through this winter, there needs to be urgent action.\"\nHe says local leaders of health and social care services will need \"to make maximum use of everything they have at their disposal to get safely through the winter... If these things don't happen there is the genuine risk of a tsunami of unmet need, with many people not getting the care that they so desperately need this winter.\"\nHe believes the key is more collaboration between services and urges a rapid overhaul: \"We can't be in this position in a year's time. We need to be thinking about what systems will look like in the future.\n\"We are really clear, there are no silver bullets, there are no simple answers to what is a very, very complex problem.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care official said: \"We appreciate the dedication and tireless work of health and social care staff throughout the pandemic. \n\"We have provided record levels of investment to support them and will provide \u00a336bn over the next three years for health and social care across the UK. \n\"We are working on health and social care reform to ensure we can provide world-leading services and are committed to learning lessons from the pandemic, with a full public inquiry in the spring.\"\nShadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, called the report \"devastating\", saying the government's recent social care announcement would not help.\n\"Labour is calling for a ten-year plan of investment and reform,\" to include a new deal to transform pay, training and conditions for care staff, and a shift in focus towards prevention and early intervention, said Ms Kendall.

Here we look at six things to watch out for in the Budget that could affect your personal finances.\nThe chancellor is reportedly considering a cut to the 5% rate of value added tax on household energy bills.\nThe move would be popular and timely against the background of soaring energy bills this winter and is something the government is now able to do because of Brexit.\nBut the move could attract criticism as it would - in effect - mean subsidising fossil fuels ahead of the climate summit.\nAlso, a VAT cut on domestic energy bills would cost about \u00a31.5bn a year, which may just be too much for the chancellor.\nThere are rumours the chancellor is planning to simplify the way that alcohol is taxed in the UK.\nThe 2019 Conservative election manifesto promised to review it, so now could be the time.\nOne suggestion is to reduce the premium on sparkling wine to the same level as still wine, which could knock 83p off a bottle of Champagne or Prosecco.\n\"The government should stop trying to favour certain parts of the industry, instead focusing on removing distortions and creating a simpler system of alcohol taxes targeted at socially costly drinking,\" said Kate Smith, associate director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nThe drinks levies have been in place since the 1600s and raise \u00a312bn a year for the government.\nThere are rumours that the current Capital Gains Tax rates may be tinkered with.\nThe tax is paid when people sell assets such as shares or a second home.\nIt's been suggested that rates could be aligned more closely with income tax rates, which could mean scrapping the current tax rates of 10% and 20% (or 18% and 28% for property) and instead making everyone pay income tax rates on their gains.\nA report by the Office of Tax Simplification, published in November 2020, recommended that CGT rates should be increased to bring them into line with income tax.\nBut it would be unlikely to raise significant extra amounts of tax, as it is typically paid by only about 275,000 taxpayers and raises less than \u00a310bn a year. \nThere are reports that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier.\nThe chancellor could do that by lowering the threshold at which people start repaying their student loans, a move that could save the Treasury about \u00a32bn a year. \nCurrently, English and Welsh students who enrolled at university after 2012 pay 9% of everything they earn above \u00a327,295 per year. They repay the same 9% until the loan is fully repaid or until 30 years after graduating. \nIf the threshold were reduced to \u00a325,000, it would cost anyone earning more than the current limit an extra \u00a3206 a year, while if it were slashed to \u00a320,000, it would cost an extra \u00a3656 a year.\nMinisters are rumoured to have proposed cutting the threshold to as low as \u00a323,000 and giving graduates 40 years as opposed to 30 to repay their debt. \n In his March Budget, Mr Sunak announced that the National Living Wage (what the governments call the minimum wage) would increase for workers over the age of 23.\nSince then, the government has come under pressure to help employees further - especially as younger workers have been some of the worst hit by the economic downturn.\nOne solution the chancellor has been reportedly looking at is to increase the National Living Wage by 5.7% to \u00a39.42 per hour from its current rate of \u00a38.91.\nThat would bring it close to the Living Wage Foundation's current recommendation of \u00a39.50 an hour. \nThe government could raise cash by cutting tax relief on pension savings for those on high salaries. \nBut pension experts warn such a move would not be as simple as it sounds, Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said: \"A move to a flat rate of pensions tax relief, rather than the current system where relief is based on the rate of income tax paid, would be far from simple to implement.\"\nHe said it would be particularly difficult for defined-benefit schemes and could mean medium to high earners, including doctors in public sector schemes, facing big tax bills. \n\"Removing higher-rate relief would be a direct attack on middle Britain, leading to people who do the right thing and save for their future being hit with extra tax costs,\" said Tom Selby, head of retirement policy at AJ Bell."

      "text": "Actor Alec Baldwin has expressed his shock and sadness after fatally shooting cinematographer Halyna Hutchins with a prop gun on a New Mexico film set.\nHe tweeted that he was in touch with her husband and had offered support.\n\"My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna,\" he wrote.\nMs Hutchins, 42, was shot on the set of the western Rust while working as director of photography.\n\"There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours,\" he tweeted.\n\"I'm fully co-operating with the police investigation to address how this tragedy occurred.\"\nMs Hutchins was flown to hospital by helicopter after the shooting on Thursday afternoon but died of her injuries.\nDirector Joel Souza, 48, was injured and taken from the scene at Bonanza Creek Ranch by ambulance.\nAn actress in the film, Frances Fisher, tweeted on Friday that Mr Souza had told her that he had been released from the hospital, which was also reported by US media. The hospital declined to comment on Mr Souza's condition, citing privacy laws.\nA spokesman for Mr Baldwin, best known for his role as Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock and for his portrayal of Donald Trump on sketch show Saturday Night Live, said the incident involved the misfiring of a prop gun with blanks.\nPolice are trying to establish what type of projectile left the prop gun and how. Local media reported that Mr Baldwin was seen outside the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in tears.\nA spokeswoman for the local district attorney's office told BBC News that the investigation is still its \"preliminary\" stage.\n\"At this time, we do not know if charges will be filed,\" said\u00a0First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies.\nThe actor is a co-producer of Rust and plays its namesake, an outlaw whose 13-year-old grandson is convicted of manslaughter.\nThe eldest of four brothers, all actors, Mr Baldwin has starred in numerous TV and film roles since the 1980s.\nMs Hutchins was from Ukraine and grew up on a Soviet military base in the Arctic Circle, according to her personal website. She studied journalism in Kyiv, and film in Los Angeles, and was named a \"rising star\" by the American Cinematographer magazine in 2019.\nShe was the director of photography for the 2020 action film Archenemy, directed by Adam Egypt Mortimer.\n\"I'm so sad about losing Halyna. And so infuriated that this could happen on a set,\" Mr Mortimer said in a tweet. \nIn a statement, the International Cinematographer's Guild said Ms Hutchins' death was \"devastating news\" and \"a terrible loss\".\n\"The details are unclear at this moment, but we are working to learn more, and we support a full investigation into this tragic event,\" said guild president John Lindley and executive director Rebecca Rhine.\nMs Hutchins' talent agency, Innovative Artists, wrote in an Instagram post on Friday that she was \"a ray of light\".\n\"Her talent was immense, only surpassed by the love she had for her family.\"\nThe agency's statement added it hopes that the fatal incident \"will reveal new lessons for how to better ensure safety for every crew member on set.\"\nPolice said sheriff's deputies were dispatched to Bonanza Creek Ranch, a popular filming location, at around 13:50 local time (19:50 GMT) on Thursday after receiving an emergency call.\nSuch incidents on film sets are extremely rare, but not unheard of. \nReal firearms are often used in filming, and are loaded with blanks - cartridges that create a flash and a bang without discharging a projectile. \nIn 1993, Brandon Lee - the 28-year-old son of the late martial-arts star Bruce Lee - died on set after being accidentally shot with a prop gun while filming a death scene for the film The Crow. The gun mistakenly had a dummy round loaded in it.\nResponding to Thursday's news, Brandon Lee's sister Shannon tweeted: \"Our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and to Joel Souza and all involved in the incident on 'Rust'. No-one should ever be killed by a gun on a film set. Period.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Advising people to work from home is likely to have the most impact on stopping Covid spreading this winter, scientists advising the government say.\nStricter virus restrictions should now be prepared for \"rapid deployment\", the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said.\nIt said \"presenteeism\" - or pressure to be in work - could become an increasing cause of infections in workplaces. \nAsked about working from home, the PM said all measures were under review.\nBoris Johnson added: \"We do whatever we have to do to protect the public but the numbers that we're seeing at the moment are fully in line with what we expected in the autumn and winter plan.\"\nMinisters in England are resisting calls to switch to their winter Plan B that would see measures like compulsory face coverings in certain places.\nCovid hospital admissions and deaths across the UK are rising slowly, and the UK has recorded over 40,000 new daily Covid cases for the past ten days.\nOn Friday, a further 49,298 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK, alongside 180 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nAny advice to work from home would only apply to those who are able to do their job away from the workplace.\nIn April 2020, at the height of the first pandemic lockdown, less than half of people in employment, some 46.6%, did some work at home, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nIn minutes of a meeting of scientific advisers on 14 October, published on Friday, they warn that acting earlier rather than later could reduce the need for stricter measures over a longer timeframe \"to avoid an unacceptable level of hospitalisations\".\nThey added that any measures introduced must be clearly communicated. \nThe advisers, led by Sir Patrick Vallance, say models forecasting the coming winter suggest Covid hospital admissions are \"increasingly unlikely\" to rise above the levels of January 2021 peak.\nBut they say they are unsure of the impact of \"waning immunity and people's behaviour\".\nThere has been a noticeable dip in people saying they are wearing face coverings and latest figures from the ONS suggest more than half of British working adults are now travelling to work.\nSage says making face coverings compulsory in some places is likely to help reduce the spread of Covid as well as other winter viruses, such as flu.\nIt also notes the risks of high levels of the virus circulating in the UK, compared with other countries.\n\"Cases and admissions are currently at much higher levels than in European comparators, which have retained additional measures and have greater vaccine coverage, especially in children,\" the scientists say.\n\"Reducing prevalence from a high level requires greater intervention than reducing from a lower level.\"\nAnother worry is the emergence of a new variant that becomes \"dominant globally\", which they call \"a very real possibility\".\nThe great Plan B debate for England has moved up another gear.  \nDemands for more widespread mask wearing, more working from home and vaccine passports have been growing - with the NHS Confederation and the British Medical Association throwing their weight behind measures which the government has branded its Plan B.\nMembers of the expert committee Sage, according to minutes of recent meetings, seem to favour acting sooner rather than later - \"earlier intervention may reduce the need for more stringent, disruptive and longer-lasting measures\".\nThey pointedly note that cases are much lower in European countries which have tougher rules on masks and vaccine passports. \nBoris Johnson said all measures were being kept under review but the focus was still on getting more people vaccinated.  \nThe government then is resisting pressure for Plan B in England.  \nBut the notably more cautious tone from Health Secretary Sajid Javid recently suggests that the views of official experts and advisers are having an impact. \nThe advisers warn that the prospect of people being infected with Covid, flu and other respiratory viruses this winter could be \"a significant challenge\".\nThey say people who show symptoms of an infection should stay at home to stop it spreading to others.\nThis message needs to come from government, employers, universities and schools to be most effective, they say.\nOne in 55 people in England was infected with coronavirus in the week ending 16 October, according to latest estimates from the ONS - more than at any time since the end of January.\nInfections continue to fall in Scotland, and remain flat in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe percentage of people testing positive remained highest for those in school years seven to 11, the ONS estimates showed, ahead of half term for many pupils in England.\nIn the week ending 16 October, 7.8% of people in that age group were infected - compared to less than 2% of people in all older age groups.\nOfficial government data, which tracks people testing positive, shows that nearly 1,000 people a day are being admitted to UK hospitals with Covid and more than 8,000 in total are in hospital with the illness.\nThese figures are way below where they were in January because of protection from the vaccines, but doctors and health leaders have voiced concerns over the lack of curbs to control any further rises. \nWhen Mr Johnson was asked on Friday whether a full lockdown, with \"stay at home\" advice and shops closing, was out of the question this winter, he replied: \"I've got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that's on the cards at all.\""

Wearing a grey tracksuit and black-rimmed glasses, he spoke only to confirm his name, age and address.\nHe was remanded in custody and is due to appear at the Old Bailey on Friday.\nMetropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Jukes sent his \"deepest condolences\" to the family, friends and colleagues of the MP.\n\"Sir David's dedication to his family, his constituents and his community, and his positive impact on the lives of so many has been abundantly clear since his death,\" he said.\nSince the killing, a large team of detectives in the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command had been \"working around the clock\" to search several addresses in north London, analyse digital devices and review CCTV, Mr Jukes said.\nThere have been no other arrests and police are not seeking anyone else, he added.\nThe Metropolitan Police has been working with Parliament's security team and the Home Office to review the protection of MPs.\nPolice forces across the country have also been working with individual MPs about their security in their constituencies.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"I hope that the family of David Amess and all those who love him will get the justice they deserve as fast as possible.\"\nHe praised the police outreach to MPs on security, but said MPs must not be \"intimidated by this appalling murder into changing the way we conduct our Parliamentary business or the way we work in our constituencies - which I think is the last thing David Amess himself would have wanted\".\nOn Tuesday, MPs paid emotional tributes to their colleague, with Mr Johnson saying the killing was a \"tragic and senseless death\" of one of the \"most gentle individuals\" to serve in Parliament.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer praised him as a \"dedicated constituency MP\" and fellow Essex MP Mark Francois called him \"the best bloke I ever knew\"."

      "text": "Seven students are suing a Texas school district over its dress-code policy banning boys from having long hair.\nSchool officials suspended a 9-year-old boy for a month, barred him from recess and normal lunch breaks as punishment for long hair, the lawsuit claims.\nHe and the other students, aged 7 to 17, say the policy violates the constitution and Title IX - a  federal law prohibiting sex discrimination. \nThe school district said on Thursday it was reviewing the lawsuit.\nMagnolia Independent School District \"respects varying viewpoints, and we respect the rights of citizens to advocate for change,\" spokeswoman Denise Meyers said in an email to US media. \nThe district, which serves roughly 13,000 students about 40 miles (64km) northwest of Houston, did not return a request for comment from the BBC. \nAccording to its dress code policy, boys cannot wear their hair over their eyes, past the bottom of their ears, or past the bottom of a dress shirt collar. Facing backlash this summer, Magnolia defended the policy, saying it \"reflects the values of our community at large\". \nThe suit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas (ACLU) on Thursday on behalf of the students, argues the school district \"imposed immense and irreparable harm... solely because of these students' gender\". \nIt details a number of punishments given to the students - six boys and one non-binary child - for wearing long hair. \nOne, a nine-year-old identified as AC, is Latino, and wears his hair long like his father and uncle as a part of his family's heritage, the suit says. Another, an 11-year-old identified as TM, is non-binary and has worn long hair as a \"critical component\" of their gender expression. \nBoth have been subjected to punishments including suspension, denial of extracurricular activities and separation from their peers.  \n\"This rule is a complete and utter dinosaur,\" said parent Stanley Burkhead, whose son has long hair, at a school board meeting in August.\n\"Who are we to tell him who he can't be? Who are we to tell him what a boy should look like?\" he said. A survey by the ACLU of Texas last year found that nearly 500 public school districts in the state have some type of a hair-length policy only for boys. "

      "tags": "Alec Baldwin,Film,Ukraine",
      "text": "Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer who died when actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun on a film set, has been remembered as \"an incredible artist\".\nHutchins had been working as director of photography on the set of Rust.\nAmerican Cinematographer magazine had named her one of its rising stars in 2019, and she previously worked on 2020 independent superhero film Archenemy.\nArchenemy director Adam Egypt Mortimer told BBC News the fact she had died on a set was \"really unbelievable\".\nHe said: \"Halyna was an incredible artist who was just starting a career I think people were really starting to notice.\n\"The fact that she would be killed on a set in an accident like this is unfathomable. It just seems inconceivable.\"\nHutchins' most recent post on Instagram, from Tuesday, showed her riding horses on set.\nOn Twitter, Alec Baldwin said \"there are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours.\"\n\"My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna,\" he added.\nFellow cinematographer Catherine Goldschmidt described Hutchins as \"lovely, warm, funny, charming, outgoing\", and praised her for being \"so talented\".\n\"What's so tragic is she's made beautiful films already but when you think about what was ahead of her, that is also so sad,\" she told BBC News.\n\"She was also a mum, which I think is very difficult,\" Goldschmidt added. \"When I first met her I remember being really impressed, shocked even that this beautiful, creative, outgoing, enthusiastic talented cinematographer also is raising the child.\n\"I think for women in this industry it is very difficult. So I was very impressed that she was able to do that.\"\nAlex Fedosov, who like Hutchins is a Ukrainian film-maker working Hollywood, said she was \"rising fast in her career\" and was \"an artist and a visionary\".\n\"She was so talented, a photography director with her own vision, her own strong ideas,\" he told BBC News Ukrainian.\n\"When we worked together on set, I was assistant director, I would rush her and say, 'Hurry up, we need to film this'. She would smile calmly but carry on in her own rhythm because she knew what she wanted to achieve.\"\nInnovative Artists, the agency that represented her, described her as \"a ray of light\" in a statement.\n\"Her talent was immense, only surpassed by the love she had for her family,\" the agency wrote. \"All those in her orbit knew what was coming; a star director of photography, who would be a force to be reckoned with.\"\nFedosov added Hutchins was a \"wonderful mother, first and foremost\".\nHe also questioned how her death could have happened, saying: \"Standards of safety in the US are very high. There is always an expert on set. There are always checks ahead of filming. Blanks are used sometimes to achieve a better effect on camera but it is always done with high degree of safety.\"\nDirector Adam Egypt Mortimer told the BBC that safety on movie sets is paramount. \"The fact that a gun went off and killed Halyna is both shocking from an industry point of view and just absolutely tragic from the point of view of knowing this amazing artist who suddenly not with us.\"\nJames Gunn, director of The Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy, said: \"My greatest fear is that someone will be fatally hurt on one of my sets. I pray this will never happen. My heart goes out to all of those affected by the tragedy today on Rust, especially Halyna Hutchins and her family.\"\nDirector and cinematographer Elle Schneider wrote a thread on Twitter about the death of her \"friend and rockstar cinematographer\".\n\"I don't have words to describe this tragedy. I want answers. I want her family to somehow find peace among this horrific, horrific loss,\" she said.\n\"Women cinematographers have historically been kept from genre film, and it seems especially cruel that one of the rising stars who was able to break through had her life cut short on the kind of project we've been fighting for.\"\nThe American Film Institute Conservatory also paid tribute.\nHutchins was born in Ukraine in 1979 and grew up on a Soviet military base in the Arctic Circle.\nHer website said she spent her upbringing \"surrounded by reindeer and nuclear submarines\".\nShe entered the film industry after gaining a degree in international journalism from Kyiv State University. After working on documentaries in the UK, she moved to Los Angeles, where she graduated from the American Film Institute conservatory in 2015.\nShe began working her way up in Hollywood, with credits on films including Blindfire, which she described as a \"racially charged cop drama\" written and directed by Mike Nell.\nShe also worked on horror feature Darlin', directed by Pollyanna McIntosh, which debuted at the SXSW film festival 2019.\nAmerican Cinematographer, a monthly magazine published by the American Society of Cinematographers, interviewed Hutchins in 2019.\nShe explained to them why she moved from journalism to cinematography, saying: \"My transition from journalism began when I was working on British film productions in eastern Europe, travelling with crews to remote locations and seeing how the cinematographer worked.\n\"I was fascinated with storytelling based on real characters.\" \nHer early life as a self-described \"army brat\" meant she was \"already a movie fan because 'there wasn't that much to do outside'\", the magazine added.\nIt said she gained \"hands-on shooting experience from documenting her forays into such extreme sports as parachuting and cave exploration\".\nAfter her death, the magazine paid tribute to the film-maker, saying: \"We're deeply saddened by the news from Santa Fe regarding the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Safety on the set should always be of paramount concern to everyone, especially when working with firearms.\""

      "text": "Home Secretary Priti Patel has backed calls to change the law to give victims of domestic abuse more time to report a crime, the BBC has been told.\nThere is currently a six-month time limit for a charge to be brought against someone for common assault. \nBut Ms Patel has agreed to extend the timeframe to up to two years. \nIt comes after the BBC revealed 13,000 cases in England and Wales had been dropped in five years because the six month limit had been breached.\nThe change is expected to come as part of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament. \nCampaigners have said the move would be very welcome, but they are waiting to see an official announcement. \nCommon assault cases include things like a push, threatening words or being spat at and are normally dealt with at magistrates court.\nThe clock starts from the date of the incident, and within the next six months, a victim needs to have come forward and the police have to have carried out their work to secure a charge against the alleged perpetrator, or the case will be dropped. \nVictims of domestic common assault are sometimes reluctant to report incidents and the cases can be complex - which is why campaigners say the police should be given more time before having to bring charges.\nThe argument for the time limit was to keep the criminal justice system moving, especially when there is now such a backlog of cases to be heard following Covid. \nBut Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the number of incidents being \"timed out\" because of the six month factor was \"shocking\".\nThe BBC has been told this time limit will now be extended to two years, and there will be a renewed push to ensure police and prosecutors are alive to incidents of coercive control, which are often linked with incidents of domestic abuse.\nMs Cooper said the change would be \"excellent news\", adding: \"Making this simple and practical change would give domestic abuse victims more time to report assault and means stronger action to tackle violence against women and girls - something that is badly needed right now.\" \nThree-quarters of all domestic abuse cases - including sexual assaults - are closed early without the suspect being charged, according to a report by HM inspector of constabulary.\nAnd just 1.6% of rape allegations in England and Wales result in someone being charged - something the government has said it is \"deeply ashamed\" about.\nFigures obtained by the BBC using Freedom of Information from 30 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, revealed a huge increase in allegations of common assault involving domestic abuse - but a fall in the number of charges being brought.\nFrom 2016-17 to 2020-21 there were at least 12,982 cases of common assault that were flagged as involving domestic abuse in which no-one was charged due to the time limit.\nIn the same time period, the total number of common assaults flagged as instances of domestic abuse increased by 71% from 99,134 to 170,013.\nBut the number of these common assaults that resulted in charges being brought fell by 23%.\nA government spokesman said all allegations should be investigated and pursued where possible, and money had been invested into supporting victims of such crimes during the pandemic."
