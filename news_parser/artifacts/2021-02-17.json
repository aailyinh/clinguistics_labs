      "title": "Covid: Seven symptoms should trigger virus test, study says",
      "tags": "Coronavirus testing,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Researchers want the government to add fatigue, headache, sore throat and diarrhoea to the existing three symptoms which trigger a Covid test.\nCurrently, anyone with a cough, fever or loss of smell or taste qualifies.\nTesting for these additional symptoms could pick up 40% more cases, King's College London and the Zoe Symptom Study app have suggested. \nHowever, this would mean many more people who don't have the virus being tested.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"An expert scientific group keeps the symptoms of Covid-19 under review. \n\"The main symptoms have been carefully selected to capture those most likely to have Covid-19, while not capturing a great number of people who do not.\"\nThe Zoe team was the group to first identify loss of smell and taste as a symptom of Covid, leading to it being added to the official symptoms list.\nThey spotted this by looking at the symptoms reported by people using their Covid Symptom Study mobile app, who went on to test positive. \nBy analysing data from more than 120,000 adults logging potential symptoms on the app, of which 1,200 reported a positive test, the team identified seven common symptoms.\nThe classic three, any of which already qualify people for the more sensitive PCR test which is processed in a lab, are:\nAnd the further four already mentioned, including a sore throat and diarrhoea.\nAnyone reporting one of this wider group of symptoms was invited by Zoe to take a PCR test.\nWhile the seven symptoms suggested by the Zoe app may be features of early-stage Covid, they are also extremely common and may have many other causes.\nThe concern is that if everyone with a headache goes for a Covid test, it could overwhelm the system. \nGP Dr Margaret McCartney told BBC Radio 4's Inside Health programme that a \"pragmatic\" approach was needed, with those living in areas with high levels of the virus treating those wider symptoms with more suspicion than those in low-Covid areas.\nThe Zoe team does acknowledge the strategy would increase the number of people without the virus being tested - rising from 46 negative tests for every positive to 95 negatives for every case identified if the seven symptoms were used. \nBut Dr Claire Steves, lead scientist on the app, said, \"When PCR testing was scarcely available, it made sense to restrict it. \n\"Now in the UK we have plenty of tests available, thanks to so much effort by labs all over the country, and every positive person detected could save lives.\" \nProf Tim Spector, who is leading the project, said: \"We've known since the beginning that just focusing testing on the classic triad of cough, fever and anosmia [loss of smell] misses a significant proportion of cases.\n\"For us, the message for the public is clear: 'If you're feeling newly unwell, it could be Covid and you should get a test'.\"\nHe added that this was \"especially important\", since new variants could cause different symptoms. \nA study by the Office for National Statistics found a cough, fatigue, sore throat and muscle pain may be more common in people who tested positive for the UK variant of coronavirus.\nA DHSC spokesperson said: \"Anyone experiencing the main symptoms - a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or a loss or change to sense of smell or taste - should get a test as soon as possible, and immediately self-isolate along with their household.\"\nThose with no symptoms, or symptoms outside of those three, may be able to access rapid testing through their local council or their workplace.

      "tags": "Grenfell Tower fire,Grenfell Tower Inquiry",
      "text": "The boss of the company that made the Grenfell Tower cladding has said it was not his \"priority\" to understand fire safety tests and certificates. \nClaude Schmidt, president of Arconic, told the inquiry into the fire that he only learned about a key British fire safety standard after the disaster.\nIt also heard claims the French firm \"arranged\" for some fire tests to pass. \nArconic is being investigated for not informing a British standards board about failed tests.\nThe inquiry is looking into how Grenfell Tower came to be covered in combustible materials, leading to the fire killed 72 people in June 2017.\nArconic manufactured the cladding panels in France and the product was never put through the standard test widely used in the UK construction industry.\nMr Schmidt was asked by the inquiry's lead counsel Richard Millett QC why, when he became managing director in 2007, he did not \"seek to understand thoroughly the testing and certification which supported that product\". \nSpeaking in French through an interpreter, Mr Schmidt replied: \"Because it wasn't my priority\".\n\"This is to do with fire safety and life safety. Why wasn't it your priority?\" Mr Millett asked. \nMr Schmidt said he thought these words were \"a bit too strong\". \nThere are a number of ways that building materials can comply with regulations in order to be used on high-rise buildings.\nOne of them is meeting the British standard, known as Class 0. Though some sections of the government guidance on which standards are required for certain products are disputed.\nArconic was awarded a product certificate for its cladding in the UK by the British Board of Agr\u00e9ment (BBA) in 2008. \nThis said Arconic's Reynobond PE cladding panel \"may be regarded\" as having met the Class 0 standard. The UK building industry relied heavily on it.  \nAcross the country, and at Grenfell, cladding suppliers believed that if the cladding had a BBA certificate and was Class 0, it could be used on tall buildings.\nBut the inquiry heard on Tuesday that the standard British test had not, in fact, been carried out. The French arm of Arconic relied, instead, on European tests that were similar.  \nOn top of that, there were a series of issues with the tests which were done. \nSome versions of the panel, when it was shaped into \"cassettes\" or boxes, had \"failed spectacularly\", Mr Millett said.\nArconic did not tell the BBA, so the product certificate remained in use right up to the decision to use the cladding on Grenfell Tower. \nA statement from Claude Wehrle, a technical manager who worked for Arconic, said the company believed the test was a \"rogue result\", the inquiry heard.\nThe inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, asked Mr Schmidt to respond to the view that Arconic was \"irrational and irresponsible not to carry out further tests\".\nMr Schmidt said: \"Yes... extra tests should have been carried out.\"\nWhen another version of the cladding was put through the European test in 2005 it was given a Class B rating, on a scale where A1 is the best and F is the worst.  This meant it could be used on high-rise buildings.\nBut on Tuesday the inquiry was shown an email 11 years later in which Mr Wehrle said the Class B rating had been achieved \"by 'arranging' the system to pass\".\nMr Wehrle, a French national, has refused - despite repeated requests - to come to the inquiry to give evidence, because of legal advice he says he has received.\nWhen asked how Mr Wehrle might have \"arranged\" the system to pass, Mr Schmidt said: \"I don't have an answer.\"\nThe issue of which standards the Arconic cladding met, and what testing was done on it, is at the centre of this phase of the public inquiry - and is an important component of the Metropolitan Police investigation.  \nIt is also one of the factors behind the building safety crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of people across the country. \nImmediately after the fire, residents of the Chalcots Estate in Camden, North London had to leave their homes when the fire risk of Arconic Reynobond PE aluminium composite cladding was realised. \nArconic's position has always been that it simply produced the raw materials for cladding systems, and it didn't necessarily know how they would be used, so could not know that they might not meet building regulations.\nBut on Tuesday, Mr Schmidt was asked by Mr Millett about \"occasions when Arconic did understand what project the product would be used for.\"\nAsked whether Grenfell Tower was \"an example of that\", Mr Schmidt said: \"Yes.\""

      "text": "Vulnerable children must be at the heart of government plans to \"build back better\" after the pandemic, England's children's commissioner says.\nAnne Longfield called on Boris Johnson to put them at the \"centre stage\" of plans to \"level up\" the nation.\nIn a final speech after six years in the role, she said it was a \"terrible thing\" that \"most of their lives would have got worse\" during the pandemic.\nMinisters said protecting vulnerable children was central to its response.\nA spokesperson added: \"That's why we have enabled the most vulnerable children to continue attending school in person, while providing laptops, devices and data packages to those learning at home and ensuring the most disadvantaged children are fed and warm.\"\nIt comes after warnings that children may be \"losing all hope for their future\" and as surveys suggest young people's mental health is worsening, partly due to the fallout from Covid-19.\nMs Longfield said the prime minister's commitment to putting schools at the heart of reopening of society when lockdown eases was \"really welcome\".\n\"There have been points during the year where I was dismayed when schools stayed shut and shops and pubs opened but the prime minister's come behind what we were pushing for which was for the schools to be the last last to close and the first to open,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nShe estimated around \u00a310bn will be needed for children's mental health support and help for pupils in school to catch-up.\nMs Longfield said she believed Boris Johnson wants to \"build back better\" for children but did not think he has the \"structures in government around him\" to be able to do that.\nTory MP Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee, said the pandemic had \"laid bare the damning truth about our educational divide\". \nIn a response to Ms Longfield's speech, Mr Halfon said on Twitter that children were facing a \"torrid barrage of lost learning and a new frontier of vulnerabilities\". \nHe urged ministers to focus on the \"complex challenges that exist in some children's lives\", adding that the school closures could reverse the progress made since 2011.\nMs Longfield said her departing address aimed to set out a \"challenge to government and all political parties\".\nAn entire generation risks being defined by the coronavirus crisis and some children may start school so far behind their peers \"they'll never catch up\", she said.\nBut she said while the pandemic meant the country was facing the \"biggest challenge to our society in 70 years, it is also an opportunity to reflect and rebuild\".\nMs Longfield suggested the \u00a31.5bn so far committed to a pupil catch-up fund\u00a0for England was a demonstration of the Treasury's \"institutional bias against children\" - when compared with a research group's estimate that children are facing up to \u00a3350bn in lost earnings as a result of school closures.\u00a0\nShe highlighted US President Joe Biden's new package of tax credits and benefits for families with children as an example of the type of action the government could take.\nMr Johnson's promise to \"level up\" the country will be \"just a slogan\" unless children are at the heart of the effort, she added.\nMs Longfield said ministers had focused too much on school improvements \"without recognising that many of the outcomes for the children attending the schools are overall getting worse\".\nCalling for a new \"Covid Covenant\" of education and well-being support in every community, she said school holidays should be used to catch children up with lost lessons.\nThe children's commissioner said is a \"national scandal\" the fact almost a fifth of children in England leave school or college without basic qualifications.\nAnd highlighting the case of a 16-year-old who died after being coerced into drug trafficking, she said children exploited by gangs are being failed by adults who \"simply don't see them\".\nA government spokesman said its long-term catch-up plans would combine with an investment of more than \u00a31bn to \"ensure we make up for lost time in education over the course of this Parliament\".\nHe added: \"Anne Longfield has been a tireless advocate for children, and we're grateful for her dedication and her challenge on areas where we can continue raising the bar for the most vulnerable.\"\nDame Rachel de Souza, a former chief executive of a multi-academy trust, will take over as the new children's commissioner for England in March."

      "tags": "Climate change,Environment,Philip Dunne,Environmental Audit Select Committee",
      "text": "MPs are complaining that the Treasury is set to claw back money from a mismanaged government scheme to help people insulate their homes.\nThe Green Homes Grant scheme is in such chaos that a huge majority of its \u00a31.5bn budget for this year is unspent. \nThe government has said it will pocket that money, rather than rolling it over to next year\u2019s \u00a3320m fund.\nBut the Environmental Audit Committee says that would be a \u201cdeeply retrograde step\u201d.\nConservative MP Philip Dunne, who chairs the committee, told the BBC: \u201cWe need a long-term commitment to helping people insulate their homes \u2013 at the very least until the end of this Parliament.\n\u201cWe (Conservatives) promised \u00a39.2bn for energy efficiency in our manifesto \u2013 and we have to deliver that or we won\u2019t reach our climate change targets.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s advisory Climate Change Committee says even more - \u00a32bn of public money a year - is needed until 2030. \nThe current green homes programme has been heavily criticised, with householders unable to get quotes from registered contractors and the firms unable to get paid.\nIn a parliamentary answer on Tuesday, the government confirmed only \u00a394.1m of the \u00a31.5bn allocated for homes in England until April has so far been spent. \nMr Dunne said: \u201cThe Green Homes Grant scheme is a good idea but its implementation has been woeful.\"\nHe said the scheme designed to create jobs and improve energy efficiency had turned into a \u201cjob destruction\u201d scheme because so many builders laid off their workers when government payments didn't come through. \nMr Dunne said the project had been devised with too much bureaucracy because Treasury officials didn\u2019t want a repeat of Northern Ireland's Northern Ireland's \"cash for ash\" renewable heat scheme, where millions of pounds were lost because rules were badly devised. \nAs a result of the red tape, he said, small builders in the Federation of Master Builders were reluctant to apply for accreditation. \nMr Dunne said out of 7,400 members of the federation, only three had been accredited.\nMr Dunne\u2019s committee says the government needs to invest heavily in carbon-cutting measures as part of the its response to Covid-19. \nIn a report, it has urged the government to create \u201cgreen\u201d jobs by investing in areas such as energy efficiency, nature recovery and adaptation to a heating climate. \nIt wants the government to:\nMr Dunne said: \u201cThe Covid-19 crisis must be treated as a wake-up call - it is a symptom of a growing ecological emergency. \n\u201cA tax system fit for net-zero Britain is key. It will encourage innovation, give confidence to the sector and support companies to make the low-carbon transition.\u201d\nThe MPs also say ministers should also set targets for the huge amounts of carbon generated to make steel and cement for new buildings. \nThis idea is gaining traction, because it would increase the use in construction of wood products that have soaked up CO2. \nWill Hurst from the Architects' Journal said: \"For far too long we have ignored the carbon footprints of (constructing) buildings, worrying only about their energy efficiency once built. \n\"Regulations actually encourage this state of affairs. The VAT system perversely incentivises wasteful demolition and rebuild while upfront or \u2018embodied\u2019 carbon emissions in construction are largely ignored in planning policy.\"\nCaterina Brandmayr from the think tank Green Alliance said: \u201cThe report rightly puts the spotlight on what the government still needs to do to deliver a green recovery. \n\u201cFront-loading investment in climate solutions, nature and the circular economy, and ensuring recovery plans are consistent with climate and environmental goals must be a priority. This will help create jobs, and benefit businesses and communities across the country.\u201d\nA government spokesman said the Treasury was examining ways to fund the UK's transition to net zero emissions and ministers were \"committed to building back better and greener from the pandemic\".\nThe prime minister's recently announced 10-point climate change plan will \"put the UK at the forefront of the global green industrial revolution and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs,\" the spokesman added.\n\"We continue to bring forward bold measures to cut emissions, with plans to invest \u00a39bn in improving the energy efficiency of buildings forming part of our wider commitment to end our contribution to climate change by 2050.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

That test resulted in a class E rating as the cladding caught fire.\nWhen Arconic applied to the BBA for the certificate, the inquiry heard, it sent the results of the first test, but not the second, despite being asked to provide more evidence.\nThe folded design was later chosen by designers for use on Grenfell Tower.\nThe inquiry's lead counsel, Richard Millett QC, put it to Claude Schmidt that Arconic had a contractual requirement to provide all relevant information upfront.\nMr Millett said the company had concealed the class E test, in which the cladding \"performed disastrously\" - which might have \"substantially affected sales of the product in the UK\".\nSpeaking in French through an interpreter, Mr Schmidt said: \"I don't know why at the start that test wasn't mentioned... but it could have been found out, discovered in an audit.\"\nMr Millet asked if Mr Schmidt accepted that Arconic \"was telling the BBA a misleading half-truth\".\n\"Yes, you can see it like that,\" Mr Schmidt replied.\nMr Schmidt accepted Mr Millett's suggestion that any user of Arconic's product would see the test result as \"absolutely crucial safety information\".\nBut Arconic's president said it was \"too strong\" to describe the information as \" life-and-death stuff\".\nDocuments presented to the inquiry show that negotiations with the BBA were led by a technical manager, Claude Wehrle.\nMr Schmidt said: \"I can't know what Claude Wehrle was thinking about or reasoning at the time.\"\nMr Wehrle, a French national, has refused - despite repeated requests - to come to the inquiry to give evidence, because of legal advice he says he has received.\nThe inquiry has the power to force British witnesses to give evidence, but not foreign nationals.\nThe issue of which standards the Arconic cladding met, and what testing was done on it, is at the centre of this phase of the public inquiry - and is an important component of the Metropolitan Police investigation.\nIt is also one of the factors behind the building safety crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of people across the country.\nImmediately after the fire, residents of the Chalcots Estate in Camden, north London, had to leave their homes when the fire risk of Arconic Reynobond PE aluminium composite cladding was realised.\nArconic's position has always been that it simply produced the raw materials for cladding systems, and it didn't necessarily know how they would be used, so could not know that they might not meet building regulations.\nBut on Tuesday, Mr Schmidt was asked by Mr Millett about \"occasions when Arconic did understand what project the product would be used for\".\nAsked whether Grenfell Tower was \"an example of that\", Mr Schmidt said: \"Yes.\"\nThe inquiry continues."

      "tags": "Nottingham,Banksy",
      "text": "A Banksy artwork has been removed from the side of a building in Nottingham and sold to a collector.\nThe mural, which depicts a girl hula-hooping with a bicycle tyre, appeared on a residential street in October.\nThe \"slab of brick\" was seen being cut from the wall in Rothesay Avenue from about 05:00 GMT.\nGallery owner John Brandler told the BBC he paid a \"six-figure sum\" for the piece, and wanted to help preserve it, as well as put it on display.\nResident Dan Golstein said workmen were \"drilling into the wall\" in the early hours. The artwork was then seen being loaded into the back of a van.\nMr Brandler said the workers were part of a \"very specialised company\" which had removed Banksy art before.\nHe added he is now sending it to Scotland to be restored.\nThe collector owns a number of the elusive artist's pieces, including Seasons Greetings, which he bought from a garage in Port Talbot in 2019.\nHe claimed he had saved the Nottingham artwork \"in time\" before damp could cause damage under the plastic cover put on by Nottingham City Council.\n\"If you put Perspex over a picture the moisture gets into the brick wall and can't escape - the wall needs to breathe,\" he said. \n\"If I hadn't bought it and removed it, in two years' time there wouldn't have been a Banksy there at all.\"\nMr Brandler said he planned to feature the piece in a street exhibition later this year at the Moyse's Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.\nBut he added: \"Work with me and it would be lovely to bring the whole show back [to Nottingham].\"\nCity rejuvenation board The Nottingham Project said they had been in touch with Banksy's team - Pest Control - since the mural appeared, and they believed its removal would go against his wishes.\nA spokesman said they had sought Banksy's approval to move the piece to a different location in the city. \nHe said: \"They responded asking for the artwork to remain, so we respected the artist's wishes.\"\n\"Whilst we respect that this was a private decision for the landlord, we think it's a great shame that Nottingham has lost its Banksy and we hope this doesn't stop the artist coming back to the city in the future,\" he added.\nIn art world terms, this would be described as a site specific work, meaning Banksy specifically chose that location for that work and that's what made it successful.\nDon't forget Nottingham's relationship with bicycles and bicycle making, with Raleigh the most famous of many firms. And Banksy would have been aware of all this.\nIt was intended to be there, enjoyed by people, to be a social comment - it wasn't Banksy's intention that it be chipped off the wall and taken somewhere else.\nHe does accept it's part of what happens to his work - others have been whitewashed and had graffiti put all over them so they're no longer visible.\nBut my own view is the work is substantially diminished by removing it because the work was so site specific, because it was responding to the bike on the lamp-post, because it was responding to the history of Nottingham, it worked so well in that spot.\nWhen you remove it, it is diminished, it doesn't say the same things, and I think it is worth less. Not worthless, but worth less.\nA Nottingham City Council spokesman said the authority had tried to secure the work for the city but \"those options were exhausted\" and so it was left to the property owner to decide what to do next.\nBut he said the council had been unaware of the plans to move it. \nSurinder Kaur, who leases the building, said: \"I didn't know anything about this - no-one has informed me. I'm shocked now at what's going on.\" \nThe Nottingham Post reported the owner, who wanted to remain anonymous, had tried to \"donate\" the artwork and said \"substantial discussions\" had taken place with a number of local organisations, charities and national bodies, which ended unsuccessfully.\nAccording to the newspaper, they said: \"Since we were unable to donate the artwork itself, we'll be donating the proceeds privately instead.\"\nThe BBC has attempted to make contact with the building's owner.\nThe hula-hooping girl first appeared on the building, at the junction of Rothesay Avenue and Ilkeston Road, on 13 October.\nA few days later it was claimed by the artist via his Instagram account, and people flocked to have their picture taken next to it.\nMany local residents have expressed their disappointment at the mural's removal.\nJasinya Powell, 39, said: \"It's capitalism at its finest - it's all about the Benjamins [money] at the end of the day.\n\"At least we got a taste of it. \n\"It got people talking about Raleigh, about Nottingham, about what the city has produced and done.\"\nAlex Mitchell-Messam, 32, saw the artwork being put up covertly just a few yards away from his shop.\nHe said people were still visiting to take photos of it until yesterday.\n\"It's sad to see it's leaving,\" he said. \"I think it should stay in the area it was put in.\n\"Banksy travelled to Nottingham, he chose to put that artwork here when he could have chosen anywhere. \n\"It was great, bringing new faces to the area and having a vibrant effect.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

      "text": "UK house prices climbed 8.5% in 2020, the highest annual growth rate since October 2014, according to official figures.\nThe average UK house price reached a record high of \u00a3252,000 in December 2020, the Office for National Statistics said.\nThe North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%.\nThe stamp duty holiday due to end this March contributed to the rise, the ONS said.\nSpending more time at home in the pandemic meant some people also decided they needed more space.\nThat was reflected in the average price of detached properties climbing by twice as much as flats and maisonettes during 2020, up 10% and 5% respectively.\nMeanwhile Wales experienced the fastest price growth, with property values rising 10.7% to \u00a3184,000.\nIn England, prices climbed 8.5% to \u00a3269,000, in Scotland, 8.4% to \u00a3163,000 and in Northern Ireland 5.3% to \u00a3148,000.\n\"Recent price increases may reflect a range of factors including pent-up demand, some possible changes in housing preferences since the pandemic and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations,\" the ONS said.\nThe UK housing market is made up of lots of local markets, with different factors affecting property prices such as the performance of schools and the availability of jobs. The ONS figures are based on sale completions.\nAlthough average London prices were up by 3.5%, over last year, prices fell in the capital by \u00a35,000 between November and December, despite a UK-wide price increase of 1.2% over the month.\nBut the city still has the highest average house price in the UK, at \u00a3496,000.\nThe North East continued to have the lowest average house price at \u00a3141,000, and has become the final English region to surpass its pre-economic downturn peak of July 2007.\n\"2020 was the year that fundamentals came home to roost,\" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country. \n\"There was no escaping a lack of space for households who suddenly found they were living on top of each other with little respite. That has powered annual growth that reached a six-year high.\"\nThere were four major drivers of overall house price rises in 2020, said Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital.\n\"The temporary stamp duty reduction and cheap debt as a result of very low interest rates, which give buyers a 'discount'; the release of pent-up supply and demand and desire to improve surroundings amongst existing homeowners; and the 'flight to safety', since in times of uncertainty, people want to keep their money in a stable asset with low volatility.\n\"But looking to the future when the temporary stamp duty reduction ends, we're likely to see a slowdown in house price rises,\" she said.\n\"However, there is still some life in the market as lockdown helps to concentrate many potential buyers and sellers' minds as far as moving is concerned,\" said north London estate agent Jeremy Leaf. \n\"Intense speculation remains as to whether the 31 March stamp duty deadline will be extended and we can't help but have sympathy for many who have started the process several months ago who have been unavoidably delayed by a backlog in searches, surveys, conveyancing, or all three, to say nothing of problems in the new-build industry.\""

      "text": "An actress sacked over a Facebook post attacking homosexuality has had her claim for discrimination, breach of contract and harassment rejected.\nSeyi Omooba, 26, sued Leicester's Curve Theatre and her former agents for \u00a3128,000 after being dropped from a stage performance of The Color Purple.\nShe had been due to play the lead character Celie, sometimes depicted as being in a lesbian relationship.\nBut she was dismissed when a Facebook post she wrote in 2014 emerged.\nThe post was shared on social media by another actor unconnected to the play a few days after she was announced as being part of the cast in March 2019.\nThe entry, written when the Christian actress was 20, said: \"I do not believe you can be born gay, and I do not believe homosexuality is right, though the law of this land has made it legal doesn't mean its right.\"\nThe virtual hearing of the Central London Employment Tribunal heard it sparked a social media backlash and she was sacked by Leicester Theatre Trust Ltd six days later following discussions in which Ms Omooba stood by her views.\nThree days later her contract with her agency Michael Garrett Associates Ltd (Global Artists) was also terminated. \nThe panel was told she had been \"unconditionally\" offered her full salary for the role by the theatre but refused to invoice the trust, instead bringing legal action on the grounds she had suffered extensive career damage for espousing her religious beliefs.\nAt the tribunal she sought \u00a34,309 from the theatre plus a further \u00a325,000 for injury to feelings and reputational damage.\nShe also sued her former agency \u00a398,752 for loss of earnings, future losses, injury to feelings and reputational damage.\nHowever, Ms Omooba's claims of discrimination, harassment and breach of contract were rejected by the tribunal panel.\nThe panel dismissed her suggestion that her sacking by the theatre amounted to discrimination against her religious beliefs.\nIn a written judgement, it concluded it was \"the effect of the adverse publicity from [the 2014 post's] retweet, without modification or explanation, on the cohesion of the cast, the audience's reception, the reputation of the producers and 'the good standing and commercial success' of the production, that were the reasons why she was dismissed\".\nOn the harassment claim, it said: \"In the view of the tribunal Mr Stafford [Chris Stafford, chief executive of Leicester Theatre Trust] did not have the purpose of violating the claimant's dignity or creating an intimidating or humiliating environment for her. His purpose was to save the production.\"\nMiss Omooba had claimed the character's sexuality was ambiguous and she would have refused the role if she had considered her gay.\nBut this was rejected by the panel, with the panel commenting: \"She had taken part in a similar production, she had the script, and knowing that a lesbian relationship was at least one interpretation, she should have considered much earlier whether a red line was to be crossed.\"\nThe panel also rejected Ms Omooba's demands for compensation for loss of earnings, future losses and reputational damage as a result of her agency contract being terminated. \n\"There is no financial loss because she would not have played the part,\" it said.\n\"There is no loss of opportunity to enhance her reputation by performing, because she would not have played the part.\n\"If there is damage to her reputation, it was not caused by being dropped from the production but by an unconnected person's tweeting... of her Facebook post and the outcry resulting from that.\"\nMs Omooba's case had been supported by the legal arm of Christian Concern, an organisation co-founded by her father, pastor Ade Omooba MBE.\nAndrea Williams, the group's chief executive, said: \"We're disappointed by the judgement and Seyi is considering her options for appeal.\"\nCurve Theatre's management team said it was pleased with the outcome following a \"hugely challenging and upsetting time\".\nIn a statement, it said: \"Seyi Omooba accepted a lesbian part in our production of The Color Purple knowing full well she would refuse to play this iconic gay role as homosexual.\n\"We believe the case had no merit from the outset and should never have been brought to the tribunal.\n\"We now look forward to drawing a line under this painful chapter and focusing our energies on how we rebuild our theatre after the pandemic.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "text": "Captain Sir Tom Moore's family shielded him from \"pretty horrific\" internet trolling that would have \"broken his heart\", his daughter said.\nThe 100-year-old Army veteran, who raised almost \u00a333m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died in Bedford Hospital on 2 February.\nHannah Ingram-Moore said they had faced some \"outrageous negativity\" after a trip to Barbados in December.\nBut she said her father left an \"incredible legacy\".\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Mrs Ingram-Moore said Capt Sir Tom's death had left a \"deafening silence\".\nHe had been determined to continue raising funds, his daughter said, and was \"really excited about coming out for steak and chips and getting his frame back outside\".\nShe spoke about some of the \"trolling\" the family received over the past year, which culminated after the family holiday to Barbados.\n\"That trip to the Caribbean was a holiday of a lifetime for him. He sat outside in 29 degrees, in shorts, short-sleeve shirts and sandals,\" she said.\nHe read novels, the newspapers, ate fish on the beach and talked with his family.\nShe said they were \"all so pleased we could give him that\".\nHowever, the trip caused further backlash.\n\"I think we accept that whatever we do somebody won't like it and there was outrageous negativity and yet we realised we had to shelter him from that,\" she said.\n\"It came in its thickest and fastest when we were already realising he was not very well and that's what triggered it. It felt so grossly unfair. \n\"What do you do with it, though? We had to put it away and say those people who say those terrible things they have no idea how hurtful they are being obviously otherwise they wouldn't do it. \n\"They have no idea what we are going through as a family and so we shut it away but it just added a little more pain to the pain that we were going through.\"\nDespite the criticism, the family said they focused on the \"massive majority of people who we connect with\" rather than a \"vile minority\".\nShe added: \"We never told him because I don't think he could have ever understood it. I think it would have broken his heart honestly if we'd said to him people are hating us.\"\nCapt Sir Tom had tested positive for Covid-19 the week before he was admitted to hospital.\nHis family said due to other medication he was receiving for pneumonia, he was unable to be vaccinated.\nMrs Ingram-Moore said: \"I think that when he went into hospital we really all believed he'd come back out. \n\"We thought the oxygen would help, that he would be robust enough - the truth is, he just wasn't.\"\nHe was \"old and he just couldn't fight it\", she said.\nShe spoke emotionally about the impact Capt Sir Tom had had on the family's life when he moved in to their Marston Moretaine home in Bedfordshire in 2007.\n\"We've lost a huge part of our life,\" she said.\n\"He'd been with us for over 13 years and it's the deafening silence - that's the way I can describe it.\"\nShe described him as \"everything - he was the noise, he was the reason almost everything we've done together in the last 13 years as a family has centred around what he needed, because his needs were different\".\nHowever, she said her father would not have wanted the family to grieve and he himself had remained positive to the end.\n\"He was really excited about coming out for steak and chips and getting his frame back outside and his walker, and so the last real conversation was positive and about carrying on, and that's a lovely place to be,\" she said.\n\"I can honestly say the thing he was so proud of - it just oozed out of him - [was] 'I'm coming back out, there's more fundraising in me yet. There's more walking in me yet.'\"\nHis fighting spirit and positivity would be his legacy that would live on, she said.\nShe spoke of his pride in the charitable foundation set up in his name after he had completed his fundraising walk which, after Gift Aid, raised a total of \u00a339m.\n\"What a legacy\u2026a legacy that he could never have imagined that he was going to leave until his last year of life. \n\"He was so proud and he wasn't a man to articulate pride,\" she said.\n\"He really believed - and we really believe - it can make a tremendous, positive difference.\"\nShe said the \"outpouring of love and condolence\" from around the world since his death was announced had been \"simply amazing\".\n\"Yes, it's incredibly sad, but his legacy is hope and his legacy is positivity.\"\nShe also spoke of his pride at meeting the Queen when he was awarded a knighthood in July - his \"standout\" moment of a remarkable year.\n\"Alongside so many incredible things, it seems a little harsh on all the other things, but there is only one, and that was meeting the Queen,\" said Mrs Ingram-Moore.\n\"And she said thank you, and recognised what the family had done. We can never undo that, nothing can ever undo that.\"\nThe Queen led tributes to Capt Sir Tom when his death was announced.\n\"We had a lovely letter from her and I think she felt genuine loss - it's another one of her generation,\" Mrs Ingram-Moore said.\nMrs Ingram-Moore said her father and the family had discussed his funeral last year.\n\"I said 'I think your idea of the cardboard coffin and using the cheapest funeral that you could, is probably not going to cut it.'\n\"It was quite emotional for him because I think he was just overjoyed that we were asking, and we wanted him to tell us exactly what he wanted.\n\"We have a very clear directive from him about what that last day will look like - and how it should go - right down to the sandwiches.\"\nThe details have not yet been released but she said they would be \"making sure that those final moments for him are exactly what he wanted\".\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "Self-isolation is costing people who do not qualify for financial support hundreds of pounds in lost income.\nMost applications to Wales' \u00a3500 self-isolation grant scheme have been rejected.\nThe Welsh Government announced on Wednesday it is expanding the scheme to make more people eligible.\nTracy Moore, from Flintshire, saw her household income fall about \u00a3700 last month, and told BBC Wales Live the way the support system worked was \"wrong\".\nSince the coronavirus self-isolation support programme opened in November, 27,209 applications have been made in Wales.\nOf those, 8,421 were approved, 15,772 rejected and 3,016 had a decision pending as of 2 February.\nThe Welsh Government said feedback from councils suggested rejected applications were mainly due to individuals being ineligible or not providing the necessary evidence.\nUnder the existing system, applicants must stand to lose income by isolating, and be on at least one of a range of benefits.\nThe government is now expanding the scheme to include people not on any benefits but with a personal income of less than \u00a3500 net per week or on basic statutory sick pay.\nMinisters said the changes would make an additional 170,000 people potentially eligible for the grant, with the scheme extended to June. The new rules will not be backdated. \nMs Moore, from Holywell, saw her household income drop by about \u00a3700 when her husband Jason and son isolated last month.\nThey work for a Tarmac company and shared their van with someone who tested positive the following day. They called 111 and were advised to isolate for 10 days.\nBut when they tried to apply for financial help they were told they were not eligible as they had not formally been asked to isolate by Test, Trace, Protect. Another 111 call handler later said they should not have been told to isolate.\nMs Moore is disabled and does not work, so the household income took a hit.\n\"The bills have all been paid but it was not very nice. The way the system works is disgusting and wrong,\" she said.\nLynette Jackson, from Wrexham, lost about \u00a3400 when she isolated in the run-up to Christmas after a colleague at her factory tested positive.\nWhen she applied for a discretionary payment she was told she was too late as 17 days had passed since her isolation ended.\n\"I did what I was meant to do. I think people will stop doing it if they're losing money,\" she said.\n\"I would only isolate again in the future if I'm ill, I can't afford to do it again.\"\nOne self-employed woman from Cardiff said she would not qualify for the grant so is avoiding getting tested and will ignore calls from contact tracers.\n\"I've done everything to avoid being told to isolate,\" she added.\n\"If it's a choice between paying rent and bills vs self-isolating I'm going to pay the bills.\"\nBut Helen Harris, from Newport, did receive the payment and said it was a \"such a relief\", with her baby Arwen currently in hospital for heart treatment.\nHelen is on maternity leave and her husband Andrew lost about \u00a3700 when they had to isolate.\n\"I've been completely worried anyway... and then obviously we had the financial worries about if we could keep the house, if we could pay the bills,\" she said.\n\"It's just a massive weight off our mind, it's just something we don't have to worry about because it means that the money's now there for us to pay the bills that we need.\"\nMs Harris said she felt for people who are not given the grant.\n\"The government should definitely be supporting people because people are struggling with mental health and everything, they need to know they can pay their bills,\" she added.\nA Swansea University study of people asked to self-isolate in Wales found more than a quarter of those surveyed said it negatively affected their income.\nLocal government minister Julie James said feedback from councils showed the scheme was working well, but lack of income was still being reported as a barrier for self-isolating.\n\"Self-isolation is key if we are to stop the spread of coronavirus and with more community testing programmes planned in the coming months it is vital we enhance the scheme to help more people self-isolate and receive the financial support they need,\" she said.\nPlaid Cymru's shadow minister for finance and health, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said: \"Self-isolation remains a vital part of stopping the spread of coronavirus, and fear of financial hardship is one of the barriers to effective self-isolation. \n\"If support isn't sufficient, and isn't reaching the right people, our efforts to tackle the pandemic suffer.\"\nHe called for the payment to be brought up to \u00a3800 and said it will be an \"important step\" in tackling the virus as we come out of lockdown.\nThe pandemic has had a huge impact on people's day-to-day lives in Wales, with mental health problems worsening across different age groups in the past year. \nIn adults, the proportion of individuals showing symptoms of depression has almost doubled since the start of the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics says.\nAnd Covid-19 has had a \"crushing impact\" on the lives of children and young people, according to the Children's Commissioner for Wales. \nHave you or a loved one suffered a mental health problem during the pandemic?

      "text": "China is now the EU's biggest trading partner, overtaking the US in 2020. \nChina bucked a wider trend, as trade with most of Europe's major partners dipped due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \nTrade between China and the EU was worth $709bn (\u20ac586bn, \u00a3511bn) last year, compared with $671bn worth of imports and exports from the US.\nAlthough China's economy cratered in the first quarter due to the pandemic, its economic recovery later in the year fuelled demand for EU goods. \nChina was the only major global economy to see growth in 2020, stoking demand for European cars and luxury goods.  \nMeanwhile, China's exports to Europe benefited from strong demand for medical equipment and electronics.  \n\"In the year 2020, China was the main partner for the EU. This result was due to an increase of imports (+5.6%) and exports (+2.2%),\" according to Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.\nThe figures were similar to China's official data published in January, which showed trade with the EU grew by 5.3% to $696.4bn in 2020.\nThe EU's trade deficit with China also grew from $199bn to $219bn according to Eurostat figures, which were released on Monday.  \nAlthough the US and the UK remain the EU's largest export markets, trade with both countries dropped significantly, the statistics showed. \n\"Trade with the United States recorded a significant drop in both imports (-13.2%) and exports (-8.2%),\" the data agency said. \nTransatlantic trade has been hit by a series of tit-for-tat disputes that have resulted in tariffs on steel and products such as French Cognac or American Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\nIn 2020, the US had a trade volume of $671bn with the EU, down from $746bn the previous year. \nIt's not year clear if new US President Joe Biden will re-evaluate the US approach to trade with Europe.   \nThe EU and China, however, are trying to deepen their economic ties, with both sides seeking to ratify an investment deal that would give European companies better access to the Chinese market.\nAnalysts are tipping global trade to turn around in 2021 after a lacklustre 2020. \nThe real value of global trade is set to rise by 7.6% after an an estimated contraction of 13.5% in 2020 to $16.4tn, according to research firm IHS Markit.

      "tags": "Princess Latifa,United Arab Emirates,Dubai",
      "text": "The United Nations has said it will raise the detention of Princess Latifa, the daughter of Dubai's ruler, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nPrincess Latifa has accused her father of holding her hostage in Dubai since she tried to flee the city in 2018.\nIn secretly recorded videos shared with the BBC, Princess Latifa said she feared for her life.\nThe footage prompted global calls for a UN investigation, while the UK said the videos were \"deeply troubling\".\n\"We are concerned about it,\" UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Wednesday.\nHe said the videos showed \"a young woman in deep distress\", adding that the UK would watch any developments from the UN \"very closely\".\nBut when asked whether sanctions could be imposed, Mr Raab said: \"It's not clear to me that there would be the evidence to support that.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson also said the government was \"concerned\" but would \"wait and see how [the UN] get on\" with their investigation.\nThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has said it would soon question the UAE about Princess Latifa.\n\"We will certainly raise these new developments with the UAE,\" spokesman Rupert Colville said. \"Other parts of the UN human rights system with relevant mandates may also become involved once they have analysed the new material\".\nMeanwhile, a spokesman said the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention could launch an investigation once Princess Latifa's videos have been analysed.\n\"We are hoping [a UN investigation] will be decisive in finally getting Princess Latifa released,\" Rodney Dixon, a lawyer who presented the case to the UN, told the BBC.\n\"The UN needs to have a very serious meeting directly with those who are holding [her] and make sure an agreement is reached so she can be released,\" he said.\nMr Dixon added: \"The UN as the international body responsible for implementing international law can ensure that is exactly what happens.\"\nPrincess Latifa's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is one of the richest heads of state in the world, the ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the UAE.\nThe UAE has close relations with a number of Western countries, including the US and UK, which consider it a strategic ally.\nSheikh Mohammed has built a hugely successful city but rights activists say there is no tolerance of dissent and the judicial system can discriminate against women.\nWith the help of friends, Princess Latifa tried to flee Dubai to start a new life in February 2018.\n\"I'm not allowed to drive, I'm not allowed to travel or leave Dubai at all,\" she said in a video recorded just before her escape.\nBut days later, the princess was captured by commandos on a boat in the Indian Ocean. She was flown back to Dubai, where she has remained ever since.\nHer father said he was acting in her best interests. Dubai and the UAE have previously said Princess Latifa was safe in the care of family.\nAshitha Nagesh, BBC News\nWomen in the UAE are allowed to drive, vote, work, and own and inherit property, making the country the second-best in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) for gender equality, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF).\nBut, to put this in context, the Mena region had the lowest score of all the regions. The UAE was ranked 120th in the world out of 153.\nThere are still aspects of a woman's personal life in the country that are controlled by a male \"guardian\" - often a spouse or other male relative. Although the UAE isn't as strict as neighbouring Saudi Arabia, women still need their guardian's permission in order to get married. Divorce is also much harder for women; men don't need permission but women have to apply for a court order. And while the UAE does have an anti-discrimination law, sex and gender aren't included in its protected categories.\nSome laws have changed in the last few years, at least on the surface. An explicit permission for domestic violence was removed from the penal code in 2016. The requirement in the personal status law for women to \"obey\" their husbands was revoked in 2019, and the law was amended to make its language more gender-neutral. And last March a new law allowing women access to protection orders - such as restraining orders - came into effect.\nHowever, the new law defines domestic violence as abuse or threats that \"exceed [an individual's] guardianship, jurisdiction, authority or responsibility\", meaning it's ultimately down to judges to decide whether men have gone beyond their \"authority\" or not. In practice, protections for abuse victims are still weak.\nSheikh Mohammed has a vast horse-racing enterprise and frequently attends major events such as Royal Ascot, where he has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth II.\nBut he has faced severe criticism over the treatment of Princess Latifa and her stepmother, Princess Haya Bint Al Hussain, who fled to London in 2019 with her two children.\n\"There are no charges. It's pure punishment,\" Matthew Hedges, the British academic jailed for spying in the UAE in 2018, told the BBC when asked about the Princess Latifa case.\n\"There's no one looking out for her. It brings [my experiences] back quite dramatically,\" he added.\nPrincess Latifa's videos were obtained by BBC Panorama, which has independently verified the details of where she was held.\nWatch the Missing Princess on BBC iPlayer\nThe videos were recorded over several months on a phone she was secretly given about a year after her capture and return to Dubai. She recorded them in a bathroom as it had the only door she could lock.\nIn the messages, she detailed how:\nPrincess Latifa's account of her capture and detention was revealed by her close friend Tiina Jauhiainen, maternal cousin Marcus Essabri and campaigner David Haigh, who are all behind the Free Latifa campaign.\nThey said they released the messages out of concern for Princess Latifa's safety."

      "text": "A brewery boss who is in hospital with Covid has called for pubs to only reopen when safe to fully serve people.\nSimon Buckley, chairman of the Brewers of Wales, said he had been at \"death's door\" but was now \"on the mend\" at Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen.\nHe said pubs must only reopen when it was \"the right time\" and rules could be properly enforced.\nA revised plan out of Wales' lockdown, which began in December, is expected in the next few days.\nBefore Christmas, pubs, bars and restaurants across Wales were forced to close as \"stay at home\" lockdown measures were introduced, leaving them able to only sell takeaways.\nThere have been repeated warnings from the sector about the impact of Covid restrictions on the hospitality and tourism industry, with Brains pubs being taken over after the company came under \"significant financial pressure\".\nMr Buckley, the owner of Evans-Evans Brewery in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, said while the industry was now desperate to reopen, it should only happen when customers felt safe.\n\"We have written off tens and tens of thousands of pounds worth of stock because of stop- start... everybody wants a safe environment, but if we are having rules, lets have rules which are enforced,\" he said.\n\"We have to get the pubs open but we have to do it at the time and in a place and in a way that makes sense for our consumers.\"\nMr Buckley spoke as the chairman of JD Wetherspoons said pubs should reopen at the same time as non-essential shops.\nSpeaking on the Jason Mohammad show on BBC Radio Wales, Mr Buckley, who has been in hospital for 13 weeks, said he previously thought he was a \"superhero\" and immune from Covid.\nHe said that if pubs were to reopen any time soon, scenes like that in Cardiff city centre in September, where people crowded outside bars and clubs, must not be allowed to happen again.\n\"I've just been very very lucky... there are people who every day have risked their own life when they were sorting me out,\" he said.\n\"People need to understand this is not a joke... and I for one was brazen, I was bold enough to think that I wouldn't get it, I was Mr superhero.\n\"I was at death's door... had it not been for the nursing staff, the chairman of the Brewers of Wales would not be talking to you today, about rolling out our industry and saving it for the future.\"\nMr Buckley said the industry had measures in place to keep the public and staff safe and could be reopened successfully, but if people behaved irresponsibly, it could \"give us huge problems\".\nSince the start of the pandemic, businesses have been closed and reopened as lockdown rules changed, with measures introduced including alcohol bans and early closing times.\nWhile the Welsh Government is yet to set out any moves to ease current restrictions, its guidance for alert levels suggests that pubs, bars and restaurants would be allowed to reopen, but initially alcohol sales will be banned and they will have to close at 18:00.\nEven at alert level one - the lowest level of restrictions, when cases are at their lowest - they would have to stop serving at 22:00.\nSpeaking from the hospital, Mr Buckley said the sector must not be placed in a position again where pubs were told to open and then forced to close again, leading to thousands of pounds of food and drink being thrown away.\n\"What we would ask for is no limited opening hours, no limits on the offer we can make, it's open properly, let us do what we are good at,\" he said.\n\"We have to make sure that it is not stop-start, we have to make sure that when we go, we go professionally and properly and the government is behind us, not looking to trip us up at every opportunity.\""

      "tags": "Economics,Inflation,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Prices rose in January in what some economists warned could mark the first step towards increasing costs post-lockdown.\nConsumers paid more for food and sellers of household goods offered smaller-than-usual New Year discounts, official figures suggest.\nInflation rose 0.7% in the 12 months to January, up from December's 0.6%.\nSome experts warned inflation will exceed the Bank of England's 2% target by the end of 2021.\nInflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase.\nAs well as giving a snapshot of the price of our shopping and services, it influences interest rates and therefore our mortgages and is used to set regulated items, such as train tickets.\nIt's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far.\nA little inflation, however, typically encourages people to buy products sooner and makes it easier for companies to put up wages. And both of those things boost economic growth.\nMost countries' central banks have an inflation target of between 2% and 2.5%.\nRead more here.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), food prices rose by 0.6% in January, compared with a fall of 0.1% last time. \nPremium potato crisps and cauliflowers saw big increases after being discounted before Christmas. The price of fresh salmon and frozen prawns also rose. \nJonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said household goods prices were also higher because there had been less discounting on items such as bedding or sofas.\nBut Mr Athow pointed out that January discounting had continued for some goods, and there was a 4.6% fall in the cost of clothing and footwear.\nExperts said fashion is typically discounted in December and January for festive shoppers.\nSurprisingly, another large contributor to rising costs was restaurants and hotels.\nPrices in this category were estimated to have risen by 0.9% between December and January, largely driven by hotels. Holiday travel is not allowed under current lockdown rules, but hotels are open for people travelling for work and more recently people arriving from high risk countries who must quarantine. \nSome experts warned on Wednesday that inflation could exceed the Bank of England's 2% target by the end of 2021.\n\"January's small rise in CPI inflation marks the first step this year towards an above-target rate by the autumn,\" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Economics said.\nAs cuts in VAT for hospitality and tourism end at the end of March and energy prices rise, \"that alone should push prices up and we expect it to be up at around 2% at the end of the year, but it could be higher than that\", said Karen Ward, chief market strategist for Europe at JPMorgan Asset Management.\nShe added that there could also be  an \"explosion in demand and perhaps not quite enough goods and services to fulfil that\" when lockdown restrictions are finally eased.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that this would mean the Bank of England's next change to interest rates - which are currently at 0.1% - would probably be upwards, though not for some time. \nBut Ed Monk, associate director at Fidelity International, said that the picture overall was \"pretty confusing for prices right now\".\n\"It will take a few months and an ending of current restrictions for the full picture to emerge,\" he said.\nIn the long-term, he said that prices will also depend on how the labour market fares once the government's furlough scheme has ended.\n\"Any increase in unemployment rates could suppress wage and price rises,\" he said. \nThe UK's coronavirus vaccine rollout is also likely to push up inflation as the economy unlocks and consumers may start spending roughly \u00a3125bn in pent-up savings, the Bank of England has previously suggested."

      "title": "Covid: Dutch crisis as court orders end to Covid curfew",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Netherlands,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A court in The Hague has told the Dutch government that an overnight curfew to reduce the spread of coronavirus should be lifted, ruling that it breaches the right to free movement.\nThe court said the 21:00 to 04:30 curfew was imposed by an emergency law when there was no \"acute emergency\".\nLater, a higher court ruled that the curfew could stay in place pending an appeal on Friday.\nThe curfew, imposed in January, led to rioting in several Dutch cities.\nPolice were patrolling streets near the Dutch parliament on Tuesday evening but no unrest has been reported so far.\nThe earlier court ruling - which said the curfew should be lifted immediately - was a victory for campaign group Viruswaarheid (Virus Truth) and a major upset for the government.\nThe government quickly asked for the decision to be suspended until an appeal was heard at the end of the week. An appeals court later granted that suspension.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the ruling against the curfew as a setback and urged people to continue to follow the restrictions, which he said were \"simply necessary\".\nThe Dutch cabinet is urgently working on a new law to enforce the curfew, but that could take time.\nCurfews have been widely used in Europe to restrict movement. France has had a nightly curfew from 18:00 but has stopped short of imposing a third lockdown. Greece has also imposed curfews, as have Spain and Italy.\nThe Dutch measure, which came into force on 23 January, was intended to reduce movement, particularly among young people, but triggered days of rioting in a number of towns and cities. The Netherlands had not seen a curfew since Nazi occupation in World War Two.\nAlthough the Netherlands initially avoided strict measures, a lockdown was brought in last December and, after the cabinet decided on a curfew in January, MPs backed it days later amid fears that the UK, or Kent, variant would increase infections. The government resigned before last month's curfew decision and now has a caretaker role ahead of elections next month.\nInfection rates were slightly down on Tuesday, with 2,735 new cases reported in the past 24 hours. But hospital admissions were up and 88 more deaths were reported. Some 629,000 people have received their first Covid-19 vaccine dose since vaccinations began in the Netherlands on 6 January, and of those around one in four have had a second dose.\nIn their ruling on Tuesday, the Dutch judges said the curfew had been imposed under an emergency law, even though the court said there was no emergency as in the case of a \"dyke being breached\". \nFears of increased infection because of the UK variant were not valid as no curfew was imposed last year when pressure on Dutch hospitals was far greater, the judges said.\nThe curfew was therefore a violation of the right to freedom of movement and privacy, and limited the right to freedom of assembly. \nCommentators spoke of ministers having faced a \"Catch-22\" situation. When the cabinet decided on the curfew they sought the backing of MPs, but by waiting for parliamentary support, in the judges eyes they had disproved the need for emergency legislation.\nThe case threatened to descend into farce during the afternoon, when Virus Truth spokesman Jeroen Pols accused the lead judge of bias for allowing the government to challenge the court's ruling so quickly.\nEven the group that brought the case to court, Virus Truth, seemed surprised by its success.\nI recently interviewed its Covid-sceptic founder, Willem Engel, in his Rotterdam dance studio. He and his followers are adamant governments around the world are using efforts to control the spread of Covid-19 as a guise to gain control of citizens.\nThis ruling has emboldened them. \nThe curfew has been one of the most controversial and contested elements of the Dutch lockdown but the majority of the population had accepted and abided by it. \nSome people have started planning \"after-curfew\" parties, though other rules, such as no more than one guest at home a day and a ban on gatherings of more than two people outdoors, remain in place. \nWhile this court victory specifically relates to the Dutch situation, it could be used as a precedent by anti-lockdown groups seeking to overturn Covid-related rules in other countries too.

      "text": "The most vulnerable children are being \"failed by the state\" and a broken residential care system, the children's commissioner for England has said.\nGreater use of private provision has led to a fragmented, unco-ordinated and irrational system amid \"significant profits\", said Anne Longfield.   \nThe system has been allowed to slip deeper into crisis, she said. \nThe government said an independent review of children's social care would begin \"as soon as possible\". \nMs Longfield has published three reports detailing the plight of children the system \"doesn't know what to do with\". \nShe said the government has failed to respond to previous warnings that thousands of these children are in danger of becoming victims of criminal and sexual exploitation. \nOlder children were found to be living in \"disgusting\" conditions akin to a prison cell, one of the reports said.\nIt described how one 17-year-old said her accommodation was filthy and smelly, with just one working shower - covered in mould - between 14 children and young adults.\n\"Elsewhere children have told us they have not even been provided with the means to eat or sleep - things like duvet covers, plates or cutlery,\" the same report said.\nAll three reports highlight a shortage of children's home places, resulting in:\n\"Only last month, a High Court judge wrote to me after an extremely vulnerable child in care could not get a suitable care home place anywhere in the country, even though the courts had found their life was in danger,\" said Ms Longfield. \n\"These shocking cases used to be rare but are now routine, and I am worried the whole system is becoming immune to the devastating effect this is having on children who may have previously been abused and neglected, or have serious mental or physical health needs.\" \nOne of the reports analyses how, over the past decade, as demand for care has grown and local authority provision has failed to keep pace, private provision has expanded.\nThe researchers found the majority of private provision was rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, although smaller providers were more likely to have lower ratings than either larger providers or local authorities. \nSome providers are owned by private equity companies and carry \"significant amounts of debt\" which could \"risk their stability\", says the report.  \n\"Both the government and councils have failed in their responsibilities by leaving it to the market,\" said Ms Longfield. \n\"The growing reliance on private providers, some of whom are making millions, is another symptom of a system failing to prioritise the needs of children.\"\nIryna Pona, policy manager at the Children's Society, said the reports were enormously worrying but not surprising. \n\"The Children's Society is very concerned about how children in care are being failed by the very services who are supposed to be caring for and protecting them,\" she said.  \nThe Local Government Association, which represents councils across England, says it shares the commissioner's concerns about the risk of businesses running children's homes going bust as adult care provider Southern Cross did, almost a decade ago.\n\"Providers should also not be making excessive profit from providing placements for children,\" said Judith Blake, who chairs the LGA's Children and Young People Board. \nA Department for Education statement said: \"The education secretary has been clear that no child should be denied the opportunity for a loving, stable family life, or be bounced around the care system in accommodation that does not meet their needs. \n\"We have also set out that children under the age of 16 should not be living in unregulated homes.\n\"Our bold, broad and independently led care review will launch as soon as possible, and will support improvements in the children's social care system.\" "

      "title": "Covid: Extra 1.7m vulnerable added to shielding list",
      "tags": "Shielding,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is to be a large expansion of the number of people being asked to shield in England.\nAn extra 1.7 million people are expected to be added to the 2.3 million already on the list.\nHalf of the group have not yet been vaccinated so will now be prioritised urgently by their local GPs.\nIt comes after a new model was developed that takes into account extra factors rather than just health.\nThis calculation includes things such as ethnicity, deprivation (by postcode) and weight to work out a person's risk of becoming seriously ill if they were to catch Covid.\nIt also looks at age, underlying health issues and prescribed medications.\nProf Andrew Hayward, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which has been involved in the modelling, said it considered a \"combination of factors\" such as age, ethnicity and chronic illness and put them together to reach a score.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that this score could \"more or less order people in the population according to their level of risk\" and \"identify those at the top of that range to say, 'you should be prioritised for vaccine and you have a level of risk that is similar to those on the shielding list'\".\nUntil now, only those with specific conditions or undergoing certain types of treatment have been advised to shield until 31 March.\nThey include adults with Down's Syndrome, organ donor recipients and people with severe respiratory conditions.\nThe new model was developed following work by Oxford University which looked at the characteristics of people who died in the first wave to better understand risk.\nMedical records have been searched to identify high-risk patients, based on their combined risk factors. \nThey are now being sent letters by the NHS informing of them of their new status, which means they are entitled to statutory sick pay, prioritisation for online shopping slots and help collecting medicines.\nSome local authorities with areas of high deprivation will now have a major task in contacting people to check what support they need, according to the BBC's health editor Hugh Pym.\nCllr Neil Nerva, public health lead at Brent Council, in north-west London, told BBC News: \"We've got 17,000 people who are shielding. The news today means that over the next two weeks we're going to be shielding another 12,000 people who are over 70 and another 12,000 who are under 70.\"\nHe added: \"That, I think, shows in very graphic terms the health inequalities which exist in a borough like Brent.\"\nHave you been added to the shielding list? You can get in touch with us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nOf the 1.7 million people newly added to the list, around 900,000 have already received an offer of a vaccination because they were over 70.\nThe remainder are all thought to fall into one of the priority groups for vaccination that are being invited for vaccination next.\nThey will be bumped up the list first for a jab, the government said.\nIt means they will receive the offer a few weeks later than if they had been in the shielding group originally.\nShielding was re-introduced in tier four areas from mid-December, before being expanded nationally once the third lockdown was announced in early January.\nUnlike in the first lockdown, people who are shielding are being advised they can leave their homes for exercise.\nGovernment guidelines strongly advise clinically extremely vulnerable people to stay at home at all times, apart from going out to exercise or to attend a medical appointment.  \nThey should also try to stay 2m (6ft) away from other people within their household, especially if they display symptoms of the virus or have been advised to self-isolate.\nPeople on the list are still advised to shield even if they have had two doses of the vaccine.\nHigh risk categories include: \nThe list does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to do social distancing.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said: \"All of these people who are identified for the first time, are those who have not had an individual clinical condition that we've previously been able to identify through the clinically extremely vulnerable group, but they are people who have multiple personal risk factors and underlying health conditions which move them into a higher risk group.\"\nShe said adding people to the shielding list ensured \"those most vulnerable to Covid can benefit from both the protection that vaccines provide and from enhanced advice and support should they choose it\".\nThe approach was \"risk averse\" to \"protect as many people as possible\", she added.\nPhillip Anderson, of the MS Society, said some people with multiple sclerosis were being added to the shielding list.\nHe said it would come as a \"huge shock\" to people who would potentially have to make \"drastic changes\" to their lives.\nThe Westminster government said the model had been shared with the other nations of the UK, who would decide individually how to use it.\nThere are no current plans to formally expand the shielding list in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the same way as in England.\nThe Welsh government said the same computer model had already been used to add those with chronic kidney disease and adults with Down's Syndrome to its list of those who are extremely clinically vulnerable.\nIn Northern Ireland, GPs and hospital doctors can add individual patients to the shielding list if they are assessed as extremely vulnerable based on a range of factors.

      "text": "At the age of 35, Richard Linning, from Falkirk, has found himself fighting for every breath. \nNow wearing a high-pressure oxygen mask, he says he is in a state of shock after testing positive for Covid-19 and being admitted to Forth Valley Royal Hospital.\n\"At the beginning of last week I was perfectly fine and then I got a really sore headache,\" he says. \"For three days I was in pure agony. \n\"And then I started struggling to breathe and that's when it started to deteriorate.\"\nA portrait of his 10-year-old son Blair sits beside him in the Covid-19 intensive care bay at the hospital, where he has been since Saturday. \nRichard is a bus driver working out of First Bus's Larbert depot, where eight members of staff tested positive last week.\n\"I don't know how I've picked this up. My work has been really careful in making sure that we've all been safe and I've always followed the rules from day one,\" he says.\n\"It just shows you how transmissible this virus is.\"\nOlder people are more at risk of developing severe disease or dying from coronavirus. But Heather Riddoch, the senior charge nurse here, says they have seen a different profile among some patients in the second wave.\n\"We're certainly seeing younger patients that are coming in and requiring ventilatory support,\" she says. \n\"All ages contract Covid, but we are seeing more people ending up in intensive care in their 30s and 40s in this second wave.\"\n\"I think it's more shocking to see younger people coming in. We've got patients in who are close to our age and younger. \n\"A lot of young nurses here are seeing patients who are the same age as their parents, and more families in the ward all at the one time as well. \n\"There's a definite shift there and it's shocking and it's more real because it could be you.\"\nThis means the increased protection of vaccination for the over-70s won't immediately relieve all the pressure on the NHS.\nNumbers in hospital and ICU are gradually falling across the country, and are now back below the peak seen in April.\nBut that's not the case everywhere, and here in Forth Valley Royal, clinicians are worried they're starting to see the worst of this wave.\nHeather says that earlier in the week things had started to get quieter. \n\"We really felt things had taken a good turn. However, in the last 48 hours we have doubled the number of patients admitted with Covid and it's been quite shocking at how quickly that rapid turnover has happened. \n\"We have actually had to open up another ward and it's a massive change from the beginning of the week.\"\nDr Fiona McIlveney, who is the clinical lead for intensive care, says the hospital may be feeling the impact of recent outbreaks in Falkirk and Clackmannanshire, which have put local infection rates among the highest in Scotland.\n\"I think we are probably a bit different from the rest of the country in that we are still seeing a rise in our Covid numbers in the hospital and in intensive care, she says.\n\"I think there is always going to be regional variation. It's not entirely clear why, but for us we are just starting to see this peak of activity now and this will be our focus for the next few weeks.\n\"Staff have done a phenomenal job for almost a year now. They've had to run their own lives outside of here, they've had the same challenges about home schooling, and worries about illness and family concerns, but every day they've squared their shoulders and come in here, and they have given their absolute all. \n\"I'm so proud of the way they have delivered excellent compassion and care to patients and their families.\"\nUnlike some other health boards, at Forth Valley Royal they have managed to continue with much of their scheduled non-coronavirus care.\nJust next door to the 10-bed Covid ICU, there's another unit where staff are caring for patients with heart problems, kidney failure, and the aftermath of drug overdoses. \nThey also look after patients who were previously in the Covid ward, but have now tested negative. \nThe Scottish government recognises that many patients are spending longer periods of time in intensive care. The most recent figures showed 28 coronavirus patients had been in ICU for longer than 28 days.\nDr McIlveney says the effects of long stays don't stop when patients leave the doors of the unit. \n\"I think our surviving patients can spend up to 60 or 70 days in here before they leave intensive care, and then that leads them still to a long period of rehabilitation,\" she says.\n\"The effects of that persist for some time and some people will never be the same again.\"\nRichard warns that some people still need to realise how serious the disease can be for younger adults.\n\"I mean this hand on heart, on my wee boy's life, you really need to wake up and take this seriously,\" he says. \"This is no joke, I wouldn't be wearing this mask for publicity. This is genuine, this is real.\"\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

GM and Volvo Cars have set similarly ambitious targets. \nThis year car makers in the EU will face hefty fines if they fail to meet emissions standards. The UK meanwhile has said it plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, with France is targeting the same by 2040.\nDavid Leggett, automotive analyst at GlobalData, said: \"Automotive electrification is an expensive proposition for vehicle manufacturers, but they are nevertheless concluding that they must take the investment hit to be well-positioned competitively later this decade when the end for new internal combustion engine vehicle sales will be in sight in a number of markets.\" \nOn Tuesday it emerged that Coventry Airport could be the site for a gigafactory - a plant to manufacture electric car batteries.\nThe UK government previously announced \u00a3500m funding as part of a ten point plan to support the electrification of vehicles, including developing gigafactories across the UK."

      "tags": "Princess Haya case,Mohammed Al Maktoum,Dubai",
      "text": "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is the 71-year-old billionaire ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the United Arab Emirates.\nIn the Middle East, he is renowned for overseeing the transformation of Dubai into a top business and tourism destination. Elsewhere, he is perhaps best known for his connection to horseracing, as the owner of the Godolphin stables. \nOne of his daughters, Princess Latifa, has now made headlines after secret videos recorded by her in captivity have been obtained and released by the BBC's Panorama. Latifa made the videos while being held under her father's orders in Dubai in a barred villa.\nSheikh Mohammed was born in 1949 at his family home in Shindagha, near Dubai Creek. He was the third of the four sons of Sheikh Rashid Al Maktoum, who ruled Dubai for 32 years from 1958.\nAfter finishing secondary school in 1965, Sheikh Mohammed moved to the UK to study English at a language school in Cambridge. The young sheikh later attended a six-month training court at the British Army's Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot, Hampshire.  \nIn 1968, following his return to Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed accompanied his father to a meeting with the then ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan, at which they agreed to a union that would lead to the establishment of a federation of emirates. \nAfter the UAE gained independence from the UK in 1971, Sheikh Mohammed was named defence minster - a position he still holds.\nSheikh Mohammed also became heavily involved in his father's plan to compensate for Dubai's dwindling oil reserves by diversifying its economy and becoming an international trade and financial centre, as well as a tourist destination.\nToday, more than 95% of the emirate's gross domestic product is non-oil-based, with tourism contributing 20%.\nDubai's population has also grown from about 40,000 in the 1960s to 3.3 million, including almost 3.1 million non-Emiratis, many of whom live in the hundreds of high-rise buildings filling its skyline.\nIn 1990, Sheikh Rashid died after a long illness resulting from a stroke. He was succeeded by Mohammed's eldest brother, Maktoum.\nFive years later, Sheikh Maktoum named Mohammed crown prince of Dubai. He also handed over much of the day-to-day running of the emirate to him.\nSheikh Mohammed became ruler of Dubai and vice-president and prime minister of the UAE in 2006, after his brother died aged 62 during a visit to Australia. \nUnder his leadership, Dubai's development continued apace. \nIn 2008, the emirate unveiled the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa; Dubai Mall, then world's largest shopping centre by total land area; and the Dubai Metro.\nSuch ambitious projects were, however, reliant on borrowing billions of dollars. \nThe global financial crisis caused Dubai's real estate market to crash and in 2009 state-linked companies came close to defaulting on their debts. Abu Dhabi stepped in and loaned the Dubai government the money it desperately needed. \nDubai's construction boom also relied on low-paid migrant construction workers, many of whom complained that they suffered exploitation.\nSheikh Mohammed has also become famous for his involvement in horseracing, and is credited with transforming it into a global industry. \nHe rode horses on beaches in Dubai as a child and was introduced to the sport in 1967 in the UK. Ten years later, he enjoyed his first success as an owner.\nThe sheikh subsequently set up the world's largest horseracing team, Godolphin, as well as the successful stallion breeding operation, Darley. \nGodolphin - which has facilities in the UAE, England, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, Japan and the US - has won 6,000 races across the world since 1992, including 315 prestigious Group One races. \nSheikh Mohammed frequently attends major horseracing events such as Royal Ascot, where he has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe sheikh shared a love of horses with his sixth and \"junior\" wife, Princess Haya bint Al Hussein, the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan and half-sister of King Abdullah II. The pair married in Amman in 2004 and had two children, Al Jalila and Zayed.\nPrincess Haya painted a picture of a perfect family life in interviews, but cracks began to appear in 2018 when Princess Latifa, one of Sheikh Mohammed's adult daughters with another wife, tried to flee the UAE with the help of a former French spy and a Finnish fitness instructor. \nA boat carrying them was intercepted at sea off the coast of India and Latifa was returned to Dubai. In a video filmed beforehand, she alleged that she had been imprisoned for more than three years and subjected to physical abuse after another unsuccessful escape attempt in 2002. \nNow, new videos made by Latifa have been released after being obtained by the BBC's investigative current affairs programme, Panorama.\nThe footage was recorded over several months by Latifa after she had been taken back to Dubai following her failed escape in 2018. They were made using a phone that was secretly given to her by friends who are campaigning for her freedom.\nIn the videos, she describes how she fought back against the soldiers during her capture, before being tranquillised and flown back to Dubai. She said she was being held alone without access to medical or legal help in a villa with windows and doors barred shut, and guarded by police. The secret messages have since stopped, leading her friends to urge the UN to step in.\nAfter the 2018 escape attempt, Princess Haya had backed claims by the Dubai government that Latifa had been \"vulnerable to exploitation\" and was \"now safe\". But after fleeing Dubai for the UK via Germany along with their children in April 2019, sources alleged that she had become aware of new information relating to Latifa.\nSheikh Mohammed did not comment on the breakdown of his marriage, but he did write an angry poem accusing an unnamed woman of \"treachery and betrayal\" and posted it on Instagram.\nIn July 2019, Haya applied for a forced marriage protection order and a non-molestation order at the UK High Court in London - as well as wardship of their children. Sheikh Mohammed meanwhile applied for the children's return to Dubai.\nEight months later, the High Court issued a series of fact-finding judgements that said Sheikh Mohammed had ordered and orchestrated the forcible return of Latifa in 2002 and 2018, as well as the unlawful abduction of her elder sister Princess Shamsa in 2000. \nShamsa fled the family's UK estate in Surrey that year but was later recaptured in Cambridgeshire by agents of the sheikh and forcibly returned to Dubai. A request by Cambridgeshire Police to visit Dubai to investigate was refused.\nThe court found that Sheikh Mohammed \"continues to maintain a regime whereby both these two young women are deprived of their liberty\".\nIt also said Haya, who'd had an adulterous affair with a bodyguard, was now living in fear of her life after receiving numerous threats both in Dubai and in London. These included a pistol placed on her pillow.\nSheikh Mohammed rejected the judgements and findings, and appealed unsuccessfully to keep them out of the public domain. \nHe said the appeal was \"made to protect the best interests and welfare of the children\" and that the \"outcome does not protect my children from media attention in the way that other children in family proceedings in the UK are protected\".\n\"As a head of government, I was not able to participate in the court's fact-finding process. This has resulted in the release of a 'fact-finding' judgment which inevitably only tells one side of the story,\" he added."

      "tags": "Mafia,Sexual harassment,Music",
      "text": "Singer Glenn Medeiros has revealed how he and other artists were often asked for sex by music industry figures in return for help with their careers.\nMedeiros, who found fame with Nothing's Gonna Change My Love For You in 1988, said he turned down \"many offers\" for sexual relationships but others agreed.\n\"You saw it everywhere,\" said Medeiros, who now runs a school in Hawaii.\n\"Would it have led to me being more successful in my career? Potentially. But I wasn't willing to do that.\"\nHe said: \"I had friends who specifically said, 'I am going to be moving in with this person because this person is going to be helping me with my recording career.'\n\"I've never done it and I do feel proud of that, but at the same time I can understand why some other people did. I remember talking to some of my friends who said, 'The person's attractive and I like them anyway, so it's OK.'\"\nAfter spending four weeks at number one in the UK with his debut single, the heartthrob topped the charts in the US two years later with She Ain't Worth It, with Bobby Brown.\nHowever he left the music business in the mid-90s to become a teacher and is now president of Saint Louis School in his native Hawaii.\n\"You hear things about the #MeToo movement and that was such the norm when I was in the music industry,\" he told the podcast Celebrity Catch Up: Life After That Thing I Did.\n\"Unfortunately most of the females and some of the males I met - it literally took them having to have relationships with others to be able to get to the top.\n\"I'd even talk to the artists about it and they'd say, 'Hey, you know what, I've got to do what I have to do.' For me, I never took that approach.\"\nSpeaking to podcast host Genevieve Hassan, he recalled going to the house of one successful male songwriter, who told him he was better than the artists whose gold discs he had on the wall.\n\"And then he says, 'I need to get something', goes back to another room, comes back in a robe,\" recalled Medeiros, who was 18 at the time. \n\"You kind of knew what the next moves were going to be, so I just remember saying, 'Oh my God I forgot I have an appointment, I have to be going', and I made the choice.\"\nNow 50, he said he would not name those involved, which he acknowledged some people would find \"gutless\".\n\"But for me, I wouldn't mention it because I still think I had a choice,\" he said. \"As far as having a relationship with someone to make that [success] happen, I had a choice.\"\nHe has recently been writing a memoir, which will include his experiences of the murky side of fame.\n\"The other thing is, the music industry is riddled with a lot of drugs, and the Mafia is very much a part of the music industry,\" he said. \"A lot of people don't like to talk about that, but it's out there.\"\nSome artists sold drugs, while others had their houses, cars and other expenses paid for by the Mafia, who in effect \"owned\" them, Medeiros claimed.\n\"So they were basically being pimped out, for lack of a better term. I don't know why more people don't talk about it, to be honest. I guess I'm out of the industry now, so I can just clearly say, 'Hey, this is what I saw.'\n\"To me between all of those things - the drugs, the pimping out of artists and also the sexual relations that were happening - it was the music industry that I saw.\"\nNot everyone was drawn into such shady dealings, though, he added. \"In the music industry there are some people who are really good.\n\"There have been artists who have been able to steer away from that and have success and have done it in a way that they respected themselves, and I have a lot of respect for those people, so not everyone has fallen victim to that.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "NHS England,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Waiting lists for hospital treatment could more than double by April and hit 10 million in England, the Reform think tank is warning.\nA worst-case scenario could see delays continue as a new wave of referrals are made, Reform said. \nTreatment referrals by GPs were six million lower in 2020 than the year before, suggesting a mounting backlog.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said \"trumpeting worst-case scenarios\" was \"not helpful\". \nHe said while there was a \"significant problem\" which would take time and investment to overcome, a similar methodology had suggested waiting lists would hit 10 million by December last year, but they were currently at 4.4 million.\nHe also warned the NHS is likely to be \"at full stretch\" for at least another six weeks and England was still \"some way away\" from being able to start lifting restrictions.\nAre you waiting for hospital treatment? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nMr Hopson, whose organisation represents NHS trusts in England, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say case numbers are \"still far too high\" to end virus curbs. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the end of April, once the top nine priority groups had been vaccinated would be the \"logical point at which we can start considering easing restrictions\".\nSetting out the conditions they believe are needed to allow current restrictions to relax, trust leaders outlined four tests that could be applied.\nAmong the tests are: a \"significant\" drop in case numbers; a return to normal NHS capacity; solid progress with vaccinations; and a \"robust and effective\" strategy to identify new virus variants.\nMr Johnson is due to outline a roadmap for easing the current national lockdown in England on Monday.\nMeanwhile, the head of the UK's vaccine taskforce, Clive Dix, told Sky News all adults could be fully vaccinated by August \"or maybe sooner if we need to\".\nReform - a centre-right think tank that focuses on public services - praised the work of frontline NHS staff, but said more now needed to be done to tackle the growing backlog in care.\nCommunity diagnostic centres for cancer, cardiac and other conditions should be set up to restart screening programmes halted by the pandemic, coupled with a renewed focus on prioritising those most urgently in need of care currently on waiting lists, it said. And for routine treatments, it said more use should be made of the private sector.\nReform's Eleonora Harwich said: \"We must never have the equivalent of a 'National Covid Service' again.\n\"This is a system problem and in no way detracts from the heroic effort of NHS staff battling Covid-19. \n\"However, the cessation of so much non-Covid care means patients are facing more serious health conditions or disabilities, and some will die prematurely.\"\nLayla McCay, director of policy at the NHS Confederation, which represents hospital bosses, accepted the NHS faced a \"mammoth task\" to tackle the backlog - although she questioned the waiting list prediction of 10 million people by April.\nShe said the real problem was that the NHS was under-funded and had been operating \"at the top of its capacity for far too long\".\nResponding to accusations that the NHS has become a Covid-only service, Ms McCay pointed out cancer services were now operating at pre-pandemic levels.\nMr Hopson also said that Reform's suggestion that the NHS had been a \"Covid-only service\" was not helpful as staff had worked hard to keep other services going.\nProf Neil Mortensen, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said tackling the backlog would require both the use of the private sector, and extra investment in the NHS.\nA further 10,625 new coronavirus cases were reported on Tuesday, alongside another 799 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nOver 16 million people have now received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine across the UK."

      "tags": "Rudy Giuliani,Mitch McConnell,Donald Trump,US politics",
      "text": "Former President Donald Trump has launched a scathing personal attack on fellow Republican Mitch McConnell.\n\"Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack,\" said Mr Trump, \"and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again.\"\nHis statement came after Mr McConnell said the former president was \"morally responsible\" for the US Capitol riots.\nThe exchange exposed an apparent rift between the two over the future of the Republican party.\nThe majority of Republican senators backed Mr Trump in his impeachment trial last week, including Mr McConnell who voted to acquit.\nBut in a speech on the Senate floor, Mr McConnell implied the former president should face criminal and civil litigation because he was \"still liable for everything he did while in office\".\nHe said Mr Trump's actions prior to the riots on 6 January amounted to \"a disgraceful dereliction of duty\".\nThe feud has prompted concern among some Republicans about the impact it may have on next year's mid-term elections. The party is trying to regroup having lost the House, the Senate and the presidency. \n\"I'm more worried about 2022 than I've ever been,\" Senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News.\n\"I don't want to eat our own,\" he added. \"We need to knock this off.\"\nMr Trump responded on Tuesday with his lengthiest statement since he left office a month ago.\n\"The Republican Party can never again be respected or strong with political 'leaders' like Senator Mitch McConnell at its helm,\" the press release reads.\nMr McConnell's \"lack of political insight, wisdom, skill, and personality\" cost the Republicans control of the Senate following last November's elections, he said.\nTwo closely-contested run-off votes in Georgia saw the Republicans lose both seats to Democrats, resulting in a 50-50 split of seats in the Senate.  This leaves the Democrats in control because Vice-President Kamala Harris has the casting vote in the case of a tie. \nMr Trump also took aim at Mr McConnell's stated intentions to stand in the way of future Trump-backed candidates.\nThe former president said he would back Republican primary challengers who \"espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First\". \nMr McConnell \"will never do what needs to be done, or what is right for our Country,\" said Mr Trump.\nPolitico reported that an early draft was even more personal, with a source telling the site it said Mr McConnell had \"too many chins but not enough smarts\". \nDonald Trump's Twitter ban may mean that he has lost his favourite way of lobbing attacks at his opponents, but his latest press release about Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell shows he hasn't lost his bite.\nThere's a lot of invective in the eight-paragraph diatribe from the former president, but the line that will give the Republicans the most heartburn is toward the end, when he says he will back primary challenges against members of his own party \"where necessary and appropriate\".\nIt's telling that as Mr Trump prepares to re-enter the fray after his impeachment trial, he does so with an attack on his own party, not the Democrats.\nTrump may eventually take aim at Joe Biden and the left, but the political warfare Trump appears most interested in at the moment is of the internecine variety.\nThe two Republicans shared a cordial working relationship throughout Mr Trump's presidency.\nThat changed, however, after Mr Trump lost the presidential election. Mr McConnell said he had not spoken to Mr Trump since mid-December.\nThe rift between them was exacerbated after the Capitol riots, which led to the deaths of five people including a police officer.\nMr Trump, who was impeached by the House of Representatives over the violence, was acquitted by the Senate on charges of inciting the insurrection.\nOnly seven Republicans joined the Democrats in voting to convict Mr Trump. Mr McConnell and 42 other Republicans voted to acquit. \nA two-thirds vote was needed to convict.\nDespite voting to acquit, Mr McConnell excoriated the former president on the Senate floor after the vote. \n\"There is no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,\" he said.\n\"A mob was assaulting the Capitol in his name,\" he added. \"These criminals were carrying his banners, hanging his flags and screaming their loyalty to him.\"\nThe relationship between Mr Trump and Mr McConnell is not the only one to have soured over the past month.\nOn Tuesday, an adviser to Mr Trump said that former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has stopped doing legal work for the former president.\nMr Giuliani is \"not currently representing President Trump in any legal matters,\" Jason Miller told CNN.\nMr Trump reportedly tried to stop paying Mr Giuliani's legal fees in a fit of irritation about being impeached a second time, US media reported in January.\nBut Mr Miller clarified on Twitter after the interview that Mr Giuliani remains \"an ally and a friend\".\nWhat questions do you have about the US?\nIt's a new year and the beginning of a new administration.

      "text": "Boris Johnson has drafted former Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost into his cabinet to take charge of forging a new relationship with the EU.\nHe will seek to maximise post-Brexit trading opportunities when he becomes a full cabinet member next month, Downing Street said.\nHe will also replace Michael Gove as co-chair of a committee on implementing the Brexit withdrawal deal. \nMr Gove will keep his seat at the cabinet table.\nThe change means Mr Gove, who will keep the title of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, will be Lord Frost's new boss at the Cabinet Office.\nThe peer said Mr Gove had done an \"extraordinary job for this country\" in talks with the EU over the past year.\nIn taking over from him as chair of the EU-UK committee tasked with implementing the Brexit deal, he said: \"I stand on the shoulders of giants.\"\nLabour's shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry tweeted: \"So we've finally got one minister taking a grip of the problems with our post-Brexit trading relationships with Europe. \n\"Someone who has never been elected by anyone in this country, and won't be accountable in the House of Commons to any of us who have.\"\nThis appointment again shows that Brexit didn't end with the signing of a trade deal. \nWhile the UK is no longer a member of the EU, negotiating with Brussels and member states will preoccupy this and future governments for years to come. \nSince the start of the year (and the end of the transition period) serious tensions have flared up between Westminster and Brussels over trade disruption between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and vaccine supplies. \nOther issues, such as the City of London's access to EU markets, remain unresolved. \nLord Frost will now be the UK minister responsible for co-ordinating all this and it will be a full time job. \nRather than responsibility for the EU being shared between several departments - such as the Foreign Office and International Trade - the decision to put Lord Frost in the cabinet and in charge of the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee gives him huge clout overseeing policy.\nIt also takes a lot of work away from Michael Gove and means there will be a single minister responsible to parliament for EU relations - although of course he'll be answering questions in the House of Lords and not the Commons. \nSpeaking last week to a select committee, Lord Frost said the UK's relationship with the EU since the trade deal between the two came into force at the start of the year, had been more \"problematic\" and \"bumpy\" than he had expected.\nHe said he hoped we would \"get over this\", but added that it was going to require a \"different spirit\" from Brussels.\nLord Frost - who is said to be highly rated by the prime minister - had been due to become the UK's new national security adviser earlier this month, but was replaced days before he was due to start.\nHe will be the co-chair of the UK-EU joint committee, which was set up to resolve differences arising from the treaty which took the UK out of the EU in February 2020.\nSince the UK left its Brexit transition period in January, this committee has mainly focused on overcoming trade tensions in Northern Ireland. \nUnlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is continuing to follow EU single market rules on goods. \nThis provision, agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement, was designed to get rid of the need for checks at the border with the Republic of Ireland.  \nBut it has meant checks had to be introduced on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nSince the new rules came into force, there has been tensions at ports in Northern Ireland, with disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries.\nLord Frost will also become UK chair of a separate committee being set up to oversee the post-Brexit trade deal he negotiated with Brussels last year.

      "tags": "Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Healthy, young volunteers will be infected with coronavirus to test vaccines and treatments in the world's first Covid-19 \"human challenge\" study, which will take place in the UK.\nThe study, which has received ethics approval, will start in the next few weeks and recruit 90 people aged 18-30.\nThey will be exposed to the virus in a safe and controlled environment while medics monitor their health.\nThe UK has given doses of a Covid vaccine to more than 15 million people.\nHuman challenge studies have played a vital role in pushing the development of treatments for a number of diseases, including malaria, typhoid, cholera and flu.\nThe trials will help scientists work out the smallest amount of coronavirus needed to cause infection, and how the body's immune system reacts to it.\nThis will give doctors a better understanding of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, which will feed into the development of vaccines and treatments.\nThe Human Challenge study is being delivered by a partnership between the UK government's Vaccines Taskforce, Imperial College London, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and the company hVIVO, which has pioneered viral human challenge models.\nClive Dix, interim chair of the Vaccines Taskforce, said: \"We have secured a number of safe and effective vaccines for the UK, but it is essential that we continue to develop new vaccines and treatments for Covid-19. \n\"We expect these studies to offer unique insights into how the virus works and help us understand which promising vaccines offer the best chance of preventing the infection.\"\nWe have hugely effective Covid-19 vaccines already so why do we need challenge trials?\nFirst, they tell us things that are almost impossible to discover in the real world.\nHow much virus does it take to start an infection? How does the immune system mount its initial defence? Can you tell which people will develop symptoms or not?\nThe trials in the UK will start off by focusing on these fundamental scientific questions.\nBut there are also new vaccines in the pipeline and the virus itself is evolving. \nLater this year it will become almost impossible to run large-scale Covid vaccine trials in the UK because so many people will have been immunised. \nBut challenge trials involving just a small numbers of volunteers will still give the answer to crucial questions - from how second-generation vaccines compare, to whether vaccines protect against new variants. \nChief investigator Dr Chris Chiu, from Imperial College London, said: \"We are asking for volunteers aged between 18 and 30 to join this research endeavour and help us to understand how the virus infects people and how it passes so successfully between us.\"\nVolunteers will be screened to check they are healthy and have not been infected by the virus before. They will have the virus squirted up their nose and then spend 14 days quarantining in hospital, while being closely monitored by a medical team.\nFinding out how the virus grows in the nose and analysing the very early stages of infection in people before symptoms develop are two main aims.\nVolunteers will be compensated for their time, to the tune of around \u00a34,500 over the course of a year, which will include follow-up tests.\nInitially, the study will use the virus that has been circulating in the UK since the pandemic began in March, which is of low risk to healthy adults, to deliberately infect volunteers.\nIn time, a small numbers of volunteers are likely to be given an approved vaccine and then exposed to the new variants, helping scientists to find out the most effective jabs - but this phase of the study has not yet been given the go-ahead."

      "tags": "Shielding,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is to be a large expansion of the number of people being asked to shield in England.\nAn extra 1.7 million people are expected to be added to the 2.3 million already on the list.\nHalf of the group have not yet been vaccinated so will now be prioritised urgently by their local GPs.\nIt comes after a new model was developed that takes into account extra factors rather than just health.\nThis calculation includes things such as ethnicity, deprivation (by postcode) and weight to work out a person's risk of becoming seriously ill if they were to catch Covid.\nIt also looks at age, underlying health issues and prescribed medications.\nProf Andrew Hayward, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which has been involved in the modelling, said it considered a \"combination of factors\" such as age, ethnicity and chronic illness and put them together to reach a score.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that this score could \"more or less order people in the population according to their level of risk\" and \"identify those at the top of that range to say, 'you should be prioritised for vaccine and you have a level of risk that is similar to those on the shielding list'\".\nUntil now, only those with specific conditions or undergoing certain types of treatment have been advised to shield until 31 March.\nThey include adults with Down's Syndrome, organ donor recipients and people with severe respiratory conditions.\nThe new model was developed following work by Oxford University which looked at the characteristics of people who died in the first wave to better understand risk.\nMedical records have been searched to identify high-risk patients, based on their combined risk factors. \nThey are now being sent letters by the NHS informing of them of their new status, which means they are entitled to statutory sick pay, prioritisation for online shopping slots and help collecting medicines.\nSome local authorities with areas of high deprivation will now have a major task in contacting people to check what support they need, according to the BBC's health editor Hugh Pym.\nCllr Neil Nerva, public health lead at Brent Council, in north-west London, told BBC News: \"We've got 17,000 people who are shielding. The news today means that over the next two weeks we're going to be shielding another 12,000 people who are over 70 and another 12,000 who are under 70.\"\nHe added: \"That, I think, shows in very graphic terms the health inequalities which exist in a borough like Brent.\"\nHave you been added to the shielding list? You can get in touch with us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\nOf the 1.7 million people newly added to the list, around 900,000 have already received an offer of a vaccination because they were over 70.\nThe remainder are all thought to fall into one of the priority groups for vaccination that are being invited for vaccination next.\nThey will be bumped up the list first for a jab, the government said.\nIt means they will receive the offer a few weeks later than if they had been in the shielding group originally.\nShielding was re-introduced in tier four areas from mid-December, before being expanded nationally once the third lockdown was announced in early January.\nUnlike in the first lockdown, people who are shielding are being advised they can leave their homes for exercise.\nGovernment guidelines strongly advise clinically extremely vulnerable people to stay at home at all times, apart from going out to exercise or to attend a medical appointment.  \nThey should also try to stay 2m (6ft) away from other people within their household, especially if they display symptoms of the virus or have been advised to self-isolate.\nPeople on the list are still advised to shield even if they have had two doses of the vaccine.\nHigh risk categories include: \nThe list does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to do social distancing.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said: \"All of these people who are identified for the first time, are those who have not had an individual clinical condition that we've previously been able to identify through the clinically extremely vulnerable group, but they are people who have multiple personal risk factors and underlying health conditions which move them into a higher risk group.\"\nShe said adding people to the shielding list ensured \"those most vulnerable to Covid can benefit from both the protection that vaccines provide and from enhanced advice and support should they choose it\".\nThe approach was \"risk averse\" to \"protect as many people as possible\", she added.\nPhillip Anderson, of the MS Society, said some people with multiple sclerosis were being added to the shielding list.\nHe said it would come as a \"huge shock\" to people who would potentially have to make \"drastic changes\" to their lives.\nThe Westminster government said the model had been shared with the other nations of the UK, who would decide individually how to use it.\nThere are no current plans to formally expand the shielding list in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the same way as in England.\nThe Welsh government said the same computer model had already been used to add those with chronic kidney disease and adults with Down's Syndrome to its list of those who are extremely clinically vulnerable.\nIn Northern Ireland, GPs and hospital doctors can add individual patients to the shielding list if they are assessed as extremely vulnerable based on a range of factors.

      "text": "A white woman who called police on a black man bird watching in New York's Central Park has had the criminal case against her dismissed.\nProsecutors say Amy Cooper completed a therapy course addressing racial bias and asked for her charge to be dropped. \nA video of Ms Cooper went viral in 2020 and sparked outrage across the US.\nIn it she was seen threatening Christian Cooper, no relation, with the police after he reportedly asked her to put her dog on a lead.\nThe incident happened the same day that unarmed black man George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis, triggering weeks of national and global anti-racism protests. \nMs Cooper apologised after the video went viral but lost her job and was later charged with filing a false police report. \nChristian Cooper, who is prominent in the New York bird watching community, posted the encounter on Facebook and said it came after he had asked her to put her dog on a lead in an area where it was required. \nThe video showed her telling Mr Cooper that she would tell police \"there's an African-American man threatening my life\" before she is seen calling emergency services in a distressed tone to say an \"African American man\" was \"threatening me and my dog\" and asked dispatchers to \"please send the cops immediately!\" \nProsecutors later said that Ms Cooper had repeated the claim and accused Mr Cooper of trying to assault her during a second call. \nAt the time, District Attorney Cyrus Vance said Ms Cooper had \"engaged in racist criminal conduct\" and said it was \"fortunate\" that \"no one was injured or killed in the police response to Ms Cooper's hoax\".\nBut on Tuesday the single misdemeanour charge against her was dropped on the basis that Ms Cooper had completed a five-session educational therapy programme.\nAssistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said the sessions were \"designed for introspection and progress\" and focused \"on the ways in which Ms Cooper could appreciate that racial identities shape our lives but we cannot use them to harm ourselves or others\".\nShe was offered the programme as part of a restorative justice initiative in part because of her lack of criminal background, the prosecutor said. \nIn a tweeted statement, Ms Cooper's lawyer Robert Barnes thanked officials for the decision and suggested she might seek further legal action over the incident. \nMr Cooper has not publicly responded to news of the charge being dropped.

      "tags": "Ministry of Justice,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Criminal justice system,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The backlog in the Crown Courts has hit a record of 56,000 cases - meaning some cases are now being timetabled for 2023. The Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland - the cabinet minister in charge of the courts - is promising that a recovery plan will bring justice. But will those plans make a difference to victims waiting for their voices to be heard? \nIf you want to know what it feels like to wait for justice for a serious crime, consider the limbo that \"Jenny\" finds herself in. \nFor legal reasons, the BBC is not revealing any details of the case but, put briefly, she quietly and secretly coped for years with having been the victim of serious sexual violence. When the #MeToo movement took hold, she decided that she too had to speak out. \nIn 2018 detectives video-recorded Jenny's allegations and, after a long and complex investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded last summer that her abuser should be charged with serious offences. \nJenny agreed not to begin deep trauma therapy because it may affect her evidence in court. \nLast autumn, she learned when her abuser would face trial - and she was devastated. \nWeeping, she recalled her conversation with the police officer.\n\"The first court hearing and second court hearing were really close to each other. And so that gave me some faith, I thought it's taken this long to get to this point. But actually, maybe this next bit isn't going to be as long. \n\"I was asked... to provide dates of availability for court for the next nine months. So I thought, it's just another nine months. I can do this. And then I got the call - and they gave me the date. It was 2022. \n\"I said down the phone, 'You do mean 2021?' And they said, 'No, we mean, 2022.' And I got really angry. How can anyone believe that that is acceptable that you keep somebody in trauma and you don't give them the access [to the therapy] that they need?\"\nEvery week since has been a rollercoaster - to the point that Jenny cannot currently work and her family are rallying around to support her as she tries to comprehend the absence of justice. \n\"I start having a panic attack in the middle of town, I can't breathe. My body goes tight. I start convulsing, I'm sometimes sick, I'm shaking, I'm wailing. Trying to understand, why is that happening?\n\"There have been two occasions where I felt suicidal. The second time was when I was told the trial would be 2022. \n\"I felt like I'd been let down by the state. This was the whole system letting me down.\"\nJenny 's experience sounds extreme - but it is not exceptional, because of the enormous delays in criminal justice. \nLast month the watchdogs that report on the police, prosecution, prisons and probation all agreed that the backlog in Crown Courts of 54,000 cases was of grave concern. \nIn the last week, it's hit an all-time record of 56,000. \nThere was a backlog in the Crown Courts before the pandemic hit. Coronavirus made operations far harder because many courtrooms are too small to safely distance everyone who needs to be inside. \nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Buckland has defended the government's attempts to tackle these record backlogs. He has promised that his court recovery plan will work - but it will take time. \nToday, he's announcing 14 more temporary \"Nightingale Courts\" - converted spaces and hotel conference facilities that are part of \u00a3113m of spending to alleviate the pressure. \nPart of Manchester Crown Court will be knocked through to create a new \"super court\" for large socially-distanced gang trials. About 20,000 monthly remote video hearings - not without some technical problems - are already part of the court process. \n\"I think we're virtually at the limit of what we think is feasible, we continue to look to see what more can be done,\" he says. \"But I think the key now is, it's not just about capacity, it's about getting cases listed. Working with [judges], I think that we can make solid progress this year.\"\nThe Criminal Bar Association says new spaces are not enough - they need to be staffed. \nIn 2009-10, the budget for Crown Courts in England and Wales meant judges could \"sit\" for more than 108,000 days. Last year, it was 86,000. That roughly equates to only 45% of available court space being used, before the pandemic hit. \nMr Buckland says reductions in \"sitting days\" were driven by projections of falling levels of crime. His critics say it was also a political decision to deliver cuts. He is now promising a huge increase in sitting days - above 100,000 - in effect a return to where the courts were. \n\"I'm working out the number of days to be agreed with the Lord Chief Justice,\" he says. \"But I can assure everybody that that number [of sitting days] will be significantly in advance of 82,000 to many, many tens of thousands of days above that.\"\nIt's worth noting that before he became a minister, Mr Buckland sat as a part-time Crown Court judge. \nSo what does he say to victims like Jenny who are in limbo? \n\"That case is a dramatic example of a number of cases that concern me. I don't want to see victims and witnesses having to wait an inordinate length of time. I can understand her perspective.\n\"I accept what you say about the huge frustrations and the anxiety and the concern that is out there. But I'm doing everything I can to mitigate those problems.\"\nOne of the most significant changes has been the extension of the option of pre-trial video-recorded testimony and cross-examination for vulnerable victims and witnesses - in essence allowing them to give evidence long before a court hears the case. \nThe government has also pledged an extra \u00a340m to support vulnerable people waiting for trial - including \u00a316m for more independent sexual violence advisers - specialists who have been instrumental in supporting Jenny as she waits for justice. \nJenny meanwhile has been given permission by prosecutors to get additional help - but she can't get the specific deep counselling that could help her because the waiting list in her part of the country is staggeringly long. \n\"I'm resilient. I've got support. What about individuals who have got no family, no friends?\" she says. \"How many of those have walked away? Not because a crime didn't happen, but because the system hasn't enabled their voice to come out?\n\"The system is not broken because of Covid. It was well broken before that. And you might put your Nightingale courts up and running, but you need to go back to asking: what do the victims need?\""

      "text": "The Scottish government was not adequately prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new report by the public spending watchdog.\nAn Audit Scotland report said ministers had been planning for a pandemic - but had based their preparations on flu.\nThe watchdog also found the government acted quickly to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed by coronavirus. \nOpposition leaders said the failure to heed warnings and prepare better had cost the lives of care home residents.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon there were \"lots of lessons to learn\" from the report, but insisted that \"the steps we have taken are the right ones\".\nThe watchdog found that despite a number of pandemic planning exercises - in 2015, 2016 and 2018 - not all the actions identified in these projects were fully implemented. \nThese included measures to ensure access to enough personal protective equipment (PPE) and to quickly address social care capacity.\nThe report said the government had been \"slow\" to implement suggested changes in areas that would later become a \"significant challenge\" during the pandemic.\nIt stated that ministers \"could have been better prepared to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic\" and said lessons must be learned.\nHowever, auditors also found that actions such as cancelling non-urgent operations and increasing intensive care capacity had stopped the NHS from being overwhelmed in the first wave of Covid. \nThere were heated exchanges about the report during Ms Sturgeon's weekly question session at Holyrood, where she defended her government's response.\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said Audit Scotland had set out \"in black and white\" that the government was \"less prepared that it should have been\".\nShe said: \"Mistakes were made by this government, mistakes that cost the health of frontline workers, mistakes that cost the lives of care home residents, mistakes that built up over a decade of delay.\n\"The report makes it plain that her government was warned again and again, there were years where this first minister could have acted.\"\nMs Sturgeon said \"a range of national and local pandemic guidance and plans\" had been updated in light of the planning exercise - but stressed that they had focused on a flu pandemic rather than the \"different beast\" of Covid-19.\nShe said: \"However well prepared we were for flu, it became clear quite quickly that we were dealing with something of a completely different nature.\n\"If I reflect back on the last 10 months I actually think the more valid criticism of the Scottish government and other governments across the Western world is that in the early stages we maybe relied a bit too much on flu preparations, and perhaps hadn't done enough to prepare for the experiences of SARS-type outbreaks.\"\nThe first minister also said had \"sought to do nothing over the past 10 months other than every single day to do my best and make sure the government was doing its best to steer this country through the pandemic as safely as we could\".\nScottish Labour group leader Jackie Baillie said the report \"makes clear a pandemic should have been anticipated\", and said \"lives could have been saved\" had warnings been heeded.\nShe said: \"The government knew it could threaten the lives of people across Scotland, they were told the social care system would struggle to cope, and they were warned that access to protective equipment for doctors and nurses simply wasn't good enough. Now we know they didn't act on any of those warnings.\"\nMs Sturgeon replied that Scotland had \"never once run out of PPE\", and that her government had \"shown leadership\" throughout the pandemic.\nShe said she would look to learn lessons \"every day\", adding: \"Let's engage properly on these things, not just chuck soundbites across a parliamentary chamber.\"\nIt is estimated the pandemic will cost the NHS \u00a31.67bn in 2020-21 alone. \nThe knock-on effects mean there is a \"substantial backlog of patients\" waiting to be seen in the NHS, according to Audit Scotland.\nStephen Boyle, auditor general for Scotland, praised the \"extraordinary commitment\" of NHS staff but said the pandemic had \"highlighted the need to deal with long-standing health inequalities\". \nHe told Good Morning Scotland that the financial sustainability of the NHS had been under threat for years. \nMr Boyle said auditors had emphasised in a number of reports the importance of longer term planning, and shifting the balance of care away from large hospitals to community-based care. \nThe government was expecting a pandemic.  \nIt had rehearsed scenarios, carried out table-top exercises and simulations, all of which identified the need to better prepare care homes and to improve stockpiles of PPE.  \nAnd despite assessing a flu pandemic as a high risk, the government did not identify it as a stand-alone factor when considering the biggest challenges to the health service.  \nScotland is not alone in being caught off guard, and the report points to some of the things that went well.  \nSpeedily increasing the capacity of intensive care and hospital beds for example, and rapidly rolling out the use of digital technology.\nBut this is the first time we've seen in black and white from an independent body that there were shortcomings in the preparations.  \nA public inquiry will later look at the decisions that were made.\nDr Lewis Morrison, chairman of the BMA Scotland, said there was \"some concern\" that the government could have been better prepared, especially when it came to PPE for doctors. \nHe said pre-existing challenges for the NHS had been \"exacerbated by Covid\", and that restarting services was going to be a \"substantial challenge\".\nCovid has caused or contributed to the deaths of about 9,000 people in Scotland so far, with those from the most deprived areas or ethnic minorities among the worst affected. \nThe forecasted \u00a31.67bn cost of Covid in 2020-21 includes \u00a3324.5m on PPE and a near 10% rise in staffing costs. \nResponding to the report, the Royal College of Nursing said lessons needed to be learned and the \"immense pressure\" staff had faced for sustained period should be recognised. \nIt said nurses were concerned about potential long-term\u202frisks to their physical and mental health,\u202fincluding PTSD and long Covid.\u202f "

      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to hospital on Tuesday evening \"as a precautionary measure\" after feeling unwell, Buckingham Palace has said.\nPrince Philip, 99, was taken to the King Edward VII Hospital in central London, the statement added.\nA palace source told the BBC the duke travelled by car to the hospital, where he was admitted on his doctor's advice.\nHe had been feeling unwell for a few days, but it was not related to coronavirus, the source added.\nThey said the duke - who is due to celebrate his 100th birthday on 10 June - was \"in good spirits\" in hospital, where he is expected to remain for a few days of observation and rest.\nThe Queen, 94, has remained at Windsor Castle. Earlier, she spoke by telephone with the First Sea Lord, Admiral Tony Radakin, about the work of the Royal Navy at home and abroad.\nPrince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall also carried out official duties on Wednesday, visiting the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham to speak to patients and NHS staff.\nLast month, the palace announced that Prince Philip and the Queen had received Covid-19 vaccinations from a household doctor at Windsor Castle.\nThe couple have been spending the recent lockdown in England at Windsor Castle with a small household staff, nicknamed HMS Bubble.\nThey celebrated Christmas quietly at their Berkshire residence, instead of the traditional family gathering at the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk.\nA No 10 spokesman said Prime Minister Boris Johnson sends his \"best wishes\" to the duke as he \"undergoes a few days of rest in hospital\".\nThe palace is pretty protective of the privacy of members of the Royal Family when it comes to health issues; those hoping for running commentary are invariably disappointed.\nBut palace spokespeople have gone out of their way to emphasise that this was not an emergency admission and that it was precautionary.\nThe duke has been in and out of hospital a bit over the past few years, most recently just before Christmas in 2019 when he had treatment for a pre-existing medical condition.\nBut overall his later years were marked by his health and energy; he gave up smoking the day he married the Queen; he has never drunk heavily and was for decades a keen sportsman, driving himself constantly to stay fit and strong when others might have been tempted to take it easy.\nThe last time he was seen in public he seemed in good health, standing unaided - and he walked into hospital on Tuesday evening, having travelled there by car.\nIn December 2019, the duke was admitted to King Edward VII Hospital as a \"precautionary measure\" and received treatment for a \"pre-existing condition\". \nHe was discharged on Christmas Eve after four nights and driven to Sandringham, where he spent Christmas with the Queen. \nHe has received treatment for various other health conditions over the years including a blocked coronary artery in 2011, a bladder infection in 2012 and exploratory surgery on his abdomen in June 2013.\nThe duke missed events to mark a Battle of Jutland anniversary on \"doctor's advice\" in 2016, before retiring from public duties in 2017.\nIn April 2018, he was admitted to the King Edward VII hospital for a planned hip replacement, and was discharged after nine days.\nHe waved to the media as he was driven to Windsor Castle to recuperate, before attending the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex the following month, walking unaided.\nHe escaped injury after being involved in a car crash while driving near the Sandringham estate in January 2019.\nHis Land Rover Freelander landed on its side after colliding with a Kia as he pulled out of a driveway.\nPrince Philip was unhurt, but he visited hospital for a check-up. The Kia's two passengers required hospital treatment and he later wrote to one of them - Emma Fairweather - who broke her wrist in the accident.\nBuckingham Palace later announced that \"after careful consideration\" he had voluntarily surrendered his driving licence.\nLast July, Prince Philip and the Queen attended the private wedding of his granddaughter Princess Beatrice in Windsor. It was believed to be the first time the couple had attended a family gathering since lockdown began.\nLater that month, in his first official engagement in over a year, the duke took part in a ceremony at Windsor to hand over his role of colonel-in-chief of The Rifles to the Duchess of Cornwall, who received the honour at a separate ceremony at Highgrove.\nLast November, the Queen and Prince Philip marked their 73rd wedding anniversary by releasing a photograph of themselves opening a card made for them by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children."

      "text": "The National Theatre has said uncertainty over obtaining visas and work permits in mainland Europe has led it to shelve plans to tour there.\n\"We are currently not able to confirm any touring commitments in Europe as a result of Brexit legislation,\" it said.\nUK actors, musicians and crews can't work freely across the continent following the departure from the EU.\nOn Tuesday the government said it hopes to open negotiations with individual EU countries to help British artists tour.\nCulture minister Caroline Dinenage admitted there were \"a lot of obstacles to overcome\" after arts figures told a committee of MPs that Brexit had created an \"absolute crisis\".\nOne of those figures, freelance lighting designer Paule Constable, said she had been told that the producers of War Horse would no longer tour the show in Europe.\nThe National Theatre later clarified that it was in fact another of its acclaimed plays that had been affected.\n\"We had planned to take our production of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, not War Horse, to venues in Europe as part of the now postponed 2020-21 tour,\" the theatre's spokeswoman told BBC News.\nShe continued: \"The potential additional costs for visas and current lack of clarity around social security contributions as a result of the [Brexit] deal means regrettably it is currently not financially viable.\n\"We're awaiting further details of ongoing negotiations in this area and hope that in future we will be able to return to mainland Europe.\n\"However, due to the amount of time needed to plan a tour, we are not able to commit to European touring until we have clarity around these points.\"\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, which is based on Mark Haddon's 2003 novel, opened at the National in 2012. It won seven Olivier Awards and transferred to the West End before moving to Broadway and touring the world.\nThe National's concerns echoed those voiced before the House of Commons culture select committee on Tuesday and by more than 100 members of the performers' Equity union in an open letter to the government.\nSir Ian McKellen and Dame Julie Walters were among the signatories of the letter, which urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to negotiate new terms with the EU that would allow \"creative practitioners\" like themselves \"to travel to the EU visa-free for work\".\nDeborah Annetts, chief executive of the Incorporated Society of Musicians, told MPs that some British musicians were having their summer concert plans cancelled, while others had been sacked from European orchestras.\n\"I have been inundated with personal testimony from musicians as to the work that they have lost or are going to lose now in Europe as a result of the new visa and work permit arrangements,\" she said. \n\"Some of them are really quite heart-rending, with musicians saying they are thinking of giving up being a musician altogether.\"\nConstable, representing campaign group Freelancers Make Theatre Work, told the committee the current situation was \"absolute chaos\".\nSpeaking on BBC Two's Newsnight on Tuesday, This Life and Doctors star Cyril Nri said he and his fellow actors had been \"left behind\" and were \"losing out on so much\".\n\"The hurdles in our way at this moment in time are huge,\" he said. \"We are going to lose a cultural exchange and the ability to bring in huge amounts of revenue to this country and to develop the actors of the future.\"\nNri claimed that actors with European passports were now being cast ahead of those without, suggesting UK passports had become \"a mill around our necks\".\nDifferent EU countries have different arrangements for working musicians and other artists. Spain, for example, requires extra visas, while France does not.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, committee chairman Julian Knight MP said the creative industries, a \"world-leading part of the UK economy\", had effectively \"had to endure a no-deal Brexit\".\nMs Dinenage said striking deals on work permits and visas with individual countries that do require extra paperwork and fees was a \"more likely success route\" than attempting to reach an EU-wide agreement.\nAlastair Jones, a senior civil servant in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), told the committee: \"Those conversations are happening within government now, and they will be happening with member states very shortly.\"\nResponding to the National Theatre's statement on Wednesday, a government spokesperson said: \"Touring in Europe is currently not possible due to Covid-19 and EU member states have not set out plans for when it will be. We are working urgently with the UK's creative industries to help ensure they can work confidently in Europe once touring can safely resume.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Princess Latifa,United Arab Emirates,Mohammed Al Maktoum,Dubai",
      "text": "The daughter of Dubai's ruler who tried to flee the country in 2018 later sent secret video messages to friends accusing her father of holding her \"hostage\" as she feared for her life.\nIn footage shared with BBC Panorama, Princess Latifa Al Maktoum says commandos drugged her as she fled by boat and flew her back to detention.\nThe secret messages have stopped - and friends are urging the UN to step in.\nDubai and the UAE have previously said she is safe in the care of family.\nEx-UN rights envoy Mary Robinson, who had described Latifa as a \"troubled young woman\" after meeting her in 2018, now says she was \"horribly tricked\" by the princess's family.\nThe former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and president of Ireland has joined calls for international action to establish Latifa's current condition and whereabouts.\n\"I continue to be very worried about Latifa. Things have moved on. And so I think it should be investigated,\" she said.\nLatifa's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is one of the richest heads of state in the world, the ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nThe videos were recorded over several months on a phone Latifa was secretly given about a year after her capture and return to Dubai. She recorded them in a bathroom as it had the only door she could lock. \nIn the messages, she detailed how:\nLatifa's account of her capture and detention was revealed to Panorama by her close friend Tiina Jauhiainen, maternal cousin Marcus Essabri and campaigner David Haigh, who are all behind the Free Latifa campaign.\nThey say they have taken the difficult decision to release the messages now out of concern for Latifa's safety.\nIt was they who managed to establish contact with Latifa as she was held in a Dubai \"villa\", which she said had barred windows and police guards.\nPanorama has independently verified the details of where Latifa was held.  \nThe Missing Princess is on BBC One in the UK on Tuesday at 20:30, or watch it later on BBC iPlayer\nSheikh Mohammed has built a hugely successful city but rights activists say there is no tolerance of dissent and the judicial system can discriminate against women.\nHe has a vast horse-racing enterprise and frequently attends major events such as Royal Ascot, where he has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth II.\nBut he has faced severe criticism over Princess Latifa and also her stepmother, Princess Haya Bint Al Hussain, who fled to London in 2019 with her two children.\nLatifa, now 35, first tried to flee at 16 but it was only after contacting French businessman Herve Jaubert in 2011 that a long-planned escape was put into motion. This was done with the help of Ms Jauhiainen, initially her instructor for capoeira, a Brazilian martial art.\nOn 24 February 2018, Latifa and Ms Jauhiainen took an inflatable boat and jet ski to international waters, where Mr Jaubert was waiting in a US flagged yacht. \nBut eight days later, off India, the boat was boarded by commandos. Ms Jauhiainen says smoke grenades forced her and Latifa out of hiding in the bathroom below deck and they were held at gunpoint.\nLatifa was returned to Dubai, and hadn't been heard from since until now. \nMs Jauhiainen and the crew on the boat were freed after two weeks of detention in Dubai. The Indian government has never commented on its role.\nBefore her 2018 escape attempt, Latifa recorded another video which was posted on YouTube after her capture. \"If you are watching this video, it's not such a good thing, either I'm dead or I'm in a very, very, very bad situation,\" she said.\nIt was this that sparked huge international concern and calls for her release. The UAE came under intense pressure to account for her and a meeting was arranged with Ms Robinson.\nShe flew to Dubai in December 2018 at the request of her friend, Princess Haya, for a lunch at which Latifa was also present.  \nMs Robinson told Panorama she and Princess Haya had earlier been presented with details of Latifa's bipolar disorder, a condition she does not have.\nShe said she did not ask Latifa about her situation because she did not want to \"increase the trauma\" of Latifa's \"condition\".\nNine days after the lunch, the UAE's foreign ministry published photographs of Ms Robinson with Latifa, which it said was proof that the princess was safe and well.\nMs Robinson said: \"I was particularly tricked when the photographs went public. That was a total surprise... I was absolutely stunned.\"\nIn 2019, the tensions within Dubai's ruling family were laid bare before England's High Court after one of the sheikh's wives, Princess Haya, fled to the UK with two of her children and applied for a protection order and non-molestation order against the sheikh. \nLast year, the High Court issued a series of fact-finding judgments that said Sheikh Mohammed had ordered and orchestrated the forcible return of Latifa in 2002 and 2018, as well as the unlawful abduction from the UK in 2000 of her older sister Princess Shamsa, who had also tried to escape.\nThe court found Sheikh Mohammed \"continues to maintain a regime whereby both these two young women are deprived of their liberty\".\nLatifa's friends had hoped that the court case in March last year that ruled against Sheikh Mohammed, calling him \"not honest\" and in favour of Princess Haya, might help.\nOn the decision to release the messages now, Ms Jauhiainen just says that \"a lot of time has passed\" since contact was lost.\nShe says she thought hard about releasing the video messages now, but adds: \"I feel that she would want us to fight for her, and not give up.\"\nThe governments of Dubai and the UAE have failed to respond to requests for comment from the BBC about Latifa's current condition."

      "tags": "Personal finance,Housing market,UK economy",
      "text": "UK house prices climbed 8.5% in 2020, the highest annual growth rate since October 2014, according to official figures.\nThe average UK house price reached a record high of \u00a3252,000 in December 2020, the Office for National Statistics said.\nThe North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%.\nThe stamp duty holiday due to end this March contributed to the rise, the ONS said.\nSpending more time at home in the pandemic meant some people also decided they needed more space.\nThat was reflected in the average price of detached properties climbing by twice as much as flats and maisonettes during 2020, up 10% and 5% respectively.\nMeanwhile Wales experienced the fastest price growth, with property values rising 10.7% to \u00a3184,000.\nIn England, prices climbed 8.5% to \u00a3269,000, in Scotland, 8.4% to \u00a3163,000 and in Northern Ireland 5.3% to \u00a3148,000.\n\"Recent price increases may reflect a range of factors including pent-up demand, some possible changes in housing preferences since the pandemic and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations,\" the ONS said.\nThe UK housing market is made up of lots of local markets, with different factors affecting property prices such as the performance of schools and the availability of jobs. The ONS figures are based on sale completions.\nAlthough average London prices were up by 3.5%, over last year, prices fell in the capital by \u00a35,000 between November and December, despite a UK-wide price increase of 1.2% over the month.\nBut the city still has the highest average house price in the UK, at \u00a3496,000.\nThe North East continued to have the lowest average house price at \u00a3141,000, and has become the final English region to surpass its pre-economic downturn peak of July 2007.\n\"2020 was the year that fundamentals came home to roost,\" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country. \n\"There was no escaping a lack of space for households who suddenly found they were living on top of each other with little respite. That has powered annual growth that reached a six-year high.\"\nThere were four major drivers of overall house price rises in 2020, said Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital.\n\"The temporary stamp duty reduction and cheap debt as a result of very low interest rates, which give buyers a 'discount'; the release of pent-up supply and demand and desire to improve surroundings amongst existing homeowners; and the 'flight to safety', since in times of uncertainty, people want to keep their money in a stable asset with low volatility.\n\"But looking to the future when the temporary stamp duty reduction ends, we're likely to see a slowdown in house price rises,\" she said.\n\"However, there is still some life in the market as lockdown helps to concentrate many potential buyers and sellers' minds as far as moving is concerned,\" said north London estate agent Jeremy Leaf. \n\"Intense speculation remains as to whether the 31 March stamp duty deadline will be extended and we can't help but have sympathy for many who have started the process several months ago who have been unavoidably delayed by a backlog in searches, surveys, conveyancing, or all three, to say nothing of problems in the new-build industry.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Patterdale,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe prime minister has stressed England will ease its coronavirus restrictions \"cautiously\" and it is \"absolutely right\" to take a \"data not dates\" approach to leaving lockdown. Boris Johnson's comments come just days before he is expected to set out a road map on Monday for easing measures. He said relaxation of measures would be done in \"stages\" and that the reopening of hospitality was one of the last things to return after the first lockdown. Speaking at a mass vaccination centre in Cwmbran, south Wales, Mr Johnson said the government wanted to be \"going one way from now on, based on the incredible vaccination rollout\".\nHealthy, young volunteers will be infected with coronavirus to test vaccines and treatments in the world's first Covid-19 \"human challenge\" study. The study, which will take place in the UK and has received ethics approval, will start in the next few weeks and recruit 90 people aged 18-30. They will be exposed to the virus in a safe and controlled environment while medics monitor their health. The trials will help scientists work out the smallest amount of coronavirus needed to cause infection, and how the body's immune system reacts to it. This will give doctors a better understanding of Covid-19, which will feed into the development of vaccines and treatments.\nFatigue, headache, sore throat and diarrhoea should be added to the existing three symptoms which trigger a Covid test, researchers have suggested. Currently, government guidance states anyone with a cough, fever or loss of smell or taste qualifies. Testing for the additional four symptoms could pick up 40% more cases, according to King's College London and the Zoe Symptom Study app. The government said an expert scientific group keeps the virus symptoms under review and \"the main symptoms have been carefully selected to capture those most likely to have Covid-19, while not capturing a great number of people who do not\".\nThe charity Pregnant Then Screwed has lost its legal challenge against the government for indirect sexual discrimination over the amount of support self-employed mothers received. The group said women who had maternity leave got less money from a fund set up to help those hit by the Covid pandemic and lockdown restrictions. But a judge ruled the chancellor had properly considered the women's situation. Pregnant Then Screwed said the judgment was \"fundamentally flawed\" and was considering its options for appeal.\nMore than \u00a3500,000 has been raised to help a mountain rescue volunteer who suffered life-changing injuries on his way to help campers who had broken coronavirus lockdown rules. Chris Lewis, a member of the Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team in the Lake District, suffered severe spinal injuries when he fell 500ft (150m). His colleagues have described the fundraising efforts as \"phenomenal\". \"What's really struck me is the number of people who have donated. The fact more than 20,000 have contributed is remarkable,\" said Mike Blakey, a fellow volunteer with the team. The campers, from Liverpool and Leicester, have both been fined \u00a3200. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page, including this in-depth piece which looks at how we will know if the vaccine rollout in the UK is working.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Texas power outage,Snow,Texas,United States,Severe weather,Houston",
      "text": "A huge winter storm sweeping across the southern US has killed at least 21 people and left millions without power.\nThere have been widespread blackouts in Texas, where the energy grid was overwhelmed by a surge in demand.\nMillions of people in the state, which rarely experiences such low temperatures, have been struggling to cope with the lack of power and frigid conditions.\nThe extreme weather is forecast to continue until the weekend.\nDeaths attributed to the storm have been recorded in Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, North Carolina and Missouri. \nBy Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service (NWS) said that the worst of the storm had moved through Texas, but kept more than 100 million Americans under a winter weather warning. \nBut historically low temperatures are expected to remain for days, the NWS said, with more than 71% of the US covered by snow.\nThe freezing storm has even reached northern and central parts of Mexico, where millions of people have experienced days of intermittent power cuts.\n\"I'm in Houston, Texas freezing to death,\" one Twitter user, Chris Prince, wrote. \"No power, no heat, no water. I have four young children. How is this happening right now?\"\nAnother user, Josh Morgerman, wrote that a friend in Texas had resorted to \"burning furniture in the fireplace\" to stay warm.\nA senior director for Ercot - the Electric Reliability Council of Texas - told CNN on Wednesday that Texans could continue to experience rotating power outages into Thursday. \nRotating outages are the \"best case\" scenario, Dan Woodfin said. \"I don't think it's likely that we're going to have enough available based on our forecasts... and that we're going to have everybody back on today, or before at least the morning peak tomorrow\". \nScientists have linked climate change to an increasing number of severe weather events worldwide, including hurricanes, heat waves and floods. \nThe recorded deaths include people who have died in traffic accidents, as well as some who suffered carbon monoxide poisoning from running cars and generators indoors to stay warm. \n\"This is an absolute public health disaster,\" one medical official in Houston told the local television station KPRC-TV. \"[Carbon monoxide poisoning] certainly happens when it gets cold, but never in these numbers.\nOne county said it had seen more than 300 suspected carbon monoxide cases during the cold snap. \"It's turning into a mini mass casualty event,\" one Harris County doctor told the Houston Chronicle.\nAt least four people were killed following a house fire in Houston that officials said may have been sparked by candles. Separately, police said two men found alongside a Houston highway were believed to have died due to the cold.\nMeanwhile in North Carolina, a tornado spawned by the same storm left three people dead and 10 injured.\nThe cold snap has also forced Covid-19 vaccination centres to close for several days and hindered deliveries of doses in a handful of US states. Some centres raced to use vaccines that could no longer be refrigerated at the required temperature.\nThe state has seen some of its coldest temperatures in more than 30 years - some areas hit 0F (-18C) on Sunday - and US President Joe Biden earlier approved a state of emergency.\nSome two million people in Texas are still without power. At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Governor Greg Abbott said that 1.2 million Texans have so far had their power restored, with more coming \"on board\". \nThe governor signed an executive order preventing any Texas natural gas from being exported outside of the state until 21 February. \nMr Abbott also told reporters that every source of power in Texas had been \"compromised\" - seemingly walking back earlier comments blaming renewable energy for the state's blackouts. \nThe scale of the power outage has prompted anger from some officials and residents. Mr Abbott has called the situation \"unacceptable\".\nHe called for an investigation into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot), an energy co-operative responsible for the vast majority of the state's electricity to get to the \"root of any missteps\" that led to the widespread outages. He has told local media that the body should be reformed and its leaders should resign.\n\"This was a total failure,\" he told ABC News. \"They showed that they were not reliable.\"\nIn a tweet on Tuesday, Ercot said it was \"restoring load as fast as we can in a stable manner\". \nHomes in the state are not normally insulated for cold weather, meaning that indoor temperatures in homes quickly dropped to freezing after heat systems failed. Frozen pipes also burst, despite attempts by some homeowners to insulate them from the cold using blankets.\nChuck Hairston, who lives in a suburb of Fort Worth, had been without electricity for about 31 hours when he spoke to the BBC on Tuesday.\nHe said his family had slept beside the fireplace covered in \"every blanket and pillow we could find in the house\". He tried local hotels, but they were either fully booked or did not have electricity.\nIcy roads have also led to a spate of traffic accidents and people have been advised to avoid travel where possible.\nHow are you coping with the freezing conditions where you are?

GM and Volvo Cars have set similarly ambitious targets. \nThis year car makers in the EU will face hefty fines if they fail to meet emissions standards. The UK meanwhile has said it plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, with France is targeting the same by 2040.\nDavid Leggett, automotive analyst at GlobalData, said: \"Automotive electrification is an expensive proposition for vehicle manufacturers, but they are nevertheless concluding that they must take the investment hit to be well-positioned competitively later this decade when the end for new internal combustion engine vehicle sales will be in sight in a number of markets.\" \nOn Tuesday it emerged that Coventry Airport could be the site for a gigafactory - a plant to manufacture electric car batteries.\nThe UK government previously announced \u00a3500m funding as part of a ten point plan to support the electrification of vehicles, including developing gigafactories across the UK."

      "text": "The Scottish government was not adequately prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new report by the public spending watchdog.\nAn Audit Scotland report said ministers had been planning for a pandemic - but had based their preparations on flu.\nThe watchdog also found the government acted quickly to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed by coronavirus. \nOpposition leaders said the failure to heed warnings and prepare better had cost the lives of care home residents.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon there were \"lots of lessons to learn\" from the report, but insisted that \"the steps we have taken are the right ones\".\nThe watchdog found that despite a number of pandemic planning exercises - in 2015, 2016 and 2018 - not all the actions identified in these projects were fully implemented. \nThese included measures to ensure access to enough personal protective equipment (PPE) and to quickly address social care capacity.\nThe report said the government had been \"slow\" to implement suggested changes in areas that would later become a \"significant challenge\" during the pandemic.\nIt stated that ministers \"could have been better prepared to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic\" and said lessons must be learned.\nHowever, auditors also found that actions such as cancelling non-urgent operations and increasing intensive care capacity had stopped the NHS from being overwhelmed in the first wave of Covid. \nThere were heated exchanges about the report during Ms Sturgeon's weekly question session at Holyrood, where she defended her government's response.\nScottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said Audit Scotland had set out \"in black and white\" that the government was \"less prepared that it should have been\".\nShe said: \"Mistakes were made by this government, mistakes that cost the health of frontline workers, mistakes that cost the lives of care home residents, mistakes that built up over a decade of delay.\n\"The report makes it plain that her government was warned again and again, there were years where this first minister could have acted.\"\nMs Sturgeon said \"a range of national and local pandemic guidance and plans\" had been updated in light of the planning exercise - but stressed that they had focused on a flu pandemic rather than the \"different beast\" of Covid-19.\nShe said: \"However well prepared we were for flu, it became clear quite quickly that we were dealing with something of a completely different nature.\n\"If I reflect back on the last 10 months I actually think the more valid criticism of the Scottish government and other governments across the Western world is that in the early stages we maybe relied a bit too much on flu preparations, and perhaps hadn't done enough to prepare for the experiences of SARS-type outbreaks.\"\nThe first minister also said had \"sought to do nothing over the past 10 months other than every single day to do my best and make sure the government was doing its best to steer this country through the pandemic as safely as we could\".\nScottish Labour group leader Jackie Baillie said the report \"makes clear a pandemic should have been anticipated\", and said \"lives could have been saved\" had warnings been heeded.\nShe said: \"The government knew it could threaten the lives of people across Scotland, they were told the social care system would struggle to cope, and they were warned that access to protective equipment for doctors and nurses simply wasn't good enough. Now we know they didn't act on any of those warnings.\"\nMs Sturgeon replied that Scotland had \"never once run out of PPE\", and that her government had \"shown leadership\" throughout the pandemic.\nShe said she would look to learn lessons \"every day\", adding: \"Let's engage properly on these things, not just chuck soundbites across a parliamentary chamber.\"\nIt is estimated the pandemic will cost the NHS \u00a31.67bn in 2020-21 alone. \nThe knock-on effects mean there is a \"substantial backlog of patients\" waiting to be seen in the NHS, according to Audit Scotland.\nStephen Boyle, auditor general for Scotland, praised the \"extraordinary commitment\" of NHS staff but said the pandemic had \"highlighted the need to deal with long-standing health inequalities\". \nHe told Good Morning Scotland that the financial sustainability of the NHS had been under threat for years. \nMr Boyle said auditors had emphasised in a number of reports the importance of longer term planning, and shifting the balance of care away from large hospitals to community-based care. \nThe government was expecting a pandemic.  \nIt had rehearsed scenarios, carried out table-top exercises and simulations, all of which identified the need to better prepare care homes and to improve stockpiles of PPE.  \nAnd despite assessing a flu pandemic as a high risk, the government did not identify it as a stand-alone factor when considering the biggest challenges to the health service.  \nScotland is not alone in being caught off guard, and the report points to some of the things that went well.  \nSpeedily increasing the capacity of intensive care and hospital beds for example, and rapidly rolling out the use of digital technology.\nBut this is the first time we've seen in black and white from an independent body that there were shortcomings in the preparations.  \nA public inquiry will later look at the decisions that were made.\nDr Lewis Morrison, chairman of the BMA Scotland, said there was \"some concern\" that the government could have been better prepared, especially when it came to PPE for doctors. \nHe said pre-existing challenges for the NHS had been \"exacerbated by Covid\", and that restarting services was going to be a \"substantial challenge\".\nCovid has caused or contributed to the deaths of about 9,000 people in Scotland so far, with those from the most deprived areas or ethnic minorities among the worst affected. \nThe forecasted \u00a31.67bn cost of Covid in 2020-21 includes \u00a3324.5m on PPE and a near 10% rise in staffing costs. \nResponding to the report, the Royal College of Nursing said lessons needed to be learned and the \"immense pressure\" staff had faced for sustained period should be recognised. \nIt said nurses were concerned about potential long-term\u202frisks to their physical and mental health,\u202fincluding PTSD and long Covid.\u202f "

      "tags": "UK devolution",
      "text": "In the past few years, debate has raged about whether the United Kingdom faces a future without Scotland.\nPolls have suggested for months that support for Scottish independence has been higher than for Scotland staying in the UK.\nIn Wales, independence is still a minority view, but a campaign aimed at making it a reality has gained momentum in the past year.\nNow, a former adviser to David Cameron on devolution says there is \"no room for complacency\" about support for the union in Wales.\nLord Dunlop was also commissioned by Theresa May in July 2019 to produce a government review into strengthening the union. \nCompleted more than a year ago, it remains unpublished.\nNow, as some Labour peers describe the union as \"under threat as never before\", cross-party pressure is mounting on the government to release it. \nBut how \"under threat\" is the union in Wales?\nJanuary's Welsh Political Barometer poll for ITV Wales and Cardiff University suggested 22% would vote yes if a referendum was held.\nMost, 53%, told the poll they would say no, while a quarter of respondents said they did not know.\nMeanwhile, the pro-independence campaign Yes Cymru says its membership has jumped from 2,000 at the start of 2020 to more than 17,000. \nElsewhere, rows have broken out between UK and Welsh ministers over who should control funds replacing EU aid and a new trade law that the UK government says will protect Welsh businesses, but critics say will centralise power in London. \nWelsh ministers have said Westminster-Cardiff relations have worsened since Boris Johnson took over from Theresa May - though the UK government says there has been regular engagement on issues such as coronavirus and Brexit. \nLord Dunlop says reforming intergovernmental relations is one of the key recommendations in his unpublished report.\n\"It needs to be less ad hoc, more predictable, a flow of meetings, I think the agendas need to be more about joint decision-making. It needs to feel jointly owned.\"\nHe said people in Wales should not get \"carried away by individual polls\" but there was not \"any room for complacency\".\n\"There's been some suggestion devolution has failed because it hasn't killed nationalism. Whereas my view is devolution isn't a failed project - it's an unfinished project.\" \nHe believes making discussions between governments more \"transparent\" would encourage a \"constructive atmosphere to intergovernmental relations rather than the grievance-fest that it has been in the past.\" \nPrivately, there are some Conservative MPs pondering if the Dunlop review is now out of date or a bit too \"tame\" to save the union.\nOther, more devolution-sceptic voices in the party resent talk of more devolution or even phrases like \"four-nations approach\".\nMrs May's de-facto deputy Sir David Lidington warned her cabinet in the past not to be complacent about Wales.\nNow outside government, he said while it was \"nice to be flattered\", if Welsh ministers felt relations were better under Mrs May, the UK government should \"give some thought as to what lies behind that\". \n\"It's not rocket science,\" he said.\n\"It's allowing enough time for consultation, being open with people, sharing as much information as you can, inviting devolved officials and ministers to some of the cross-departmental committees and Cobra meetings that are sorting out UK-wide policy but have a devolved impact,\" he said.\nHe said that should be \"supported by confidential, private conversations between ministers\".\nPolitical analyst Laura McAllister says Welsh independence is a topic on all parties' radars.\n\"We know at the moment independence in Wales remains a minority interest,\" she said. \n\"But, and I think this is an important consideration, there is real momentum behind the Yes Cymru campaign and a real sense of growth and energy around it which of course contrasts with those who want to keep the union in place at all costs - because there isn't an energy around that and there isn't a kind of strategic plan either.\"\nBehind the scenes in Downing Street, a Welsh special adviser has been working in No 10's union unit over the past few months.\nIt is understood the UK government will soon be hosting regular \"lobby briefings\" for journalists with the Welsh Secretary Simon Hart.\nDowning Street sources say while their approach is more defensive when it comes to Scotland, the prime minister is excited by opportunities in Wales.\nOne senior UK government source said: \"There's definitely an increased recognition within No 10 that Wales is a strong unionist nation, and that there is an opportunity to build upon the 2019 general election result by levelling up the Welsh communities that have felt left behind by both the Welsh Government and previous UK governments.\" \nMr Hart has previously said Welsh ministers want to use new spending powers granted through the UK Internal Market Act to invest in Wales.\nIn response to recent calls for the Dunlop report to be published, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said it would be published \"in due course\" but it would be alongside a joint review of intergovernmental relations reforms with the devolved administrations.\nMeanwhile, Labour have set up a constitutional commission advised by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to look at devolution across the UK. \nLabour's Shadow Welsh Secretary Nia Griffith said: \"Unfortunately some comments the prime minister has made has made Wales feels as if it's an afterthought. \n\"Of course people are saying: 'Would we be better just with our own Welsh Government?' But obviously what we all have to remember is there are so many things we can also do together. \n\"I think the really important thing is listening to what people are saying. What is it that is making people want independence and what do they mean by independence? \n\"Do they actually mean the sort of independent decision making that we currently have in Welsh Government?\n\"Or do they mean completely trying to cut off and have no rapport whatsoever - that's what the first discussion has to be.\"\nPlaid Cymru, the Green Party, Gwlad Gwlad and Propel - if it is registered in time - are standing on an independence platform in May's Welsh parliament elections.\nMeanwhile, the Abolish the Assembly Party want Welsh devolution abolished completely. \nPlaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said there was a \"growing realisation the length and breadth of Wales that unless we act, we will be left behind as an appendage to England in a rump UK\".\nShe said that \"for the first time ever, independence will be a key issue going into a Senedd election\"."

Can I call?'\" said Mr Hansson.\n\"And in some cases they get outright belligerent when they see you've opened it three times but have still not replied.\"\nUse of tracking pixels is governed in the UK and other parts of Europe by 2003's Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (Pecr) and 2016's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nThey require organisations to inform recipients of the pixels, and in most cases to obtain consent.\nOne privacy consultant said the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) had previously ruled that such consent must be \"unambiguous\" and \"a clear affirmative act\".\n\"Solely placing something in a privacy notice is not consent, and it is hardly transparent,\" said Pat Walshe from Privacy Matters. \n\"The fact that tracking will take place and what that involves should be put in the user's face and involve them opting in.\n\"The law is clear enough, what we need is regulatory enforcement. Just because this practice is widespread doesn't mean it's correct and acceptable.\"\nMr Walshe noted that the ICO had used a pixel within its own e-newsletter.\nThe watchdog told the BBC it was used to track email openings, but not users' locations, adding: \"We're working with our provider to remove the pixel functionality and this should be completed soon.\"\nThe BBC asked some of the companies identified by Hey for their own response.\nBritish Airways said: \"We take customer data extremely seriously, and use a cross-industry standard approach that allows us to understand how effective our customer communications are.\"\nTalkTalk said: \"As is common across our industry and others, we track the performance of different types of communications to understand what our customers prefer.

      "text": "The Australian state of Victoria and the New Zealand city of Auckland will both exit snap lockdowns on Thursday.\nAuthorities in Australia said they had gained control of a hotel quarantine cluster in Melbourne, which prompted a five-day lockdown.\nNew Zealand will lift curbs put in place in Auckland three days ago, despite three new local cases.\nBoth countries, known for their strict measures, have seen relatively few deaths and cases during the pandemic.\nThe state of Victoria recently saw a cluster of 19 cases emerge after a person working at a Melbourne hotel housing quarantined cases unknowingly caught the UK variant of the virus and carried it into the community.\nNo additional locally acquired cases were found on Wednesday. But the state government is now under pressure to explain how the virus escaped hotel quarantine, after similar breaches nationally in recent times.\nVictorian Premier Daniel Andrews defended the \"short, sharp circuit-breaker\" lockdown, saying it had safeguarded against a potential local third wave. \n\"There was simply no alternative but to follow the advice provided,\" he said. \"I am very proud of every single Victorian for the work they've done, and the sacrifices they've made.\"\nOrganisers of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne said separately that spectators could attend the finals week, but only 7,477 people would be allowed at each session which is about 50% capacity.\nWith the ease in restrictions the state's six million residents are no longer barred from leaving home and schools can reopen. But some curbs remain including a limit on visitors to homes and mandatory mask-wearing in packed indoor spaces. \nPrior to the outbreak, Victoria - Australia's second most populous state - had not seen a local infection for 28 days.\nThe state had already endured two previous lockdowns - including a four-month shutdown of its state capital Melbourne - due to failures in the hotel quarantine scheme.\nMr Andrews emphasised the \"hyper-infectious\" nature of the UK variant as justification for announcing the lockdown last Friday.\nBut some experts - including the Australian Medical Association - have been calling for a review of hotel quarantine environments due to concerns about airborne transmission.\nVictoria is now considering a purpose-built quarantine facility.\nEarlier this week the city of Auckland entered a three-day lockdown - the first in the country for six months - after a family of three tested positive for Covid-19. At least two of them had the UK variant.\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the lockdown would end as planned at midnight, even though three more locally transmitted cases have since been discovered. They include students from a high school which will remain shut till next week.\n\"We wanted to make sure we took a cautious approach because that's much, much better than getting it wrong and having a large scale outbreak and a long lockdown,\" she explained.\nWith the end of the lockdown, Auckland's two million residents can go back to work and school, and public and hospitality venues can reopen. But social distancing in public is still required and gatherings of more than 100 people are still banned.\nThe rest of the country will have curbs loosened further, with no restrictions on movements or gatherings, at midnight."

The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else.\nHowever, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to \"think particularly carefully\" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including:\nThere is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAlthough Scotland moves to Covid protection level zero on 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said keeping the mandatory use of face coverings past then would give \"added protection and assurance\" to people who were particularly vulnerable.\nFrom 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace.\nHowever, companies still have legally binding health and safety responsibilities - and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. \nSome firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people.\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough) is available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. \nYou may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons.\nRead the updated government advice.\nAlthough the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it \"expects and recommends\" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport.\nYou should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. \nThe NHS Volunteer Responders programme is still available to offer support.\nData shows Covid vaccines are highly effective in most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection.\nBeing double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. \nYou should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not, book through the NHS website or call 119.\nThe most vulnerable people are likely to be offered booster jabs from September, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. \nYou are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions.\nThe pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The government recommends several support websites.\nIf you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on the NHS Shielded Patient List. \nA combination of factors can contribute to a person's risk, including: \nHigh risk categories include people: "

Can I call?'\" said Mr Hansson.\n\"And in some cases they get outright belligerent when they see you've opened it three times but have still not replied.\"\nUse of tracking pixels is governed in the UK and other parts of Europe by 2003's Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (Pecr) and 2016's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nThey require organisations to inform recipients of the pixels, and in most cases to obtain consent.\nOne privacy consultant said the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) had previously ruled that such consent must be \"unambiguous\" and \"a clear affirmative act\".\n\"Solely placing something in a privacy notice is not consent, and it is hardly transparent,\" said Pat Walshe from Privacy Matters. \n\"The fact that tracking will take place and what that involves should be put in the user's face and involve them opting in.\n\"The law is clear enough, what we need is regulatory enforcement. Just because this practice is widespread doesn't mean it's correct and acceptable.\"\nMr Walshe noted that the ICO had used a pixel within its own e-newsletter.\nThe watchdog told the BBC it was used to track email openings, but not users' locations, adding: \"We're working with our provider to remove the pixel functionality and this should be completed soon.\"\nThe BBC asked some of the companies identified by Hey for their own response.\nBritish Airways said: \"We take customer data extremely seriously, and use a cross-industry standard approach that allows us to understand how effective our customer communications are.\"\nTalkTalk said: \"As is common across our industry and others, we track the performance of different types of communications to understand what our customers prefer. We do not share this data externally.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Loneliness,Children,Disability,Children's Commissioner for England,Young people,Mental health",
      "text": "They are not likely to get seriously ill with Covid and there have been very few deaths. But children are still the victims of the virus - and our response to it - in many other ways.\nFrom increasing rates of mental health problems to concerns about rising levels of abuse and neglect and the potential harm being done to the development of babies, the pandemic is threatening to have a devastating legacy on the nation's young.\nThe closure of schools is, of course, damaging to children's education. But schools are not just a place for learning. They are places where kids socialise, develop emotionally and, for some, a refuge from troubled family life.\nProf Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, perhaps put it most clearly when he told MPs on the Education Select Committee earlier this month: \"When we close schools we close their lives.\"\nHe says the pandemic has caused a range of harms to children across the board from being isolated and lonely to suffering from sleep problems and reduced physical activity - alongside school closures all children's sport is currently banned as it has been at various points during the pandemic. The only exception is for organised outdoor sport for the under 12s in Scotland. \nMany experts are baffled by the approach to children's sport given the low risks of transmission outdoors and the clear benefits for emotional and physical wellbeing - the UK has some of the highest rates of child obesity in the world.\nBut it's not just the closure of schools. The stress the pandemic has put on families, with rising levels of unemployment and financial insecurity combined with the stay-at-home orders, has put strain on home life up and down the land.\nThe NSPCC says the amount of counselling for loneliness provided by its Childline service has risen by 10% since the pandemic started. Neil Homer, who has been volunteering for the service since 2009, has never known anything like it. \"It's had a devastating impact,\" he says.\nThe experience of this 16-year-old is typical of the calls that come in. \"I feel really sad and lonely. Most days I find myself just lost in my own thoughts and feeling numb.\"\nUnsurprisingly, there are clear signs the upheaval in children's lives is having an impact on children's mental health.\nThe Mental Health of Children and Young People in England 2020 report, which is produced by NHS Digital and the Office for National Statistics, is the official stocktake of the state of children's well-being.\nIt has been tracking more than 3,000 young people over the last four years. Its latest findings, published in the autumn, found overall one in six children aged five to 16 had a probable mental health disorder, up from one in nine three years previously. Older girls had the highest rates.\nChildren involved in the research cited family tensions and financial concerns as well as feeling isolated from friends and fear about the virus for causing their distress.\nOlder teenagers and adolescents have been affected too as they have seen their prospects shrink. The Youth Index, published in January by the Prince's Trust in partnership with YouGov, has been tracking the well-being of young people aged 16 to 25 for 12 years. \nIt found more than half of young people were always or often feeling anxious - the highest level ever recorded. Jonathan Townsend, of The Prince's Trust, fears young people are \"losing all hope for their future\".\nAt the opposite end of the age spectrum, health visitors, who support parents and babies during the early years, are worried about the impact on newborns.\nResearch shows the first two to three years of a baby's life is the most crucial period of human development. This has become known as the 1,001 days agenda. If children fall behind, they can find themselves at a lifelong disadvantage.\nThe Institute of Health Visiting says services have been badly hit during the pandemic with these specialist nurses pulled away from their duties to help out on the Covid front line. In some areas, health visitor numbers have dropped by half.\nThis and the social distancing rules mean for a lot of parents the only support they have received has been online. Meanwhile, the absence of baby and parent groups, and the friendships that naturally develop from them, has meant the babies of the pandemic have not benefited from the stimulus of social contact that is vital to their development.\nAlison Morton, head of the Institute of Health Visiting, says this has been an \"invisible\" cost of the pandemic, but one that will have a lasting impact, particularly in the most deprived areas. Babies and children, she says, are being \"harmed\" by what she says is the secondary indirect impact of the virus.\nThere are around one million children with special educational needs and disabilities - around one in 10 of whom have complex and life-limiting conditions, such as severe cerebral palsy or cystic fibrosis.\nThe nature of the pandemic and the response to it have created even greater challenges for many of these children and their families.\nThose with the most complex conditions can require care at home from specialist nurses and carers. This has become harder to obtain as staff have been redeployed or charities forced to cut back on their support networks. For those with compromised immune systems, shielding has been a constant almost throughout.\nDame Christine Lenehan, director of the Council for Disabled Children, says in some cases children have ended up \"incarcerated\" in their homes. \"There are some who have barely had any formal education since lockdown began.\"\nShe says even those who are the most independent have struggled, with many schools - she estimates more than half - unable to address the additional learning needs of children with special needs who are learning remotely.\nFor some children, the pandemic has had dire consequences with the numbers being harmed and abused on the rise.\nBetween April and September there were 285 reports by councils of child deaths and incidents of serious harm, which includes child sexual exploitation. This was a rise of more than a quarter on the same period the year before.\nBut children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, is worried this is just the tip of the iceberg, arguing the lockdowns, closure of schools and stay-at-home orders have led to a generation of vulnerable children becoming \"invisible\" to social workers.\nReferrals that would normally come in from a variety of sources, form health visitors to school nurses, dropped last year. This, she says, makes no sense given the impact of the pandemic on family life.\nFigures show that before the pandemic there were already more than two million children in England and Wales living in households affected by one of the \"toxic trio\" - domestic abuse, parental drug and alcohol dependency or severe mental health issues. The fear is this will have risen significantly.\nThe governments across the UK, of course, maintain they have prioritised children. Investment has been made in mental health services and schools are being prioritised as the first thing to open once lockdown starts to lift.\nBut is this enough? Research by Ms Longfield's organisation shows only one in three children who needed mental health support was getting it before the pandemic - and she believes that will now be even worse given the impact of the pandemic on both services and mental health.\nShe warns that children will be living with the legacy of the pandemic for \"years to come\", particularly those from disadvantaged communities, and wants to see a major investment in support for children.\nSunil Bhopal, an expert in child health at Newcastle University, agrees. He says too many people dismiss the impact on children, claiming they are \"resilient\" and will \"bounce back\". \nHe believes this is misguided and instead growing up in a world where even \"playing with your friends is illegal\" threatens to cause long-lasting damage to many. \"I don't think it is an exaggeration to say children and their families have been abandoned.\"\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 15 million people in the UK have received a first dose of coronavirus vaccine - but how will we know if it's working? \nThere are some early signs of a possible vaccine effect in falling deaths among people aged over 80. \nBut data on cases and hospital patients is not so clear.\nIt is hard to separate the effect of the vaccine from that of lockdown.\nSo the government will review other data before deciding on easing restrictions.\nBBC News analysis, using data from England only, suggests the vaccine is starting to push the numbers down.\nCoronavirus deaths are falling faster for vaccinated than unvaccinated groups.\nOn average, deaths of over-80s fell by 53% between 28 January and 11 February, compared with 44% for under-80s.\nThis week, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, said: \"The earliest indications would imply there is some effect.\n\"But I think it's too early to put a number on that.\n\"We would expect to see some evidence that is strong enough to put into the public domain in the next few weeks.\"\nBut we're not seeing a strong vaccine effect in other statistics.\nHospital admissions for over-85s dropped by 45% between 30 January and 13 February, compared with 42% for under-85s.\nThe number of coronavirus cases is also falling slightly faster for older people compared with other age groups.\nBetween 28 January and 11 February, cases in over-80s fell by 52% compared with 47% in under-80s.\nBut case numbers might not be a reliable indicator of whether the vaccine is working.\nThe vaccine prevents serious infections.\nBut the large number of routine coronavirus tests in settings such as care homes will also pick up mild and asymptomatic infections. \nWhen the UK eventually sees the vaccine having an effect, it will be very obvious, data from Israel suggests.\nIsrael is the first country to see the impact of its vaccination programme.\nBut it took significant population coverage and several weeks.\nIt had had to vaccinate 80% of its over-60s before seeing an impact on Covid-19 cases, Prof Eran Segal, of the Weizmann Institute of Science, who is analysing data for the Israeli Ministry of Health, told BBC News.\nBut then, there had been clear signs of the vaccine \"really helping\" to reduce numbers of cases.\nThe biggest falls in hospital admissions and deaths had been in the over-60s, who had been vaccinated first. \nAnd at the time, admissions had still been rising among the under-60s.\nSo the difference between the two groups had been very clear.\n\"Of course it's not magic,\" Prof Segal said of realising the programme was starting to work.\n\"It's science.\n\"But it was so exciting, we thought it was a magical moment.\" \nIn the UK, the lockdown has been reducing the numbers of admissions in all age groups.\nSo it is harder to be sure any fall is due to vaccination. \nSenior government advisers say it is very hard to be confident about the vaccination effect just by \"eyeballing\" the trends in big groups of people.\nAnd this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"Although the vaccination programme is going well, we still don't have enough data about the exact effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing the spread of infection.\"  \nBut by linking vaccine records to the testing programme or GP records, government scientists can determine whether individuals who have been vaccinated are less likely to become infected or sick or pass on any infection. \nAnd the government is reportedly reviewing data towards the end of the week in advance of Monday, when it plans to publish its plan to exit lockdown in England. \nAdditional reporting by Wesley Stephenson and Robert Cuffe.

      "text": "Researchers want the government to add fatigue, headache, sore throat and diarrhoea to the existing three symptoms which trigger a Covid test.\nCurrently, anyone with a cough, fever or loss of smell or taste qualifies.\nTesting for these additional symptoms could pick up 40% more cases, King's College London and the Zoe Symptom Study app have suggested. \nHowever, this would mean many more people who don't have the virus being tested.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"An expert scientific group keeps the symptoms of Covid-19 under review. \n\"The main symptoms have been carefully selected to capture those most likely to have Covid-19, while not capturing a great number of people who do not.\"\nThe Zoe team was the group to first identify loss of smell and taste as a symptom of Covid, leading to it being added to the official symptoms list.\nThey spotted this by looking at the symptoms reported by people using their Covid Symptom Study mobile app, who went on to test positive. \nBy analysing data from more than 120,000 adults logging potential symptoms on the app, of which 1,200 reported a positive test, the team identified seven common symptoms.\nThe classic three, any of which already qualify people for the more sensitive PCR test which is processed in a lab, are:\nAnd the further four already mentioned, including a sore throat and diarrhoea.\nAnyone reporting one of this wider group of symptoms was invited by Zoe to take a PCR test.\nWhile the seven symptoms suggested by the Zoe app may be features of early-stage Covid, they are also extremely common and may have many other causes.\nThe concern is that if everyone with a headache goes for a Covid test, it could overwhelm the system. \nGP Dr Margaret McCartney told BBC Radio 4's Inside Health programme that a \"pragmatic\" approach was needed, with those living in areas with high levels of the virus treating those wider symptoms with more suspicion than those in low-Covid areas.\nThe Zoe team does acknowledge the strategy would increase the number of people without the virus being tested - rising from 46 negative tests for every positive to 95 negatives for every case identified if the seven symptoms were used. \nBut Dr Claire Steves, lead scientist on the app, said, \"When PCR testing was scarcely available, it made sense to restrict it. \n\"Now in the UK we have plenty of tests available, thanks to so much effort by labs all over the country, and every positive person detected could save lives.\" \nProf Tim Spector, who is leading the project, said: \"We've known since the beginning that just focusing testing on the classic triad of cough, fever and anosmia [loss of smell] misses a significant proportion of cases.\n\"For us, the message for the public is clear: 'If you're feeling newly unwell, it could be Covid and you should get a test'.\"\nHe added that this was \"especially important\", since new variants could cause different symptoms. \nA study by the Office for National Statistics found a cough, fatigue, sore throat and muscle pain may be more common in people who tested positive for the UK variant of coronavirus.\nA DHSC spokesperson said: \"Anyone experiencing the main symptoms - a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or a loss or change to sense of smell or taste - should get a test as soon as possible, and immediately self-isolate along with their household.\"\nThose with no symptoms, or symptoms outside of those three, may be able to access rapid testing through their local council or their workplace.

So it can be a rush.\"\nAfter leaving Dustin, Gillian travelled several miles to vaccinate Alan McKinney, who is 77 and has dementia.\nEach patient gets a cheery greeting as Gillian puts on her personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitises her hands and prepares the injection.\nAfter it was administered Mr McKinney said he felt \"100%\" and was happy he and his wife had got their first jab.\nIn order to roll-out the vaccine, community nurses work closely with GPs in individual practices.\nIt is a well-oiled machine as practices attempt to get around as many of their patients as quickly as possible.\nDr David Reid, who is a GP in Bangor Health Centre, said his team was delivering it as quickly as they get it but he acknowledged some are \"feeling anxious and frustrated\".\n\"That creates a massive logistical and administrative challenge and that is being met by practice managers and the admin team.\n\"To be honest, the easiest thing is putting the vaccine in someone's arm.\"\nHowever, the pace of the roll-out is not in step across the country.\nAccording to Dr Reid, that is due to what nurses are available in each practice and how quickly they are able to call members of the public to come into the surgery.\n\"I'm sure those behind the scenes are trying to do this as equitably as they can,\" Dr Reid said.\n\"There are frustrations and anxieties but I think, if we look at where we are in Northern Ireland and as part of the UK, our roll-out has been incredible.\n\"I would just ask people to be patient.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health said \"it is anticipated that the vast majority of housebound patients will be vaccinated over the next few weeks\"."

      "title": "Northern Ireland abortion law changes proposed by the DUP",
      "tags": "NI Health,Northern Ireland Assembly,Abortion in Northern Ireland",
      "text": "The DUP has proposed a new law to prevent abortions being carried out in NI in cases of non-fatal disabilities.\nNI's abortion laws changed significantly last year following legislation passed at Westminster.\nThere is no time limit for terminations when there is a \"substantial risk\" a fetus would suffer a severe mental or physical impairment.\nCampaigners have argued the law allows abortions without time limit for conditions such as Down's syndrome.\nA private member's bill brought by Paul Givan, backed by disability rights campaign group Don't Screen Us Out, is seeking to overturn the law.\nOne high-profile activist involved in the campaign is Heidi Crowter, who has Down's syndrome.\nShe is also taking a separate legal action against the UK government regarding a similar element in the 1967 Abortion Act, which applies in Great Britain.\nHowever, the UK government has said it is legally bound to provide \"access to abortions in cases of severe fetal impairment, not only fatal fetal abnormalities\".\nIn the Republic of Ireland, abortions are allowed in cases of fatal fetal abnormality, but this does not apply for conditions such as Down's syndrome.\nMr Givan's bill represents the first legislative attempt since devolution was restored in Northern Ireland to amend the abortion laws introduced by the UK government.\nHe said the legislation would not seek to amend the law for abortions in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities and that it was about removing discrimination against people with disabilities.\n\"This is an opportunity for people to come together and fight a prejudicial, discriminatory piece of legislation,\" he told the Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"We have introduced laws called the Disability Act of 1995 and we have built upon that to place duties on public authorities and support people with disabilities.\n\"I believe that those rights - and these are human rights - ought to be conferred upon people before they are born and that is what this campaign is going to be about.\n\"I believe there is a majority of assembly members that agree with this, as does the majority of the public.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in called on Health Minister Robin Swann to commission the provision of abortion services without further delay.\n\"Our priority is to provide appropriate, modern and compassionate healthcare services for women across the island,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"The legislation enacted at Westminster in 2019 put a legal responsibility on the British secretary of state to ensure that the recommendations of the Cedaw (UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women) report are implemented in the north, and gives him the powers to make any necessary changes to the law in order for the north to comply with Cedaw.\n\"Therefore the DUP bill is going nowhere.\" \nPaula Bradshaw, of the Alliance Party, challenged Mr Givan. She said checks and balances were already in place.\n\"If he [Mr Givan] thinks these terminations are taken lightly by a woman who has received such a devastating diagnosis, or a healthcare professional who has devoted their whole life to healthcare and supporting women, it is horrendously disrespectful,\" she said.\n\"I'm not pro-abortion, I'm pro-choice.\n\"A woman has to be supported when she's presented with this diagnosis to explore all options for managing the rest of her pregnancy.\"\nThe moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Rev David Bruce, welcomed Mr Givan's bill and has encouraged \"as many MLAs as possible\" to give their backing.\n\"We vigorously opposed the imposition of abortion legislation by Westminster on Northern Ireland, as we believed at the time, as we continue to maintain today, that it would create the most extreme and most liberal abortion regime anywhere in these islands, which it has done,\" he said, in a statement.\nDr Bruce said that many aspects of the current legislation are \"morally wrong and unjustifiable\".\nIn a statement, the UK government said the law requires it to implement recommendations made by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (Cedaw) report in 2018, including \"providing access to abortions in cases of severe fetal impairment, not only fatal fetal abnormalities\".\n\"While abortion remains a devolved issue, the assembly can only legislate in a way that remains compatible with Convention rights,\" it added.\n\"We remain of the firm view that the 2020 Abortion Regulations are compatible with our international obligations, including under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\"\nIn July 2019, MPs voted to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland and create new laws. \nStormont was not functioning due to a row between the main power-sharing parties.\nA new framework for abortion services in NI was then drawn up by the Northern Ireland Office and took effect last March.  \nIt made terminations legal in all circumstances within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nA 24-week limit would apply in situations where continuing a pregnancy would involve risk of injury to the woman's physical or mental health.\nBut there is no term limit in cases of fatal fetal abnormality where there is a substantial risk that the fetus would die or, if born, would suffer a severe mental or physical impairment.\nLast year, the Stormont assembly supported a non-binding motion rejecting the laws. \nPaul Givan has no memory of his great uncle Samuel but grew up listening to stories about him.\nHe had Down's syndrome and died at the age of 57.\nFor him, this move today is both personal and political as his bill -  if successful  - will allow MLAs to change part of Northern Ireland's new abortion laws, which were approved at Westminster while Stormont was in suspension. \nThe DUP have worked out their sums and believe the bill could secure the support of 75 of Stormont's 90 MLAs.\nThat calculation is based on a series of votes in the Stormont chamber last year when an amendment similar to this bill was proposed by Sinn F\u00e9in.\nIt was defeated at the time but Paul Givan believes with the support of his party this time and other anti-abortion MLAs it could get over the line.\nBut predicting outcomes in the Stormont chamber is a risky business and there is no guarantee the voting patterns will remain the same.\nWhat is for sure is that we can expect some heated and emotive exchanges across the assembly floor and maybe a legal challenge in the courts.\nThe DUP is opposed to abortion, while Sinn F\u00e9in voted to change its stance in 2018 and supports it in most circumstances. \nThe SDLP, UUP and Alliance Party view abortion as a matter of conscience so it is up to individual MLAs how they vote on the issue.\nThe new regulations came into force weeks after the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic began.\nStormont's Department of Health said that the full commissioning of abortion services in NI would need to be discussed by the executive.\nSome health trusts then started providing interim services, allowing early medical abortions within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe latest figures from the Department of Health state that since the new abortion laws came into place on 31 March 2020, 1,091 notifications of terminated pregnancies have been received. \nThe British government has been providing funding to allow women from NI seeking abortion services to continue travelling to England."

      "text": "Almost 300 old coal tips in Wales have been classed as \"high-risk\" a year on from a 60,000 tonne landslip caused by Storm Dennis.\nThe matter was discussed at a Welsh Government summit on mine safety on Tuesday.\nWales has more than 2,000 coal tips. Most are on private land and most are around the south Wales valleys.\nOf those, 294 are categorised as \"high-risk\", meaning they could endanger life or property.\nSeventy are in Caerphilly, 64 in Rhondda Cynon Taf, 59 in Merthyr Tydfil, 42 in Bridgend, 35 in Neath Port Talbot, 16 in Blaenau Gwent and eight in Swansea.\nThe landslip last year was at Tylorstown, in Rhondda. Since it happened, work has been done to map tips and assess their stability. \nThe Welsh and UK governments, the Coal Authority, local councils and other bodies have been examining the problem.\nTheir investigation has concluded current legislation surrounding tips is \"neither sufficiently robust or fit for purpose in relation to inspection and maintenance\".\nCoal Authority chief executive, Lisa Pinney, said managing tips on hillsides was key to reducing risk to communities.\n\"Just under 300 are higher-risk sites but that really just means that they needed much more regular attention and inspection to make sure they stay safe,\" she said.\nShe said when there were concerns, action would be taken. \n\"Any tip which is old mining material sitting on a hillside can pose a risk, obviously, but the key thing to their safety is to manage water and keep it away,\" said Ms Pinney.\n\"And that's why these inspections and maintenance are so important.\"\nNo-one was hurt in the Tylorstown landslip and work is under way to secure the hillside.\nRhondda MP Chris Bryant said funding was essential.\n\"It's shocking that no proper register of disused coal tips was made when the mines closed, so this work is long overdue,\" he said. \n\"With so many on private land this is going to be a massive and complex piece of work in which Parliament and Senedd must work together.\n\"My biggest fear is [Chancellor] Rishi Sunak will demand that local councils pay for this out of their council tax but the poorest communities in the UK should not be forced to pay for tidying up our national industrial heritage.\"\nPlaid Cymru Member of the Senedd for Rhondda Leanne Wood said the UK government should foot the full bill for making the tips safe and anything less would be \"unacceptable\".\n\"When the profits from coal mining were not seen in Rhondda, nor in many other coalfield areas across Wales, coupled with the high cost to health and lives of the workers and their families, that funding and more is owed to us,\" she said.\nWelsh Conservative Janet Finch-Saunders said long-term work to make the tips safe could only be done in partnership with the UK government.\nCoalfield historian Ben Curtis said some tips were removed or made safe after the Aberfan disaster in 1966. \n\"But it is a potential problem that continues to remain for some of these tips to become unsafe over time, perhaps [because of] factors like the effects of climate change and increased rainfall,\" he said.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"Ever since the devastating storms of early 2020, the UK government has been working with the Welsh Government on its devolved responsibility to provide extra support for flood relief and protection to the communities which were so badly affected.\n\"In December we confirmed that \u00a331m would be provided for this vital work, of which \u00a39m was to repair vulnerable coal tips.\n\"We also provided the Welsh Government with an additional \u00a31.3bn for next year at the recent spending review so they are well placed to continue this work\"\nThe summit - which was held virtually - was also due to discuss wider issues of mine safety after water escaped after building up in a mine shaft in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, flooding nearby homes in January.\n\"The coal tip is made up of what we call unconsolidated materials so this is loose material like grains of sugar, all stacked up on top of each other,\" Ashley Patton, an engineering geologist from the British Geological Survey said. \nShe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"When it gets to a certain angle it can make it unsafe and then when you get triggering factors, such as water from a spring line or from heavy rain that we've seen quite a lot of in south Wales, it can just make it destabilise.\n\"The main problem with south Wales is you've got lots of steep-sided valleys and then if you're going to put coal spoil on top of those steep slopes that's just going to make it more likely that it's going to fail...\n\"The most important thing is to take what we call the angle of friction so you're looking at what is the perfect angle for that material - so if you can cut it back to a shallower angle... generally speaking, it could be quite stable, and of course the other important thing is to make sure that the slopes are not sited on any spring lines or areas where farmers are putting water onto the slopes.\""

      "tags": "NHS Scotland,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are now more people in Scottish hospitals with Covid than there were at the peak of the first wave in April.\nOn the day the first lockdown started at the end of March last year there were 329 in hospital with Covid.\nThe numbers rose steeply and by 20 April there were 1,520 patients in hospital with Covid in Scotland.\nThe latest daily figures show there are now 1,530 in hospital, up 340 in the past week.\nIn addition, there are now 102 people in intensive care units in Scotland being treated for Covid - which is up 29 on a week ago.\nThe number of people in intensive care is still significantly lower than the April peak, which was 208.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Monday that this partly reflected the fact that treatment of Covid had improved significantly.\nBut, even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels.\nIndeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.\nThe increased spread of the virus is attributed to the new variant, which is up to 70% more transmissible than previous strains.\nThe new strain now accounts for half of cases in Scotland. A week ago the figure was 42.8% and a month earlier it was less than 6% of all UK cases.\nOn 19 December, when concerns over the new strain led to announcements that mainland Scotland would be moving to level four a week later, the cumulative seven-day incidence per 100,000 people was 136. It has since risen to more than 250.\nThe figure for England is above 500 per 100,000 and in some regions it is much higher.\nThe highest rate in Scotland is in Inverclyde at almost 573 per 100,000. Dumfries and Galloway, which previously recorded low case rates, has increased by more than 400 in the past week to 552 cases per 100,000.\nThe increased number of people in hospital and the rapid spread of the new strain led the Scottish government to take action and impose a lockdown similar to the one in March last year.\nOn Monday, it published a paper which showed its \"modelling\" of three scenarios on the transmission of the disease without a stricter lockdown.\nScenario two, the one considered most likely, showed the number of people in hospital with Covid reaching the April peak in the week commencing 18 January.\nIn fact, the figure was reached on 8 January.\nThe scenario then sees the number of cases almost double again over the next two weeks to 2,900. \nThe NHS had put the Covid surge capacity in Scotland at 3,656 hospital beds but this was revised down to 2,400 for the winter to account for \"additional seasonal pressures including weather-related issues and increased staff absence\".\nIn the evidence paper, Scenario 3, the most pessimistic outcome, which factored in an estimate of Christmas spread, suggested there could be 8,300 in hospital by the week commencing 1 February.\nThere are fewer than 13,000 hospitals beds in the whole of the NHS in Scotland and occupancy in normal winter months is close to 90%.\nThe first minister said NHS services were coping at present, although the pressure on frontline staff was considerable.\nHowever, the position in some areas is fragile and getting more challenging.\nMs Sturgeon said that the  increase in case numbers seen in past two weeks could not continue unchecked and that was why the lockdown had been imposed.\nWithout it, she said, there would be a real risk of the NHS being overwhelmed."

It has signed up hundreds of media outlets in Germany, Brazil and the UK, among others, to participate in its Google News Showcase programme.\nThe deal with News Corp comes just days before Australia is due to pass a law allowing it to appoint an arbitrator to set fees if Google or other platforms cannot not come to terms with publishers on their own.\nGoogle has threatened to cut its search engine in Australia over the plans. On Wednesday, Facebook said it would restrict news on its platform in the country.\nIn his statement, Mr Thomson said \"particular thanks\" was due to Australian politicians who backed the proposal.\nIn addition to payments, Google's News Showcase product makes tweaks to its news app, like promoting participating publishers in the newsstand section.\nIt also gives news organisations more control over which stories are promoted and how they appear to users who follow their outlets.\nAs part of its three-year-agreement, News Corp said the two firms would also collaborate on a subscription platform, share advertising revenue and invest in video journalism on YouTube, which shares a parent company with Google.\nNews Corp has previously struck payment deals with Apple and Facebook.\nFinancial deals of the News Corp deal were not disclosed.\nReuters has reported Google agreed to pay $76m over three years to a group of 121 French news publishers to end a dispute over copyright laws in Europe."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Healthy, young volunteers will be infected with coronavirus to test vaccines and treatments in the world's first Covid-19 \"human challenge\" study, which will take place in the UK.\nThe study, which has received ethics approval, will start in the next few weeks and recruit 90 people aged 18-30.\nThey will be exposed to the virus in a safe and controlled environment while medics monitor their health.\nThe UK has given doses of a Covid vaccine to more than 15 million people.\nHuman challenge studies have played a vital role in pushing the development of treatments for a number of diseases, including malaria, typhoid, cholera and flu.\nThe trials will help scientists work out the smallest amount of coronavirus needed to cause infection, and how the body's immune system reacts to it.\nThis will give doctors a better understanding of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, which will feed into the development of vaccines and treatments.\nThe Human Challenge study is being delivered by a partnership between the UK government's Vaccines Taskforce, Imperial College London, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and the company hVIVO, which has pioneered viral human challenge models.\nClive Dix, interim chair of the Vaccines Taskforce, said: \"We have secured a number of safe and effective vaccines for the UK, but it is essential that we continue to develop new vaccines and treatments for Covid-19. \n\"We expect these studies to offer unique insights into how the virus works and help us understand which promising vaccines offer the best chance of preventing the infection.\"\nWe have hugely effective Covid-19 vaccines already so why do we need challenge trials?\nFirst, they tell us things that are almost impossible to discover in the real world.\nHow much virus does it take to start an infection? How does the immune system mount its initial defence? Can you tell which people will develop symptoms or not?\nThe trials in the UK will start off by focusing on these fundamental scientific questions.\nBut there are also new vaccines in the pipeline and the virus itself is evolving. \nLater this year it will become almost impossible to run large-scale Covid vaccine trials in the UK because so many people will have been immunised. \nBut challenge trials involving just a small numbers of volunteers will still give the answer to crucial questions - from how second-generation vaccines compare, to whether vaccines protect against new variants. \nChief investigator Dr Chris Chiu, from Imperial College London, said: \"We are asking for volunteers aged between 18 and 30 to join this research endeavour and help us to understand how the virus infects people and how it passes so successfully between us.\"\nVolunteers will be screened to check they are healthy and have not been infected by the virus before. They will have the virus squirted up their nose and then spend 14 days quarantining in hospital, while being closely monitored by a medical team.\nFinding out how the virus grows in the nose and analysing the very early stages of infection in people before symptoms develop are two main aims.\nVolunteers will be compensated for their time, to the tune of around \u00a34,500 over the course of a year, which will include follow-up tests.\nInitially, the study will use the virus that has been circulating in the UK since the pandemic began in March, which is of low risk to healthy adults, to deliberately infect volunteers.\nIn time, a small numbers of volunteers are likely to be given an approved vaccine and then exposed to the new variants, helping scientists to find out the most effective jabs - but this phase of the study has not yet been given the go-ahead."

      "tags": "Walmart,Asda",
      "text": "Asda has new owners. \nThe Issa brothers, two entrepreneurs from Blackburn who made billion-pound fortunes running petrol stations, have completed the deal to buy Britain's third-largest supermarket chain. \nAsda was valued at \u00a36.8bn, but the brothers and the investment firm TDR Capital paid just \u00a3780m.\nThe rest of the money was borrowed. So how does this kind of deal work? And will it leave Asda with too much debt?\nThis kind of deal is called a leveraged buyout - which means that it involves large amounts of debt.\nTDR Capital specialises in this kind of deal. It is also co-owner of EG Group, the worldwide petrol station business which built the brothers' fortune, and which also has large borrowings.\nThe Issas and TDR each contribute half of the \u00a3780m in cash to Asda's former owners, Wal-Mart, which has owned Asda since 1999.\nMost of the purchase price - just under \u00a34bn - will be borrowed. \nWalmart, the American supermarket which owned Asda for the past 21 years, will retain a small stake in Asda, for \u00a3500m, along with a seat on Asda's board. \nThen the new owners will sell off parts of Asda to raise the rest of the purchase price. \nAsda will sell its warehouses and distribution system for \u00a3950m. It will still use them, but in future, it will have to pay rent to their new owners.\nAnd Asda's 323 petrol stations will be sold for \u00a3750m to EG Group, adding to the portfolio of more than 6,000 around the world.\nThe deal is still awaiting approval from the Competition and Markets Authority, which is expected by the summer.\nBuying a \u00a36.8bn business for less than \u00a3800m has certainly raised eyebrows, but it is not unusual for buyers to put up only a small fraction of the purchase price in such big deals. \n\"10% looks low, compared to the average for leveraged buyouts as a whole of around 50%,\" says Roberto Pozzi, senior vice-president at Moody's, an agency which analyses the riskiness of company's borrowings. \n\"Keep in mind that it depends also on the stability of the business, and there is no more stable business than supermarkets,\" he adds.\nFirms such as TDR Capital, known as private equity firms, have backed nearly 5,000 buyout deals over the past decade, worth a total of \u00a3350bn, according to research firm Preqin - although the Asda buyout is the largest in more than a decade.\nWith big debts come fears that paying interest on the debt will suck money away from investing in the business or paying staff. \nBut interest rates are currently extremely low, which will made Asda's debt burden affordable.\nOn the \u00a33.7bn of Asda's debt which is being raised on public markets, the interest bill will be just \u00a3125m a year, according to Azhar Hussain, head of global credit at the Royal London Asset Management. Leasing back the warehouses will cost about \u00a357m a year. \nSo the \u00a3500m or so of cash which Asda makes each year will easily cover the interest costs incurred in the buyout, leaving plenty spare to pay down the debts and reduce Asda's borrowings even further.\nThe debt burden will be higher than supermarket rivals Tesco and Morrisons, but it's expected to fall over time as new owners pay the debts off.\nPaying back borrowers will be less of an issue than competition from other supermarkets.\nAsda may still find itself needing to cut costs, but not necessarily to pay back debts. \"Every grocer is cutting costs anyway, because of competition,\" says Mr Pozzi.\n\"Now their plan is to become more efficient and put in place a lower cost structure, because that's what everybody is doing.\"\nThe Issa brothers are new to the hyper-competitive world of UK supermarkets and they will have to learn fast, at the same time as running a vast forecourt empire.\n\"It won't be easy and they will probably have to work harder to stand still,\" says Mr Pozzi.\nAs the third-largest supermarket in the UK, Asda has seen its market share fall as discounters Aldi and Lidl have grown.\nAsda is behind in the fast-growing and profitable convenience store business, where Sainsbury's Local and Tesco Express have grown rapidly.\nThe new relationship with EG Group gives it a chance to open convenience stores in petrol stations. \nBuyout deals can be extremely profitable for the new owners. Just suppose they pay 10% of the purchase price in cash. If they increase the value by 10%, all that increase in value goes to them, so they've doubled their money.\nBig buyouts are often controversial. The GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said Asda was \"a profitable company that does not need to be loaded with debt\" and labelled the sale of the warehouses \"asset-stripping\". \nThere are stories of businesses where private equity buyouts have led to underinvestment and subsequent collapse. Debenhams is often cited as an example. But most of the thousands of private equity buyouts do not end that way.\nBusinesses with big debts pay much less tax on their profits. They can deduct the interest payments from their profits before calculating how much tax to pay, which reduces their corporation tax bill. \nSo that's a lower contribution to the costs of schools, hospitals and everything else taxes pay for.\nCompanies owned by private investors are not listed on the stock exchange, meaning private investors can't participate in its future success by buying shares. \nHowever, many pension funds will still invest in the new Asda, either by lending their share of that \u00a34bn of debt or investing in TDR Capital."

      "text": "Three North Koreans have been charged in the US over a scheme to steal and extort more than $1.3bn (\u00a3940m) from banks and businesses around the world. \nThe three, who are not in custody, are also accused of deploying malicious cryptocurrency programs.\nA Canadian-American citizen was also charged with money laundering.\nThe men are also accused of being part of the Wannacry cyber-attack of 2017, which crippled UK health service computer systems on a national scale.\nAnnouncing the charges, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, John Demers, said North Korea \"has become a criminal syndicate with a flag\".\nOne of the defendants, Park Jin Hyok, was previously charged two years ago for his role in the 2014 hacking of Sony Entertainment Pictures. \nMr Park, Jon Chang Hyok and Kim Il are accused of criminal conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.\nThe Department of Justice says the defendants work for the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea's military intelligence agency.\n\"North Korea's operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world's leading bank robbers,\" Mr Demers said.\nAll three men are believed to be in North Korea, which does not extradite its citizens to face US charges.\nThe Canadian-American man, 37-year-old Ghaleb Alaumary, from Mississauga, Ontario, is accused of being the group's money launderer in a separate case announced on Wednesday. Officials say he has agreed to plead guilty to the charge\nSony Entertainment Picture's 2014 film, The Interview, is widely believed to have been the initial motive for the attack on the film company.\nThe satirical film, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, ridicules North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and centres around a fictitious assassination plot against him. \nThe men are also believed to have had a hand in the WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attack in 2017. \nThe attack temporarily crippled UK National Health Service (NHS) computer systems and affected more than 150 countries around the world.\nAbout 40 NHS organisations and some medical practices were hit, with operations and appointments cancelled.\nThere are broadly three reasons why governments choose cyber-attacks to further their interests: to spy on each-other; to steal intellectual property; or to meddle in politics.\nThis indictment adds further evidence to the theory that North Korea bucks the trend. The politically isolated country is actually far more interested in making money.\nAs the assistant attorney general put it, North Korean hackers are \"the world's leading bank robbers\".\nOf all the major cyber powers, North Korea has time and time again used its considerable skills to prop up a struggling economy.\nIt's working rather well, too - with well over $1bn in the bank from these hacks alone.\nWhile other nations cause chaos and political noise with their hackers, North Korea seems content to quietly continue lining its coffers.\nThe three men hit by the indictment also conducted campaigns targeting US defence and energy contractors. As part of this, Department of State and Pentagon officials were tricked into sharing their credentials so hackers could access their computers. \n\"The scope of the criminal conduct by the North Korean hackers was extensive and long-running and the range of crimes they have committed is staggering,\" Acting US Attorney Tracy Wilkison said.\nThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre said it fully supported the criminal charges.\n\"Working with our allies we are committed to countering malicious activity by state and non-state actors and will defend ourselves from disruptive behaviour in cyber-space,\" said the organisation's director for operations, Paul Chichester."

      "tags": "UK devolution,Cwmbran,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Devolution has not been an \"overall\" disaster, Boris Johnson has said.\nSpeaking on visit to a vaccination centre in Cwmbran, Torfaen, he said \"it depends\" what the devolved authorities do.\nSince 1999, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have had more control over their own affairs.\nThe comments come amid debate within the Conservative Party itself about the future of devolution and the union itself.\nA group of Conservatives were recently selected to stand for the Welsh Parliament after telling members they would support abolishing the institution.\nPlaid Cymru Liz Saville Roberts said Mr Johnson's defence of devolution was \"lukewarm\".\nMr Johnson's visit also took him to South Wales Police's headquarters in Bridgend, although a Senedd minister questioned whether he should have travelled to Wales given the current lockdown rules.\nAsked if he thought devolution had been a disaster, Mr Johnson said: \"Certainly not overall, absolutely not overall.\"\nHe said he had been a \"proud beneficiary\" of devolution when he was mayor of London.\n\"I think that devolution can work very well, but it depends very much on what the devolved authorities do,\" he added.\nAlso while on the visit, Mr Johnson said the UK and Welsh governments were working to \"concert\" their messages on lockdown. \nIn Wales, the National Assembly was set up following a referendum in 1997.\nIts powers grew and, after a further referendum in 2011, it gained law-making powers and has since changed its name to the Welsh Parliament/Senedd Cymru.\nElections to the Senedd determine what ministers form the Welsh Government, which is a separate body currently led by First Minister Mark Drakeford.\nMr Drakeford has been in charge of Covid-19 restrictions in Wales and has been free to vary the rules from the UK government.\nThe two governments chose to go into lockdown at different times during the winter months and have, at times, disagreed on the messaging to the public. The whole of the UK is now under lockdown, however.\nMr Johnson said UK ministers were having \"continuous conversations\" with Mr Drakeford and the two sides tried \"to make sure we concert our approach and concert our general messaging\".\n\"Overall, if you look at infection rates across the UK, they are coming down a bit now, that's very encouraging.\"Mr Johnson added that while there were \"some encouraging signs\" this could be driven by vaccination and it was \"still early days\".\nThe prime minister said a \"data not dates\" approach would be \"absolute right\" in exiting restrictions in England.\nMark Drakeford recently partly blamed the UK government's programme of austerity as being behind high rates of coronavirus deaths in parts of the south Wales valleys.\nMr Johnson said he would be \"reluctant to ascribe a single cause like that\".\n\"Yes, sadly, some parts of the UK have been worse hit than than others,\" he said.\n\"I think that there will be a time where we go over everything and when the pandemic has really come to an end then we try to isolate all the particular causes, but I think it is multifactorial.\"\nThe UK government was recently warned to avoid \"complacency\" over the Welsh independence movement.\nMr Johnson told journalists that he was \"confident\" about the future of the union, although he said he wasn't complacent.\n\"I believe passionately in the Union. And I think that its, its advantages are clear.\"\n\"When you see vaccination being rolled out by the NHS invented in the UK, it's impossible not to be very moved and also very confident about the future of our of our country.\"\nWelsh Government Wellbeing Minister Eluned Morgan said she was not sure Mr Johnson's visit could be classed as essential travel.\nShe told a press conference: \"Of course he is the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and has to make his own judgement on that.\n\"In an ideal world, I think, as many people as possible should stay at home and, yes, in an ideal world, perhaps that should have happened in this instance.\"\nWork is an exception to the stay-at-home lockdown rules.\nMs Morgan said the relationship with the UK government had \"ebbed and flowed\".\nShe added: \"In an ideal world, we would like to be coming out of the lockdown together, but at the end of the day we will do what is right for us in Wales, and that will depend on the rates of infection and how quickly we can roll out the vaccine, and we are doing incredibly well in Wales on that score.\"\nPlaid's Liz Saville Roberts also criticised Mr Johnson's visit.\n\"This was a pointless 140-mile cross-border journey to Wales to make public comment on matters relating to England only,\" she said. \n\"Mr Johnson's lukewarm defence of devolution is undermined by his actions. This is a Prime Minister who has overseen the biggest Westminster power grab since the advent of devolution and has consistently refused to support Welsh lockdown measures with the financial support needed to make them work.'"

      "tags": "United Arab Emirates,Mohammed Al Maktoum,Long Reads,Dubai",
      "text": "Dramatic new details have come to light about the extraordinary kidnapping and secretive detention of Princess Latifa.\nIt has been many months since Tiina Jauhiainen last heard from her friend.\nPrincess Latifa, imprisoned in Dubai after attempting a daring escape, had kept in touch with her for some time using a secret phone.\nBut all of a sudden, the contact stopped.\nWhen Tiina last saw Latifa, they had lain on the deck of a yacht gazing at the stars, travelling across the Indian Ocean.\nIt was February 2018, and they had embarked on a risky plan to get Latifa out of Dubai and start a new life abroad.\nThe princess is one of 25 children of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. \nThe sheikh has transformed the emirate into a glittering city, a place people flock to for business, and the playground of the region. But for Emirati women, the laws and customs can make life very restrictive.\n\"I'm not allowed to drive, I'm not allowed to travel or leave Dubai at all,\" Latifa said in a video recorded just before her escape.\n\"I haven't left the country since 2000. I've been asking a lot to just go travelling, to study, to do anything normal. They don't let me. I need to leave.\"\nSitting in Tiina's apartment, Latifa spoke cheerfully of what was to come.\n\"I'm feeling positive about the future. I don't know how I'll feel just waking up in the morning and thinking I can do whatever I want today. I'm really looking forward to that.\"\nThe princess had no access to her passport and was under surveillance, so they had to slip out of Dubai and drive to the coast of Oman. It took hours for them to get out to international waters, riding a dinghy and jet ski. By the evening they reached the yacht which was supposed to carry them to freedom. \nIn a Whatsapp message to a friend, Latifa declared: \"I'm free\".\nThey planned to sail across the Indian Ocean, and then fly to the United States where Latifa could try to claim political asylum.\nBut eight days later, as the coast of India neared, the escape went horribly wrong.\nArmed men boarded the boat. The friends hid in the bathroom until smoke grenades forced them up to the deck. \n\"Latifa was screaming and kicking. She kept saying 'don't take me back to the UAE. Just shoot me here',\" Tiina said. It was the last time she saw her friend.\nIn her later videos, released only now, Latifa gives a vivid account of the storming of the yacht.\n\"I was fighting, and this guy came with a small pouch and he took out the needle and he injected me in my arm.\"\nLatifa says she was then transferred to an Indian military ship.\n\"The commandos carried me through this corridor, and to a big room, and there was in front of me like maybe four or five generals. \n\"I'm repeating to them 'my name's Latifa al Maktoum'.\n\"I don't want to go Dubai, I want to get asylum. I was in international waters, you should let me go.\"\nHer pleas fell on deaf ears, and she says she was then manhandled by an Emirati commando.\n\"He grabs me. Lifts me up. Kicking and fighting, he's much bigger than me. So I see that his sleeve is rolled up and arm exposed. I had one shot. Bit as hard as I can, and shake my head. And he screamed.\"\nShe says she was tranquilised and flown back to Dubai.\n\"I just felt really sad at that point. I felt everything I was working on for so many years to get my freedom was gone. And I've been here ever since, by myself, so solitary confinement.  No access to medical help, no trial, no charge, nothing.\"\nTiina was taken back to the UAE with the yacht's crew, where she was detained for two weeks. Then she began telling the story to the international media. She formed the campaign group Free Latifa and took the princess's case to the United Nations.\nBut as the months passed, she heard nothing from Latifa.\nThen one day in early 2019, while she was visiting family in Finland, she got a message from a stranger.\nFirst she had to answer security questions. Years earlier, Tiina had taught Latifa capoeira, a Brazilian martial art. Now the stranger wanted to know Latifa's capoeira nickname.\nSoon Tiina was able to get a phone to the princess directly.  \n\"When I first heard her voice, I was crying. I couldn't help it. It was very, very emotional.\"\nLatifa was able to start recording video messages. What they reveal is shocking.\nThe princess, now 35, appears in the corner of her bathroom, speaking in a fragile whisper.\n\"I'm doing this video from a bathroom, because this is the only room with a door I can lock. I'm a hostage. I am not free. I'm enslaved in this jail. My life is not in my hands.\"\nPale and puffy, she has spent three years with little access to sunlight.\n\"I am in a villa, and this villa has been converted into jail. All the windows are barred shut. There's five policemen outside and two policewomen inside the house. And I can't even go outside to get any fresh air.\"\nThe villa is just metres from the beach, in a luxury neighbourhood.  \n\"We shouldn't pretend that just because it's a villa, it's fine\", the executive director of Human Rights Watch, Ken Roth, says. \n\"This woman is imprisoned. It's basically solitary confinement except for her jailers. Solitary confinement of that sort is broadly considered to be a form of torture, as it becomes prolonged in the way this has right now.\"\nThe fear is palpable in Latifa's videos. There is a constant urgency and a desperation in her voice.\n\"Every day I am worried about my safety and my life. I don't really know if I'm going to survive this situation. The police threatened me that I'll be in prison my whole life and I'll never see the sun again. So I'm not safe here.\"\nBut despite the risk that she would be caught with the secret phone, she began to calmly and methodically document her extraordinary story.\nWatch Panorama's The Missing Princess on BBC iPlayer\n\"For me it's simple, it's like, am I free or am I not free? So ok, the world is going to know that I'm not free. Anybody who cares is going to know that I'm not free, and I'm not going to go along with their propaganda. That's just how I am.\"\nThe sheikh has said that he considers Latifa's return to Dubai a rescue mission.\nIn December 2018, after Latifa had been missing for nine months, the UAE was facing pressure. The United Nations had requested proof of life - or it would go public with concerns that the princess might have died.\nLatifa received a visit from her stepmother Princess Haya.\nHaya asked her to lunch. \n\"She said to me it would be like a test, to see how you will react around people after being in prison for so long,\" says Latifa in one video. \"And if you act well, you react well, you're going to be out in a few days.\"\nUnbeknown to Latifa, Princess Haya had been spun an elaborate lie, that Latifa had bipolar disorder and was vulnerable to exploitation. To help prove to the UN that all was well with Latifa, Haya called a friend, the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson.\nOn 15 December 2018, Mary Robinson flew to Dubai where she says Haya and her officials briefed her about Latifa's supposed \"medical condition\". She agreed to help contact the UN.\nLatifa, meanwhile, was kept in the dark. Over the lunch they discussed the environment, skydiving, and Mary Robinson's upcoming book.\n\"We never discussed me. We never discussed my case,\" Latifa says. She had no idea that Robinson was a former UN Human Rights Commissioner.\nMary Robinson told us that she did not question Latifa about the video or her escape, or ask to meet with her one-on-one.\n\"I didn't know how to address somebody who was bipolar. I really didn't actually want to talk to her and increase the trauma over a nice lunch.\"\nBut Robinson did allow photographs to be taken of Latifa which she agreed to send on to the UN. Robinson says she believed these were private photographs and that she was stunned when the UAE released them to the world nine days later.  \nAfter the lunch Latifa was taken back to her prison villa. \"It was all a set up. It was like they tricked me,\" Latifa says. Nothing changed for the missing princess.\nBut for her stepmother Princess Haya, there was an extraordinary development.\n\"Relatively shortly afterwards,\" recalls Robinson, \"I got a call from Haya, saying 'Mary, I am in London. I have just come to London with my two children. I have come in the clothes we were in because I am so fearful. We were wrong. I have found out a lot.'\"\nHaya later said that the sheikh did not welcome her interest in Latifa and that he became progressively more hostile to her. By April 2019, she says that she believed her position in Dubai was unsafe. On 15 April, she fled to the UK.\nNow confronted with the escape of one of his wives as well as two more children, the Sheikh began a High Court battle to have the children returned to Dubai. But he got more than he bargained for.\nIn March 2020, a High Court judgement revealed further details about his treatment of his adult daughters. Eighteen years earlier, a second daughter, Shamsa, had been abducted in the UK and returned to Dubai, where she has been captive ever since. The judgement laid out the full story, for the first time, of how the sheikh's agents had tracked her down in Cambridge, and flown her back.\nThe judge also found that Haya had been intimidated and Latifa had been abducted and imprisoned - and that the sheikh had not been honest and open with the court.\nFor Tiina, this was a breakthrough. \"I thought that would have been something that could have quickly led to her release.\"\nBut once again, little changed for Latifa in her prison in Dubai.\n\"It's almost like, what do we need to get her free? It's sad. It's very very sad,\" says Tiina.\nAlone in her villa in Dubai, Latifa followed the case and maintained daily contact with her friend, along with her UK-based maternal cousin Marcus and Free Latifa co-founder David Haigh.  What had begun as concise, factual video recordings evidencing her situation had turned into lengthy text chats.\n\"The phone meant a lot, it was a lifeline,\" says Marcus.\nLatifa was now in her third year of imprisonment and solitary confinement.\n\"Every day was a struggle for her, and you could hear that in her voice. I know she was tired, I know her health was not the best,\" says Marcus.\nBut then one day, the contact stopped just as dramatically as it had begun.\nNow, many months later, Tiina, David and Marcus have taken the decision to release some of Latifa's videos in the hope they will help pressure the sheikh to release her.\n\"We haven't taken this decision lightly, there's been some sleepless nights thinking about this\", Tiina says.\n\"But it's time to do something. I feel that she would want us to fight for her, and not give up.\nThe governments of Dubai and the UAE have said that Latifa is safe in the loving care of her family.\nTiina is consumed by fear for her friend.\n\"Initially, I thought maybe she had problems with her phone. I was hoping she would reappear. I didn't want to believe it,\" says Tiina. \nBut then it dawned on her that Latifa was not coming back. \n\"We are extremely worried about her well-being,\" she says. \"If we assume that she was caught with the phone, her conditions now are probably a lot worse.\""

      "text": "Children exploited by gangs are being failed by adults who \"simply don't see them\", the Children's Commissioner for England has said.\nIn her final speech in the role, Anne Longfield highlighted the case of 16-year-old Jacob, who died after being coerced into drug trafficking.\nShe condemned the \"national scandal\" of a fifth of children leaving school without basic qualifications.\nThe government said it had prioritised protecting vulnerable children.\nThe children's commissioner's six-year term ends this month, and she spoke earlier to a virtual conference of more than 2,000 people.\nJacob, 16, was found dead in his bedroom in April 2019. A serious case review showed he had not been provided any type of education for 21 months.\nThe report exposed failings by the local authorities and police, which left him to be targeted by so-called \"county lines\" gangs.\nMs Longfield said Jacob was just one of many young people failed by Whitehall officials who need to rethink their priorities.\n\"I have been shocked to discover how many of these officials have never met any of the children they are responsible for,\" she said\n\"So many seem to view them as remote concepts or data points on an annual return. \n\"This is how children fall through the gaps - because too often the people in charge of the systems they need simply don't see them and try to understand their world.\" \nMs Longfield also mentioned Corey Junior Davis and Jaden Moodie, two other children \"caught up in gang violence who were let down by a succession of adults whose job it was to keep them safe\".\nShe said the \"basic flaw\" in how the government works is that \"different parts of the system know different areas of these children's lives, but nobody connects the dots\". \nIn her speech, she called for the government's \"build back better\" strategy to focus on \"rethinking our priorities and the way we care for children\".\nShe said: \"It's impossible to overstate how damaging the last year has been for many children.\n\"Covid is the biggest challenge to our society in 70 years. But also an opportunity to reflect and rebuild.\"\nJacob, from Banbury, was coerced into a life of crime, and the report said his schooling absence played a \"significant role\" in leaving him vulnerable to being exploited.\nHe was recorded as a suspect or an offender in 26 police reports, mostly for violent crimes, but was never brought before the courts.\nMs Longfield said: \"This was not some evil criminal mastermind. \n\"This was a child who the report says talked to his friend about buying a school uniform and walking into school, just to feel like the other kids.\"\nA coroner concluded he was \"intoxicated and distressed\" when he died but said there was \"insufficient evidence\" that he intended to kill himself. \nInvestigators found there was \"a lack of responsibility and accountability\" in the council's education department.\nOxfordshire County Council admitted \"more should have been done\" but has refused to answer further questions on the case.\nThames Valley Police said it recognised it did not get the \"balance right\" in Jacob's case between \"dealing with children who are exploited but may also pose a risk to and offend against others\".\nA government spokesperson said: \"Protecting vulnerable children has been at the heart of our response to the pandemic, driven by our commitment to level up opportunities and outcomes.  \n\"Anne Longfield has been a tireless advocate for children, and we're grateful for her dedication and her challenge on areas where we can continue raising the bar for the most vulnerable.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

It is about anti-Irish abuse and how it's been over decades.\n\"Fellow players have backed me and even today Arlene Foster from the DUP, Michelle O'Neill from Sinn F\u00e9in and the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister), Miche\u00e1l Martin.\n\"It is no longer acceptable and people need to stand up and speak out against it because it's been going on for far too long.\"\nNorthern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill expressed her solidarity with the family and said footballing authorities \"must take immediate action to tackle the scourge of anti-Irish racism\".\nUlster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken also said that \"too many of the people indulging in such abuse are able to hide behind anonymous online accounts\". \nOn Wednesday, the Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin also tweeted his support for the McClean family, congratulating them for \"speaking out about years of horrific abuse they've suffered online\".\nMr McClean also told the programme that his brother, Patrick McClean, who plays for Northern Ireland Football League club Glentoran, has also been the subject of online abuse. \nThe Football Association of Ireland issued a statement on Monday offering its support to McClean and his family and also condemned the abuse.\nThe Professional Footballers' Association and McClean's club Stoke City have also condemned the abuse.\nMr McClean said by speaking out he hopes that future generations will not have to experience the level of abuse he and his family have been subjected to. \n\"I was a young boy growing up in Creggan with dreams of becoming a footballer.\n\"I am in a position where I can provide for my family so it's worth it, but it would be even more worth it when my career is over and done that the next generations are not subjected to this kind of abuse.\"\nHe added: \"I have a five-year-old son and all he wants to be is a footballer, all he knows is Stoke City and Ireland. \n\"If we can stop this now, God willing he becomes a professional footballer, because he's good enough, playing his trade in the UK he won't have to put up with this.\n\"Not just him, but any young Irish footballer who has aspirations of coming across the water, can play their football freely and not have to put up with this.\""

      "title": "Obituary: Rush Limbaugh, provocative US radio host",
      "tags": "Republican Party,Radio,United States",
      "text": "Rush Limbaugh, the controversial US radio personality and political commentator, has died aged 70. \nHis wife Kathryn Adams announced his death on his radio show on Wednesday. He had been suffering from lung cancer. \nBest known as the host of the long-running talk radio programme The Rush Limbaugh Show, he was a towering figure in the conservative movement for years. \nThree presidents appeared on his show, and he received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2020.\nBut he was as controversial as he was influential, accused of voicing racist, sexist and homophobic views throughout his career.\nThe climate change denier peddled numerous conspiracy theories on the air, staunchly opposed immigration, and was a hard-line advocate for US exceptionalism.\nHe was also a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump. Speaking on Fox News, Mr Trump called the radio host \"irreplaceable\".\nBorn in Missouri on 12 January 1951, Limbaugh first began working in radio at his local station when he was in high school. After graduating in 1969, he started at Southeast Missouri State University but dropped out and took his first job at a music radio station in Pennsylvania.\nLimbaugh initially struggled to succeed in broadcasting. He was fired from his first two jobs. He became the host of a public affairs talk show in Kansas City but again lost his position.\nIn 1979, he began working for the Kansas City Royals baseball team. During this time he took trips to Europe and Asia, experiences Limbaugh later said reinforced his belief in US exceptionalism.\n\"I go to Europe and say, 'Wait a minute. Why is this bedroom so damned old-fashion and doesn't work? What the hell is this? They call this a toilet?' So I started asking myself: 'How is it that we, who have only been around 200 years, are light-years ahead of people that have been alive a thousand?'\" he told his listeners in 2013.\nLimbaugh returned to radio in 1983, launching The Rush Limbaugh Show the following year in California.\nBut the outspoken conservative only began to find widespread success after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed its fairness doctrine in 1987 - a regulation requiring US broadcasters to present both sides of a controversial opinion. As the Wall Street Journal put it in 2005, this decision led to \"hyper-articulate conservative hosts opening their microphones to millions of hyper-angry conservative voters\". \nIn 1988 the show became nationally syndicated, broadcast live on hundreds of radio stations around the country. By 2020, it had attracted around 27 million listeners each week.\nThe programme and its host developed huge influence in the Republican Party and the US conservative movement. \nPresident George HW Bush appeared on the programme during his re-election campaign in 1992, while his son George W Bush appeared six times.\nPresident Donald Trump also came on the show in January 2020, when Limbaugh praised him for ordering a US drone strike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.\nLimbaugh's controversial views frequently caused outrage. \nHe drew strong criticism for his use of racial stereotypes on his show, including once claiming that all newspaper composite images of wanted criminals looked like civil rights activist Rev Jesse Jackson. \nHe declared his opposition to LGBT rights, and made derogatory remarks about victims of the HIV/Aids epidemic.\nHe dismissed sexual consent and disparaged advocates of women's rights. \"Feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women access to the mainstream of society,\" he once wrote, frequently dismissing women as \"femi-Nazis\". \nAnd he voiced a number of lies and fringe theories to his listeners, claiming that President Barack Obama was not born in the US, denying the existence of man-made climate change, accusing environmentalists of deliberately causing the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010, and arguing that the dangers of smoking had been exaggerated while the benefits dismissed.\nMr Trump awarded Limbaugh the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour, to recognise his \"decades of tireless devotion to our country\". It came the day after Limbaugh announced he had advanced lung cancer.\nLimbaugh married four times and divorced three times but never had any children."

      "title": "Rush Limbaugh: Trump leads tributes to divisive US radio host",
      "text": "Donald Trump and other prominent US conservatives have been paying tribute to controversial radio personality and political commentator Rush Limbaugh.\nThe radio host's wife announced his death on Wednesday following his diagnosis of lung cancer last year. \nBest known as the host of radio programme The Rush Limbaugh Show, the 70-year-old was a towering figure in the conservative movement for decades.\nMr Trump described him as a \"legend\" in his first post-presidency interview.\n\"There aren't too many legends around. But he is a legend,\" Mr Trump told Fox News. \"And those people who listen to him every day, it was like a religious experience for a lot of people.\"\nLimbaugh was as controversial as he was influential - accused of voicing racist, sexist and homophobic views throughout his career.\nHe was known for offensive characterisations of those whose politics he disagreed with and had a reputation for peddling conspiracy theories to his millions of listeners. \nMr Trump bestowed Limbaugh with the Medal of Freedom - the highest US civilian honour - in 2020.\nBorn in 1951, Limbaugh got his start in radio in the 1980s and was on his way to stardom by the end of the decade when his show was syndicated nationally. \nThe Rush Limbaugh Show is widely considered the most-listened-to show of its kind with an estimated 15 million weekly listeners.\nLimbaugh's wife Kathryn announced his death on the radio show on Wednesday. \n\"I know that I am most certainly not the Limbaugh that you tuned in to listen to today,\" she told listeners, before revealing he had died of complications from late-stage lung cancer.\nTributes have been pouring in from leading figures on the political right.\nMr Trump called into Fox News shortly after news of the death broke to pay tribute to what he called a \"great gentleman, a great man\" with \"tremendous insight\". \nHe told the network he had spoken with Limbaugh \"three or four days ago\" and said the host had been with him from the very beginning of his 2016 presidential campaign.\nJust days after his impeachment acquittal, Mr Trump also again pushed the false narrative that victory had been stolen from him in the 2020 election, saying: \"Rush thought we won, and so do I. I think we won substantially.\"\nMike Pence, the former vice-president, said the country had \"lost a giant\" with the host's passing while former President George W Bush described him as \"an indomitable spirit with a big heart\".\n\"While he was brash, at times controversial, and always opinionated, he spoke his mind as a voice for millions of Americans and approached each day with gusto,\" he said.\nAlthough hugely popular among millions of American Republicans, the radio host was a deeply divisive and criticised figure.\nHe was known for sharing inflammatory views with his millions of listeners and pushing baseless conspiracy theories like casting doubt on ex-President Barack Obama's birthplace.\nEven in his final months of broadcasting, he played down the coronavirus pandemic and touted unfounded claims of electoral fraud.\nA White House spokeswoman said President Joe Biden's condolences went out to Limbaugh's family and friends. \nThere are few people more responsible for the current shape of US conservative politics than Rush Limbaugh. Before social media allowed the masses an avenue to speak outside the filters of mainstream media, Limbaugh did so by building a powerful talk radio megaphone essentially from scratch. And if he didn't invent the genre of right-wing populist radio punditry, he re-invented it for the modern era.\nHis daily radio programme, which expanded into a television and print empire, set the agenda for the Republican Party. He could make or break conservative political careers with a well-timed diatribe or words of praise. He turned back-burner issues into pressing topics of debate. He seemed to welcome controversy and fan the flames of political grievance, knowing they only helped his ratings.\nHe had listeners who tuned in because they loved his politics and listeners who did so because they hated him. He was seldom boring.\nHis critics - and there are many - will say he brought a level of toxicity and vitriol to American politics that has sharpened the nation's partisan divisions.

      "text": "Leaked documents show that three Conservative candidates standing at this year's Senedd election support abolishing the Welsh Parliament.\nAll prospective candidates for the South Wales Central regional list were asked how they would stand in a hypothetical referendum late last year.\nNow BBC Wales has seen statements from three of the selected candidates stating they are anti-devolution.\nWelsh Secretary Simon Hart said attention needs to be on the election.\nThe Tories have won two of the four seats in the South Wales Central region in every Senedd election since devolution in 1999.\nIn December, all candidates for the seats - which is based on the additional member system - were asked about the Senedd during the selection process to determine who would be selected for the list.\nCouncillors Joel James, Calum Davies and Chris Thorne - respectively selected second, third and fourth as Conservative South Wales Central candidates - sent applications to party members setting out their anti-devolution stance.\nThe party's former Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies was selected top of the party's list for the area.\nA party source said his \"CV wasn't abolitionist\".\nCommenting at the time, David Melding, who is standing down as the second Conservative Member of the Senedd for South Wales Central at the 2021 election, said he did not believe \"such a question would have been sanctioned by the Welsh Conservative Party\".\nOne party source dismissed the question as \"random\", but another said it showed the party's \"strong abolish streak\".\nIn an application, seen by BBC Wales, Mr James, councillor for the Llantwit Fardre ward in Rhondda Cynon Taf, said: \"As Welsh Conservatives, is it not our duty to say that after 20 years of devolution, it has failed, and that enough is enough?\n\"I believe that the time has come to respond to the changed political landscape, harness the anger and concerns of those voters ignored by an arrogant and self-electing elite, and take a sledgehammer to Labour's original 'Red Wall', finally ending their devolution experiment in Wales.\n\"I will challenge the cosy Cardiff Bay consensus that has underachieved for Wales for so long, I will continue to push Welsh Labour out of south Wales, and I will campaign to end devolution in Wales.\"\nCalum Davies, is in third spot, with Chris Thorne, in fourth. It is unlikely that either will be elected.\nCalum Davies said in his application: \"The simple truth is devolution is failing and must be abolished.\n\"So, if you want accountability, a disrupter of the cushy Cardiff Bay consensus, and someone who not only recognises the danger in devolution but will fight to abolish it, then I'm your Conservative and Unionist,\" he added.\nMr Thorne said: \"In any future referendum on the future of the assembly, I would vote to abolish the institution.\"\nWelsh Secretary Mr Hart said: \"I'm not in the same place as they are in terms of rolling back devolution and all those things.\"\nHe said it \"reflects intense frustration in the fact that for 23 years there has been a sort of one-party state in Wales\". \n\"And I think everybody's attention needs to be on the election in May.\""

      "text": "Waiting lists for hospital treatment could more than double by April and hit 10 million in England, the Reform think tank is warning.\nA worst-case scenario could see delays continue as a new wave of referrals are made, Reform said. \nTreatment referrals by GPs were six million lower in 2020 than the year before, suggesting a mounting backlog.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said \"trumpeting worst-case scenarios\" was \"not helpful\". \nHe said while there was a \"significant problem\" which would take time and investment to overcome, a similar methodology had suggested waiting lists would hit 10 million by December last year, but they were currently at 4.4 million.\nHe also warned the NHS is likely to be \"at full stretch\" for at least another six weeks and England was still \"some way away\" from being able to start lifting restrictions.\nAre you waiting for hospital treatment? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nMr Hopson, whose organisation represents NHS trusts in England, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say case numbers are \"still far too high\" to end virus curbs. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the end of April, once the top nine priority groups had been vaccinated would be the \"logical point at which we can start considering easing restrictions\".\nSetting out the conditions they believe are needed to allow current restrictions to relax, trust leaders outlined four tests that could be applied.\nAmong the tests are: a \"significant\" drop in case numbers; a return to normal NHS capacity; solid progress with vaccinations; and a \"robust and effective\" strategy to identify new virus variants.\nMr Johnson is due to outline a roadmap for easing the current national lockdown in England on Monday.\nMeanwhile, the head of the UK's vaccine taskforce, Clive Dix, told Sky News all adults could be fully vaccinated by August \"or maybe sooner if we need to\".\nReform - a centre-right think tank that focuses on public services - praised the work of frontline NHS staff, but said more now needed to be done to tackle the growing backlog in care.\nCommunity diagnostic centres for cancer, cardiac and other conditions should be set up to restart screening programmes halted by the pandemic, coupled with a renewed focus on prioritising those most urgently in need of care currently on waiting lists, it said. And for routine treatments, it said more use should be made of the private sector.\nReform's Eleonora Harwich said: \"We must never have the equivalent of a 'National Covid Service' again.\n\"This is a system problem and in no way detracts from the heroic effort of NHS staff battling Covid-19. \n\"However, the cessation of so much non-Covid care means patients are facing more serious health conditions or disabilities, and some will die prematurely.\"\nLayla McCay, director of policy at the NHS Confederation, which represents hospital bosses, accepted the NHS faced a \"mammoth task\" to tackle the backlog - although she questioned the waiting list prediction of 10 million people by April.\nShe said the real problem was that the NHS was under-funded and had been operating \"at the top of its capacity for far too long\".\nResponding to accusations that the NHS has become a Covid-only service, Ms McCay pointed out cancer services were now operating at pre-pandemic levels.\nMr Hopson also said that Reform's suggestion that the NHS had been a \"Covid-only service\" was not helpful as staff had worked hard to keep other services going.\nProf Neil Mortensen, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said tackling the backlog would require both the use of the private sector, and extra investment in the NHS.\nA further 10,625 new coronavirus cases were reported on Tuesday, alongside another 799 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nOver 16 million people have now received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine across the UK."

      "tags": "Facebook,Australia",
      "text": "Facebook has blocked Australian users from sharing or viewing news content on the platform, causing much alarm over public access to key information.\nIt comes in response to a proposed law which would make tech giants pay for news content on their platforms.\nAustralians on Thursday woke up to find that Facebook pages of all local and global news sites were unavailable.\nSeveral government health and emergency pages were also blocked  - something Facebook later asserted was a mistake.\nThose outside of the country are also unable to read or access any Australian news publications on the platform.\nThe Australian government has strongly criticised the move, saying it demonstrated the \"immense market power of these digital social giants\".\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ban on news information had a \"huge community impact\". About 17 million Australians visit the social media site every month.\nHe said the government was committed to passing the law, and \"we would like to see them [Facebook] in Australia.\n\"But I think their actions today were unnecessary and wrong,\" he added.\nGoogle and Facebook have fought the law because they say it doesn't reflect how the internet works, and unfairly \"penalises\" their platforms.\nHowever, in contrast to Facebook, Google has in recent days signed payment deals with three major Australian media outlets. \nFacebook's action came just hours after Google agreed to pay Rupert Murdoch's News Corp for content from news sites across its media empire.\nAustralian authorities had drawn up the laws to \"level the playing field\" between the tech giants and struggling publishers over profits. Of every A$100 (\u00a356; $77) spent on digital advertising in Australian media these days, A$81 goes to Google and Facebook.\nBut Facebook said the law left it \"facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia\".\n\"With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,\" it said in a blog post.\nThe law sought \"to penalise Facebook for content it didn't take or ask for\", the company's local managing director William Easton said.\nFacebook said it helped Australian publishers earn about A$407m (\u00a3228m;$316m) last year through referrals, but for itself \"the platform gain from news is minimal\".\nUnder the ban, Australian publishers are also restricted from sharing or posting any links on their Facebook pages. The national broadcaster, the ABC, and newspapers like The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian have millions of followers. \nFacebook's change also denied Australians access to many key government agencies, including police and emergency services, health departments and the Bureau of Meteorology.\nOther pages for charities, politicians, sports groups and other non-news organisations were also affected.\nFacebook later released a statement which said these pages had been \"inadvertently impacted\" and would be reinstated, though it did not give a deadline.\nA spokesperson said the company had \"taken a broad definition\" of the term \"news content\" in the law.\nThe ban sparked an immediate backlash, with many Australians angry about their sudden loss of access to trusted and authoritative sources.\nSeveral pointed out that Facebook was one crucial way that people received emergency updates about the pandemic and national disaster situations.\nOthers raised concerns about misinformation now freely circulating on the site.\n\"It feels obviously very restrictive in what Facebook is going to allow people to do in the future, not only in Australia but around the world,\" Sydney man Peter Firth told the BBC. \nAmelia Marshall said she could not believe the firm's decision \"in the middle of a pandemic\", adding: \"I've made the long-overdue decision to permanently delete my Facebook account.\" \nHuman Rights Watch' Australia director said Facebook was censoring the flow of information in the country - calling it a \"dangerous turn of events\".\n\"Cutting off access to vital information to an entire country in the dead of the night is unconscionable,\" said Elaine Pearson.\nAustralia's conservative government is standing by the law - which passed the lower house of parliament on Wednesday. It has broad cross-party support and will be debated again in parliament on Thursday.\n\"We will legislate this code. We want the digital giants paying traditional news media businesses for generating original journalistic content,\" said Treasurer Josh Frydenberg who added that \"the eyes of the world are watching what's happening here\".\nHe said he'd also had a discussion with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg which had been \"constructive\".\nBut he pointed out that Facebook, like Google, had been negotiating pay deals with local organisations. This banning action had \"come at an eleventh hour\" and damaged the site's reputation he said.\n\"What they're effectively saying to Australians is: \"You will not find content on our platform which comes from an organisation which employs professional journalists, which has editorial policies, which has fact-checking processes\".\nAustralia is not a big market for Facebook. And Facebook says news isn't a big driver of revenue for the company. So why does it care so much about this law? \nThis is far more about the principle. Other countries have been looking at what is happening in Australia. There's speculation that Canada, even the EU could follow Australia's lead - something Facebook wants to avoid. \nFacebook does already pay for some news. It's entered into commercial deals with media companies in the UK, for example.\nWhat Facebook wants to do, however, is call the shots. \nIts executives do not want governments to step in, telling them they have to pay for news - and even setting the price.\nFacebook, then, has decided to show that there are consequences for governments if they want to take muscular action against Big Tech. \nBut that could backfire spectacularly. That Facebook can essentially switch off Australian news on its platform is already being criticised as anti-democratic - even authoritarian - in some quarters."

      "text": "Boris Johnson says it is \"absolutely right\" to take a \"data not dates\" approach to leaving lockdown, stressing England will ease measures \"cautiously\".\nThe prime minister said he would set out \"what we can\" in a road map for easing restrictions on Monday. \n\"We want to be going one way from now on, based on the incredible vaccination rollout,\" he said.\nIt follows a call from scientists for a data-led approach to lifting measures. \nSpeaking at a mass vaccination centre in Cwmbran, south Wales, Mr Johnson said relaxation of measures would be done in \"stages\" and that the reopening of hospitality was one of the last things to return after the first lockdown.\n\"You have to remember from last year that we opened up hospitality fully as one of the last things that we did because there is obviously an extra risk of transmission from hospitality,\" he said.\nAsked whether he agreed with a data-led approach, Mr Johnson said \"I do think that's absolutely right\" and said the relaxation of measures will be \"based firmly on a cautious and prudent approach\", in such a way as to be \"irreversible\".\nOfficial figures show the UK has recorded a further 12,718 Covid cases and another 738 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Last Wednesday, 13,013 cases and 1,001 deaths were reported.\nA total of 15,940,972 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine.\nAt the weekend ministers were hopeful that schools could reopen from 8 March, with non-essential shops to follow and later pubs and restaurants.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said he expected \"gradual easing\" to be the approach from when restrictions were reviewed but the government needed to \"do more to stop the spread\".\n\"We have to be driven by the data, but we have to be cautious because this has got to be the final lockdown,\" he said.\nProf Dame Angela McLean, deputy chief scientific adviser, earlier told the Commons Science and Technology Committee that each step of easing measures should be \"irrevocable\", adding \"that means we have to be extremely careful, before we add another unlocking\".\n\"We want to understand the impact on each step before taking the next steps,\" she said, adding that required a \"large gap\" after children go back to school.\nProf Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases from Edinburgh University who advises the government, said it was right to be cautious.\nBut he said it must also be recognised the falling rates of infection seen during lockdown were more encouraging than many thought they would be.\nHe said schools were not a \"significant driver of infection\" and there had never been a surge in cases seen across western Europe after reopening schools - although the new UK variant, which is more contagious, needed to be considered.\nOn Tuesday, Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the phased return of primary school pupils from Monday, while in Wales pupils aged three to seven will return to school after half-term. They remain closed to most pupils in Northern Ireland.\nInfection rates are coming down - more quickly than many thought they would given the new more contagious UK variant.\nThe vaccination programme is also going well, providing protection to the most vulnerable. And the arrival of spring should be expected to help keep rates low.\nSo why the caution? While most believe Covid will become seasonal, a bounce-back in the summer is not being ruled out. \nAnd even if rates rebound only a little, there are still large numbers of vulnerable people. Nearly half of hospitalisations have been in the under-70s.\nWhat is more, high levels of infection at a time when vaccines are being rolled out and immunity being built provides the perfect breeding ground for new variants. Mutation may be unavoidable in the long-term, but encouraging them at this point would, many experts believe, be foolish.\nIt means the government is likely to be more cautious than some would want - and indeed maybe need to be given the cost of lockdown. But the judgement being made is it's better to go slowly and surely rather than having to take any more steps back.\nAlso speaking at the committee earlier was Prof Sir John Bell, Oxford University's regius professor of medicine, who said it was \"not plausible\" to expect people to comply with major curbs after they have received two doses of vaccine.\n\"It's better to plan for that than to assume you can hold back the water with a dam, because you won't be able to,\" he said.\nThe committee heard that ministers may need to consider what society sees is an \"acceptable\" level of Covid infection and deaths as restrictions are eased.\nAsked about this on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, Prof Peter Openshaw, from the government respiratory virus threats advisory group Nervtag, said some \"hard-nosed... calculations are going to be done\".\nNHS Providers, which represents health managers, has suggested the number of new daily cases should be below 1,000 before restrictions are lifted.\nThe average is currently above 10,000.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said the end of April, once the top nine priority groups have been vaccinated, was the \"logical point at which we can start considering easing restrictions\".\nMeanwhile, healthy volunteers will be infected with coronavirus to test vaccines and treatments in the world's first \"human challenge\" study which will take place in the UK."

Last Wednesday, 13,013 cases and 1,001 deaths were reported.\nA total of 15,940,972 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine.\nAt the weekend ministers were hopeful that schools could reopen from 8 March, with non-essential shops to follow and later pubs and restaurants.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said he expected \"gradual easing\" to be the approach from when restrictions were reviewed but the government needed to \"do more to stop the spread\".\n\"We have to be driven by the data, but we have to be cautious because this has got to be the final lockdown,\" he said.\nProf Dame Angela McLean, deputy chief scientific adviser, earlier told the Commons Science and Technology Committee that each step of easing measures should be \"irrevocable\", adding \"that means we have to be extremely careful, before we add another unlocking\".\n\"We want to understand the impact on each step before taking the next steps,\" she said, adding that required a \"large gap\" after children go back to school.\nProf Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases from Edinburgh University who advises the government, said it was right to be cautious.\nBut he said it must also be recognised the falling rates of infection seen during lockdown were more encouraging than many thought they would be.\nHe said schools were not a \"significant driver of infection\" and there had never been a surge in cases seen across western Europe after reopening schools - although the new UK variant, which is more contagious, needed to be considered.\nOn Tuesday, Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the phased return of primary school pupils from Monday, while in Wales pupils aged three to seven will return to school after half-term. They remain closed to most pupils in Northern Ireland.\nInfection rates are coming down - more quickly than many thought they would given the new more contagious UK variant.\nThe vaccination programme is also going well, providing protection to the most vulnerable. And the arrival of spring should be expected to help keep rates low.\nSo why the caution? While most believe Covid will become seasonal, a bounce-back in the summer is not being ruled out. \nAnd even if rates rebound only a little, there are still large numbers of vulnerable people. Nearly half of hospitalisations have been in the under-70s.\nWhat is more, high levels of infection at a time when vaccines are being rolled out and immunity being built provides the perfect breeding ground for new variants. Mutation may be unavoidable in the long-term, but encouraging them at this point would, many experts believe, be foolish.\nIt means the government is likely to be more cautious than some would want - and indeed maybe need to be given the cost of lockdown. But the judgement being made is it's better to go slowly and surely rather than having to take any more steps back.\nAlso speaking at the committee earlier was Prof Sir John Bell, Oxford University's regius professor of medicine, who said it was \"not plausible\" to expect people to comply with major curbs after they have received two doses of vaccine.\n\"It's better to plan for that than to assume you can hold back the water with a dam, because you won't be able to,\" he said.\nThe committee heard that ministers may need to consider what society sees is an \"acceptable\" level of Covid infection and deaths as restrictions are eased.\nAsked about this on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, Prof Peter Openshaw, from the government respiratory virus threats advisory group Nervtag, said some \"hard-nosed... calculations are going to be done\".\nNHS Providers, which represents health managers, has suggested the number of new daily cases should be below 1,000 before restrictions are lifted.\nThe average is currently above 10,000.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said the end of April, once the top nine priority groups have been vaccinated, was the \"logical point at which we can start considering easing restrictions\".\nMeanwhile, healthy volunteers will be infected with coronavirus to test vaccines and treatments in the world's first \"human challenge\" study which will take place in the UK."

      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

      "text": "A man denied a \u00a3500 grant after being told to isolate by the NHS phone app has said it was a \"kick in the teeth.\"\nIn Wales, the self-isolation support scheme for low-earners is still not available to people who are notified by the app.\nTaxi driver David Miller lost 10 days of work by isolating and had no grant.\nThe Welsh Government said it was working with councils to \"identify what other alternatives, including manual solutions, can be put in place\".\nThe self-isolation support scheme is intended to help with loss of earnings for those told to self-isolate who cannot work from home.\nIn Wales it is also for parents and carers on low incomes with children who are self-isolating.\nIn December it was reported that the NHS Track and Trace app for Wales and England had been updated to allow people notified that they must isolate to claim the \u00a3500.\nBut while users in England notified by the app can claim the payments after going through an identity-verification process, people in Wales cannot.\nMr Miller, from Pembroke, received a notification on the NHS app on Boxing Day telling him to self-isolate for 10 days.\nAs a recipient of housing benefit he should have been able to claim the \u00a3500 grant to offset his loss of earnings.\nBut when he applied via his local authority he was told they could not pay him. \n\"It was a kick in the teeth really. I've had no help since the pandemic started, financially, from the government.\n\"They ask you to self-isolate to protect others and then you get no financial support so you have got to make a choice of shall I go out and put people at risk because I need to pay my bills or should I struggle financially and stay home?\n\"My choice is listen to the app, stay at home, self- isolate.\"\nBut Mr Miller thinks without the financial support, others are not making the same choice\n\"I have a lot of friends in the taxi trade who wouldn't download the app because of that.\n\"I know people will not adhere to it, I know that for a fact because I've spoken to them. \n\"They can't do it financially.\"\nA mother-of-two from Carmarthenshire, who didn't want to be named, told BBC Wales Live she lied to her doctor to get a sicknote after missing out on the \u00a3500 grant.\nShe had to stay home to look after her son who had been told to isolate, meaning she would lose nearly \u00a3500 in wages.\nShe wasn't eligible for the grant as she is not on benefits, and she would have had to take unpaid leave if she did not have a doctor's note.\n\"It's horrible. I still feel really guilty about it now, but needs must.\n\"When you have to feed your children you do what you have to do.\"\nThe Welsh Government has told Wales Live more than 5,000 payments have been made since the scheme's launch.\nDuring that period around 300,000 positive cases and close contacts were identified by the Test, Trace, Protect system. \nThe charity Resolution Foundation said the figures and its own research showed the payment was \"not reaching enough people\".\nIt has called for a bigger scheme that would operate in a similar way to the job retention furlough programme.\nMaja Gustafsson, from the foundation, said: \"Not supporting the people who fall ill or risk spreading the virus further is going to be devastating for everyone.\n\"Investing in people so that they can do the right thing will be money well spent.\" \nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"Unfortunately, making the necessary changes to enable people to apply for self-isolation payments after being told by the app to self-isolate could take a little while to deliver for Welsh app users. \n\"We are urgently working with local authorities to identify what other alternatives, including manual solutions, can be put in place as soon as possible, to ensure people told to self-isolate via the app are able to apply for the \u00a3500 self-isolation payment if they are eligible.\""

      "text": "Prices rose in January in what some economists warned could mark the first step towards increasing costs post-lockdown.\nConsumers paid more for food and sellers of household goods offered smaller-than-usual New Year discounts, official figures suggest.\nInflation rose 0.7% in the 12 months to January, up from December's 0.6%.\nSome experts warned inflation will exceed the Bank of England's 2% target by the end of 2021.\nInflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase.\nAs well as giving a snapshot of the price of our shopping and services, it influences interest rates and therefore our mortgages and is used to set regulated items, such as train tickets.\nIt's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far.\nA little inflation, however, typically encourages people to buy products sooner and makes it easier for companies to put up wages. And both of those things boost economic growth.\nMost countries' central banks have an inflation target of between 2% and 2.5%.\nRead more here.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), food prices rose by 0.6% in January, compared with a fall of 0.1% last time. \nPremium potato crisps and cauliflowers saw big increases after being discounted before Christmas. The price of fresh salmon and frozen prawns also rose. \nJonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said household goods prices were also higher because there had been less discounting on items such as bedding or sofas.\nBut Mr Athow pointed out that January discounting had continued for some goods, and there was a 4.6% fall in the cost of clothing and footwear.\nExperts said fashion is typically discounted in December and January for festive shoppers.\nSurprisingly, another large contributor to rising costs was restaurants and hotels.\nPrices in this category were estimated to have risen by 0.9% between December and January, largely driven by hotels. Holiday travel is not allowed under current lockdown rules, but hotels are open for people travelling for work and more recently people arriving from high risk countries who must quarantine. \nSome experts warned on Wednesday that inflation could exceed the Bank of England's 2% target by the end of 2021.\n\"January's small rise in CPI inflation marks the first step this year towards an above-target rate by the autumn,\" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Economics said.\nAs cuts in VAT for hospitality and tourism end at the end of March and energy prices rise, \"that alone should push prices up and we expect it to be up at around 2% at the end of the year, but it could be higher than that\", said Karen Ward, chief market strategist for Europe at JPMorgan Asset Management.\nShe added that there could also be  an \"explosion in demand and perhaps not quite enough goods and services to fulfil that\" when lockdown restrictions are finally eased.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that this would mean the Bank of England's next change to interest rates - which are currently at 0.1% - would probably be upwards, though not for some time. \nBut Ed Monk, associate director at Fidelity International, said that the picture overall was \"pretty confusing for prices right now\".\n\"It will take a few months and an ending of current restrictions for the full picture to emerge,\" he said.\nIn the long-term, he said that prices will also depend on how the labour market fares once the government's furlough scheme has ended.\n\"Any increase in unemployment rates could suppress wage and price rises,\" he said. \nThe UK's coronavirus vaccine rollout is also likely to push up inflation as the economy unlocks and consumers may start spending roughly \u00a3125bn in pent-up savings, the Bank of England has previously suggested."

      "text": "Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccination programme has been extended to include carers and more people with underlying health conditions.\nThe vaccine rollout will be divided between GP practices and the seven regional vaccination centres.\nNorthern Ireland's vaccine rollout is running weeks ahead of schedule, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. \nOn Wednesday, the Department of Health recorded six more Covid-19 related deaths, taking its death toll to 2,015.\nPeople aged 18 to 64 with underlying health conditions - as well as their carers - will now be contacted by GPs for their jab. \nThis extended target group largely mirrors those who receive the winter flu vaccine each year because of their medical conditions.  \nCarers aged 60-64, anyone aged 65-69 and those who received a shielding letter because they are Clinically Extremely Vulnerable (CEV) will now be able to receive the vaccine at a regional vaccination centre. \nIn addition, anyone over 70 who has not yet had their first dose from their GP will have the option to book a vaccination appointment at one of the seven regional centres.\nThe timing of vaccination jabs for people with asthma depends on the severity of their condition, and is based on an assessment from their GP, said the health department. \nHealth Minister Robin Swann encouraged anyone eligible for vaccinations to book as soon as possible.\n\"It had been planned to begin vaccinating carers in early March,\" he said. \n\"I am delighted that we are now able to bring this forward, on a staggered basis. \n\"As ever, the rate of our progress through the eligible groups will depend on available supplies of vaccines,\" added Mr Swann.\nThere are currently 434 Covid inpatients in Northern Ireland's hospitals, with 53 being treated in intensive care, 44 of whom are on ventilators.\nThe Department of Health said there were currently 53 active outbreaks in care homes.\nIn Wednesday's figures, the largest increase in cases came in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon area, where 75 extra cases of Covid-19 were reported in the last 24 hours. \nThe council area has also seen the biggest increase in new cases of the virus reported over the last seven days. \nThe Republic of Ireland reported 650 new cases on Wednesday, and 57 Covid-19 related deaths, bringing the country's death toll to 4,036. \nSo far, more than 2,800 people in Northern Ireland who are clinically housebound have received their first Covid-19 jab.\nClinically housebound patients have been receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The department began vaccinating that cohort of patients on 6 February.\nWhile just under 16,000 people are registered to receive the flu vaccine at home according to the Department of Health, a number of housebound people have been receiving their Covid jab at their GP practice as well.\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to meet on Thursday to review the ongoing coronavirus restrictions.\nIt has been seven weeks since Northern Ireland re-entered lockdown and officials have urged caution over the easing of any restrictions.\nA lockdown began in Northern Ireland on 26 December, with schools closed along with non-essential shops.\nIt falls to the five parties that make up Stormont's power-sharing executive to decide whether to extend restrictions beyond 5 March, or begin the process of lifting them."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nThe outgoing children's commissioner for England has called on the government to put vulnerable young people \"centre stage\" of plans to \"level-up\" the country. Anne Longfield, in her last speech after six years in the job, will say that an entire generation risks being forever defined by the coronavirus pandemic and will call for a new \"Covid Covenant\" for education and support in every community. For its part, the government says the most vulnerable children in England can still go to school and it has also worked to provide laptops and data packages for home-schooling.\nResearch by the think tank Reform suggests hospital waiting lists in England could more than double and hit 10 million by April. While praising NHS staff for their work during the pandemic, Reform said more needs to be done to deal with the growing backlog in hospitals. The NHS Confederation, which represents hospital bosses, has questioned Reform's predictions, saying the main issues were under-funding and the health service operating near capacity.\nWork has begun to assess the effectiveness of the coronavirus jab developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca on children. Around 300 volunteers aged between six and 17 are taking part in the trial, with 240 receiving the Covid vaccine and the rest getting a meningitis jab. While children can catch and spread coronavirus they are unlikely to become very sick with it. But the Oxford researchers say this trial is needed to find out whether some young people might benefit from being vaccinated.\nBBC News analysis of data from England suggests the vaccine rollout in England is starting to push down the number of deaths from coronavirus. According to the data currently available, deaths of over-80s fell by 53% between 28 January and 11 February, compared with 44% for under-80s. The number of Covid cases is also down, but this statistic is not a reliable indicator of whether the vaccines are working because the jabs should prevent serious infections. It is expected the government will release more details next week as part of its plans to ease the lockdown in England.\nWith more than 118,000 people in the UK now having died with coronavirus, many of us may end up feeling a bit numb. This is not unusual, psychologist Dr Meg Arroll tells BBC Newsbeat, and is a form of self-preservation. She says that some people may be suffering from \"compassion fatigue\". If you're feeling out of touch with your emotions, there are things you can do to help, including remembering it is OK not to be OK at the moment, looking after your physical health and taking time out for yourself. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "text": "The number of deaths involving Covid-19 in the pandemic has passed the 7,000 mark in Wales.\nBut the number of weekly deaths has fallen for a third successive week, according to latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThere were 314 deaths involving Covid-19 in the week ending 5 February, accounting for 34.8% of all deaths, compared with 37.1% the week before.\nIt takes the total to 7,089 since March last year.\nThe most deaths were again in north Wales with 73 deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area.\nFifty of these were in hospitals and 20 in care homes.\nOf these, 45 were in Wrexham and Flintshire, which have been the hotspots for Covid cases in Wales in recent weeks.\nThere were also 65 deaths in the Cardiff and Vale area.\nThe number of deaths also rose to 17 in Powys, its highest weekly number since the first wave of the pandemic.\nElsewhere, the number of weekly deaths fell.\nIn total in Wales, this meant a drop from 361 deaths the week before.\nIt takes the total of deaths in the pandemic where Covid is mentioned on the death certificate to 7,005 up to 5 February.\nThis is nearly a fifth of all deaths over the period.\nWhen deaths occurring up to 5 February but registered in the week or so after are included, the total is 7,089.\nThe figures also show the peak in the second wave of the pandemic came on 11 January, when there were 81 deaths in Wales.\nThis is even higher than the peak of the first wave, which happened on 12 April, when there were 73 deaths involving Covid-19.\nThe ONS estimates Covid is the underlying cause of death in 90% of those when it is mentioned on certificates by doctors.\nUnlike Public Health Wales, which gives a daily snapshot of deaths, the ONS also includes cases where Covid is both suspected or confirmed.\nIt also covers deaths not only in hospitals, but all care homes and also hospices and people's homes.\nThe ONS figures cover 65 deaths involving care home residents, including 10 in both Carmarthenshire and Wrexham.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing.\nIn Wales, the number of deaths from all causes fell again from 974 to 903 in the week, but it was still 143 deaths (18.8%) above the five-year average.\nRhondda Cynon Taf has had most Covid-19 deaths in Wales over the course of the pandemic - 838 so far.\nLooking at the crude mortality rate - which takes into account population sizes - it also has the fourth highest across England and Wales with 347.3 deaths per 100,000.\nMerthyr Tydfil (328.2) and Bridgend (324.4) also feature in the highest 10 areas."

      "text": "A council that sparked an internet sensation when a meeting descended into chaos has again been dogged by rows.\nA clip of a Handforth Parish Council meeting featuring insults and members being kicked out was watched by millions earlier this month.\nJackie Weaver, who was trending on Twitter after the December Zoom meeting went viral, was not involved when the council met on Wednesday evening.\nMembers of the public interjected and made cat-calls throughout the meeting. \nWednesday's meeting was being watched on YouTube by more than 3,500 people at one stage.\nCouncillor John Smith and chairman Brian Tolver had a tense disagreement over the events of the Cheshire council's viral meeting in December.\nMr Smith offered a lengthy defence of Ms Weaver and described Mr Tolver and others' comments towards her as \"abusive\".\nIn response, Mr Tolver said: \"I have much to dispute in what councillor Smith just said. I don't want to bore everybody but he was wrong on just about every point he raised.\"\nShortly afterwards a member of the public asked Mr Tolver if he would like to apologise for his actions in the December meeting, and Mr Tolver asked for the person to be muted. \nWednesday's meeting included a number of references to the viral meeting, with members of the public interrupting proceedings with laughter and quoting catchphrases like \"read the standing orders, read them and understand them\".\nAn argument also broke out among the councillors about the previous meeting's minutes, with Mr Tolver trying to defer the minutes to a future meeting but other councillors telling him this needed to be decided with a vote.\nMr Tolver then briefly left the meeting after the argument and when a vote on minutes was taking place.\nAlthough Ms Weaver was not part of the meeting she did listen in to parts of it. \n\"I would have been perfectly happy to have been involved this evening but I don't think it's right for Handforth,\" she said.\n\"Now the clerk is back it's absolutely right and proper they've taken their proper place, which they're perfectly competent to do.\"\nBy BBC Cheshire political reporter Phil McCann \nTonight's meeting was a demonstration of why the parish council for this commuter village on the northern tip of Cheshire has become so dysfunctional. \nThe councillors were arguing over nearly everything - most of it being finer points of law and procedure as opposed to policy. \nNot to mention the continual din from more than 80 members of the public who were on the Zoom call un-muted. \nThe most intense debate was about what happened in THAT viral meeting - where the chair who claims he was chucked out asserted that Jackie Weaver had no authority to do so and didn't apologise for his conduct when a member of the public called 'Joe' asked him to. \nAfter that, the councillors agreed the public would be muted.\nCheshire East Council mayor Barry Burkhill, who faces a vote of no-confidence over his role in December's viral meeting, did not attend.\nHe did not send his apologies but the chairman said he had attended a Cheshire East Council meeting earlier on Wednesday.\nHis vote of no confidence was referred to Cheshire East Council's Standards Committee.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?
