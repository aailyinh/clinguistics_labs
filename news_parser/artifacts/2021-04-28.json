      "text": "Boris Johnson has denied reports he said he would rather see \"bodies pile high\" than take the country into a third lockdown.\nSources have told the BBC the prime minister made the comment last autumn.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked the PM: \"Did he make those remarks, or remarks to that effect?\"\nMr Johnson replied \"no\", and challenged Sir Keir to \"substantiate\" the allegations and say where they had come from.\nHe added that last October there were \"very bitter, very difficult\" decisions to be made about whether to go into lockdown.\n\"Lockdowns are miserable, lockdowns are appalling things to have to do, but I have to say that I believe we had absolutely no choice,\" Mr Johnson added.\nThe Labour leader reminded the PM of the ministerial code, which says \"ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation\", and warned Mr Johnson he would return to this issue.\nAt a stormy Prime Minsters Questions, Mr Johnson then came under fire from the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, who said many people would find his reported remarks about bodies piling high \"utterly, utterly sickening\".\nHe claimed people were \"willing to go under oath confirming that the prime minister said these exact words\".\nHe added: \"Parliamentary rules stop me from saying that the prime minister has repeatedly lied to the public over the last week, but can I ask the question, are you a liar prime minister?\"\nMr Johnson paused before standing up to reply, in an anticipation of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle ruling Mr Blackford's comments out of order, as MPs are banned from accusing other MPs of lying.\nSir Lindsay said: \"Can I just say unfortunately they're in order, but were not savoury and not what we would expect.\"\nMr Johnson challenged Mr Blackford to \"produce the author, the person who claims to have heard it, because I can't find them\".\n\"He (Mr Blackford) says that they're willing to go oath. Perhaps they're sitting somewhere in this building, I rather doubt it because I didn't say those words.\n\"What I do believe is that a lockdown is a miserable, miserable thing and I did everything I could to try to protect the British public throughout the pandemic, to protect them from lockdowns, but also to protect them from disease. \n\"We grieve, as I know the whole House grieves, for every family that has lost a loved one.\" \nThe comments - first reported in the Daily Mail - came at the end of October when the government announced there would be a second lockdown in England following a sharp rise in coronavirus cases.\nThe BBC verified through sources that the PM had made the remark, which has also been reported by ITV."

      "title": "Fishmongers' Hall: Usman Khan 'influential terrorist prisoner'",
      "text": "A convicted terrorist who killed two people had been one of the UK's highest risk inmates, an inquest heard.\nUsman Khan, 28, killed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones at Fishmongers' Hall in London Bridge on 29 November 2019.\nEight months earlier he had been released from prison, where he was viewed as an \"influential\" inmate who mixed with high-profile terrorists.\nA panel tasked with managing Khan after his release did not discuss the risks of his London visit, the inquest heard.\nDuring his eight years in prison Khan was considered to be among the 70 highest-risk prisoners in the entire country, jurors were told.\nKhan associated with terrorists including Fusilier Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebowale, and was involved with violent incidents and radicalisation of fellow inmates at seven prisons across England, the inquest heard.\nAt HMP Woodhill he was deemed to be a \"Muslim enforcer\" who headed up \"a bullying gang\".\nSenior investigating officer Det Ch Insp Dan Brown gave evidence about Khan's life and long history of extremism in and out of prison, including:\nJanuary 2011: Khan suggested he had access to a weapon and would \"do someone in the eye or neck\" and wanted to die and go to paradise\nMarch 2011: Khan and others were involved in an attack on another prisoner to shouts of \"Allahu Akbar\"\nNovember 2011: Khan shouted during the two-minute silence for Armistice Day.\nJune 2012: Khan recited a poem including a reference to beheading a \"kuffar\", or non-believer\nMay 2013: A stockpile of chemicals was found in Khan's cell \nNovember 2013: A Church of England chaplain was caught up in an assault by Khan on another prisoner. A razor blade was found in his cell later that day.\nBy March 2017, Khan was at HMP Whitemoor where he remained a high risk, Mr Brown said, and in June of the same year was regarded as an \"influential\" terrorist prisoner involved in \"extremist bullying\".\nEvidence suggested he continued to harbour extremist attitudes and deliberately \"told lies or ticked boxes to achieve progression\", the detective said.\nIntelligence gathered in October 2018 suggested he would \"return to his old ways\" following release, the court heard.\nJurors have also heard Khan engaged with Learning Together, the education project where Mr Merritt and Ms Jones worked, describing it as \"kind of a family\".\nHe launched his fatal attack at one of its rehabilitation conferences held at Fishmongers' Hall.\nThe inquest has heard Khan shaved off his body hair - an apparent preparation for an act of martyrdom - in a toilet cubicle at the venue before attacking fellow attendees.\nHe was chased on to London Bridge by several people, including a serving and former offender, and was then shot dead by police.\nA multi-agency public protection arrangements (Mappa) panel tasked with managing Khan after his release had not discussed the risks his trip might pose, the court was told.\nAt a final meeting on 14 November 2019, jurors heard, the group mentioned arrangements for Khan to travel to London on 29 November.\nHowever, Jonathan Hough QC, counsel for the coroner, said consideration of the trip referred to \"logistics rather than risks\".\nThe inquest hearing continues."

      "tags": "Asia,Coronavirus vaccines,Asia Pacific,Delhi,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Crematoriums in the Indian capital Delhi have been forced to build makeshift funeral pyres, as the city runs out of space to cremate its dead.\nStaff are working around the clock, while parks and other empty spaces are also being utilised for cremations.\nFamilies have had to wait hours before being allowed to cremate their dead due to the rise in demand.\nDeaths have been surging in India as a second wave of infections devastates the country.\nThe rising number of deaths - 380 were recorded in Delhi alone on Monday - has left crematoriums in urgent need of space.\nAt the capital city's Sarai Kale Khan crematorium, at least 27 new pyres have been built and dozens more are being added in a nearby park. Officials are also looking for additional space near the city's Yamuna river bed. \nA worker at the crematorium, which originally had capacity for only 22 bodies, told The Hindu newspaper that they are operating continuously from early morning until midnight. \nIn Delhi, the authorities have reportedly cut down trees in city parks for use as kindling on funeral pyres. Relatives of the dead have also been asked to help with cremations by piling wood and assisting in other rituals.\nThe Ghazipur crematorium in East Delhi has added 20 more pyres in a car park. One official told the Indian Express newspaper that there was a waiting time of three to four hours for cremation, with each body taking up to six hours to burn. \nThe situation is serious at other crematoriums too. Sunil Kumar Aledia, who runs the Centre for Holistic Development, an organisation that is providing assistance with oxygen, meals and cremations, told the BBC that some do not have any space to expand.\nDemand for cremation is likely to remain high. In Delhi - with its population of about 20 million people  - hospitals are full and medical oxygen is scarce. \nIndia has recorded more than a million Covid-19 cases in just a few days. Ambulances, medical oxygen, intensive care unit (ICU) beds and life-saving medicines are all in short supply. \nAt least two hospitals in Delhi have seen patients die after oxygen supplies ran out.  It is becoming difficult for families to take their sick to hospitals even if they manage to find a bed, and many people have died while waiting for one.\nThe city's testing capacity has also been overwhelmed.\nSocial media is awash with frantic pleas for help, with people desperately searching for oxygen cylinders, medicines and ICU beds.  \nMany countries have offered assistance. The UK has begun sending ventilators and oxygen concentrator devices, although a spokesman for the prime minister said it had no surplus vaccine doses to send.\nFrance, Ireland, Germany and Australia are also sending medical equipment. The World Health Organization (WHO), meanwhile, said it would send thousands of oxygen concentrators.\nUS President Joe Biden spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pledged America's \"full support\". The US is lifting a ban on sending raw materials for vaccine production abroad, enabling India to manufacture more AstraZeneca doses. It will also provide medical equipment and protective gear.\nBut Zarir Udwadia, who works in Mumbai hospitals and counsels the government, told the BBC's Today programme the currently pledged supplies would have limited effects. He said he was seeing \"ward after ward full of patients struggling to breathe on ventilators of different forms and shapes\".\nThe number of reported cases declined slightly on Tuesday to 323,144 from the peak of more than 350,000 the day before. The total number of Indian cases so far is nearly 17 million with 192,000 deaths.\nBut it is thought the true figures are far higher.\nAn investigation by television station NDTV found at least 1,150 extra deaths which were not included in Delhi's official Covid count over the last week. Other investigations have found similar examples of undercounting replicated around the country.  \nOn Wednesday, the BBC is bringing you a special day of coverage on the deepening coronavirus crisis in India and its significance for the global fight against the pandemic.

      "tags": "Car Technology,Tesla,Driverless cars,Transport,Road safety,Motoring",
      "text": "\"Self-driving\" vehicles could be allowed on UK roads by the end of this year, the government has said.\nThe Department for Transport said automated lane-keeping systems (ALKS) would be the first type of hands-free driving legalised.\nThe technology controls the position and speed of a car in a single lane and it will be limited to 37mph (60km/h)\nBut insurers have warned the government's definition of ALKS as \"self-driving\" is misleading.\nPreviously, the government had said these new laws would be in place by spring this year and told the BBC there was no delay in its suggested timeframes.\nFollowing a consultation last year, the government has now said that vehicles with ALKS technology can be legally defined as self-driving, \u201cas long as they receive GB type approval and that there is no evidence to challenge the vehicle\u2019s ability to self-drive.\u201d\nThe government confirmed that drivers will not be required to monitor the road or keep their hands on the wheel when the vehicle is driving itself.\nBut the driver will need to stay alert and be able take over when requested by the system within 10 seconds.\nIf a driver fails to respond, the vehicle will automatically put on its hazard lights to warn nearby vehicles, slow down and eventually stop.\nThe Highway Code is now consulting on what rules will be put into new laws to make sure the technology is safely used.\n\u201cThis is a major step for the safe use of self-driving vehicles in the UK, making future journeys greener, easier and more reliable while also helping the nation to build back better,\u201d said Transport Minister Rachel Maclean.\n\u201cBut we must ensure that this exciting new tech is deployed safely, which is why we are consulting on what the rules to enable this should look like.\u201d\nThe technology could improve road safety by reducing human error, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said.\n\u201cAutomated driving systems could prevent 47,000 serious accidents and save 3,900 lives over the next decade through their ability to reduce the single largest cause of road accidents \u2013 human error,\u201d said chief executive Mike Hawes.\n\u201cTechnologies such as Automated Lane Keeping Systems will pave the way for higher levels of automation in future \u2013 and these advances will unleash Britain\u2019s potential to be a world leader in the development and use of these technologies, creating essential jobs while ensuring our roads remain among the safest on the planet.\u201d\nTesla's so-called \"Autopilot\" uses lane technology similar to ALKS. It is considered \"level two\" on the five defined levels of self-driving cars.\nThe next step - level three - would not need the driver's attention at all times, and in theory, the driver could do other things such as check email or even watch a movie - until the car prompts them to take over again. This is would include ALKS.\nHowever, there have been several incidents involving this technology when drivers did not pay enough attention to the road. \nIn 2018, a Nottingham resident was banned from driving after climbing into the passenger seat of his Tesla on the motorway, letting it do the driving.\nA fatal crash in the United States was caused, in part, by the driver playing a video game while leaving his car in \"Autopilot\" mode, before it drove into a concrete barrier.\nA recent report found that the feature can be \u201ceasily tricked\u201d into operating without a driver, adding to the mounting criticisms over the marketing of these features as \"self-driving\", and whether that is misleading to customers.\nThatcham Research, which conducts safety tests for motor insurers, urged caution over defining ALKS as 'self-driving', as the government has done.\n\"ALKS as currently proposed by the government are not automated,\" said Matthew Avery, director of research at Thatcham Research. \"They are assisted driving systems as they rely on the driver to take back control.\n\"Aside from the lack of technical capabilities, by calling ALKS automated our concern also is that the UK government is contributing to the confusion and frequent misuse of assisted driving systems that have unfortunately already led to many tragic deaths.\n\"Consumers will expect the car to do the job of a driver, which current models can't do.\"\nThe autonomous car industry and the UK government share a sunny optimism about progress towards our self-driving future - but in recent years many of their predictions have failed to come to pass.\nIn his 2017 Budget the then Chancellor Philip Hammond promised that driverless cars would be on British roads by 2021. \nWhen I emailed a Treasury official to ask whether that really meant an autonomous vehicle with no safety driver the answer came back in block capitals YES - THIS WOULD MEAN FULL SELF-DRIVING CARS WITH NOBODY BEHIND THE WHEEL. \nThat has obviously not happened and even today's announcement takes us only a short way down that road. \nSystems such as Tesla's Autopilot have been keeping cars in lane on British roads for some years - and at speeds far higher than the 37mph envisaged in the new regulations. \nThe danger is that calling this a \"self-driving\" feature will make motorists over confident. The road to full autonomy has plenty of technical and regulatory challenges - and the trickiest section of the journey is where drivers can begin to let the car take over but still need to stay alert. \nThe government is keen to push the idea that the UK can be a leader in self-driving technology - but safety experts are urging caution about the pace at which the robots can be allowed to take the wheel."

      "tags": "US economy,Infrastructure,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has called for trillions in spending aimed at re-igniting America's economic growth by upgrading its crumbling infrastructure and tackling climate change.\nThe $2.3tn (\u00a31.7tn) proposal would direct billions to initiatives such as charging stations for electric vehicles and eliminating lead water pipes.\nThe spending would be partially offset by raising taxes on businesses.\nThose plans have already roused fierce opposition.\nRepublicans have called the rises \"a recipe for stagnation and decline\", while powerful business lobby groups including the Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce said they supported investments but would oppose tax increases.\nThe pushback is a sign of the tough fight ahead for the plan, which needs approval from Congress.\nJoe Biden could have gone in a number of different policy directions after narrowly getting his covid pandemic aid package through Congress. That he opted to push for an infrastructure bill, rather than upping the pressure for gun control, voting rights, immigration, the environment or healthcare reform, suggests he's looking for a popular, non-controversial legislative second act.\nOf course, like that coronavirus package, the Biden administration is likely to use a massive piece of legislation to quietly advance some of those other policy priorities. The proposal contains hundreds of millions of dollars in green energy spending, expanded care for the elderly and disabled and job training, for instance.\nAlso like the coronavirus aid bill, even non-controversial infrastructure provisions that have high public support will be swamped in partisan acrimony. In particular, Republicans are going to vehemently object to the tax increases for corporations and businesses contained in the proposed legislation.\nChances are, Democrats will again have to go it alone when it comes to passing Biden's legislative agenda.\nThe challenge, then, will be keeping the Democratic coalition together at a time when a wide number of constituencies, many of whom held their tongue during the Covid negotiations, line up to ensure their priorities are funded.\nThe White House has promoted its proposal as the most ambitious public spending in decades, saying the investments are necessary to keep the US economy growing and competitive with other countries, especially China.\n\"This is not a plan that tinkers around the edges,\" Mr Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Wednesday. \"It's a once in a generation investment in America.\"\nIt calls for investing more than $600bn in infrastructure, including modernising roads, replacing rail cars and buses and repairing crumbling bridges.\nBillions more would be devoted to initiatives like improving veterans hospitals, upgrading affordable housing, expanding high-speed broadband, and providing incentives for manufacturing and technology research.\nIt calls for money to be directed to rural communities and communities of colour, including establishing a national climate-focused laboratory affiliated with an historically black university. \nThe spending, which would have to be approved by Congress, would roll out over eight years. \nThe White House said tax increases would offset the cost over 15 years. \nMr Biden called for raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a move that would partially undo cuts the US passed in 2017. He also proposed raising the minimum rate charged for overseas profits.\nIn his speech, in an acknowledgment such plans are likely to face, he said he was also \"open to other ideas\" when it came to paying for the spending.\n\"Failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors,\" he said. \"The divisions of the moment shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for the future.\" \nMr Biden's proposal - which closely resembles promises he made during last year's election campaign - comes just weeks after Democrats muscled through $1.9tn more in aid to address the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic, approving that package without Republican support.\nIt's not clear yet how much of Mr Biden's latest plan will make it through Congress - or how much of another spending package focused on areas such as childcare and education that he plans to unveil in coming weeks.\nPaul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the speedy advance of the pandemic package was unusual. \n\"Normally the negotiations drag on for months and what eventually gets passed, if anything gets passed at all, bears only a passing resemblance to what the administration originally asked for,\" he said. \"We suspect these negotiations will revert to the mean.\"\nEli Allen is director of the Center for Sustainable Careers at Civic Works, a non-profit organisation that offers programmes such as job training focused on careers in sustainable energy in Baltimore, Maryland, a majority black city near Washington, DC.\nHe said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that something resembling Mr Biden's ambitions would eventually pass and  was particularly heartened by Mr Biden's emphasis on creating \"quality jobs\" in terms of pay and benefits - which he said could help set a standard across the industry.\n\"The focus on racial equity is not something we've seen in some of the past federal programmes that we've worked with,\" he added. \"I think that focus \u2026 is very important as we think about strategies to expand access to these jobs, especially for communities of colour.\"\nStefani Pashman is chief executive of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, a regional economic development group in Pittsburgh, the former steel town in Pennsylvania where Mr Biden delivered his speech on Wednesday.\nThe city, located in a state that was key to Mr Biden's election victory, has been working to reinvent itself as a centre for high-tech research in areas such as autonomous vehicles. \nMs Pashman said the president's promise of billions of government dollars has also injected new energy into ambitious local plans, like an effort by Carnegie Mellon University and rail technology company Wabtec to establish a new research lab focused on innovations in freight rail, like autonomous trains.\n\"The idea is to transform the rail industry \u2026 but we need $600m from the federal government to amplify what we're able to do at the local level,\" she said.\n\"The past few years \u2026 I don't think the government was positioned to take this on at the level that it needs to be addressed and invested in to propel our region's economy and all the economies of the nation,\" she added. \n\"It's clear that they're prioritizing infrastructure in a new way.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A single dose of a coronavirus vaccine can reduce household transmission of the virus by up to half, a study shows.\nThose given a first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines - and who became infected three weeks later - were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus on than unvaccinated people, PHE found.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock described the study's results as \"terrific news\".\nHe has urged \"everybody to get their vaccines as soon as they are eligible\".\nIn the study, protection against Covid was seen from about 14 days after vaccination, with similar levels of protection regardless of age of cases or contacts, PHE said in a statement.\nIt added that this protection was on top of the reduced risk of a vaccinated person developing symptomatic infection in the first place, which is around 60 to 65% - four weeks after one dose of either vaccine.\nDr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: \"Vaccines are vital in helping us return to a normal way of life. Not only do vaccines reduce the severity of illness and prevent hundreds of deaths every day, we now see they also have an additional impact on reducing the chance of passing Covid-19 on to others.\"\nBut, while she said the findings were \"encouraging\", she said it was important people continue to act like they have the virus, \"practise good hand hygiene and follow social distancing guidance\".\nHouseholds are high-risk settings for transmission, meaning the study provides early evidence on the impact of vaccines in preventing onward transmission, PHE said. \nSimilar results could be expected in other settings with similar transmission risks, such as shared accommodation and prisons, it added.\nUniversity of Warwick epidemiologist Mike Tildesley said the findings were significant but pressed people to continue to take up vaccination offers.\n\"We need to remember these vaccines are not 100% effective either at preventing severe symptoms or at allowing yourself to be infected but the evidence is suggesting they are providing at least some level of protection from passing the virus on if you do get infected,\" he told BBC's Breakfast.\nHe said the study was extra evidence that as many people as possible needed to be vaccinated, even if they are not at risk of developing severe symptoms, in order to get much higher levels of protection across the population and reduce the number of people who get severely ill and die from the disease.\nThis is the latest piece of evidence to indicate that vaccines are slowing the transmission of the virus as well as saving lives.\nHouseholds are among the most likely places for infection to spread, so these set of results are particularly encouraging. \nPublic Health England has said it would expect similar results in other high-risk settings, such as shared accommodation and prisons. \nAll this bodes well for the continued easing of restrictions, especially as the vaccination campaign is making good progress into younger age groups - who are more likely to spread the virus. \nAnd it also gives further reassurance to those concerned about the fact that children will not be vaccinated - and so might bring infection into households.\nA cause for concern, though, is whether newer variants of the virus, which might be more resistant to vaccines, might cause a new surge in infections. \nBut the expert opinion is that the current vaccines will provide a significant degree of protection, especially against severe illness.\nThe study, which has yet to be fully peer-reviewed, included more than 57,000 contacts from 24,000 households in which there was a lab-confirmed coronavirus case that had received a vaccination, compared with nearly one million contacts of unvaccinated cases.\nContacts were defined as secondary cases of coronavirus if they tested positive two to 14 days after the initial household case. Most of the people in the study were under the age of 60.\nPrevious PHE studies have shown that both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are highly effective in reducing Covid-19 infections among older people, with 10,400 deaths prevented in over-60s by the end of March.\nPHE is also undertaking separate studies on the effect of vaccination on transmission in the wider population."

      "text": "\"Self-driving\" vehicles could be allowed on UK roads by the end of this year, the government has said.\nThe Department for Transport said automated lane-keeping systems (ALKS) would be the first type of hands-free driving legalised.\nThe technology controls the position and speed of a car in a single lane and it will be limited to 37mph (60km/h)\nBut insurers have warned the government's definition of ALKS as \"self-driving\" is misleading.\nPreviously, the government had said these new laws would be in place by spring this year and told the BBC there was no delay in its suggested timeframes.\nFollowing a consultation last year, the government has now said that vehicles with ALKS technology can be legally defined as self-driving, \u201cas long as they receive GB type approval and that there is no evidence to challenge the vehicle\u2019s ability to self-drive.\u201d\nThe government confirmed that drivers will not be required to monitor the road or keep their hands on the wheel when the vehicle is driving itself.\nBut the driver will need to stay alert and be able take over when requested by the system within 10 seconds.\nIf a driver fails to respond, the vehicle will automatically put on its hazard lights to warn nearby vehicles, slow down and eventually stop.\nThe Highway Code is now consulting on what rules will be put into new laws to make sure the technology is safely used.\n\u201cThis is a major step for the safe use of self-driving vehicles in the UK, making future journeys greener, easier and more reliable while also helping the nation to build back better,\u201d said Transport Minister Rachel Maclean.\n\u201cBut we must ensure that this exciting new tech is deployed safely, which is why we are consulting on what the rules to enable this should look like.\u201d\nThe technology could improve road safety by reducing human error, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said.\n\u201cAutomated driving systems could prevent 47,000 serious accidents and save 3,900 lives over the next decade through their ability to reduce the single largest cause of road accidents \u2013 human error,\u201d said chief executive Mike Hawes.\n\u201cTechnologies such as Automated Lane Keeping Systems will pave the way for higher levels of automation in future \u2013 and these advances will unleash Britain\u2019s potential to be a world leader in the development and use of these technologies, creating essential jobs while ensuring our roads remain among the safest on the planet.\u201d\nTesla's so-called \"Autopilot\" uses lane technology similar to ALKS. It is considered \"level two\" on the five defined levels of self-driving cars.\nThe next step - level three - would not need the driver's attention at all times, and in theory, the driver could do other things such as check email or even watch a movie - until the car prompts them to take over again. This is would include ALKS.\nHowever, there have been several incidents involving this technology when drivers did not pay enough attention to the road. \nIn 2018, a Nottingham resident was banned from driving after climbing into the passenger seat of his Tesla on the motorway, letting it do the driving.\nA fatal crash in the United States was caused, in part, by the driver playing a video game while leaving his car in \"Autopilot\" mode, before it drove into a concrete barrier.\nA recent report found that the feature can be \u201ceasily tricked\u201d into operating without a driver, adding to the mounting criticisms over the marketing of these features as \"self-driving\", and whether that is misleading to customers.\nThatcham Research, which conducts safety tests for motor insurers, urged caution over defining ALKS as 'self-driving', as the government has done.\n\"ALKS as currently proposed by the government are not automated,\" said Matthew Avery, director of research at Thatcham Research. \"They are assisted driving systems as they rely on the driver to take back control.\n\"Aside from the lack of technical capabilities, by calling ALKS automated our concern also is that the UK government is contributing to the confusion and frequent misuse of assisted driving systems that have unfortunately already led to many tragic deaths.\n\"Consumers will expect the car to do the job of a driver, which current models can't do.\"\nThe autonomous car industry and the UK government share a sunny optimism about progress towards our self-driving future - but in recent years many of their predictions have failed to come to pass.\nIn his 2017 Budget the then Chancellor Philip Hammond promised that driverless cars would be on British roads by 2021. \nWhen I emailed a Treasury official to ask whether that really meant an autonomous vehicle with no safety driver the answer came back in block capitals YES - THIS WOULD MEAN FULL SELF-DRIVING CARS WITH NOBODY BEHIND THE WHEEL. \nThat has obviously not happened and even today's announcement takes us only a short way down that road. \nSystems such as Tesla's Autopilot have been keeping cars in lane on British roads for some years - and at speeds far higher than the 37mph envisaged in the new regulations. \nThe danger is that calling this a \"self-driving\" feature will make motorists over confident. The road to full autonomy has plenty of technical and regulatory challenges - and the trickiest section of the journey is where drivers can begin to let the car take over but still need to stay alert. \nThe government is keen to push the idea that the UK can be a leader in self-driving technology - but safety experts are urging caution about the pace at which the robots can be allowed to take the wheel."

      "text": "Sainsbury's has slumped to a \u00a3261m loss despite bumper food and Argos sales during the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe supermarket giant said that in the year to 6 March Covid costs \"to help keep our colleagues and customers safe\" had been \"high\".\nHowever, it said it expected profits to bounce back in the coming year.\nRival Tesco reported a sharp fall in profits earlier this month after spending nearly \u00a3900m to carry on trading during the pandemic.\nSainsbury's said it had spent \u00a3485m on Covid-related costs, including paying colleagues that were required to shield or needed to self-isolate. It also paid back business rates relief on its stores in line with rivals.\nThe supermarket giant also paid out restructuring costs, including to close 170 standalone Argos stores.\nSainsbury's \u00a3261m pre-tax loss for the year was despite like-for-like sales rising 8.1%.\nArgos did especially well, with total sales rising almost 11% as digital sales boomed.\nHowever, Argos standalone stores, rather than those inside the supermarkets, were closed for much of the year during lockdowns.\nSainsbury's online sales rose as coronavirus restrictions accelerated internet shopping. Online jumped from 8% of grocery sales to 17% during the year.\nThe retailer has already embarked on a restructuring, and announced in March that 1,150 jobs were at risk.\nDespite a big jump in food sales Sainsbury's is nursing a \u00a3261m loss.\nSupermarkets have been among the big winners during the pandemic but they've also had huge Covid-19 costs, from keeping workers and customers safe to sick pay for staff who've had to shield.\nSainsbury's also incurred \u00a3617m of exceptional costs. Most of this was the result of closing hundreds of standalone Argos stores as it restructures the business.\nThe boss says that like his customers, he's looking forward to things feeling more normal over the coming months.\nBut what is the new normal going to look like for our big grocers?\nIt's not just about the shift to online, grocers are thinking about the future of work, and how to respond if many of us don't return to five days a week in the office.\nSainsbury's is pressing ahead with plans to open more convenience stores and new neighbourhood hub shops - mini supermarkets in smaller towns -  which could be a shrewd move if we're going to be working more from home and shopping locally.\nChief executive Simon Roberts praised the \"heroic\" efforts of staff to keep the business going during the pandemic, but added: \"The cost of keeping colleagues and customers safe during the pandemic has been high.\"\nSusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the costs of operating through the coronavirus crisis have \"seriously dented\" the supermarket giant's bottom line.\n\"Redesigning layouts to keep customers and staff safe, paying colleagues in full who needed to shield, all added [to costs] with \u00a3485m spent on Covid related costs,\" she said.\nSainsbury's also spent \u00a3100m on higher staff salaries and special recognition payments to colleagues \"for their efforts during the crisis\", Ms Streeter added.\nKeith Bowman, equity analyst at Interactive Investor, said the results offered \"broad optimism\" for the future.\n\"[But] intense competition across the sector, including from discount retailers Aldi and Lidl, cannot be ignored,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday Sainsbury's reiterated plans to open 25 to 30 convenience stores per year for three years.\nMr Roberts said this would tap into the coronavirus trend of more people working from home.\nHe said the return of people working a five day week in the office \"is not going to happen\".\n\"As customers find new ways of working it inevitably will mean some of the week working from home,\" he said. \"We believe convenience stores will play a big part in the local community.\"\nSainsbury's already has more than 800 convenience stores, and those \"acted as mini supermarkets in the crisis with sales up 13% on the year,\" he said.\n\"Hundreds of these stores will be in in important locations for customers as they work locally,\" he added."

      "text": "Since the start of the pandemic many of us have been working more flexibly, caring for others and shopping differently. \nWe don't know what \"normal life\" will be like in the future but - with just a week left of campaigning for the Senedd elections - I've been asking politicians from the four main parties what they think it will be like to live and work in Wales in five years' time.\nPlaid Cymru's leader Adam Price says he wants to reverse the trend of past decades when manufacturing firms left Wales to set up in places like China - where wages are lower - leaving jobs axed in Wales.\n\"Instead of spending money writing large cheques to luxury brands coming in for a short number of years to set up factories,\" he says, during our conversation in the town of Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent. \n\"We should be using that money to back Welsh businesses, Welsh entrepreneurs and innovators who have ideas and start their businesses in communities like this in the valleys.\"\nBut the harsh reality for Mr Price is there are many cases of Welsh firms growing and then selling themselves to large UK or international firms. \nA lot fewer grow and stay Welsh-owned - and if the ownership moves outside of Wales, so do the profits.\nMr Price promises to help firms stay in Welsh hands as they grow. \nSIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:  Get extra updates on BBC election coverage\nThe pandemic has been a time for businesses to \"take stock\", according to Russell George of the Welsh Conservatives.\n\"We need to capture that entrepreneurial spirit and support those businesses to grow - small to medium, medium to large,\" he says.\nTo do that, he proposes setting up an arms-length government body called Innovate Wales.\nThis isn't an original idea - in the 1980s and 1990s the Welsh Development Agency was that sort of organisation.\nMr George, talking to me outside the Heart of Wales business park in Llandrindod Wells, Powys, wants that body to give every business in Wales an \"account manager\" to help it grow.\nWith about 250,000 companies in Wales, that's a vast task - a job creator in itself.\n\"There will be jobs rooted in the local communities where people live,\" says Welsh Labour's Mark Drakeford, talking to me at Barry Island.\n\"Jobs that can't be moved overseas - jobs that perhaps we haven't valued that we should have in the past.\" \nHe adds there will also be jobs that use Wales' natural resources, and predicts an energy revolution where homes generate as much energy as they use.\nHe also believes there should be support for highly-skilled sectors where Wales is already successful, like cyber security.  \nThe Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, plan to invest in making our houses warmer and cheaper to run, which they say would help smaller firms grow.\nWALES ELECTION: THE BASICS\nWhat's happening? On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.  Find out more here.\nWhat powers does the Senedd have? MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. \n\"If you retrofit a home, it's cheaper to heat, financially better to sell or rent, it contributes to combating climate emergency and you're training to be able to do that,\" says leader Jane Dodds. \nShe says that would benefit small firms to self-employed contractors. Manufacturers would benefit too, she says, as they would make the products needed. \nThe Lib Dems are bringing back a well-worn phrase: \"Brand Wales.\"\nIts message, says Ms Dodds, is that \"we are new Wales and we want people to come here to work with us and for us\". \nBut why would they come here? \n\"Creating opportunities, development grants, good deals to make sure we get specialist skills and specialist companies,\" she says.\nJust as I'm starting to feel like we're going back to the '90s, Ms Dodds tells me she doesn't want to be going back to the days of the Welsh Development Agency - instead she wants to see smaller organisations. \nBefore Covid shook up the way we work and live, many thousands of people commuted to offices and call centres miles from where they live.\nThat was a difficult juggle for people caring for children or older relatives.\n\"If we've learnt one thing from the pandemic, we no longer need people travelling every day to an office location,\" says Mr Drakeford.\n\"We can work equally successfully closer to home - and at home.\"\nHis party would also develop hubs where people from all sorts of employers could work nearer their homes.\nIs that just useful for professionals in offices? Not according to Mr Drakeford, who says call centres have also shown their teams can work well remotely. \nPlaid Cymru also wants to develop hubs and Mr Price suggests these could be based near stops on the new Metro.\n\"Most of us in Wales don't live in cities - we live in towns and villages and valleys and we need to have our economic and transport policies reflecting that,\" he says.\nThe Lib Dems also want these hubs, adding they could help counteract loneliness and mental health issues from isolation, which have been a big issue during the pandemic. \nWith investments in the M4, A55 and A40 a Conservative priority, does the party expect as many of us to commute to work as before the pandemic?\nMr George says not.\n\"You won't just see people going to work, there's haulage moving from one place to another,\" he says.\nHe adds people will still probably have to go into their place of work for a couple of days a week, even with a shift to more home working and \"you're still going to have huge amounts of traffic on the M4\".\nMr George believes flexible working benefits businesses \"because you get the best out of workers\". \nHe argues, if employers make it possible for parents to work from home and pick children up from school, for example, a wider number of people will want to work for them.\nBusinesses, he says, \"will continue to think differently about how they can operate differently to get a bigger pool of skills\".    \nMs Dodds wants the change in working hours to be open to everybody.\n\"There used to be a massive begging - from mainly women - for condensed working hours, for example, but the whole thing has changed,\" she says.\n\"But it has to be fair\". \nWelsh Labour sees high streets as places where people will work, live and be entertained.\n\"I don't think the future of the high street is trying to recreate what was there in the past,\" says Mr Drakeford.\nHe says centres of towns need a \"vitality that lives beyond the working day\".\nBut hasn't the pandemic highlighted how people cherish more space in their homes - and a garden?\nHe says people want different things at different times in their lives, such as being close to services or entertainment.\nMr Drakeford vows to put new jobs from the public sector on high streets, getting \"more people living in the centre of our towns, a mixed approach\".\nMr Price, meanwhile, still sees businesses as the heart of high streets - but not large business chains.\nHe talks of a wave of investment involving \"bright people from Wales who have ideas about independent businesses that could transform high streets\".\nBut traditionally Wales has had a relatively low proportion of entrepreneurs.\nMr Price says Wales needs a \"business revolution with enterprise and innovation at the core at every level\".\nHe does not need reminding, however, that over the years there have been many programmes to develop an \"entrepreneurial spirit\" in Wales.\nThe Welsh Conservatives aren't suggesting a revolution - instead they would bring in free parking and scrap business rates for small firms. \nMr George says people need to realise \"our high streets are changing\".\n\"What we've seen in Wales is that people are willing to shop more local and again we have to retain that,\" he says.  \nSmall businesses have adapted well in the pandemic, says Mr George, because they are more agile and change more easily, developing websites and offering click and collect.\nSo, are ideas like free parking and lower overheads enough to breathe life into struggling town centres? \nMs Dodds - standing in Abergavenny's town centre - says some independent shops selling essentials like \"our butchers and small delis\" have done well during the pandemic and need to continue being supported.\nShe has another vision of the future - the \"15-minute city\" - where, she says, we can \"guarantee somebody has the bank, the post office and essential shops within a 15-minute walk of where they are\"."

      "text": "The government has been defeated for a fourth time on its Fire Safety Bill as the House of Lords voted to shield residents from fire safety work costs.\nMPs had, earlier in the day, rejected the Lords amendment but it will now be reinserted into the bill.\nThousands of leaseholders are currently facing large bills to pay for safety improvements following the Grenfell fire which killed 72 people.\nHousing minister Chris Pincher said the Lords' amendment was \"ineffective\". \nThe Fire Safety Bill must be approved by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords if it is to become law.\nThe government is under pressure to get the bill passed before the end of the parliamentary session on Thursday.\nIf the bill is not approved by both MPs and peers before then, it will be dropped - although the government could choose to carry it over to the next session. \nThe issue of who should pay for fire safety work has become a sticking point, with the House of Commons repeatedly voting to reject Lords amendments on the subject.\nThe government introduced its Fire Safety Bill to address safety concerns triggered by the 2017 fire.\nThe bill modifies a previous law to clarify that building owners must manage and reduce the risk of fire in their properties. \nHowever, last week the House of Lords added an amendment which sought to ensure building owners do not pass on the costs to leaseholders and tenants until a support scheme is in place.\nIn February, ministers said it would introduce a loan scheme to cover repair work with repayments capped at \u00a350 a month.\nOn Tuesday afternoon - despite a rebellion by 31 Conservative MPs - the House of Commons rejected the Lords' amendment.\nBut, later on Tuesday evening the House of Lords voted by 329 votes to 247 to reinsert the motion.\nMr Pincher called the Lords' amendment \"ineffective and defective\". \nHe argued it would prevent any remediation costs from being passed to the leaseholder, even in instances where the cost was very minor - such as replacing a smoke alarm.\nThe minister also warned that the amendment would slow down repair work as it did not make clear who would be responsible for the costs.\nAnd in the Lords, communities minister Lord Greenhalgh called the proposals \"unworkable\" and wouldn't \"deliver solutions for leaseholders\". \nLabour's shadow Home Office minister Sarah Jones said thousands of leaseholders were \"worrying about their futures, getting into debt and facing bankruptcy\".\n\"Why, when it is directly in their gift, won't the government pay to fix these problems and then go after the building companies and developers who are responsible,\" she asked.\nThe government also faced criticism from its own MPs, including former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith.\nHe acknowledged problems with the Lords amendment but said \"My problem is I don't see the government responding to what is an overwhelming concern about what's happening to leaseholders.\"\nAnother Conservative rebel, Stephen McPartland, told MPs: \"It astonishes me that people in government cannot hear the screams of pain from people begging from help.\"\n\"Homes have to be made safe it is a basic human right.\"\nThe bill will now return to the Commons on either Wednesday or Thursday for MPs to reject or agree the Lords amendment.

Wales, meanwhile, has been inviting over-40s for vaccination, as well as over-30s in some areas. Scotland has been inviting the over-45s for vaccination.\nAcross the UK, there have now been 152,205 deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nThe highest number of deaths to occur on a single day was 1,477 on 19 January, the ONS added.\nHowever, it also said deaths involving Covid-19 in England and Wales have fallen by 97% since the peak of the second wave of the virus.\nA total of 266 deaths occurred in the week ending 9 April where Covid-19 was recorded on the death certificate - this is down 97% from 8,965 deaths in the week to 22 January.\nAnother set of figures produced by the government, which measure deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test result, show 127,434 Covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic, after a further 6 were reported on Monday.\nAt Tuesday's cabinet meeting, the PM \"re-iterated that the data continues to look good but warned that we are not out of the woods yet as variants of concern continue to pose a threat\", a No 10 statement said.\nThe statement continued: \"The PM said that while the road ahead looks positive, there will still be challenges and this government will continue to take tough decisions where necessary to protect both lives and livelihoods.\"  \nWhile England's vaccine rollout continues to draw praise, its approach towards the policing of Covid lockdown breaches has been criticised as \"muddled, discriminatory and unfair\" by a parliamentary committee.\nMPs on the Joint Committee on Human Rights want a review of all the fixed penalty notices served for lockdown breaches, which can be as high as \u00a310,000.\nThe JCHR, which is made up of MPs and peers, said it had \"significant concerns\" about the validity of fines, the inadequacy of the review and appeal process, the size of the penalties and the criminalisation of those who could not afford to pay.\n\"The whole process disproportionately hits the less well-off and criminalises the poor over the better off,\" said the committee chairwoman, Labour MP Harriet Harman.\nAccording to the report, coronavirus rules have changed at least 65 times since March 2020.\n\"It is possible to tell from penalties that have not been paid and have then progressed through the system towards a prosecution, that a significant number of FPNs are incorrectly issued,\" the committee said.\nA government spokesperson said it was right there were consequences for those who most flagrantly breached the rules.\nElsewhere, medical supplies from the UK arrived in India, the first international shipment aimed at stemming a devastating Covid surge.\nIndia recorded 320,000 new infections on Tuesday, and deaths have risen to almost 200,000 overall.\nThe UK shipment of 200 pieces, including ventilators and oxygen concentrators, to help hospitals manage oxygen supplies was unloaded at Delhi airport on Tuesday.\nHowever, asked if surplus vaccines would be sent to India, the PM's spokesman said: \"We don't have surplus doses.\"\nThe spokesman added: \"We committed in February to sending excess doses from the UK's supply to the Covax procurement pool and to countries in need once they are available.\" \nHow has coronavirus affected you?

      "tags": "Housing,Welsh government,UK fire safety",
      "text": "People living in flats with extensive fire safety defects are calling on politicians to commit to helping them pay huge remediation costs. \nAbout 50 private residential blocks more than 18m high have combustible cladding and other defects in Wales.\nDespite work by some developers, some leaseholders still face spiralling costs to pay for the work.\nAhead of May's Senedd election, parties are promising plans to improve the situation for leaseholders.\nMany thousands of flat owners around the UK face huge bills for fire-safety improvements, brought in after 2017's Grenfell Tower fire when flames spread via combustible cladding, killing 72 people.\nZoe Griffiths lives at South Quay near Swansea's marina. The majority of the development was built by Carillion, which went bust in 2018.\nSignificant fire safety issues have been identified which affects more than 160 units, including combustible cladding and compartmentation defects. \nThe building's NHBC warranty has expired, which leaves homeowners to pick up the bill of the remediation work.\n\"We are left being accountable for the remediation work out of our own pockets,\" said Ms Griffiths.\n\"The insurance costs from 2020-21 have increased by 371%, our service charges have increased by 167%. \n\"We're left footing the bill for our cladding - in real terms what that means is we are paying for \u00a3335,000 out of our own pockets to meet the new fire regulations.\"\nShe said millions of pounds had been pledged last year by the Welsh government but \"we haven't seen any of it in the private sector\". \n\"They're very future-focused, but we're seeing no action being present based,\" said Ms Griffiths.\n\"We'd like to see the next Welsh government come forward and be supportive of the health and wellbeing, and the safety of all their people and the leaseholders, and put as a priority the spending of the money that should be allocated to the cladding.\"\nEarlier this year, the Labour Welsh government explained that money given to Wales from Westminster through the Barnett formula in 2020 had been put into the effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn February it said \u00a332m would be committed to address fire safety defects during the 2021-22 financial year.\nIn England, disagreement continues between the government, opposition parties and members of the House of Lords over who should pay for fire safety work there. \nResidents at the Victoria Wharf development in Cardiff Bay claim not to have seen any of that money, despite ongoing problems.\nFollowing an \"intrusive survey\" in 2019, the blocks of flats were found to have missing firebreaks and problems with compartmentation, which is when measures are put in place during construction to ensure a fire in one flat is not able to spread.\nResident Cerys Owen, who set up Wales Leaseholder Action Group, said the majority of internal remediation work had been undertaken by the developer, Taylor Wimpey, but external cladding problems remained.\nInterim measures such as new fire alarms and a waking watch - people who continually patrol all floors ready to wake up residents if there was a fire - have been paid for by the leaseholders.\nMs Owen said the building's insurance had \"skyrocketed as a result of the problems, up from \u00a365,000 for the development to \u00a3629,000 this year\". \n\"Per leaseholder that's just over \u00a31,000. So far, I've personally had to pay out around \u00a33,000,\" she said. \n\"The estimate to fix everything else in the development is around \u00a328m and that translates to about \u00a360,000 per leaseholder.\n\"The interim measures in themselves are enough to bankrupt people and put them in a really difficult position so it's not feasible at all that we can pay that \u00a360,000 bill if it lands on our doorstep.\"\nAhead of the Senedd election, Ms Owen said: \"The lack of support from Welsh government to date has been really tough for us to accept. \n\"It's understandable that Covid has been a huge issue for us all.\n\"But what we hope to see now, and what we hope to see with whoever is voted in after the election, is a Welsh government willing to step up and support us, willing to work with us on any solutions going forward, and fundamentally put the money they have received in place and use it for its intended purpose - to protect us, to help us with all these costs for the fire safety issues which we're facing.\n\"You know, we've heard from them many times [that] it's unfair we're in this situation and that leaseholders shouldn't pay.\n\"But we need to see action from whoever is voted in because it's not enough any more to say leaseholders shouldn't pay because we are paying now, so we need to see that support immediately.\"\nIf re-elected on 6 May, Welsh Labour said it would create \"a fire safety fund for existing buildings\".\nA spokesman said the party was \"committed to the very highest standards of building safety in Wales\", and it was proposing a new fire safety regime \"to move Wales forward with improved safety of high rise and other buildings, including new duty holder roles, a new process for identifying risk and changes to regulation so that we improve the way we design, build, manage and live in buildings across Wales\".\nThe Welsh Conservatives have criticised the current Welsh government, saying it had \"failed to spend monies provided by the UK government to specifically tackle the problem of fire safety in apartment blocks\".\nThe party said if elected it would \"establish a fire safety fund to compensate leaseholders for fire safety works and the scourge of tackling unsafe cladding, guaranteeing any Barnett consequentials from the UK government to the fund\".\nPlaid Cymru said it would \"seek the powers to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of large developers, and use the proceeds to solve the problems created by poor builds\". \n\"This will improve safety and avoid owners being trapped into poor quality flats and houses with no recourse, which has been the case with the cladding scandal. We will also improve consumer protection for poor quality in new builds.\"\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said: \"Many people living in high-rise properties across Wales do not feel confident that their property is safe and are worried about potential fire risks.\n\"It's high time the Welsh government acted to make these homes safe.\"\nPropel, which has campaigned in support of leaseholders facing rising remediation costs, said it would introduce a Housing Justice Act which would include an annual service charge cap for leaseholders, linked to the Consumer Price Index, and it would \"stipulate not to grant building contracts to existing developers until they have rectified dangerous fire cladding in previous developments\". \nIt said: \"No other party has made this commitment. Propel will not abandon leaseholders living in dangerous flats.\"\nOther parties standing for election, including Reform, have also backed calls to alleviate leaseholders of the financial burden to carry out remediation work."

      "text": "Two Spanish journalists and an Irish national abducted near a nature reserve in eastern Burkina Faso have been killed.\nThe Europeans were part of an anti-poaching patrol that was ambushed by gunmen near Pama Reserve on Monday. \nBurkina Faso government officials confirmed their deaths on Tuesday. A local soldier was also abducted, but his status is unknown. \nIt remains unclear who carried out the attack. \nThe West African country is facing a deepening security crisis, like many of its neighbours, as Islamist armed groups carry out raids and kidnappings across much of the region. \nThe patrol on Monday included soldiers, forest rangers and foreign reporters.\nTwo soldiers wounded in the ambush told the Associated Press (AP) news agency the attack had been launched by jihadists who had outnumbered the patrol.\nOne of the soldiers was shot in the leg and the other in his arm, causing it to be amputated, according to AP. The soldiers said they had tried to form a protective shield around the foreigners, but realised when the shooting stopped that they had disappeared.\nVehicles and weapons were also seized in the attack.\nSpanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya told reporters on Tuesday that bodies found in the area appeared to be those of two Spanish journalists who had been filming a documentary.\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez later tweeted: \"The worst news is confirmed.\"\nHe named the journalists as David Beriain and Roberto Fraile, and praised \"those who, like them, carry out courageous and essential journalism from conflict zones\".\nMr Beriain was a seasoned journalist who had reported from around the world and launched his own production house, while Mr Fraile had covered several conflicts as a cameraman, including the war in Syria.\nOn Tuesday Burkina Faso officials confirmed their deaths, as well as the death of an Irish national. \nThe Irish victim was named as Rory Young, co-founder and president of the anti-poaching group Chengeta Wildlife. The organisation called him an \"inspirational leader\".\nIn a statement, Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he had learned with \"deep dismay\" of Mr Young's death, and offered condolences to the families of all three victims. \n\"The minister condemns in the strongest possible terms the actions of those who are responsible for this attack. We will continue to liaise with the authorities and partners on the ground on the matter,\" the statement said. \nA senior security source told AFP news agency that the three Europeans had been \"executed by terrorists\".\nThe secretary general of journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders reacted to the news on Twitter, saying \"this tragedy confirms the great dangers reporters face\" in Africa's Sahel region.\nDetails of what happened to the local soldier who was abducted were not immediately clear.\nThe kidnappings are the latest in the former French colony where wildlife reserves used to be popular with tourists.\nBut many of them are in territory now targeted by jihadists.\nMilitant Islamist groups are believed to be holding several foreigners hostage in Burkina Faso, as well as in the neighbouring states of Mali and Niger, Reuters news agency reports.\nThe semi-arid region, known as the Sahel, has been hit by an insurgency since the militants captured large parts of northern Mali in 2012 and 2013.\nFrance and other foreign allies have deployed troops to the region but have failed to end the insurgency. \nThe conflict has displaced nearly three million people."

      "tags": "Snowdon",
      "text": "Wales' highest mountain could only be called by its Welsh name under plans being considered by park authorities.\nIt follows a motion brought by a Gwynedd county councillor that Snowdonia National Park authorities be asked to only refer to Snowdon as Yr Wyddfa, and Snowdonia as Eryri.\nThe mountain in Snowdonia National Park stands at 3,560ft (1,085m) and attracts about 400,000 walkers a year.\nBut the park authority said a task group would consider the proposal.\nSnowdonia National Park Authority (SNPA) said the motion was not discussed at a meeting on Wednesday as it would be considered by its task group, set up to adapt guidelines on the use of Welsh place names. \nThe Welsh name for Snowdon, Yr Wyddfa, means grave and is pronounced like \"er with-va\".\nThe story goes in a legend that the giant Rhita Gawr, the king of Wales, was buried under a cairn of stones on the summit of the mountain, following a battle with King Arthur.\nIt is said that the giant defeated 30 kings of Britain, taking their beards to create a cloak of the beards, reaching from his shoulder to the floor.\nMeanwhile, Eryri, the Welsh name for Snowdonia, is believed to originate from the Latin: oriri (to rise) and was first documented in the 9th Century, despite it long being thought to refer to the Welsh name for eagle - Eryr, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nThe English names for Snowdonia and Snowdon are thought to derive from the Saxon: snow dune, meaning snow hill.\nHill expert Myrddyn Phillips said, according to Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan's Dictionary of the Place-Names of Wales, the name Snowdon is documented as far back as far 1095, while the first known reference to Yr Wyddfa was in 1284.\nThe highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest, is not commonly known by its Tibetan name Chomolungma, meaning goddess mother of the world.\nMany Sherpas, a community indigenous to the Himalayan region, believe that the summit of Chomolungma is home to the Buddhist goddess Miyolangsangma.\nIts English name comes from Colonel Sir George Everest, who was born in Crickhowell, Powys, in 1790, who was a Surveyor General of India.\nMeanwhile, Australia's giant monolith Ayers Rock was renamed Uluru in 1993, switching from its colonial namesake, former South Australian Premier Sir Henry Ayers, to the language of its traditional owners, the Anangu people.\nIn 2002, that dual name was officially reversed, making it Uluru/Ayers Rock. Almost all Australians now refer to it as Uluru.\nCouncillor John Pughe Roberts, who put forward the motion for Snowdon and Snowdonia, said many members were \"complaining that people are changing house names, rock names, renaming the mountains\".\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme, Mr Roberts, who represents Corris Mawddwy in Gwynedd, said: \"In this area, for example Bwlch y Groes has become Hellfire Pass, Dol Hir is known as Longmeadow and this is happening in many areas.\"\nAfter learning of the decision that his motion was to be considered by the park authority's task group, he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service he was \"naturally disappointed\".\n\"There's much talk of people wrongly changing Welsh house names into English and long established place names being eradicated, but the public sector has a duty to lead the way here rather than insisting on this bureaucracy of kicking the can down the road to another committee,\" he said.\nSNPA chairman Wyn Ellis Jones said: \"Authority members decided that there was no need to consider the motion today as a Welsh place names task and finish group has already been appointed. \n\"This follows previous consideration by the members in a working group which recommended to establish and adopt guidelines to guide the use of place names by the SNPA.\"\nHe also said authority members would consider these issues once the task group was able to make recommendations. \n\"The authority is committed to protect and promote the use of native place names for everyday use and future generations,\" he added."

      "text": "The FBI has carried out searches at the home and office of Rudy Giuliani, who was Donald Trump's personal lawyer.\nThe raid is part of a probe into Mr Giuliani's dealings with Ukraine. His lawyer says he denies breaking the law.\nBefore the 2020 presidential election Mr Giuliani led an effort to find incriminating information about Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.\nMr Biden won the election and he and his son have denied any wrongdoing.\nMr Trump was impeached in 2019 over allegations he sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election.\nSearches took place on Wednesday at the former New York City mayor's Upper East Side apartment, as well as his Park Avenue office.\nSeveral electronic devices belonging to the 76-year-old were seized, according to the New York Times.\nThe warrants included an allegation that Giuliani failed to register as a foreign agent. The Foreign Agents Registration Act requires people to notify the State Department if they are acting as a foreign agent on behalf of another nation.\nMr Giuliani's lawyer, Robert Costello, called the searches \"legal thuggery\".\n\"This is totally unnecessary,\" Mr Costello told Fox News, adding that the search was conducted to \"make him look like he's some sort of criminal\".\nHe added that the raids stem from an \"alleged incident of failure to register as a foreign agent\".\nMr Giuliani has previously called the investigation \"pure political persecution\".\nMr Giuliani played a central role in the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm. He was also instrumental in the ousting of the former US ambassador to Ukraine, witnesses at Mr Trump's impeachment trial testified.\nHunter Biden is facing an unrelated criminal tax probe from the US Justice Department.\nWednesday's search warrant does not imply criminality on the part of Mr Giuliani, but it signals a ramping up of the case into the former mayor.\nInvestigators have released few details so far about the case and it remains unknown whether the Republican will eventually face any charges.\nThe search warrant was signed by a federal judge. Warrants against lawyers such as Mr Giuliani require the authorisation of senior Justice Department officials, the Associated Press reports.\nMr Giuliani began representing the former president in April 2018 when Mr Trump was being investigated for his involvement with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nAfter Mr Trump's election loss in November, Mr Giuliani toured the country speaking to Republican state legislators in an effort to get state lawmakers to overturn the result in favour of Mr Trump."

Hundreds of workers would usually be going home, but this afternoon just 10 workers have left the site.\nThey kept their heads down as they walked through the main gates.

You're allowed to shake hands,\" he told the BBC.\n\"This is also a test for events that are nothing to do with business because nobody really knows what's going to happen,\" said Mr Hemmingway.\n\"But I am pretty confident that as human beings we enjoy getting together... it's made us what we are.\"\nAfter the presentations and networking, a comedy show was due to take place to monitor audience laughter - another milestone moment.\nGarth Dallas from the event team said: \"This is just amazing. Liverpool is an event city and that's why we were chosen to be part of this.\n\"Businesses have embraced this. Not all - but enough for us to hold this event.\"\nOther pilot events being monitored in the government's research programme are the World Snooker Championships, held in Sheffield on 17 April, and the Brit Awards in London on 11 May.\nThe data gathered will be used to determine how festivals, gigs, conferences and sporting events can take place again with large audiences.\nUnder the government's current roadmap 21 June is the earliest date that such events will be allowed. \nBefore the pandemic, the business meetings and events sector was worth \u00a370bn to the economy every year and supported 700,000 jobs. \nWhile some businesses in the sector have pivoted successfully to online conferences, a lot of the sector has experienced an extremely challenging year.\nProfessor Iain Buchan, from the Institute of Population Health at the University of Liverpool, said it was \"heartening\" to see people reconnect but the organisers were also looking for lessons to learn.\n\"We want to start cautiously with venues like this that are easy to reconfigure... looking at movement in the venues, are there any bottlenecks we can do something about? Is our ventilation really working?\"\nHe said delegates were not compelled to be mask-free as part of the pilot event but to practise \"good citizenship\"... adding scientists were \"not expecting to find transmission of the virus\".\nThe events industry has been particularly hard-hit by the restrictions introduced because of the pandemic.\nIn order to \"keep events sustainable\", Professor Buchan said systems were in place to \"respond very quickly if rates increase\".\nBrendan Kenny and Jim Forshaw were among those attending the event from Liverpool's business community.\nMr Kenny, who works in the construction industry, said: \"It's absolutely fantastic. Great to see people, great to engage... do what we used to do.\"\nMr Forshaw, a flooring business owner, added: \"It's nice to get back to some sort of normality. It's nice to see people's full faces.\"\nIt has taken a considerable amount of work to get to a position where an event on this scale and under these conditions can be held safely.\nClaire McColgan, Director of Culture Liverpool, told the BBC: \"This has been the biggest learning curve of my whole career. It's been really tough.\n\"This time we're not worrying about the weather or how many people are coming to an event.\"\nShe added: \"48% of our economy comes from the visitor economy. We've had to sit on Zoom calls for a year and a half.\n\"But we're not a city about buildings, we're a city about people, animation and life.\""

      "text": "US President Joe Biden is expected to call for free pre-school and community college in his first speech to a joint session of Congress.\nSpeaking on the eve of his 100th day in office, the Democrat will call for the most sweeping revamp of US social benefits since the 1960s. \nHis plan includes $4tn (\u00a32.9tn) of spending on education and family leave.\nHistory will also be made as two women sit behind the president for the first time during a speech to Congress.\nUS Vice-President Kamala Harris and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi will both wear masks at the rostrum during Wednesday night's primetime address.\nThe US president's State of the Union-style remarks will be followed by the traditional rebuttal speech from the opposing party - delivered on this occasion by Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican.\nMr Scott, a potential 2024 White House contender who is African American, is a leading voice in his party on race.\nMr Biden will speak at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST on Thursday) from a US Capitol that is still ringed by security fencing and guarded by hundreds of National Guard troops following the storming of the complex on 6 January by pro-Trump protesters.\nAhead of his speech, he will meet congressional staff who were trapped in the building during the riot, the White House said.\nAround 1,600 guests usually attend a president's address to a joint session of Congress. But this time only about 200 people will get invitations because of virus-prevention protocols.\nBuoyed by solid approval ratings, Mr Biden will look to the tens of millions of Americans that the White House hopes will tune in from home.\nThe president will seek to build public support for two massive packages - the\u00a0American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan - which analysts project would entail the most far-reaching reform of the US social safety net since the 1960s.\nThe White House says both proposals if passed by Congress would be \"fully paid for\" by tax hikes on the richest Americans and corporations.\nThe American Families Plan, with a price tag of $1.8tn, aims to provide free pre-school for US children aged three to four, paid family leave and free community college, the White House said on Tuesday.\nIt would also extend until 2025 a child tax credit that was expanded during the pandemic, offering monthly payments to lower-income parents of around $300 per child. Democrats reportedly hope to establish these payments as a permanent government programme.\nThe White House has indicated the package would be funded by almost doubling the capital gains tax rate on incomes above $1 million to 39.6% and hiking the top income tax bracket for households earning more than $400,000 to the same level.\nReports of Biden plans for an increase in capital gains taxes sparked a stock market sell-off last week. \nWe thought that Joe Biden - all 78 years of him - would be a transitional president. He would be there to lower the political temperature; try to heal a divided nation.\nTake the absurd politics out of the response to Covid. Improve vaccine roll-out. Drain the poison from the body politic. But that aside, not do too much.\nHe appointed a largely technocratic cabinet, presumably to perform managerial functions. Maybe make the trains run on time a bit better, but not change all the rolling stock, let alone alter the gauge of the railway. \nA fitting ambition for Amtrak Joe.\nBut maybe we've got that all wrong. Is it possible that far from being transitional, he's transformational?\nThe president will also pitch his $2.3tn American Jobs Plan, which the White House unveiled last month.\nBilled as an infrastructure package, it seeks to invest in public transit, rail, airports, water pipes, high-speed broadband, roads and bridges, veterans' hospitals, childcare centres and combating racial disparities.\nThe proposal also seeks to steer the US economy towards electric cars - which today make up barely 2% of vehicles of America's roads - and clean energy.\nIt would be paid for by raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and other taxes on multinational corporations, says the White House.\nDuring his speech, Mr Biden is also expected to address cultural flashpoints such as police reform, gun violence and the crisis at the US-Mexico border.\nLast month he signed the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans.\nSenator Scott has been a leading voice in his party on race and has talked about times he has been racially profiled by police.\nHe has hinted that his rebuttal speech will not just be about ripping into the president's agenda.\n\"We face serious challenges on multiple fronts, but I am as confident as I have ever been in the promise and potential of America.\n\"I look forward to having an honest conversation with the American people and sharing Republicans' optimistic vision for expanding opportunity and empowering working families.\"\nBut among his colleagues in Congress there has been widespread opposition to the Biden agenda.\nThe US president's party narrowly controls the House and Senate for the first time in a decade, enabling Democrats to pass that relief bill without a single congressional vote from Republicans. \nTop Republican Senator Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday: \"President Biden ran as a moderate, but I'm hard pressed to think of anything at all that he's done so far that would indicate some degree of moderation.\"\nIn addition to three packages totalling around $6tn, Mr Biden last week also unveiled plans for a $1.5tn federal budget that would significantly expand spending on domestic programmes."

      "text": "Michael Collins - one of the three crew members of the first manned mission to land on the Moon, Apollo 11 in 1969 - has died aged 90, his family say.\nHe died on Wednesday after \"a valiant battle with cancer. He spent his final days peacefully, with his family by his side,\" they said.\nCollins stayed in lunar orbit as his colleagues Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the Moon.\nAldrin, 91, is now the only surviving member of the mission.\nPaying tribute to Collins, Aldrin wrote in a tweet: \"Dear Mike, Wherever you have been or will be, you will always have the Fire to Carry us deftly to new heights and to the future. We will miss you. May you Rest In Peace.\"\nIn a statement, the Collins family said that \"Mike always faced the challenges of life with grace and humility, and faced this, his final challenge, the same way\".\n\"We will miss him terribly. Yet we also know how lucky Mike felt to have lived the life he did.\n\"We will honour his wish for us to celebrate, not mourn, that life.\"\nOn 16 July 2019, Collins visited Florida's Kennedy Space Center - the site where the mission had set off exactly 50 years earlier. \nSpeaking at launchpad 39A - where the crew's rocket began the historic mission - he described how he felt during take-off.\n\"The shockwave from the rocket power hits you,\" Collins told Nasa TV. \"Your whole body is shaking. This gives you an entirely... different concept of what power really means.\"\n\"You're suspended in the cockpit... as you lift off,\" he continued. \"From then on it's a quieter, more rational, silent ride all the way to the Moon.\n\"We crew felt the weight of the world on our shoulders, we knew that everyone would be looking at us, friend or foe.\"\nBy Paul Rincon, Science editor, BBC News website\nNeil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin garnered most of the attention for the historic first Moon landing in 1969. \nBut their crewmate, Michael Collins, was just as important for the success of the mission. \nAs the command module pilot, Collins stayed in lunar orbit while Neil and Buzz bounded across the surface. But he performed crucial manoeuvres in space that were needed to get to the Moon. \nHe was sanguine about others getting the glory: \"I certainly thought that I did not have the best seat of the three,\" he said. \"But I can say in all honesty, I was thrilled with the seat that I did have.\"\nAfter leaving Nasa, he had a brief spell in politics, but later retired to Florida, where he painted and wrote. \nDespite joining Twitter in 2019, at the age of 88, he admitted that he never really enjoyed the spotlight of public life. \nBut his name will live on, as a new generation of astronauts prepares to return to the Moon in the next few years, following the trail blazed by Collins and the other pioneers of Apollo.\nOn 16 July 1969, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were strapped into their Apollo spacecraft on top of the vast Saturn V rocket and were propelled into orbit in just over 11 minutes. \nFour days later, Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the lunar surface. Collins remained in the command module throughout the mission.\nArmstrong's words, beamed to the world by TV, entered history: \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\nAbout 400,000 people worked on the programme, at a cost at the time of $25bn.\nThe crew returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on 24 July.\nAn estimated 650 million people worldwide watched the Moon landing. For the US, the achievement helped it demonstrate its power to a world audience."

      "tags": "Domestic abuse,Stalking,House of Lords",
      "text": "The Domestic Abuse Bill is set to become law, after peers backed down in a dispute over how best to monitor stalkers and abusers.\nThe Lords has been pressing for legal changes to ensure offenders are automatically monitored under an existing police database.\nThe government has rejected this, arguing changing monitoring rules would be more effective.\nWith time to pass the bill running out, peers withdrew the demand on Tuesday.\nThe bill - which only applies to England and Wales - aims to strengthen rules surrounding controlling or coercive behaviour, target revenge porn and end the \"rough sex defence\" in court. \nIt also recognises children as victims of domestic abuse.\nThe House of Lords approved the bill just days before the parliamentary session is due to end on Thursday.\nPeers had wanted to create a new category of offender to ensure stalkers are managed under multiagency public protection arrangements (Mappa), between police and probation services. \nBut the amendment, which has previously been defeated twice by MPs, was again rejected by the government. \nHome Office Minister Baroness Williams of Trafford told peers that improving \"how Mappa operates on the ground\" was more important. \nInstead of supporting changes to legislation, she pledged to widen the binding guidance governing Mappa to ensure stalkers who pose a threat are covered. \nBut Labour's Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, who had originally tabled the amendment, said there was \"no proper direction\" on how the guidance should be used. \nShe also argued that spending cuts had led to a situation where authorities \"cannot use their professional judgment\" because \"the resources are so stretched\". \nShe added that the current system \"is not working\" and \"leads to thousands of women living in fear and hundreds murdered\". \nHer comments were echoed by Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Brinton, who said: \"We have said repeatedly the consequences of these fixated, obsessive, serial and high-risk perpetrators who escalate their behaviour far too often results in serious violence and murder.\n\"At the end of the day, lives depend on the government and everyone in the police and criminal justice system getting it right.\"\nPeers had previously defeated the government four times over changes to the bill including an effort to strengthen standards in child contact centres - neutral meeting places for children and parents who are involved in a difficult break up. \nHowever, they accepted a series of compromises from the government on this issue to ensure the bill passed.\nCrossbench peer Baroness Finlay of Llandaff said she was disappointed her amendment on child contact centres had not been accepted by the government but added she didn't want to \"jeopardise\" the bill.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe UK has ordered a further 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, to be used for booster jabs in the autumn, the health secretary has announced. It brings the total number of Pfizer vaccines ordered to 100 million. The expectation is the most vulnerable groups will be offered another jab before next winter. Speaking at a Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Matt Hancock also said that \"more and more people are getting protection and now seven in 10 adults have protective Covid antibodies\". It comes after a study showed a single dose of a coronavirus vaccine can reduce household transmission of the virus by up to half.\nThe UK has promised to offer further support and equipment to India to help tackle the growing Covid crisis there. The country has suffered another record day of deaths and infections, with more than 200,000 people now confirmed to have died with the virus - although the real total is thought to be much higher. Foreign Office Minister Nigel Adams told MPs 200 ventilators and 95 oxygen concentrators arrived in India yesterday as well as another shipment of 400 concentrators over the next two days. Meanwhile, British Indians have raised thousands of pounds to buy oxygen concentrators and medics are offering remote consultations and support to their colleagues abroad. \nSpain has said it hopes to open up to overseas travellers from June, as plans for an EU-wide digital certificate go before the European Parliament. Tourism minister Fernando Vald\u00e9s said a pilot test would take place in May so that Spain would be ready to receive travellers the following month. The EU has been working on a digital pass in time for the summer holidays. It would cover anyone who is either vaccinated against Covid-19, has a negative test or recently recovered. Overseas leisure travel will be allowed from the UK from 17 May at the earliest, under the government's plans for travel.\nCondom sales have jumped in countries including China where lockdowns are easing, consumer goods giant Reckitt says. It reported a \"double-digit\" increase in Durex sales in the first quarter of 2021, compared with one year ago. But demand for health products fell overall as fewer customers stocked up on cold and flu medicines. Reckitt's boss said sales for Lysol and Dettol were strong as hygiene habits improved.\nSmash hit musical Hamilton is planning to be back in London's West End this summer, more than a year after it closed because of the pandemic. Producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said the award-winning show about the founding fathers of the US would resume at the Victoria Palace Theatre from 19 August. Many shows are making plans to reopen from 17 May with social distancing, and from June 21 with no restrictions. The dates depend on the government's roadmap out of lockdown - which you can read more about here - remaining on track. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAs the Covid crisis grows in India, our global science correspondent Rebecca Morelle explains why it matters to the whole world. \nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scenes of people in India begging for oxygen during the nation's record Covid surge have shocked and moved the world. And no-one has been more moved than the global Indian diaspora. So how are those in the UK responding to the crisis?\nIn a Hindu temple in Wembley, north-west London, the small congregation is chanting a special prayer for people thousands of miles away.\nThe Hanuman Chalisa is a devotional hymn believed to have immense power for helping those in need. \nBut for many people in Britain's Indian communities, their minds are on very practical ways to help as well.\n\"There isn't a member of the diaspora who hasn't been touched by the events going on in India,\" says Manoj Badale, chairman of the British Asian Trust.\n\"I have plenty of family in India, my sister's a doctor, my niece and nephews are doctors. We're hearing terrible stories. It's really astonishing how the challenge has exponentially increased over the last week.\"\nThe trust, run by British Asians to support development projects, is focusing its efforts on \"the single most clear and present danger\" to people in India: lack of oxygen.\nThe Prince of Wales has endorsed the trust's emergency appeal, saying those suffering in India were in his thoughts and prayers.\nHe said Indian aid and ingenuity had been a support to other countries through the pandemic. \"As India has helped others, so now must we help India,\" he said.\nThe prince has made a personal donation to the trust's Oxygen for India campaign.\nThe appeal has already raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to buy oxygen concentrators - devices that can provide the enriched gas straight from the air, to treat patients when hospital supplies are under strain.\nThe trust is not alone: another independent Gofundme campaign run by British Indians blew past its initial goal of \u00a3160,000 - enough to buy 200 oxygen concentrators - in just one day. \nIts total now stands at more than \u00a3300,000.\nMr Badale says the British Asian Trust has helped during crises in South Asia for 14 years, but this one seems different.\n\"It just feels so real - not just to British Asians, but to British people generally. Some of our biggest donations have been from Brits who've been watching the news,\" he says.\nOthers in the UK's extensive Indian medical community have been finding other ways to help.\nOn evenings and weekends in between working as a consultant cardiologist in Bristol, Amardeep Dastidar is on the phone to India offering telemedicine - remote - consultations and supporting overwhelmed colleagues thousands of miles away as they battle with Covid's biggest wave yet.\n\"Any disease's second wave is always difficult, because the mental state is completely different compared with the first wave,\" he says.\n\"I was personally hit, my brother was infected, had to be hospitalised, was in ICU for seven days. It was a challenging time.\"\nHe has been offering support through relatives and friends in India, sharing expertise on treating Covid and translating it into local languages.\n\"Everyone is coming to the tipping point. I think everyone needs a bit of support,\" Dr Dastidar says.\nBapio, the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, is working to extend the informal support offered by people like Dr Dastidar with an official programme of telemedicine to help medics in India cope with the colossal workload - alongside fundraising for oxygen equipment.\nNaremdra Thakrar, chairman of the Shri Vallabh Nidhi Temple in Wembley, says the British Indian community feels the crisis in India very strongly.\n\"All their relatives are there, some of them want to travel there, they can't see their relatives and some of them can't even attend the funerals,\" he says.\nAnd so, as they fundraise and procure oxygen equipment, the congregation in Wembley prays.\n\"As a priest it's my duty to pray for the universe, to pray for the world. The whole world is our family and every place is our responsibility,\" says the temple's priest, Bhavik Pandya.\nThe oxygen shortage means \"people are very scared\", he says. \"We are praying, please protect our motherland.\"\nHas your family been affected by Covid-19 in India? Are you of the diaspora and trying to help with crisis relief efforts?

      "title": "Labour accuses Boris Johnson of lying over flat renovation costs",
      "tags": "Angela Rayner,Carrie Symonds,Dominic Cummings,Jonathan Ashworth,Boris Johnson,Simon Case",
      "text": "Labour has accused Boris Johnson of lying over who paid for renovations to his Downing Street flat.\nPressure is growing on the PM to reveal details after his ex-adviser, Dominic Cummings, claimed he planned for donors to \"secretly pay\" for the work.\nMr Johnson's spokesman has refused to say whether the PM received a loan to cover the costs. \nBut shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has demanded a \"full and frank\" explanation from Mr Johnson.\nWhile it is not against the rules to receive donations, politicians must declare them so the public can see who has given them money and whether it has had any influence on their decisions.\nOn Monday, amid reports Tory donors had loaned Mr Johnson the cash for the renovations, the prime minister told reporters \"any declaration to be made\" would be done in \"due course\". \nHis spokesman also said the refurbishment costs \"have been met by the prime minister personally\".\nBut there has yet to be a declaration from Downing Street showing exactly how the works were paid for.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, Labour MP Mr Ashworth said: \"We really need to know who's given the loan, who's given the money, because we need to know who the prime minister...is beholden to. \n\"To be honest he lied yesterday - that's not good enough.\"\nOn Tuesday, Mr Johnson's spokesman said the PM \"fully complies\" with all the rules, adding: \"Any costs of the wider refurbishment in No 10 have been met by the prime minister and he has acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law.\"\nBut the spokesman refused to say if a statement in March from Mr Johnson's former press secretary - who said \"Conservative Party funds are not being used to pay for any refurbishment of the Downing Street estate\" - was incorrect. \nLabour has now written to the Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case, asking for an investigation into whether the press secretary, Allegra Stratton, \"knowingly misled\" journalists as part of a larger inquiry it wants into the flat renovations. \nMeanwhile Sky News and the Guardian have reported that last July former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling was approached by government officials about sitting on a trust to handle the Downing Street refurbishment - but he reportedly rejected the offer fearing it risked giving donors influence. \nLord Darling is also reported to have argued that the state should be responsible for the maintenance of government buildings.\nMr Johnson is facing a series of claims and questions over his conduct.\nAmong them is an accusation the PM suggested he would rather see \"bodies pile high\" than approve a third lockdown, which sources familiar with the conversations have told the BBC he said.\nMr Johnson and No 10 strongly denied he said the phrase, as the PM described multiple reports as \"total rubbish\".\nThe comment was first reported in the Daily Mail - but later, the BBC and ITV separately reported sources confirming Mr Johnson did make the remarks.\nThe No 10 spokesman did not deny that Mr Johnson said he would rather let coronavirus \"rip\" than impose tighter restrictions. \nSeparately, the High Court has also decided to look into Mr Johnson's decision that Home Secretary Priti Patel did not break Whitehall rules over bullying.\nLeaders of six opposition parties in the Commons met Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle on Tuesday to express their \"deep concerns\" that the reputation of Parliament was being \"endangered by the routine and systematic lack of truthfulness in statements made by the prime minister\".\nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas, the SNP's Ian Blackford, Liberal Democrat Sir Ed Davey, Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville-Roberts MP, the SDLP's Colum Eastwood and the Alliance Party's Stephen Farry MP now plan to write to Parliament's Procedure Committee to follow up on the discussions.\nIn British politics, to accuse an opponent of lying is a big charge and one deployed relatively rarely in public. \nAnd so for Labour to do so is significant, as critics point to what they see as a pattern of behaviour from Boris Johnson, a consistent unwillingness to tell the truth - something No 10 disputes. \nThere are a wheelbarrow full of questions - some connected, some not - all of which coalesce around the prime minister's integrity. \nOn Monday, three major news organisations - the BBC, ITV News and the Daily Mail - did something unprecedented in recent times. \nDespite the PM's outright denial on camera, all three reported that sources familiar with the conversations had heard Mr Boris Johnson say, last autumn, that he would rather see \"bodies pile high\" than take England into a third lockdown. \nIt's impossible to tell if all this will change how anyone might vote in next week's elections. \nBut few would dispute the government would much rather the focus be on anything else than ongoing questions about its own probity.\nA statement from Downing Street after Tuesday's Cabinet meeting said ministers discussed a range of topics, from sending support to India through to updates from Northern Ireland. \nBut there was no mention in the statement of the ongoing questions facing Mr Johnson, which instead offered a warning on coronavirus that the UK was \"not out of the woods yet as variants of concern continue to pose a threat\".\nIt added: \"The PM said that while the road ahead looks positive, there will still be challenges and this government will continue to take tough decisions where necessary to protect both lives and livelihoods.\"\nThe PM and Ms Symonds carried out works on the flat above No 11 after moving in when Mr Johnson became prime minister in July 2019.\nA number of previous prime ministers have chosen to live in that flat rather than the one above No 10 as it is bigger.\nThe PM receives an annual public grant of \u00a330,000 to carry out renovations to the private residence each year - but reports from newspapers suggested the bill could be as high as \u00a3200,000.  \nThe government has insisted that Mr Johnson paid for the refurbishments out of his own pocket.\nBut his former adviser, Mr Cummings, wrote a blog last week, claiming the PM once planned to have donors \"secretly pay\" for the work on his flat. \nHe described the move as \"unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended\".\nLabour's Mr Ashworth told the BBC any loans or donations \"should have been declared by now\".\nHe added: \"He's [the PM] the most powerful politician in the land and if business people have funded the upgrade of his flat then we need to know because we need to know if those business people have an interest in government policy, whether they have an interest in procuring government contracts. \n\"There's a reason why we have rules around donations and loans to government ministers. Boris Johnson has to offer a full and frank explanation. He has to be transparent. \n\"If he has nothing to hide he's got nothing to fear - but, so far, his behaviour suggests something fishy is going on.\"\nBut Transport Secretary Grant Shapps defended the PM, saying the way the works on the flat was paid for has \"all been done absolutely correctly\" - although he would not answer questions on the reports of a loan.\nHe added: \"There will be a Cabinet Office report when they put out their annual accounts and everyone will be able to see exactly what happened.\"\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the opposition believed the furore was starting to be noticed by voters - and one cabinet minister told her \"there's nothing we can do to control it\".\nLabour has called for a full inquiry into the cost and financing of the renovations, with the party's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, saying the PM was \"just not coming clean with the public\".  \nShe added: \"We believe that he's potentially broken the rules. His previous senior adviser has accused him of being unethical and potentially unlawful. \n\"Why are you not telling people where this money has been coming from and who's paid for your luxury flat?\"\nOn Monday, the UK's top civil servant, Mr Case said the prime minister had asked him to review how a refurbishment of the No 11 flat was funded.\nMr Case also confirmed a probe was still ongoing into leaks pre-empting the official announcement of a second lockdown in England, but he admitted a culprit for the unauthorised disclosure may never be found.\nAnd he said steps were being taken to tighten the rules around civil servants having second jobs in the wake of a row over the now-collapsed Greensill Capital, which employed ex-PM David Cameron.\nBut when it came to the flat, senior Conservative backbencher Sir Charles Walker told BBC Two's Newsnight he \"doesn't really care\" about the flat funding issue \"as long as my constituents didn't pay for it\".\nHowever, former Conservative leader William Hague issued a warning not to \"dismiss the latest allegations of sleaze as a fleeting problem\", writing an opinion piece for the Times saying a trail of digital evidence \"is one of several reasons the government should worry about the latest accusations of impropriety\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The most common side effects of the Covid-19 vaccines are pain or tenderness at the injection site - in other words, a sore arm - a UK study has suggested. \nRoughly one in four people had wider effects like fever, headache, nausea and fatigue.\nBut these only lasted on average for one day.\nResearchers involved in the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app saw fewer reactions than were seen in clinical trials. \nConfidence in the vaccines has continued to grow since the end of last year, with more than 80% saying they believe the vaccines are safe and effective, compared with about 70% who said the same towards the end of 2020, according to a survey of 5,000 people.\nThe survey, run in association with the National Institute for Health Research, found twice as many people say they want to have the vaccine as soon as possible - although the number of people saying they would actively prefer the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has fallen.\nThe ZOE study researchers looked at self-reported symptoms in 627,383 people using their app in the eight days after being vaccinated. \nAbout 70% of people having the Pfizer jab had some reaction around where the needle went in, including pain, tenderness, redness or swelling, compared with just under 60% for the AstraZeneca jab. \nThe trend was reversed for those reactions that affect the whole body rather than just the site of the injection.\nFor the AstraZeneca jab, 34% had some \"systemic\" (whole body) reaction like headache, tiredness or chills. For the Pfizer vaccine this was only 14% after the first dose and 22% after the second. \nThe most common of these side effects was a headache. \nThe study's lead scientist, Prof Tim Spector of King's College London, said these findings should reassure people the after effects of the vaccine are \"usually mild and short-lived\".\nBut he pointed out there was a wide range of responses to the vaccine, just as there was to the virus, depending on age and sex among other things. \nThe study did not look at what happened after a second dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab since hardly anyone had received it at the time of the study, which went up to 10 March. \nAmong all vaccinated users of the ZOE symptom app, one in four (25%) had one of these whole body reactions and two-thirds (66%) had a local reaction.\nWomen, people under 55 and those who had a Covid infection in the past were all more likely to experience side effects.\nIn the final stage of the Pfizer vaccine's clinical trials, roughly 77% of people had pain at the injection site compared with just under 30% in this study, while the proportion of people experiencing fatigue and headache was three to five times smaller. \nFor AstraZeneca, roughly half as many people had a whole body reaction like fever or fatigue as was recorded in clinical trials.\nThis may be because people in the clinical trials were younger and healthier, or because people enrolled in the trial of an experimental vaccine might be more nervous and so more likely to identify symptoms, Prof Spector suggested. \nDr Cristina Menni from King's College London, lead author of the paper, said the results supported the safety of both vaccines and should \"help allay safety concerns of people willing to get vaccinated\"."

The mission couldn't be more critical or important.\"\nThe event will be recorded on Sunday at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, and broadcast on 8 May. \nVax Live is calling on governments to commit to vaccine equity by donating doses and resources.\nThe campaign is also pushing businesses to \"donate dollars for doses\", and for pharmaceutical companies to make vaccines available at not-for-profit prices.\nIn their role as campaign chairs, Harry and Meghan have been encouraging the private sector to make donations to the Covax scheme, which is co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor.\nMore than one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have now been administered worldwide. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, with some countries having delivered doses to a large proportion of their population and others still waiting for their first shipments to arrive.\nThe concert will feature performances from artists including Jennifer Lopez, Foo Fighters and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder.\nMr Biden, his wife Jill and Vice-President Kamala Harris will promote the \"We Can Do This\" initiative, which seeks to increase confidence in Covid-19 vaccines\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic will also make appearances.\nLast year, Global Citizen partnered with the WHO to put on a virtual concert to celebrate healthcare workers.

Russia, New Zealand and France have pledged to send emergency medical equipment, and even regional rivals Pakistan and China have put aside their differences and promised to help.\nOn Thursday, the US said it would start delivering supplies worth more than $100m, in addition to individual US states and private companies also readying oxygen, equipment, and supplies for Indian hospital. \nHowever, experts say the aid will only have a limited effect in a nation that has a population of 1.3 billion.\nA government website where Indians can register for a vaccination programme crashed soon after it launched on Wednesday, as tens of thousands of people tried to access it.\nAnd in the state of Assam, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake damaged hospitals which were already under intense strain. People ran from their homes and other buildings in panic.\nThe numbers we are seeing are staggeringly high - but the real number of fatalities are thought to be much higher.\nMortality data in India is poor and deaths at home often go unregistered, especially in rural areas. There are reports of journalists counting bodies at morgues themselves, to try to get a more accurate number. \nIn Uttar Pradesh, health officials said 68 people had died on one day earlier this month across the state. But a Hindi newspaper pointed out that officials also said there were 98 Covid funerals in the capital, Lucknow, alone.\nCrematoriums continue to work throughout the night to keep up with the number of bodies arriving, and many families are facing long waits before their loved ones can receive funeral rites. Some say they were asked to help speed up the process by piling the wood themselves.\nIn the southern city of Bengaluru, one doctor told the BBC people were panicking. It is one of the worst-hit cities in India, with some estimates saying there are about 300 active Covid cases per square kilometre.\n\"We were not prepared for this second surge,\" the consultant said. \n\"For the first surge it was well organised. This time there are more cases, it was more sudden, and the situation was not prepared for.\"\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reported in its weekly epidemiological update that there were nearly 5.7 million new cases reported globally last week - and India accounts for 38% of them.\nIt also said that the B.1.617 variant of the virus detected in India has a higher growth rate than other variants in the country, suggesting increased transmissibility.\nIndia is carrying out the world's biggest vaccination drive, but less than 10% of the population has so far received an initial jab and there are concerns about meeting demand.\nThe US is helping India with the raw materials it needs for vaccine production, after India's biggest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute of India, complained of shortages of specialised imports from the US.\nMeanwhile, the first batch of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, is set to arrive in India on 1 May, The New Indian Express reports. It has not yet been revealed how many doses will be delivered.\nIndia is heading towards state elections, and there is increasing anger towards both state authorities and the central government for the handling of the pandemic. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of ignoring scientific warnings to participate in election rallies and allowing a massive Hindu festival to go ahead in northern India.\nDr Navjot Dahiya, the vice-president of the Indian Medical Association, called Mr Modi a \"super spreader\" who had \"tossed all Covid norms in the air\".\nThe prime minister said he had held three meetings on Tuesday to discuss ways to increase oxygen capacities and medical infrastructure, including the use of trains and military aircraft to speed up transport of oxygen supplies.\nThe BBC's Yogita Limaye says many people are asking why the military and disaster response teams have not been put on a war footing to build field hospitals.\n\"There is a sense of abandonment in the country, of people being left to fend for themselves,\" our correspondent reports.\nState and union territory governments, from Delhi to Karnataka, have been criticised for allowing Covid protocols to lapse and failing to prepare for what epidemiologists say was an inevitable surge in infections."

      "tags": "DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "Rumours about bids to remove Arlene Foster from the helm of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had been swirling for months.\nOn many occasions they'd been easily shrugged off by the first minister. \nBut she could shrug no longer, given many of those previously loyal to her abandoned the Foster ship.\nHowever questions remain about the move's timing and what has caused it.\nFirstly, pressure to remove her has come from the outworkings of Brexit and the Irish Sea border.\nArlene Foster led the party's campaign in favour of Brexit, but struggled once its ramifications for the union came into view.\nFeeling betrayed by Boris Johnson when he signed up to the Brexit deal that would mean different trading arrangements for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, Mrs Foster faced accusations of poor judgement for trusting the prime minister.\nShe hardened her stance earlier this year after concerns about the protocol's effects on GB-NI trade became clear, and demanded it be scrapped.\nThe party even published a five-point plan it aimed to use in a bid to replace the protocol and said it would no longer engage with north-south bodies on Brexit.\nBut that was not enough to quash internal unhappiness at how the issue was being managed, with some elected representatives concerned it would affect the party's chances in the next assembly election in May 2022.\nIt may also be that some assembly members who were worried about the prospect of retaining their seats have drawn the conclusion that their own political positions trump loyalty to the leadership at this crucial time, just as election strategies are being devised.\nRecent scenes of rioting and violence in loyalist communities against the protocol and criticism of unionist politicians have added to the narrative that the current DUP leadership is not reflecting or understanding the views of those it is supposed to represent.\nIt may be a key issue in all of this, but it's not the only factor.\nParty sources have given strong hints about growing concern that Mrs Foster held a softer stance on some social issues than her predecessors and was willing to move the party in that direction.\nThe DUP's roots are deeply conservative, staunchly opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. \nWestminster legislated to change NI's laws on those issues in 2019 when devolution was suspended - the DUP opposed it at the time, but it did not go down well with many grassroots party members.\nThen last week, a debate on a motion in the Stormont assembly calling for a ban on gay conversion therapy further raised eyebrows when Mrs Foster was one of five DUP assembly members who abstained on it.\nThe majority of the party had voted against the motion, arguing that any legislation to outlaw the practice needed to ensure safeguards for churches.\nAlthough it was a free vote, it openly exposed the gulf between Mrs Foster and most of her assembly team at a time when she was already under pressure. For some party members, it was the final straw.\nThere are also those within the DUP who point to Mrs Foster's difficulties in retaining authority, claiming that she was too weak to discipline some of her MPs and assembly members for breaching Covid-19 guidelines or making comments at odds with party policy.\nTo further understand the timing of the leadership challenge, it's important to know how DUP internal rules work.\nRule 12 states that a leadership election should take place before 30 April every year - normally it is an informal procedure to simply reappoint the office holder as opposed to an actual contest.\nHowever it's understood that this has not happened yet this year, and it's believed those behind the motion challenging Mrs Foster had called on the DUP chairman to invoke the rule and call an election for leader within seven days.\nA fight for the heart and soul of the DUP is on which may chart the party's course for some time to come."

      "text": "The European Parliament has ratified the post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal - a key move to ensure that tariff- and quota-free trade continues.\nThe Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) has been operating provisionally since January. MEPs voted in favour by 660 votes to 5, while 32 abstained.\nThe UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, said the vote \"brings certainty and allows us to focus on the future\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson spoke of a \"final step in a long journey\".\nThe trade deal provided \"stability to our new relationship with the EU as vital trading partners, close allies and sovereign equals\", he said.\nThe result, announced on Wednesday after a vote late on Tuesday, was also welcomed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\nEarlier Ms von der Leyen said the TCA \"comes with real teeth, with a binding dispute settlement mechanism\". And she warned that the EU would use those teeth if necessary.\nThe parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt described the deal as \"a failure for both sides, but better than nothing\". \nLord Frost's opposite number in the Brexit talks, Michel Barnier, was also less than flattering. \"This is a divorce. It is a warning, Brexit. It's a failure of the European Union and we have to learn lessons from it,\" he told MEPs.\nBrexit tensions remain, including a French threat of \"reprisals\" against the UK over new fishing restrictions. Northern Ireland trade is also a thorny issue.\nUnder a separate protocol, Northern Ireland remains de facto part of the EU's single market, so goods arriving there from Britain have to undergo EU checks. Since Brexit there has been some disruption to that trade.\nThe TCA covers EU-UK trade in goods, but not services. The UK economy is dominated by services - sectors such as banking, insurance, advertising and legal advice.\nThe TCA has still resulted in more paperwork, extra costs and less trade between the two sides, since the UK left the EU.\nA European Parliament resolution described the UK's exit from the EU as \"a historic mistake\".\nAmong the areas not covered by the deal are foreign policy, financial services and student exchanges. \nBefore the MEPs' debate started on Tuesday, French Europe Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune accused the UK of blocking fishing rights. He said the EU could respond with \"reprisals\" in financial services.\n\"The United Kingdom is expecting quite a few authorisations from us for financial services. We won't give any for as long as we don't have guarantees on fishing and other issues,\" he said on French news channel BFMTV.\nFrench fishermen have complained of being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences.\nMeanwhile, British seafood exporters have been hit by an EU ban on UK exports of live shellfish. Scottish firms account for most of that business, and some now face collapse.\nThe UK made fishing rights a key issue in the negotiations, with control over access to its waters seen as a sign of British sovereignty.\nPraising the TCA when it was agreed in December, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said \"we have taken back control of our laws and our destiny\". \nHe described it as \"a deal which will if anything allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends\".\nIn Tuesday's debate, German MEP David McAllister said Brexit \"will always be a lose-lose situation\", but he backed the TCA.\nIt is a 1,400-page deal which was not clinched until 24 December. The Brexit negotiations began in 2017 and the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Common rules remained during the UK's transition period until January 2021.\nAfter nearly four years of difficult negotiations on the UK exit from the EU and the post-Brexit relationship, it's hardly surprising that a few bruises are showing. \nThe TCA certainly hasn't solved everything. There are still big questions to resolve on issues like financial services, for example. \nMonitoring and implementing what has been agreed, in a complex network of committees, will also be a constant feature of the new relationship. \nBut it will take some time before the long-term effect on trade becomes clear. \nTrade volumes fell sharply in January before rebounding in February. But the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex says UK exports to the EU were still down by 17.2% in February compared to an average of February 2018 to 2020. \nA significant part is down to Brexit, although Covid is also a factor. \nThe most prominent post-Brexit issue so far this year, though, isn't part of the TCA itself.  Northern Ireland's trading relationship with the rest of the UK, and with the EU, won't change as a result of this agreement being ratified. \nBoth sides say they are working hard to find practical solutions in Northern Ireland, but some checks on trade between NI and Britain will remain in place. \nThe European Commission has launched legal action, accusing the UK of breaching the agreement on Northern Ireland trade and breaking international law - charges Downing Street denies. \nBrexit also means:"

      "title": "Biden 100 days: What we all got wrong about him",
      "tags": "US politics,Joe Biden",
      "text": "For the White House press corps who've binged out for four years on the son et lumi\u00e8re of the Trump-show, the last three months have been a challenge. \nAs I remarked, perhaps unwisely, to an audience the other night, the transition from Trump to Joe Biden has been like going from a daily crack pipe to a small bottle of low-alcohol beer once a week.\nThe daily White House briefings now are a snoozefest. There are no fights, no name-calling. \nNo middle-of-the-night Twitter storms, no payments to porn stars, no rollicking MAGA rallies.\nSo does all this mean it's been a boring presidency? Absolutely not. This is a far more interesting presidency - so far - than I think any of us had imagined. I would go as far as to say it's fascinating. \nThe sad thing, from a purely selfish point of view, is that what it isn't is a made-for-TV spectacular, which is what I have feasted on these past four years. \nDonald Trump always had an eye for the visual and outrageous. He knew how to make himself the centre of attention; Biden seems to relish the lack of histrionics, and seems to think it is important for people to focus on what he delivers, rather than what he says. Most strange.\nWe reported that Joe Biden - all 78 years of him - would be a transitional president. He would be there to lower the political temperature; try to heal a divided nation. \nTake the absurd politics out of the response to Covid. Improve vaccine roll-out. Drain the poison from the body politic. But that aside, not do too much. \nHe appointed a largely technocratic cabinet, presumably to perform managerial functions. Maybe make the trains run on time a bit better, but not change all the rolling stock, let alone alter the gauge of the railway. A fitting ambition for Amtrak Joe.\nBut maybe we've got that all wrong. Is it possible that far from being transitional, he's transformational?\nAnd that word is not freighted with a positive or negative connotation - it is merely a statement based on the ambition of what we've seen so far. Voters will soon decide whether it's for better or worse.\nLet's start with the $1.9 trillion (\u00a31.35tn) stimulus package. \nThe headline from the passing of this humungous piece of legislation was that nearly all adult Americans would receive a cheque for $1,400 to help them cope with the hardships brought about by the pandemic. It was cash in hand to a lot of Americans, and won massive approval - from Democratic and Republican voters alike - although not a single Republican lawmaker would back the proposal.\nBut look beyond the headline and lift the lid on this policy a little further. There is a lot to see. Perhaps most significant is the extension of child tax credits. Poorer families could soon be receiving up to $3,000 per child per annum. It is estimated this one measure will lift literally millions of youngsters out of poverty. As things stand, this measure is for 2021 only - but it is clear within the White House that Joe Biden wants to make this permanent. \nIt is a major piece of social policy. It is big potatoes. \nWith the passing of the stimulus package - or the American Rescue Package, as it is more properly called - Biden wanted to correct something he felt that Barack Obama had got wrong when he came to power and inherited the mess of the financial crisis in 2009. Yes, Obama passed a variety of measures - but with hindsight they were seen as too cautious; not ambitious enough.\nOne insight that Biden has borrowed from his time as vice-president to America's first African-American president, is do not let a good crisis go to waste. The urgency of the pandemic has given Biden the excuse he needed to push for a massive plan. And he got it through.\nNow look at what he's planning on rebuilding America's infrastructure. Again, the price tag will be in the trillions. Again, the ambition will be immense - not just the staid repairing of bridges and roads (important and vital though that is); it is about making digital access more equitable - but it goes wider than that. Way wider.\n\"It is not a plan that tinkers around the edges,\" the president told an audience outside Pittsburgh. \"It is a once-in-a-generation investment in America.\"\nFor Republicans it's typical government overreach and smacks more of social engineering than the civic kind usually associated with highway repairs.\nThe wish-list of what Biden hopes to achieve from this infrastructure plan goes on and on. It aspires to create millions of jobs in the short term and strengthen American competitiveness in the long. It hopes to lead to greater racial equality. The focus on new, cleaner energy sources promises to help the nation fight climate change.\nOn the subject of which, look too at the ambitious goals he's set for climate change with the virtual summit he held last week in Washington. These are not the actions of a steady-as-you-go president. A 52% cut in emissions by the end of the decade is BIG. \nWho knows whether he'll achieve it - it's going to require Americans to change the way they drive; the way they heat and cool their homes. The way industry functions. But if the ambition is to show American ambition, it is, umm, ambitious.\nNow obviously there is an element of motherhood and apple pie in this shopping list. And the measure needs to pass through Congress, and that hasn't happened. \nAnd whilst I am in the business of saying \"and\", let me add this\u2026. and there is something slightly ridiculous on the focus of the first 100 days. \nThe first 100 days is a statement of intent, a down payment on what you might do with the rest of your term. But frankly, who cares if you have a sparkling first 100 days if the subsequent 1,360 stink and sink?\nAll that said, the statement of intent is big, and this is what makes boring old Joe Biden so interesting. \nThis is a blog column and not a book, but arguably the dominant idea in American politics for the past 40 years has been the low-taxing, economy-deregulating, budget-balancing, competition-encouraging, union-limiting small government of Ronald Reagan. \nThe same is true of the influence of Thatcherism in the UK - yes, there have been 13 years of Labour government since Maggie's demise, just as here there have been the Clinton and Obama terms since Reagan. But arguably they operated within, and were defined by, the orthodoxy of the monetarist economists who've held such intellectual sway on both sides of the Atlantic: Milton Friedman, the Chicago school, Laffer curves, Sir Alan Walters. \nIf Obama's rescue package didn't go far enough (as Biden believes), surely that was because he was looking at the disruptive and growing power of the conservative Tea Party movement. Both Clinton and Blair saw their paths to victory through the elusive \"third way\": free-market economic liberalism with a big dollop of concern for the least well off.\nAfter the morale-sapping defeats of the 1980s-  both for Labour in the UK and Democrats in the US - the head-scratching was intense on what they needed to do to win. Both Bill Clinton and Tony Blair came to believe firmly that tax-raising and big government pledges would not reverse that trend.\nBut Biden - for better or worse - looks like he is using the pandemic and the woeful state of America's infrastructure to unapologetically say to the American people \"yep, big government is back\". It is territory that Republican opponents - still trying to sort out their post-Trumpian identity - will be keen to fight on.\nJoe Biden's former pollster is even more bullish, arguing the president should be more direct about the need to raise taxes on the wealthiest to pay for this ambition.\nMake no mistake: this is a big break and a mighty gamble. So far, his approval ratings on the ground where he has chosen to fight - handling of coronavirus, the economic stimulus, his plans for infrastructure - have been really positive. \nLess so over the chaos at the southern border; something the president now acknowledges is a crisis. And the perennial issue of gun control is going to lead to a lot of huffing and puffing, but it's hard to see what he will be able to achieve through legislation, given the fine balance of the Senate.\nJoe Biden has been a stickler for sticking to social distancing and mask wearing, marking a big distinction with the freewheeling, coronavirus super-spreading White House of his predecessor. Meetings with the president are kept socially distanced; protocols strictly adhered to. \nBut this time last month an interesting meeting took place in the East Room.\nPresidential historian Jon Meacham brought in a number of his eminent colleagues for a sitdown that Joe Biden was anxious to host. At this stage, only around 60 days into his presidency, Biden was already thinking about his legacy and what he needed to do; what was the limit of presidential power; what lessons could he learn from his predecessors. \nAt one point he turns to - perhaps - the most revered of these presidential scholars, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and says \"I'm no FDR, but\u2026 \"\nPerhaps Joe Biden is eyeing this as his moment to deliver a New Deal \u00e0 la Franklin Delano Roosevelt following the Great Depression, or the war on poverty and fight against racial inequality that was championed in the 1960s by Lyndon B Johnson.\nThe taunt of Donald Trump during the campaign was that Biden may have been in politics for over four decades, but what did he have to show for it. \nIt looks like in power he is trying to give a mighty clear answer to that question - even if it doesn't make for great theatre."

From 17 May, overseas leisure travel could resume for people in England under Prime Minister Boris Johnson's roadmap for easing restrictions.\nThe UK government is also expected to set out which countries fall into the \"green\", \"amber\" and \"red\" categories under a new risk-based traffic light system. These will determine testing and quarantine requirements for travellers when they return from various countries.\nIn a debate ahead of Wednesday's EU Parliament vote on the new scheme, EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders warned of the possibility of \"fragmentation across Europe\" if an agreement could not be reached.\n\"We would risk having a variety of documents that cannot be read and verified in other member states. And we risk the spread of forged documents, and with it, the spread of both the virus and the mistrust of citizens,\" he said.\nDutch MEP Jeroen Lenaers stressed that the proposed system would ensure \"full equality and avoids discrimination between those who have been vaccinated and those who have not\" by allowing travel to people who had tested negative or had recovered from the virus.\nHowever, questions remain about how long immunity lasts after an infection and whether further jabs are needed amid the rapid spread of more contagious Covid variants.\nOther issues include what data would be used to prove an individual was not infected with coronavirus and privacy concerns.\nKey to the EU's digital certificate is a QR code - a machine-readable graphic code made up of black and white squares - that contains personal data and the EU's Commission says it will be safe and secure. It is working with the World Health Organization to ensure the certificate is recognised beyond Europe.\nThe 27 member states also want to include non-EU countries such as Norway, Iceland and Switzerland, with officials saying earlier this week that vaccinated travellers from the US may also be able to visit Europe this summer.\nHowever, the European Commission has said that there have been \"no contacts\" with the UK over the issue. \nThe UK government is working on a digital system for international travel that would prove travellers' vaccination status. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC he would discuss the issue next week with G7 industrialised countries, including the US and Canada.\nMore details were expected to be released in the next few weeks, he added.\nA number of countries have already begun unveiling their own passport systems.\nIn Denmark, the Coronapas app is being used to allow customers who have been vaccinated or recovered from an infection to enter bars, restaurants and museums.\nA similar scheme in Israel, which has one of the highest levels of vaccinations in the world, permits users to access hotels, gyms and theatres. The \"Green pass\" has also created travel opportunities for Israeli citizens, following deals with Greece and Cyprus."

These will determine testing and quarantine requirements for travellers when they return from various countries.\nIn a debate ahead of Wednesday's EU Parliament vote on the new scheme, EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders warned of the possibility of \"fragmentation across Europe\" if an agreement could not be reached.\n\"We would risk having a variety of documents that cannot be read and verified in other member states. And we risk the spread of forged documents, and with it, the spread of both the virus and the mistrust of citizens,\" he said.\nDutch MEP Jeroen Lenaers stressed that the proposed system would ensure \"full equality and avoids discrimination between those who have been vaccinated and those who have not\" by allowing travel to people who had tested negative or had recovered from the virus.\nHowever, questions remain about how long immunity lasts after an infection and whether further jabs are needed amid the rapid spread of more contagious Covid variants.\nOther issues include what data would be used to prove an individual was not infected with coronavirus and privacy concerns.\nKey to the EU's digital certificate is a QR code - a machine-readable graphic code made up of black and white squares - that contains personal data and the EU's Commission says it will be safe and secure. It is working with the World Health Organization to ensure the certificate is recognised beyond Europe.\nThe 27 member states also want to include non-EU countries such as Norway, Iceland and Switzerland, with officials saying earlier this week that vaccinated travellers from the US may also be able to visit Europe this summer.\nHowever, the European Commission has said that there have been \"no contacts\" with the UK over the issue. \nThe UK government is working on a digital system for international travel that would prove travellers' vaccination status. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC he would discuss the issue next week with G7 industrialised countries, including the US and Canada.\nMore details were expected to be released in the next few weeks, he added.\nA number of countries have already begun unveiling their own passport systems.\nIn Denmark, the Coronapas app is being used to allow customers who have been vaccinated or recovered from an infection to enter bars, restaurants and museums.\nA similar scheme in Israel, which has one of the highest levels of vaccinations in the world, permits users to access hotels, gyms and theatres. The \"Green pass\" has also created travel opportunities for Israeli citizens, following deals with Greece and Cyprus."

      "text": "Condom sales have jumped in countries including China where lockdowns are easing, says consumer goods giant Reckitt.\nIt reported a \"double-digit\" increase in Durex sales in the first quarter of 2021, compared with one year ago. \nBut demand for health products fell overall as fewer customers stocked up on cold and flu medicines.\nReckitt's boss pointed out that sales for Lysol and Dettol were strong as hygiene habits improved.\nAt the start of the pandemic last year, the firm said people were having less sex because of the coronavirus crisis, partly due to a \"manifestation of anxiety\". \nConversely, the company said sales of Durex jumped when social-distancing rules were relaxed in the summer.\nIn its nutrition division, which includes baby formula brand Enfa, sales in the first quarter fell 12.3%, but with hygiene sales up 21.1%, the overall sales tally for the first three months of the year stood at \u00a33.5bn - down 1.1%.\nChief executive Laxman Narasimhan said: \"Demand for Lysol and Dettol continues to be strong as consumers remain vigilant to the spread of the virus and see use of our products, and improved hygiene habits, as a way of protecting their health and regaining normality in their lives.\"\nHe said that the firm would continue to track changes in consumer behaviour and demand for different products at different stages of the pandemic.\nThe company reported a 16.4% decline in sales for health products like cold and flu relief products such as Nurofen or Strepsils. It estimated that cases of flu were down by as much as 90%, while consumers had already stocked up last year.\nMr Narasimhan added that in countries with few coronavirus cases and high vaccination rates, people have eased off on washing their hands or using hand sanitizers, although use was still higher than before the pandemic.\nFor example, sales of Dettol showed strong growth in India, which is currently dealing with soaring cases of Covid, but declined in China.\n\"Sexual wellness\" products saw a big uptick in sales in countries like China too, as well as parts of the United States and Europe.\nBosses said they expect this to grow in other countries as lockdowns and social distancing measures lead to the opportunity for more people to use their products.\nThe results are an illustration of changes in spending habits as lockdown rules loosen. \nOn Tuesday market research firm Kantar said that UK shoppers are making more trips to supermarkets and buying less online as lockdown lifts and the vaccine rollout continues.\nIts latest figures show that online supermarket sales growth has halved since the height of the pandemic, to 46%. Meanwhile, the number of trips to grocery stores rose by 4% month-on-month in the four weeks to 18 April.\nKantar said older shoppers accounted for much of the rise in footfall, with much of the over-65 community now vaccinated. \nMore than 33 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine - part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched.\nOverall supermarket sales rose by 5.7% to \u00a331.6 billion in the 12 weeks to 18 April, marking a slowdown in the rate of growth seen a year ago when shoppers panic-bought at the start of the crisis.\nFraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \"While the market may fluctuate between growth and decline in the months ahead, depending on the year-on-year comparison being made, the fact that trip numbers are up and basket sizes down suggests that habits are slowly returning to normal.\""

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "The Electoral Commission has announced it will investigate the funding of Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat renovation, saying there are \"reasonable grounds to suspect an offence\".\nMr Johnson says he covered the cost of the refurbishment himself and has \"conformed in full with the code of conduct\".\nConflict of interest\nPrime ministers are allowed to spend \u00a330,000 a year of public money to renovate their accommodation. The final bill for the latest refit is not known but there has been speculation that it could be as much as \u00a3200,000.\nThe government has refused to say whether Mr Johnson received a loan from the Conservative Party to pay for the renovations that were above the annual allowance.\nIf this was the case, Mr Johnson would need to demonstrate that the arrangement was consistent with the ministerial code - a government document that sets out the \"expected standards\" of behaviour in office.\nThe code makes clear there should be \"no actual or perceived conflicts of interest\".\nHannah White, from the Institute for Government think tank, says there could be \"a problem of perception\".\n\"There's no legal problem with the PM having taken a loan from a political party... it's more about whether there's a sense the prime minister might have a conflict if he wanted to reorganise the Conservative Party or sack the treasurer or something like that. \n\"He then has a financial obligation with the Conservative Party.\" \nDeclarations\nThere are numerous registers where political donations need to be declared, depending on who is sending and receiving the funds. Each one has its own rules about what needs to be declared and when.\nDonations and loans to political parties of more than \u00a37,500 must be reported to the Electoral Commission - the organisation which regulates political donations in the UK. This register is updated every three months. \nOn 28 April, the Electoral Commission announced it would carry out an investigation about whether any funding should have been declared. In a statement, the commission said: \"We are now satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred\".\nA second register, tied to the ministerial code, requires ministers to declare any financial benefits received. The government is supposed to publish a list of ministers' financial interests twice a year. However, the last one was released in July 2020.\nThe list is overseen by an independent adviser. However, the post was left vacant after Sir Alex Allan - the previous adviser on standards - resigned in November in a row over a bullying inquiry involving Home Secretary Priti Patel.\nOn 28 April the government announced Lord Geidt as the new independent adviser. Shortly after the appointment Mr Johnson said he would seek advice from Lord Geidt on whether any further declarations were required. \nSeparately, all MPs must declare - within 28 days - any donations which could influence their actions. This is known as the Register of Members' Financial Interests and is updated frequently.\nAlex Thomas - a former principal private secretary to then cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood - believes the prime minister would be required to make a disclosure: \n\"If you owe someone money in this context, I would say it should be declared on that register.\"\nIt depends exactly what the offensive is and which register it relates to.\nIf a party breaks the rules about making declarations to the Electoral Commission a range of sanctions are available - including fines of up to \u00a320,000. Very serious offensives can also be referred to the police.\nIf there is a breach of the ministerial code, it would normally be the prime minister who decides the sanction - such as sacking the minister responsible. \nHowever, given that Mr Johnson is at the centre of the row on this occasion and wrote the foreword to the code, that exposes an obvious gap that's not easily resolvable. \nThe register of members' financial interests, on the other hand, is regulated by Parliament's Committee on Standards.\nThe committee, which is chaired by an MP, can carry out investigations for possible rule breaches and impose sanctions. \nThis includes forcing an MP to apologise or a suspension from Parliament. \nMr Johnson has previously been in hot water with the standards committee. \nIn 2018 - before he became prime minister - Mr Johnson made a \"full and unreserved\" apology to MPs for failing to declare more than \u00a352,000 in income.\nAt the time, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone ruled that the breaches were \"neither inadvertent nor minor\". The report noted that there had been nine payments registered by Mr Johnson after the required 28-day deadline."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Electoral Commission ",
      "text": "The Electoral Commission has launched an investigation into funding of works on Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat. \nThe spending watchdog said there were \"reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred\".\nThe PM is under growing pressure to declare how refurbishments were paid for after his ex-adviser said there was a plan for donors to \"secretly pay\".\nMr Johnson told MPs he had covered the revamp \"personally\", but would not say who had paid the initial bill.\nAnd, speaking at the government's Covid press conference, Health Secretary Matt Hancock repeatedly refused to comment on the funding of the refurbishment, urging the media to \"concentrate on the big things that really matter\".\nThe prime minister receives an annual public grant of \u00a330,000 to carry out renovations to his Downing Street flat each year - but newspaper reports suggest the bill for the latest renovations could be as high as \u00a3200,000.\nIn its investigation, the commission - the independent watchdog regulating UK political finance - will assess the Conservative Party's compliance with laws on political donations.\nIt will examine whether any spending on the flat falls within its remit, and if it was published as required. \nThe commission can impose fines if breaches are found, or pass on allegations to the police if it sees fit. \nDuring fraught exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pushed Mr Johnson to explain who had paid the initial invoice for renovations - asking whether it was the taxpayer, the Conservative Party, a private donor or Mr Johnson himself.\nHe accused the government of being \"mired in sleaze, cronyism and scandal\".\nBut Mr Johnson replied: \"The answer is I have covered the costs... I conformed in full with the code of conduct and officials have kept advising me through this whole thing.\"\nThe Treasury has revealed that Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Mr Johnson's neighbour in Downing Street, also redecorated his flat last year, saying the costs were paid \"upfront and entirely at his own expense\".\n\"Baffling\" - that is one cabinet source's verdict on how No 10 is handling the allegations about the renovations of the Downing Street flat. \nMatt Hancock repeatedly wouldn't engage in questions on the matter at Wednesday's press conference.  \nAnd Boris Johnson wouldn't answer the central question in the Commons earlier during a session of Prime Minister's Questions, where he looked more red-faced and furious than I can recall. \nThe question is a simple one. Who paid the bill for the Downing Street flat makeover at the start? \nAnd for as long as the PM won't answer that, the question will be asked again, and again, and again.\nRead more from Laura Kuenssberg here.\nNo 10 has also confirmed the appointment of a new independent adviser on ministers' interests. \nCrossbench peer Lord Geidt will take up the role, unfilled for five months since the resignation of Sir Alex Allan in November 2020. \nSir Alex quit after Mr Johnson rejected his finding that Home Secretary Priti Patel had broken the ministerial code over bullying allegations.\nDowning Street also confirmed Lord Geidt would carry out his own inquiry into the funding of the renovations and \"advise the prime minister on any further registration of interests that may be needed\".\nHowever, the prime minister's spokesman later said Mr Johnson \"remains the ultimate arbiter\" of the ministerial code - setting out rules of conduct - and would decide whether to accept or reject any findings. \nThe prime minister's former senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, claimed last week that Mr Johnson had once planned to have donors \"secretly pay\" for the work on his flat.\nHe described the move as \"unethical, foolish, possibly illegal\" and said the PM \"almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended\".\nNo 10 has refused to say whether the prime minister initially received a loan to cover the costs, but Downing Street has insisted the prime minister \"acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law\".\nRefusing to answer questions on the flat at the Covid press conference, Mr Hancock said: \"It is important that there are questions, and there were endless questions in the House of Commons earlier on some of the issues that you raise, and you will have seen the appointment of Lord Geidt earlier.\n\"But you have also got to concentrate on the big things that really matter\" \nEstablished in 2001, it is an independent body that regulates political finance in the UK, including donations to political parties.  \nParties, campaigners, and other groups are required to report donations and loans over a certain amount - which are then published.  \nThe watchdog monitors whether the rules are being followed and has powers to ensure they are enforced. \nAs well as being able to refer investigations to the police, it can hand out its own sanctions under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.\nIt can issue investigation notices, disclosure orders and can carry out interviews - as well as impose fines of up to \u00a320,000, which can increase if payments are late."

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Boris Johnson's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has alleged that the prime minister once planned for Conservative donors to \"secretly pay\" for the revamp of the flat where he and fianc\u00e9e Carrie Symonds live.\nBut the defence secretary has responded by saying Mr Johnson \"personally\" footed the bill.\nIt's not clear whether any of the work - reportedly costing up to \u00a3200,000 - was initially paid for by another source, whom the prime minister then repaid.\nIt was reported that Conservative Lord Brownlow said he was making a donation to the party, which included \"\u00a358,000 to cover the payments\" already made.\nAsked whether he had ever discussed using donations to pay for refurbishments, Mr Johnson said: \"If there's anything to be said about that, any declaration to be made, that will of course be made in due course.\"\nWhy it matters: If Lord Brownlow, or other donors, contributed to the fund or made a loan, this should have been reported to the Electoral Commission, the body which ensures transparency in political funding.\nDetails of the second lockdown were released before the government announced it on 31 October. Dominic Cummings has denied responsibility for those leaks.\nHe also claimed the prime minister had considered stopping an inquiry into who was responsible for the leak after it was found that \"all the evidence\" pointed to Henry Newman - who was a Cabinet Office adviser at the time and now works in Downing Street. \nMr Johnson allegedly said Mr Newman and Carrie Symonds were \"best friends\" and he would have to fire Mr Newman if the inquiry concluded that he was to blame - and that this could cause problems in his family life.\nThe government said the PM had \"never interfered in a government leak inquiry\". And Cabinet Secretary Simon Case warned it was \"probable\" it would \"not successfully\" identify the person responsible, given the time that's elapsed.\nWhy it matters: The inquiry still has not reported its findings, almost six months after being launched. If Mr Johnson wanted to stop it because it might conclude his fiancee's friend was the leaker, this would contravene the ministerial code, laying out rules of behaviour.\nLast week, messages sent between Mr Johnson and the businessman came to light. They revealed that, early in the pandemic, the prime minister had promised to \"fix\" a tax issue so that Sir James's Singapore-based staff could work for longer in the UK in order to help build more ventilators for sick patients.\nMr Johnson promised to publish the full exchange on Friday, but while some details of the correspondence were released, this did not happen.\nWhy it matters: The prime minister said there would be transparency over the texts and is therefore under pressure to give more information.\nPlans for a football competition in which six of the UK's clubs were guaranteed a place - whatever their Premier League performance - were announced last week. Mr Johnson was among its heaviest critics, calling it a \"cartel\".\nBut it was later revealed that Manchester United chief executive Edward Woodward - whose club was one of those behind the European Super League (ESL) - had met the PM's chief of staff in Downing Street five days earlier.\nThe Sunday Times reported that the plans had been discussed in the meeting. But Downing Street denied that, saying it had specifically been about the safe reopening of stadiums and what forms of Covid registration needed to be in place.\nLabour is pushing for fuller details of what happened in the meeting.\nWhy it matters: The UK government welcomed the end of the ESL, from which the English clubs have withdrawn. But were some in Downing Street aware of the clubs' plan in advance? \nIt's been reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman contacted Mr Johnson to say relations between his country and the UK would be damaged if he did not try to \"correct\" the Premier League's decision not to allow a \u00a3300m takeover of Newcastle United.\nIt is claimed the prime minister asked an aide, Lord Udny-Lister, to look into the matter.\nBut the government has denied any involvement with the takeover, a position backed up by Newcastle United.\nWhy it matters: The Premier League had been scrutinising the takeover attempt over concerns that the consortium behind the bid was not properly independent from the Saudi government. Prince Mohammed is also accused of having approved the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2018."

      "title": "A nightmare on repeat - India is running out of oxygen again",
      "tags": "Asia,Oxygen,Maharashtra,India,Pune,New Delhi,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Twenty-five families in India's capital Delhi woke up to the news on Friday morning that someone they loved had died in the city's Sir Ganga Ram hospital, reportedly because coronavirus patients could not get enough oxygen. \nThe hospital's medical director said a severe shortfall had slowed the flow of oxygen to 25 of the sickest patients, who needed a high pressure, stable supply.\nThe tragedy came at the end of a week where several major hospitals in Delhi have repeatedly come close to running out of oxygen, which can help patients with the virus who need support with their breathing stay alive. \nOn Tuesday, it took a desperate public plea from the chief minister and an intervention from the high court for the Indian central government to organise a late night refill. \nAn oxygen tanker eventually arrived at Sir Ganga Ram hospital on Friday morning, shortly after a dire warning that 60 more patients were on the verge of death. \nBut India's rising wave of cases is pushing its healthcare system to the brink - from the country's richest cities to its remotest corners. \nMaharashtra and Gujarat in the west, Haryana in the north, and Madhya Pradesh in central India are all facing an oxygen shortage. \nIn the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, some hospitals have put \"oxygen out of stock\" boards outside, and in the state capital Lucknow hospitals have asked patients to move elsewhere. \nSmaller hospitals and nursing homes in Delhi are doing the same. Desperate relatives in several cities are lining up outside oxygen refilling centres. One plant in the southern city of Hyderabad hired bouncers to manage the crowd. \nMany stricken with coronavirus are dying while they wait. Hospitals are struggling to accommodate breathless patients, or even keep alive those who were lucky enough to find a bed. Social media feeds and WhatsApp groups are full of frantic pleas for oxygen cylinders.\nFor a week, India has been reliving this nightmare on repeat, waiting for the terrifying moment when there is no oxygen left at all.\nFor anyone who has watched the pandemic unfold here - from doctors to officials to journalists - this feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Seven months ago, the country had grappled with a similar oxygen shortage amid a rapid surge in case numbers. But this time, it's much worse. \nTypically, healthcare facilities consume about 15% of oxygen supply, leaving the rest for industrial use. But amid India's second wave nearly 90% of the country's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes daily - is being diverted for medical use, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. \nThat's nearly three times higher than was consumed every day at the peak of the first wave in mid-September last year.  \nThen, India was adding about 90,000 cases daily. Just two weeks ago, in early April, the single-day spike was around 144,000. Now, the daily caseload has more than doubled to well more than 300,000. \n\"The situation is so bad that we had to treat some patients in a cardiac ambulance for 12 hours until they could get an ICU bed,\" said Dr Siddheshwar Shinde, who runs a Covid hospital in Pune, a western district with India's second-highest active caseload and third-highest death toll from the virus. \nLast week, when there were no ventilators left, Dr Shinde began moving patients to other cities - unheard of in Pune, where patients usually arrive from nearby districts seeking treatment. \nThe state of Maharashtra, where Pune is located, is among the worst-affected parts of India, and currently accounts for more than a third of active cases. The state is producing about 1,200 metric tonnes of oxygen daily but all of it is already being used for Covid patients. \nAnd demand is rising along with cases, and outstripping supply. It shows no signs of letting up.  \n\"Usually hospitals like ours were able to have enough oxygen supply. But in the past fortnight, keeping people breathing has become a task. Patients as young as 22 need oxygen support,\" said Dr Shinde.\nDoctors and epidemiologists believe the deluge of cases is delaying tests and consultation, leading to many people being admitted to hospital when their condition is severe. So the demand for high-flow oxygen - and therefore more oxygen - is higher than it was during the last wave.\n\"Nobody knows when this is going to end,\" Dr Shinde said. \"I think even the government did not foresee this.\"\nSome governments did. The southern state of Kerala increased supply by monitoring demand closely and planning for a rise in cases. Kerala now has surplus oxygen that it is sending to other states. \nBut Delhi and some other states do not have their own oxygen plants and are relying on imports. \nThe Supreme Court has weighed in, asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration for a national Covid plan that addresses the oxygen crunch.  \nThe federal health ministry had invited bids for new oxygen plants in October last year - more than eight months after the beginning of pandemic in India. Of the 162 that were sanctioned, only 33 have been installed so far - 59 will be installed by the end of April and another 80 by the end of May, the ministry has said. \nThe scramble to increase supply points to the lack of any emergency plan. \nLiquid oxygen, pale blue and extremely cold, with a temperature of around -183C, is a cryogenic gas that can only be stored and transported in special cylinders and tankers. \nAbout 500 factories in India extract and purify oxygen from air and send it to hospitals in liquid form. Most of it is supplied through tankers. \nMajor hospitals usually have their own tank where oxygen is stored and then piped directly to beds. Smaller and temporary hospitals rely on steel and aluminium cylinders. \nOxygen tankers often queue outside a plant for hours and it takes about two hours to fill one tanker. It takes several hours more for these tankers to travel to various towns within or across states. \nThe tankers also have to follow a specific speed limit - no more than 25mph (40km/h) - and they often don't travel in the night to avoid accidents. \nThe head of one of India's biggest oxygen suppliers has said part of the struggle has been getting oxygen from eastern India, where supply in industrial states such as Orissa and Jharkhand is high, to western or northern India such as Maharashtra or Delhi, where cases are rising fast. \nAnd the demand for oxygen at individual facilities is unpredictable, making it difficult to gauge a hospital's requirement and adequately get supply where it is needed.\n\"Not every patient needs the same amount of oxygen for the same duration. How many patients need oxygen changes by hour in a hospital,\" said Dr Om Shrivastav, an infectious diseases expert at a Mumbai hospital. \n\"We are taking all the care we can. But I've not seen anything like this. I think nobody here has.\"\nBefore the crunch of the oxygen crisis, the federal government was already facing criticism for allowing election rallies and a massive Hindu festival, and failing to expand the vaccination drive quickly enough. Critics have accused various state governments of doing too little to prepare for the devastating second wave now washing through the county.\nDoctors and virologists who spoke to the BBC said the oxygen shortfall was more a symptom than a cause of the crisis - effective safety protocols and strong public messaging could have kept more people at home, and the virus at bay. \nBut a sharp drop in cases by January lulled the country into a false sense of safety, they said, creating the conditions for a terrible second wave. \nMr Modi's government has now started an \"oxygen express\", with trains carrying tankers to wherever there is demand, and the Indian Air Force is airlifting oxygen from military bases. They are also mulling plans to import 50,000 metric tonnes of of liquid oxygen. \n\"We have been telling authorities that we are willing to increase our capacity, but we need financial aid for that,\" said Rajabhau Shinde, who runs a small oxygen plant in Maharashtra. \n\"Nobody said anything and now suddenly, hospitals and doctors are pleading for more cylinders,\" he said. \n\"This should not have happened. As the saying goes, dig the well before you're thirsty. But we didn't do that.\"\nHave you been affected by any of the issues raised in this story?

      "text": "Cruise enthusiast Cathy Rogers doesn't know how many trips she's been on - she stopped counting when it passed 30.\nFrom 17 May cruises will be allowed to resume from England under step three of the roadmap out of lockdown and demand is high. \nCathy, who runs a Facebook group for enthusiasts, has already booked up and has no qualms.    \n\"I really would feel much safer on board a ship than even in my local supermarket,\" she says. \n\"There's always higher levels of hygiene than you would get in a normal restaurant or a pub. I'm really looking forward to seeing how they make things as normal as possible for us on board.\"\nJust outside Edinburgh three Fred Olsen cruise ships are being readied for service in anticipation of a rush in demand. \nAfter 14 months of standstill, the paint is being retouched, the chairs re-upholstered and the carpets relaid, ready to set sail this summer. \nFred Olsen says it has already sold two thirds of tickets for British cruises.\nThey were only launched a few weeks ago. \nIts hotel operations director, Thomas Rennesland, tells the BBC he has never been busier, but also that the last year has been stressful.\n\"Unfortunately we had to say goodbye to some really fantastic colleagues as the ships were not moving. Then of course we had to start planning the re-entry into service. No one has ever done anything like this before.\"\nWhen cruising does restart it will be phased, starting with scenic tours around the UK stopping and starting at the same port, or so called trips to nowhere out to sea. \nThe first ships could set sail from 17 May from England, but the industry hopes that the other UK nations will follow too. \nSome operators, like Virgin Voyages, are seeing it as a chance to introduce cruising to a new customer, with 3 or 4-day trips as an alternative to a staycation. Along with testing and cleaning protocols, they are requiring all passengers and crew to be fully vaccinated before they travel onboard. \n\"I don't know where else you can travel, where else you can go to a restaurant that has this level of protocols in place,\" says Tom McAlpin, boss of Virgin Voyages. \n\"I think you rebuild trust by creating these protocols so that people feel safe. It's the right thing for us to do to make people feel comfortable.\" \nAt the beginning of the pandemic, there were several stories of outbreaks on different international cruise liners. \nBob Sanguinetti, boss of the UK Chamber of Shipping, says the industry, like the rest of society, has learned lots of lessons since then.\nThere are now protocols for UK operators that mean all cruise passengers will need to take a test before they embark, as well as guidelines on social distancing, bubbles and how to monitor passengers' health.  \n\"I don't think it will be difficult to persuade passengers back on board,\" says Mr Sanguinetti. \"Cruise companies are doing their utmost to ensure that risk is kept to an absolute minimum.\"\nChris and Wendy Hignell are booked to travel from Southampton to Liverpool in May. They don't mind that this time it will be closer to home. \n\"The fact we can't get off is not a problem, just to be able to enjoy the ship itself is the thing,\" says Wendy. \nThey feel reassured by the safety measures too. \n\"The numbers are greatly reduced so that's a big bonus. Everyone's being tested, there's masks, there's social distancing,\" says Chris. \"It makes us think it's worth having a go and feeling safe whilst we do it.\"\nStill the industry - which has been on pause for more than a year - has work to do to regain lost ground. \n\"The pandemic has had a massive impact on the industry, not just cruise companies, but tour operators, ports and other destinations where they visit,\" says Mr Sanguinetti. \n\"The UK cruise sector contributes about \u00a310bn to the UK economy every year and supports over 80,000 jobs. A lot of those will have gone.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Facebook,Apple",
      "text": "A surge in iPhone sales, especially in China, has led to a doubling of profits at Apple since the start of the pandemic.\nThe results reflected \"optimism\" about the days ahead, Apple's boss said.\nRival tech firm Facebook also reported bumper revenues and profits.\nBut the social media giant warned Apple's latest software release could undermine its prospects later in the year.\nApple has seen sales of its phones, apps and other devices rise throughout the pandemic, as consumers spent more time working, shopping and seeking entertainment online.\nCustomers continued to upgrade to Apple's new 5G phones which were rolled out last year, and also bought Mac computers and iPads to tackle working and studying from home, the firm said.\nFitness and music apps also saw a lockdown boost.\nSales to China nearly doubled, leading to overall revenues for the first three months of this year of $89.6bn (\u00a364.2bn), more than 50% up compared to a year earlier.\nProfit was $23.6bn, up from $11.3bn for the same period last year.\n\"This quarter reflects both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives, as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead for all of us,\" said chief executive Tim Cook.\nPaolo Pescatore, analyst with PP Foresight, said it was \"another blowout quarter\" for Apple. \n\"The iPhone remains a core product and gateway to the Apple universe,\" he added, providing Apple with \"a key launchpad\" to sell further services.\nSophie Lund-Yates, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said customers had proved willing to \"splurge on big-ticket items thanks to a global shift to working from home, and the fact people have found comfort in treating themselves\".\n\"The sheer scale of Apple's sales is testament to the grip that shiny embossed piece of fruit has on global consumers,\" she added.\nFacebook, which relies on sales of advertising rather than consumer electronics, also saw bumper revenues and profits in the first three months of the year.\nThe time spent by consumers at home, and the spending power that shifted online, translated into revenues of $26.17bn, outpacing analysts predictions. Profit was also higher than expected at $9.5bn.\nFacebook said in coming months it expected revenue to be stable or grow moderately, and admitted a new feature released this week by Apple - an option for users to prevent apps from collecting user data - could \"significantly\" hurt its business.\nIt's not just Apple and Facebook who have posted astonishing profits this week. Google and Microsoft announced eye-watering quarterly figures yesterday too. \nThat may not be surprising to many. Global lockdowns have made people work and play more online. What's less clear though was whether this was a pandemic bounce? Or have people permanently changed their behaviour? These figures certainly suggest the latter. \nApple's figures across multiple sectors, across the world, are exceptional. In places like China, which has mostly been lockdown-free in recent months, sales were up dramatically. Facebook's figures too, show that advertisers are feeling bullish about online spending. \nAlmost all of Facebook's revenue is from ads, so when Facebook is doing well, that usually suggests we're buying more things on the internet. Amazon's quarterly figures are out tomorrow, and they too are expected to have had a bumper quarter. Big Tech's pandemic bounce is increasingly looking like a trend. \nThe two companies are locked in a stand-off after Apple announced the latest version of its iOS operating system this week. \nA new feature will prompt device users to decide whether they are happy for their data to be collected by apps. Many are likely to say no.\nBut user data is a large reason why Facebook's ad-based business model is so profitable. It allows advertising to be targeted and monitored for efficacy.\nFacebook saw a rise in monthly active users, however, which were up by 10% at 2.85 billion.\nOn Tuesday Google's parent company Alphabet reported a record profit in the three months to March as its advertising revenue swelled by a third. \nThe firm credited \"elevated consumer activity online\" for its results as populations around the world spent more time indoors at home to avoid the spread of coronavirus."

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Further questions have been asked about the funding of home improvements at the prime minister's Downing Street flat, following the release of an exchange of letters with his standards adviser.\nLord Geidt complained about not having been shown WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and Tory donor Lord Brownlow, which talked about the refurbishment.\nBoris Johnson and Carrie Symonds had work carried out on their private residence, the flat above 11 Downing Street.\nThe prime minister receives an annual public grant of \u00a330,000 to spend on his living quarters. But the work cost considerably more than that - at least \u00a3112,000 based on the amount we know Lord Brownlow contributed.\nThe work was initially paid for by the Cabinet Office, but \u00a352,000 was given to the Conservative Party by Lord Brownlow to cover the bills. Mr Johnson says he has now covered all the costs out of his own pocket.\nThe Conservative Party was fined \u00a317,800 after the Electoral Commission found it had failed to accurately declare all of Lord Brownlow's donations towards the renovation.\nLord Brownlow was asked in May 2020 to set up a Downing Street trust that would fund renovations to the flat above 11 Downing Street, but that trust was never established.\nIn November 2020, the prime minister approached Lord Brownlow by WhatsApp message to approve payments to the interior designer carrying out the work. \nThe Electoral Commission found in December 2021 that the subsequent \u00a352,000 payment from Huntswood Associates Ltd, whose director is Lord Brownlow, had not been properly recorded and that it should not have been described as a loan or as part of a trust.\nBut it said that separate payments of almost \u00a360,000 for the refurbishments made by Lord Brownlow directly to suppliers, did not need to be declared.\nThe Electoral Commission report led to further controversy because it referred to an exchange of WhatsApp messages between the prime minister and Lord Brownlow, which had not been seen by the adviser on standards, Lord Geidt, when he had reported on the case earlier in the year.\nLord Geidt's report in May had concluded that Mr Johnson did not break the ministerial code over the funding of the renovations.\nBut he said: \"The prime minister - unwisely, in my view - allowed the refurbishment of the apartment at No 11 Downing Street to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded.\"\nLord Geidt added: \"The record shows no evidence that the prime minister had been informed\" about the payments. His report says that when he found out in February 2021, Mr Johnson \"settled the full amount himself\". \nBut when Lord Geidt found out about the messages to Lord Brownlow, he wrote to the prime minister saying that while his overall conclusions about the ministerial code were unchanged, had he seen the messages, \"I doubt whether I would have concluded, without qualification... that 'at the point when the prime minister became aware, he took steps to make the relevant declaration and to seek advice'.\"\nMr Johnson replied, offering a \"humble and sincere apology\" for not giving him the messages, blaming security issues which had forced him to change his phone.   \nIf a politician accepts money from a donor - either as a gift or as a loan - they are expected to make that information public, normally within 28 days.\nThe concern is that if a financial gift is kept secret, it might be used to gain favours or political influence.\nThis is the exchange of messages between Mr Johnson and Lord Brownlow:\nAt the end of his message, Mr Johnson refers to the \"great exhibition plan\", which was a proposal for a cultural festival, which Lord Brownlow was involved with as a trustee of London's Albert Hall.\nLord Brownlow met Oliver Dowden, who was then culture secretary, to discuss the event six weeks after the text exchange with the prime minister, according to the meeting log. In the end, the exhibition did not happen, but Labour says Lord Brownlow's November 2020 text exchanges with the PM are still important.\n\"Lord Brownlow appears to have access to the prime minister because he was paying for the flat renovations. If that is the case, that is corruption,\" the party said.\nThe BBC has approached Lord Brownlow for comment but he has not yet responded.\nBusiness Minister Paul Scully denied that the prime minister was linking support for a Great Exhibition with financial support for flat renovations in his messages.\nHe said the Great Exhibition plan was passed to \"the right channels\" at the culture department and that Mr Johnson \"had no idea\" who would be paying for the flat refurbishments, believing the funding would come through a blind trust.\nLike several of his recent predecessors, Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds are living at No 11 because the four-bedroom flat there is much larger than the one above No 10.\nTony Blair was the first prime minister to live at No 11 - he and his wife Cherie turned the space into a family home. \nThe Grade 1-listed flat was then extensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameron in 2011 at a cost of \u00a330,000.\nThe latest upgrade for the flat was carried out by interior designer Lulu Lytle. \nMr Johnson and his wife wanted to transform the flat from previous Prime Minister Theresa May's \"John Lewis furniture nightmare\" into a \"high society haven\", according to the society magazine Tatler."

It also paid back business rates relief on its stores in line with rivals.\nThe supermarket giant also paid out restructuring costs, including to close 170 standalone Argos stores.\nSainsbury's \u00a3261m pre-tax loss for the year was despite like-for-like sales rising 8.1%.\nArgos did especially well, with total sales rising almost 11% as digital sales boomed.\nHowever, Argos standalone stores, rather than those inside the supermarkets, were closed for much of the year during lockdowns.\nSainsbury's online sales rose as coronavirus restrictions accelerated internet shopping. Online jumped from 8% of grocery sales to 17% during the year.\nThe retailer has already embarked on a restructuring, and announced in March that 1,150 jobs were at risk.\nDespite a big jump in food sales Sainsbury's is nursing a \u00a3261m loss.\nSupermarkets have been among the big winners during the pandemic but they've also had huge Covid-19 costs, from keeping workers and customers safe to sick pay for staff who've had to shield.\nSainsbury's also incurred \u00a3617m of exceptional costs. Most of this was the result of closing hundreds of standalone Argos stores as it restructures the business.\nThe boss says that like his customers, he's looking forward to things feeling more normal over the coming months.\nBut what is the new normal going to look like for our big grocers?\nIt's not just about the shift to online, grocers are thinking about the future of work, and how to respond if many of us don't return to five days a week in the office.\nSainsbury's is pressing ahead with plans to open more convenience stores and new neighbourhood hub shops - mini supermarkets in smaller towns -  which could be a shrewd move if we're going to be working more from home and shopping locally.\nChief executive Simon Roberts praised the \"heroic\" efforts of staff to keep the business going during the pandemic, but added: \"The cost of keeping colleagues and customers safe during the pandemic has been high.\"\nSusannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the costs of operating through the coronavirus crisis have \"seriously dented\" the supermarket giant's bottom line.\n\"Redesigning layouts to keep customers and staff safe, paying colleagues in full who needed to shield, all added [to costs] with \u00a3485m spent on Covid related costs,\" she said.\nSainsbury's also spent \u00a3100m on higher staff salaries and special recognition payments to colleagues \"for their efforts during the crisis\", Ms Streeter added.\nKeith Bowman, equity analyst at Interactive Investor, said the results offered \"broad optimism\" for the future.\n\"[But] intense competition across the sector, including from discount retailers Aldi and Lidl, cannot be ignored,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday Sainsbury's reiterated plans to open 25 to 30 convenience stores per year for three years.\nMr Roberts said this would tap into the coronavirus trend of more people working from home.\nHe said the return of people working a five day week in the office \"is not going to happen\".\n\"As customers find new ways of working it inevitably will mean some of the week working from home,\" he said. \"We believe convenience stores will play a big part in the local community.\"\nSainsbury's already has more than 800 convenience stores, and those \"acted as mini supermarkets in the crisis with sales up 13% on the year,\" he said.\n\"Hundreds of these stores will be in in important locations for customers as they work locally,\" he added."

      "text": "A \"shocking shortage\" in imaging doctors could risk patient safety and make it \"extremely difficult\" to cut waiting lists built up during the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have warned.\nThe Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) said Wales had the UK's worst shortage with 38% fewer consultants than needed to keep up with demand.\nCharities called the figures alarming.\nParties fighting to lead the next Welsh government in May's election said they would recruit more staff to the NHS.\nRadiologists are doctors who specialise in interpreting X-rays, scans and other types of medical images which are vital in detecting and diagnosing injury and disease including cancer.\nThe latest figures show more than 500,000 people were on waiting lists in Wales in February and 20,548 patients had to wait more than eight weeks for a scan following a consultant or GP referral - 33 times higher than at the same time last year.\nThe RCR estimates the Welsh NHS needs to recruit 97 more radiologists to meet growing demand - yet its research suggests there was no increase in the number of consultants here during 2019-20.\nThe situation could be made worse, it warned, with its survey suggesting 11% of radiologists in Wales planning on leaving the NHS next year, with 43% of those staying intending to reduce their hours.\nA significant proportion of the radiologist workforce, the RCR said, feel \"demoralised\". \nSenior doctors said they were worried there were not enough consultants to keep patients safe, and the shortage would make it very difficult to deal with the significant backlog of tests and treatments that built up during the pandemic.\nSwansea consultant radiologist Dr Toby Wells, who represents the RCR in Wales, said the pandemic had piled on the pressure but there had been a \"crisis\" in recruitment for years, leading to a \"shocking shortage\".\n\"We're trying to catch up that backlog but it's on a background of a shortage of radiologists, a shortage of scanners, a shortage of radiographers,\" he said.\nThere have also been changes in working practices, with radiologists scanning fewer people in a day due to social distancing measures.\n\"Trying to accommodate that and make any progress, and catching up, is difficult,\" he said.\nAlthough the number of patients awaiting scans has reduced since February, he said there was a \"huge backlog of patients waiting to see surgeons\" which would lead to an increase in workload.\nPlaid Cymru said: \"Over the past year we have witnessed the frailties and unsustainability of healthcare services and the lack of investment that led to an overdependence on the goodwill and sheer dedication of the health and care workforce. \n\"A Plaid Cymru government has a five-year plan to recruit and train an additional 1,000 doctors, 4,000 nurses, and 1,000 allied healthcare professionals, including radiologists.\n\"We will also prioritise the continued roll out of multi disciplinary cancer diagnostic centres across Wales, making access to diagnostic tests easier for patients and GPs.\"\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said: \"This isn't something which will be solved overnight. \n\"Training medical staff takes times and that is why our manifesto for next week's election has commitments to boost medical recruitment as well as to improve levels of staff retention. \n\"We know that many staff leave the NHS due to burnout and stress and that many don't feel they have the mental health support they need to continue.\"\nWelsh Labour said: \"Our \u00a33.4m support last term helped open the new state of the art National Imaging Academy Wales in August 2018 that is training the next generation of radiologists and imaging professionals. \n\"The National Health Service is our top priority and we've pledged an NHS recovery plan on day one with more than \u00a31bn of funding behind it that can support our health service and its staff and sustainably tackle the delayed cases that have built up over the last year.  \n\"That recovery plan will include the development of a new medical school in north Wales so we can train the new professionals we need over the coming years; support for staff wellbeing and costed plans to train the 12,000 doctors, nurses and allied healthcare professionals we need to support NHS recovery.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives said: \"These are alarming figures and highlight Labour's poor management of our public services over the past two decades.\n\"Labour have shown they have no plan to fix things and their poor record over the past 22 years has left Wales and the NHS in a perilous position. \n\"Welsh Conservatives will build a strong economy so we can invest in our NHS and tackle these problems with five new hospitals, 1,200 more doctors and 3,000 more nurses.\"\nJudi Rhys, chief executive of Tenovus Cancer Care, said: \"Not once since the start of the pandemic has the number of people being sent for cancer tests matched the pre-pandemic levels. \n\"This has led to a missing community of 35,755 people, potentially with cancer, who have yet to engage with the health service. \n\"Tenovus Cancer Care estimates that even if the number of people being sent for scans was 10% higher in future, it would take more than two years to clear this backlog.\n\"We need a comprehensive, detailed and long-term plan for cancer services, and we urge residents to call on anyone seeking election next month to commit to one as a matter of urgency.\"\nRichard Pugh, head of partnerships for Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, said he was \"concerned at the level of radiology workforce gaps in Wales, which is part of wider gaps across the Welsh cancer workforce that make tackling the cancer backlog caused by the pandemic even harder\".\n\"Macmillan's analysis of Welsh cancer waiting times shows there were around 1,550 fewer first treatments for cancer in the year since the start of the pandemic compared to the same period a year before.\n\"It is vital that the next Welsh government prioritises getting cancer services back on track to ensure that people with cancer get a timely diagnosis and treatment for the best chance of survival.\n\"We need the next government to urgently invest in the NHS workforce and to create a long-term strategy for recovery and renewing cancer care so that Wales has the staff and resources to tackle this growing challenge.\"\nThe RCR's annual workforce survey highlights key concerns for Wales.\nIt suggests the radiologist workforce is understaffed by 38% - the biggest shortfall in any UK nation.\nIt means Wales lags significantly behind the EU average for the number of radiologists per patient - Wales has 7.8 radiologists per 100,000 people, the UK average is 8.6, the EU average is 12.8.\nOn patient safety, the college said 60% of Wales' imaging directors said they did not have enough consultants to keep patients safe.\nWales also has the worst interventional radiology (radiologists undertaking procedures) provision of any UK nation, with 60% of health boards unable to provide 24/7 rotas or transfer arrangements for patients needing interventional care. \nAt the start of April, the RCR polled 1,089 consultants around the UK about their feelings on working in the NHS post-Covid. A total of 37 were from Wales and, of those:\nThe RCR has previously warned of \"real risk\" to the future of cancer services in Wales because of a significant shortage of specialists."

      "tags": "Renewable Heat Incentive inquiry ,DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "Arlene Foster faced unprecedented challenges and monumental political changes during her tenure as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nFrom Brexit to the Irish Sea border and of course the pandemic, it has been a tough few years for Northern Ireland's first minister, culminating in the revolt that has forced her to step down.\nHere BBC News NI charts her career.\nMrs Foster, a lawyer from County Fermanagh, held the DUP's top job for just over five years.\nShe became leader of the party in December 2015 and, the following month as leader of Stormont's largest party, she was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland.\nShe was the first woman and the youngest person to hold both jobs.\nWhen she took on the roles, she was viewed by many as a capable minister and a popular leader whose personal experiences shaped her passion for the unionist cause.\nBorn as Arlene Kelly in 1970, she grew up on a farm in rural County Fermanagh, close to the Irish border.\nThe Troubles played a significant role in her childhood - when she was eight years old, the IRA attempted to kill her father, a reserve police officer, outside her family home.\n\"My father came in on all fours crawling, with blood coming from his head,\" Mrs Foster told the Belfast Telegraph in 2015.\nMr Kelly survived the attack, but the family was forced to sell their farm and move away.\n\"I now know that this was a deliberate tactic of targeting vulnerable border Protestants to drive them from their homes,\" she wrote in the News Letter in January 2016 after taking Stormont's top job.\n\"I want to send a very direct message to the victims of the violence: I am one of you, I am on your side and I will not let you down.\"\nAs as teenager in 1988 the IRA set off a bomb on her school bus and the future first minister was caught up in the blast.\nThe target of the attack was the bus driver, who was also a part-time soldier in the Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR).\nArlene Kelly was not hurt in the explosion, but a schoolgirl sitting next to her was seriously injured.\nWhen she left grammar school in Enniskillen, the future Mrs Foster became the first member of her family to go to university, studying law at Queen's University, Belfast. \nShe became politically active at university, joining the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and chairing Queen's Ulster Unionist Association.\nShe qualified as a solicitor and began working in private practice in Enniskillen and Portadown, County Armagh.\nOn 24 August 1995, aged 25, she married Brian Foster, and the couple went on to have three children. \nIn 2003, Mrs Foster was elected as a UUP assembly member (MLA) for her home constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone.\nBut she vehemently opposed David Trimble's leadership of the UUP and the following year she defected to Ian Paisley's DUP.\nWhen the DUP entered a power-sharing government with Sinn F\u00e9in in 2007, Mrs Foster was given her first government post - environment minister.\nShe then held posts as minister of enterprise, trade and investment and finance minister. \nWhen former DUP leader Peter Robinson stepped down as first minister in late 2015, Mrs Foster was elected unopposed as his successor.\nShe passed her first electoral test in May 2016, when the DUP consolidated its position as the largest party in Northern Ireland.\nThe following month, Mrs Foster and the DUP were on the winning side of the Brexit debate when the UK voted to leave the European Union.\nWithin a year of taking up her post as DUP leader, she was feeling the heat from a financial controversy at Stormont. \nThe Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme, which had been set up by Mrs Foster when she was economy minister in 2012, was in danger of a multi-million pound overspend.\nWhen she refused to step aside, saying she had done nothing wrong, the then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuiness resigned.\nThe nature of their joint office meant that when he quit, she lost her job too and a snap assembly election was triggered. \nThe collapse of Stormont's coalition government in January 2017 would lead to a three-year gap in devolution. \nDuring a bitter election campaign, Mrs Foster compared Sinn F\u00e9in to a \"crocodile\" that would keep coming back for more when she was asked about the party's demand for an Irish language act. \nIn the end, the DUP topped the poll and retained its place as Stormont's biggest party, but Sinn F\u00e9in narrowed the gap to a single seat.\nThe result also meant that for the first time, unionists did not hold an overall majority in the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nBut in June 2017, a snap general election produced a dramatic reversal of fortunes for Mrs Foster. \nPrime Minister Theresa May lost the Conservative's majority at Westminster, forcing her to seek the DUP's support to stay in power.\nMrs Foster and her DUP delegation negotiated more than \u00a31bn in extra public spending for Northern Ireland, in exchange for a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Tories.\nAs Mrs May tried to strike a Brexit deal with the EU however, the DUP threatened to pull the plug if it did not agree with the eventual arrangements. \nBut Mrs Foster argued there could not be an economic border in the Irish Sea, describing that as a \"blood-red line\" for the DUP.\nIn November 2018, her party placed its trust in the then backbench MP Boris Johnson who gave the keynote speech at the DUP's annual conference.\nMr Johnson received rapturous applause when he called for the proposed Irish border arrangements to be junked.\nSeveral months later, now in office as prime minister, Mr Johnson did the complete opposite and agreed to a trade border down the Irish Sea, in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nUnionists felt betrayed by Mr Johnson - but some pointed the finger at the DUP leadership for allowing its influence to be abused.\nMrs Foster later joked she had sent the prime minister \"to the naughty step\", with the DUP refusing to uphold its confidence-and-supply commitments with the government.\nBoris Johnson won a large majority in the December general election that year, and no longer needed DUP support. \nThe DUP meanwhile lost two of its 10 seats, with its deputy leader Nigel Dodds among the casualties.\nOut of influence at Westminster, the party was facing calls from an impatient public to return to power-sharing at Stormont.\nIn January 2020, devolution was restored with the New Decade, New Approach agreement and the DUP formed a new government with Sinn F\u00e9in and three smaller parties. \nMrs Foster resumed her role as first minister and said it was \"time for Stormont to move forward\".\nMrs Foster, along with Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, was tasked with leading the local response to the biggest global crisis since World War Two. \nThe first few months appeared to be marked by a new spirit of cross-party cooperation, as the pair frequently appeared together to appeal to the public to follow strict lockdown regulations. \nBut by June 2020, political relations were once again at breaking point.\nMrs O'Neill, along with other Sinn F\u00e9in politicians, was among about 2,000 mourners at the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey.\nHaving ordered so many grieving families to forego the usual funeral customs to protect lives, images of the large cortege caused widespread anger.\nMrs Foster stopped appearing at joint coronavirus press conferences with Ms O'Neill - a stand-off that continued until a second wave of the virus took hold in the autumn. \nThe Covid crisis was still dominating the news agenda when the new Irish Sea border came into operation on 1 January 2021.\nUnionist anger over the Irish Sea border has grown and by April, it was cited among the reasons which contributed to a spate of riots. \nSome of Mrs Foster's critics in the DUP were also angered by her decision to abstain in a vote on banning gay conversion therapy in the Northern Ireland Assembly rather than opposing it with the majority of the party's MLAs. \nOn Tuesday, it emerged that more than 20 MLAs, four MPs and a peer had signed a letter calling for leadership contest.\nIt was clear that her tumultuous tenure as party leader - and NI First Minister - was coming to an end.\nIn her resignation statement, she urged young people to get involved in politics \"to shape Northern Ireland for the better\".\n\"My election as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party broke a glass ceiling and I am glad inspired other women to enter politics and spurred them on to take up elected office.\"\nMrs Foster added: \"I have sought to lead the party and Northern Ireland away from division and towards a better path.\n\"There are people in Northern Ireland with a British identity, others are Irish, others are Northern Irish, others are a mixture of all three and some are new and emerging. We must all learn to be generous to each other, live together and share this wonderful country.\n \"The future of unionism and Northern Ireland will not be found in division, it will only be found in sharing this place we all are privileged to call home.\"\nAs her party met in a Belfast hotel to ratify the election of her successor Edwin Poots as DUP leader, Mrs Foster shared her thoughts about the nature of her ousting with the BBC's Newscast programme.\n\"I think I said a couple of days after what had happened that politics is brutal, but even by DUP standards, it was pretty brutal,\" she said.\n\"I had absolutely no idea and was telephoned by a close colleague that this was happening on Monday evening and then by Tuesday morning, it was all in the papers, so it wasn't particularly pleasant.\"\nShe had originally indicated that she intended to stay on as first minister until the end of June, but Mr Poots was anxious to get his new ministerial team in place sooner.\nIn the end, it was agreed that Mrs Foster would stay on to host a British-Irish Council summit in her native County Fermanagh on 11 June.\nThis was her swansong as first minister - her last big political event on her home soil - and it also produced an actual song as Mrs Foster broke into a rendition of a Frank Sinatra classic.\n\"That's life, that's what all the people say. You're riding high in April, shot down in May,\" she sang at a press conference.\nHer pertinent choice of lyrics meant Mrs Foster bowed out to applause and laughter in Fermanagh.\nAt midday on Monday 14 June, the assembly member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone addressed the Northern Ireland Assembly for the final time as first minister. \nAn hour later, her resignation became official.\nOver the course of the last few weeks, Mrs Foster has often referred to the end of her \"local\" political career, so as leaves the stage in Belfast it is unlikely to be her final role in public life."

      "text": "People aged 42 and over in England are now able to book their Covid-19 jab, the health secretary has said.\nThose who are due to turn 42 by 1 July are also eligible to make an appointment under the latest extension of the vaccine rollout.\nMatt Hancock, who is 42, said he was \"really looking forward\" to receiving his invitation via text and urged others to book their jabs.\nMeanwhile, one in four UK adults have now had both of their Covid jabs.\nMore than 33.8 million people in the UK have received their first dose, while more than 13.2 million have received two, according to the latest government figures. \nThey also show that a further 17 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and 2,685 new cases were recorded. \nThe extension of the rollout comes just a day after vaccinations were opened to 44-year-olds in England. \nIn a video posted on Twitter, Mr Hancock said that rollout had gone \"very, very well\" and thanked those who had booked their jabs.\n\"Now we're able to go that little bit further,\" he said.\nNHS medical director Prof Stephen Powis added the success of the rollout \"hasn't happened by accident\".\n\"It is down to months of careful planning and sheer hard work by nurses, doctors and countless other staff supported by our volunteers,\" he said.\nNorthern Ireland has opened its vaccination programme to people aged 35 to 39. Wales, meanwhile, has been inviting over-40s for vaccination, as well as over-30s in some areas. Scotland has been inviting the over-45s for vaccination.\nAcross the UK, there have now been 152,205 deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nThe highest number of deaths to occur on a single day was 1,477 on 19 January, the ONS added.\nHowever, it also said deaths involving Covid-19 in England and Wales have fallen by 97% since the peak of the second wave of the virus.\nA total of 266 deaths occurred in the week ending 9 April where Covid-19 was recorded on the death certificate - this is down 97% from 8,965 deaths in the week to 22 January.\nAnother set of figures produced by the government, which measure deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test result, show 127,434 Covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic, after a further 6 were reported on Monday.\nAt Tuesday's cabinet meeting, the PM \"re-iterated that the data continues to look good but warned that we are not out of the woods yet as variants of concern continue to pose a threat\", a No 10 statement said.\nThe statement continued: \"The PM said that while the road ahead looks positive, there will still be challenges and this government will continue to take tough decisions where necessary to protect both lives and livelihoods.\"  \nWhile England's vaccine rollout continues to draw praise, its approach towards the policing of Covid lockdown breaches has been criticised as \"muddled, discriminatory and unfair\" by a parliamentary committee.\nMPs on the Joint Committee on Human Rights want a review of all the fixed penalty notices served for lockdown breaches, which can be as high as \u00a310,000.\nThe JCHR, which is made up of MPs and peers, said it had \"significant concerns\" about the validity of fines, the inadequacy of the review and appeal process, the size of the penalties and the criminalisation of those who could not afford to pay.\n\"The whole process disproportionately hits the less well-off and criminalises the poor over the better off,\" said the committee chairwoman, Labour MP Harriet Harman.\nAccording to the report, coronavirus rules have changed at least 65 times since March 2020.\n\"It is possible to tell from penalties that have not been paid and have then progressed through the system towards a prosecution, that a significant number of FPNs are incorrectly issued,\" the committee said.\nA government spokesperson said it was right there were consequences for those who most flagrantly breached the rules.\nElsewhere, medical supplies from the UK arrived in India, the first international shipment aimed at stemming a devastating Covid surge.\nIndia recorded 320,000 new infections on Tuesday, and deaths have risen to almost 200,000 overall.\nThe UK shipment of 200 pieces, including ventilators and oxygen concentrators, to help hospitals manage oxygen supplies was unloaded at Delhi airport on Tuesday.\nHowever, asked if surplus vaccines would be sent to India, the PM's spokesman said: \"We don't have surplus doses.\"\nThe spokesman added: \"We committed in February to sending excess doses from the UK's supply to the Covax procurement pool and to countries in need once they are available.\" \nHow has coronavirus affected you?

      "text": "Rajeshwari Devi, 58, died on Sunday after waiting for two days to get uninterrupted oxygen, an ambulance and a bed in a Covid-19 hospital.\nShe kept waiting and gasping but it was too late by the time help arrived. She was taken to a hospital emergency room on 16 April after her oxygen saturation level dropped. Her CT scan showed that she had developed severe pneumonia.\nBut without her Covid report the hospital refused to admit her. She spent around 36 hours in the emergency room on oxygen support in the northern Indian district of Robertsganj. The staff there told her family they were running out of oxygen and she needed to be moved to a bigger hospital but there was no ambulance or any promise of a bed. \nThe desperate family took her in their car to a hospital where a bed had become available after the intervention of a politician. She had no oxygen support in the car - she died minutes before she could be admitted to hospital. \nAshish Agrahari, her son, says his mother \"would have had a chance at survival if treatment was given in time\".\nHeartbreaking stories such as this are coming in from across India as a second Covid wave wreaks havoc. Data suggests that this wave is proving to be more infectious and deadlier in some states, although India's death rate from the virus is still relatively low. \nBut the county's healthcare system is crumbling amid the surge in cases - doctors say it's hard for them to \"see the light at the end of the tunnel this time\".  \nThe rise in case numbers has been exponential in the second wave. \nOn 18 June last year, India recorded 11,000 cases and in the next 60 days, it added 35,000 new cases on average every day. \nOn 10 February, at the start of the second wave, India confirmed 11,000 cases - and in the next 50 days, the daily average was around 22,000 cases. But in the following 10 days, cases rose sharply with the daily average reaching 89,800.\nExperts say this rapid increase shows that the second wave is spreading much faster across the country. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of Kerala state's Covid taskforce, said the rise was not entirely unexpected given that India let its guard down when daily infections in January fell to fewer than 20,000 from a peak of over 90,000 in September.\nBig religious gatherings, the reopening of most public places and crowded election rallies are being blamed for the uptick. Dr Fathahudeen said there were warning signs in February but \"we did not get our act together\".\n\"I said in February that Covid had not gone anywhere and a tsunami would hit us if urgent actions were not taken. Sadly, a tsunami has indeed hit us now,\" he added.\n\"A false sense of normalcy crept in and everybody, including people and officials, did not take measures to stop the second wave.\"\nMany Indian cities are reporting a chronic shortage of hospital beds. It's also evident in the desperate cries for help on social media platforms. Disturbing reports of people dying without getting timely treatment are coming from all over the country.\nSeveral state governments say they are creating new facilities but experts say it's going to be hard to keep up with the pace of the rising number of infections.\nIndia has been consistently reporting more than 150,000 cases for days now. It reported 273,810 cases on Monday - the biggest daily spike since the pandemic began.\nBadly-affected cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad have almost run out of hospital beds. \nThe situation is not very different in other cities, such as Lucknow, Bhopal, Kolkata, Allahabad and Surat. Public health expert Anant Bhan says officials did not use the lean period to boost facilities.\n\"We didn't learn any lesson from the first wave. We had reports of some cities running out of beds even in the first wave and that should have been a good enough reason to be prepared for the second wave,\" he said.\nHe adds that there appears to be a lack of co-ordination between states and the federal government over the supply of oxygen and essential drugs. \"We need a consolidated response and resources should be shared between states.\" \nThe situation is much more dire when it comes to ICU beds. Several cities have just a few dozen ICU beds left and they are now frantically trying to build extra capacity in hotels and stadiums.\nBut getting ICU beds up and running quickly is not easy. Dr Fathahudeen says adding beds alone is not enough. \"We need to ensure that most of these beds have oxygen facility. We need more doctors and nurses to manage extra ICU beds,\" he adds.\nHe says it's going to be a \"daunting task\" for the government to get such facilities up and running and ensure good quality of care in a short span of time.\nThe number of daily deaths has risen sharply in the second wave. India reported 1,761 deaths on Monday, taking the toll to over 180,000 since the pandemic began.\nCrematoriums have been running day and night in several cities, and people have to wait for hours to get the deceased cremated or buried.\nExperts say this shows that the actual number of deaths could be much higher. \nSanjeev Gupta, a photojournalist based in the central Indian city of Bhopal, reached one of the city's crematoriums for what he thought was a usual assignment last week. \nBhopal had reported only four Covid-related deaths on that day. But Mr Gupta was surprised to see dozens of funeral pyres burning. Additionally, several bodies were lined up to be cremated in the electric furnace. \nMr Gupta says he was moved when a young man asked him to photograph the smoke coming out from the chimney of the electric crematorium. \n\"He said the smoke represented his mother. It's the most heartbreaking thing I have ever heard.\"\nAnother photojournalist in Lucknow, which is the capital of Uttar Pradesh state, told the BBC that he counted nearly 100 funeral pyres burning at one of the city's crematoriums in the city on 14 April. The official death data for the whole state on that day was 85.\n\"The sky had turned orange near the crematorium. I still get chills thinking about it. We are definitely not getting the right death data from the government,\" he said.\nAnother photojournalist the BBC spoke to in Varanasi city in Uttar Pradesh state also talked about similar discrepancies in how deaths were being reported. \nExperts say there are several reasons for this. One of them is that many people are dying at home because they are not getting hospital beds or they are not being able to get tested for Covid. So, they don't find a place as a Covid patient in the database managed by different states. \nMr Bhan says testing facilities are still poor in smaller towns and even in some cities and \"it's possible we are missing many Covid-related deaths in these areas\".\nHe adds that there seems to be an issue with recording Covid deaths in some states. There have been reports about administrative oversight as well but officials deny the allegation. \n\"We need more transparency in numbers as it helps in managing the situation and also clearly tells you how severe the situation is,\" Mr Bhan adds. \nIndia on 25 March announced that a new variant of the coronavirus had been detected from samples collected from different states.\nVirologist Shahid Jameel explained that a \"double mutation in key areas of the virus's spike protein may make the virus more infectious and allow it to escape the immune system\".\nHe says the change in the virus is the only \"logical explanation\" behind the surge. Health officials in the UK are now investigating whether a double mutant spreads more easily and evades vaccines. \nAs things stand there is still not enough evidence to determine any causal relationship with India's deadly second wave, and the variant is not currently listed by Public Health England as a \"variant of concern\" - a term used to describe the UK, Brazilian and South African variants.\nDr Jameel adds that India started looking at mutations \"fairly late\". \"By December, India had done genome sequencing of only 5,000 samples. It wasn't a concentrated effort.\"\nIn January, India put together a group of labs to speed up sequencing and these labs started functioning in February. \"But unfortunately, the second wave started and the vision of sequencing roughly 5% of the total samples did not come through.\"\nSequencing becomes important in a pandemic as it allows scientists to monitor changes in the virus. \"If you can catch a more infectious variant early on in a region, you can quickly put in public health measures to stop it from spreading wider in the community,\" he explains.\nBut it's \"never too late\" to take measures. \"We need to strengthen safety protocols and rapidly vaccinate people, and also keep an eye on mutations. If we do all this, we could reduce numbers significantly.\""

      "tags": "Victoria,Melbourne,Australia",
      "text": "An Australian man has received a 10-month jail sentence for filming and mocking police officers as they lay dying at a crash scene.\nLast month Richard Pusey pleaded guilty to the rare charge of outraging public decency, as well as other offences.\nThe 42-year-old has already been in custody for nearly 300 days, so he will probably complete his sentence within days.\nThe sentencing judge called his actions \"heartless, cruel and disgraceful\".\nStill, families of the victims were disappointed with the length of the sentence in a case that has stirred huge public anger. \nLast month, Judge Trevor Wraight said the media had demonised Pusey to the point where he was \"probably the most hated man in Australia\".\nThe mortgage broker had been speeding in his car on a Melbourne freeway last year when he was pulled over by four officers. \nWhile they were making his arrest, all four were struck by a lorry that had veered out of its lane.\nSenior Constables Lynette Taylor and Kevin King, and Constables Glen Humphris and Josh Prestney died at the scene.\nPusey had been standing a few metres away and avoided the crash, but afterwards pulled out his phone and began filming numerous videos, some of which ran for more than three minutes.\nThe court had heard that Pusey stood over and taunted Senior Constable Taylor as she remained pinned under the lorry. Experts said she was most likely still alive at the time.\n\"There you go. Amazing, absolutely amazing,\" he said, according to vision from the constable's body-worn camera which was tendered to a court.\n\"All I wanted was to go home and have some sushi,\" he added, before using expletives to blame the officers for ruining his Porsche sports car.\nHe fled the scene on Melbourne's Eastern Freeway shortly after. The next day he was arrested at his home and initially charged with speeding, drug possession and reckless conduct offences.\nHowever, police then also discovered Pusey's video and that he had shared it among friends.\nThe lorry driver, Mohinder Singh, was jailed earlier this month to 22 years for the deaths. \nA court found that the truck driver had been high on drugs, suffering delusions and hallucinations, and driving erratically when he ploughed his truck into the officers.\nOn Wednesday, Judge Wraight condemned Pusey's behaviour while noting he was only being sentenced for his actions. Pusey hadn't caused the deaths of the officers, contrary to some public opinion, the judge said. \n\"Your conduct in recording the police officers in their dying moments, together with the words you used as you recorded, was not only derogatory and horrible... but it was also callous and reprehensible conduct,\" Judge Wraight said.\nHe noted that Pusey had a history of mental health problems, including a complex personality disorder \"which may go some way to explaining your behaviour\". But he said it did not excuse his actions. \nPusey had previously testified he felt ashamed about the videos and that he often said offensive things \"because that's how [it] comes out of my head\".\nPusey was also fined A$1,000 (\u00a3557; $774), put on a two-year good behaviour bond, and had his drivers licence suspended. \nFamilies and supporters of the police officers criticised the sentence after it was handed down in Victoria's County Court.\nStuart Schulze, the husband of Constable Taylor, said he felt \"almost unbearable\" pain every time he remembered how his wife was treated in her final moments.\n\"This sentence is totally inappropriate of this offending,\" Mr Schulze told reporters outside court. He argued it was the court's duty to \"set the appropriate standard\" in penalising such behaviour.\nThe offence of outraging public decency has rarely been prosecuted in Australia, and the charge carries no set penalty.\nThe head of Victoria state's police union also criticised the sentence.\n\"Four upstanding heroes died on that day and\u2026 one soulless coward lived,\" Wayne Gatt said."

      "tags": "DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "Arlene Foster's future as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party remains in doubt on Wednesday as she faces a heave from within her own party.\nA letter of no confidence in Mrs Foster, who is also first minister, has been circulated among DUP MPs and MLAs. \nThe party said it would not be commenting.\nIt is understood there is majority support among the party's Stormont and Westminster ranks - about 80% -  for a change in leadership.\nIt is believed 22 of the party's 27 MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and four MPs have so far signed the letter.   \nOnly a small number of the DUP membership - MLAs and MPs - will get to vote in a leadership contest.\nMrs Foster has endured a turbulent time as DUP leader and the fall-out from Brexit - which the party supported - has put particular pressure on the party's top brass as it faces having to weather the storm caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposed a border down the Irish Sea. \nIt has also been suggested that recent changes to NI's abortion laws and the commitment to implement an Irish language act were causing concerns with some elected DUP representatives ahead of next year's assembly election. \nShe has not commented on the leadership move since Tuesday, but on Wednesday afternoon she tweeted to say she had visited a primary school in her constituency.\nIn addition, a letter was sent from DUP councillors to the party chairman, Lord Morrow, stating they were \"severely worried\" about the state of the party and country and calling for Mrs Foster and deputy leader Lord Dodds to resign. \n\"We as councillors and as members are deeply concerned about the future of unionism, Ulster conservatism and the DUP,\" the letter states.\n\"As members and councillors, we have received the brunt of the anger from our voter base caused by ineffective leadership.\"\nA separate letter from councillors in Lisburn and Castlereagh Council states the current party leadership \"no longer enjoys the confidence of the party membership , the majority of DUP elected representatives and most importantly the unionist people\".\nThe group lists a number of issues which have caused them concern, ranging from the NI Protocol, abortion legislation, same sex marriage, policing and the recent gay conversion debate at Stormont. \nArlene Foster is, in a sense, backed into a corner. We are waiting to hear how she is going to respond to this crisis of leadership in the party. \nOur understanding is that Lord Morrow, the DUP chairman, has not yet received the letter of no confidence in Mrs Foster. He has to be handed the piece of paper. It can't be sent electronically.\nLord Morrow is in London at present but is due home on Thursday. He will be handed the letter then and is planning to meet Mrs Foster on Thursday night. \nThat's not to say that Mrs Foster might not act herself and come out with her own statement on her future. \nIt may well be the easy part to remove Mrs Foster from her position. \nThe more challenging role for the DUP is to try to plot a way out of this and try to find a course to bring the party back together again.\nIt is unchartered waters for the party. \nNormally the party has a vacancy filled before a vacancy arises. Now it finds itself sharply looking at the prospect of having a vacancy, but without anyone to fill it. \nMrs Foster was elected as the first female leader of the DUP in December 2015, taking over from Peter Robinson. She was the only candidate. \nHer time at the helm has been seen many challenges, having faced Brexit, a botched green energy scandal which subsequently led to the collapse of Stormont for three years and Covid-19.\nThe aftermath of Brexit has also caused friction both internally and between the party and some of its core voters who are unhappy at the deal which led to the Irish Sea border.\nThe DUP has argued that it has never supported the Northern Ireland protocol and has actively tried to have it overthrown.\nFor some time there have been rumblings of discontent, but Mrs Foster's internal enemies have lacked the numbers, or the courage, to act against her. \nEarlier on Tuesday, Mrs Foster played down suggestions her leadership of the party was under threat. \nIt followed a report in the Belfast News Letter, which said there was internal party unrest over her leadership. \nBut Mrs Foster said stories on leadership \"come up from time to time\".\n\"So we'll just deal with it and move on because I've bigger things to do, including getting us through this Covid pandemic, including listening to the concerns of working-class communities,\" she said. \nMrs Foster posted a biblical verse from the Book of Psalms on her private Facebook page on Tuesday evening: \"It is God who arms me with strength and keeps my way secure\".\nPossible contenders to replace Mrs Foster include NI Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson. \nThere has been speculation of a split role, with one person for first minister and then a party leader at Westminster.\nMrs Foster has represented the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency since 2003.\nIn a statement, the DUP said on Tuesday it would not be commenting.\n\"Whilst understanding that there will be from time-to-time public interest in party processes, these issues, in the first instance, are matters for members of the party and we are not able to make any further comment at this time,\" it said. \nMeanwhile a planned North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting on agriculture did not go ahead on Wednesday after DUP minister Edwin Poots indicated he would not be taking part. \nMr Poots was due to chair the meeting.\nThe NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nThe DUP has been criticised for not attending previous NSMC meetings, with claims it is boycotting some NSMC meetings due to their opposition to post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland.\nMrs Foster has said this was not the case, although she has said North-South relationships will be affected by the NI Protocol. \nOn Wednesday, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill described Mr Poots' decision not to attend the NSMC meeting as \"hare-brained antics\". \nCharlie McConalogue, the Irish agriculture minister, said he was disappointed at the move, while Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said \"targeting\" north-south relations was counterproductive.  \nDUP rules say a leadership election should be called by 30 April. Normally this is simply a formality and the existing leader continues in their role, but other candidates are free to challenge them.\nOnly a small number of party members are eligible to vote in such a contest - MPs and NI Assembly members (MLAs). There are 27 MLAs that hold the party whip - including Mrs Foster - and eight MPs.\nParty rules currently state the leader of the party must be an MLA, but there has been talk of changing this rule to allow an MP to hold the role.\nThe role of first minister is separate, but as the largest party from the largest grouping (unionism) in the assembly, the DUP is entitled to nominate someone to hold the post of first minister.\nIf Mrs Foster stepped down as first minister, the DUP would then be asked to nominate a replacement within seven days and a vote would be held in the assembly.\nIf a replacement is not nominated, then the Northern Ireland secretary is obliged to call an assembly election. \nThe New Decade, New Approach deal, which was signed in January 2020 and restored the NI Assembly after a three-year hiatus, included a commitment to extend the time to appoint a new first or deputy first minister after a resignation from seven days to six weeks.\nHowever, this has not yet been legislated for.\nA UK government spokesperson told the BBC that \"good progress\" was being made with the legislation and it will be brought forward during the second parliamentary session.\nThe turmoil in the DUP is being watched in Brussels.\nThe European Commission would dearly love unionist leaders to reach some sort of pragmatic accommodation with the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nIn fact, Arlene Foster was edging towards that position until the Article 16 controversy at the end of January, when EU moved to introduce controls on vaccines made in the bloc, including to Northern Ireland, amid a row about delivery shortfalls.\nIt quickly reversed its decision following condemnation in London, Dublin and Belfast. \nSince then, unionist attitudes have hardened. There is no way an aspirant DUP leader is now going to make the case for living with a reformed Protocol.\nOne of the favourites to replace Mrs Foster has had a role in implementing the Protocol.\nEdwin Poots is Northern Ireland agriculture minister and it is his department which operates the Irish Sea border posts.\nBut Mr Poots has been assiduous in leaving a paper trail which shows that at every stage that implementation has only happened under orders from ministers in London."

      "text": "About 1.5 million homes in the UK still do not have internet access, a report by Ofcom has found.\nThe regulator has released its annual snapshot of online and media habits in the UK, which this year spans all three lockdowns.\nIt found 20% of children did not always have access to a device for online learning while schools were closed.\nOfcom said in total 6% of the homes had no internet access at all, at the time the study was carried out last month. \nThere were also 1% of adults aged over 18 who had internet access but chose not to use it.\nThose without access were most likely to be either people aged over 65, or households with low incomes or financial vulnerability.\nAmong children, tablets were the most popular device for five to 15-year-olds in 2020, although 91% of 12 to 15-year-olds had their own smartphones. It was also found that 48% of three to four-year-old pre-schoolers had their own tablets.\nJust over half of 12 to 15-year-olds said they had had a negative experience online in the past year, with the most common being someone they didn't know trying to befriend them.\nSix out of 10 five to 15-year-olds said they made their own videos online and nearly half said they watched content on TikTok. \n\"We have seen a big rise in the use of TikTok during last year particularly among girls,\" said Yih-Choung Teh, strategy and research group director at Ofcom.\n\"The perception among adults is that it's focused on younger people but adults have increasingly taken up TikTok as well.\"\nAccording to Ofcom, 21% of its adult social media users had TikTok profiles, although Facebook was the most popular overall with 83% of the adults in the study having a presence on the platform.\nGaming also became increasingly popular during lockdown, with 62% of adults and seven out of 10 five to 15-year-olds playing online games.\nThe campaign group Which? said it was very concerned about those who were getting left behind.\n\"It is vital that more is done to address this digital divide and ensure all consumers are able to access broadband connectivity, particularly as new networks roll out across the UK,\" said Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy. \nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown, whose Alliance for Full Employment has released its own report on the digital divide, called for a national digital plan from the government and Ofcom.\n\"We have a generation that has lost out for more than a year on the education that they need, and will lose out when it comes to workforce qualifications, job prospects, and then income,\" he told the BBC.\n\"So we've got to heal this digital divide. And I think the government's got to act pretty quickly.\"\nGood news - the year of the pandemic has seen a big fall in the number of homes without any internet connection as the need for services only available online has become more acute.\nBad news - those who are still living without the internet find themselves even more disadvantaged than before. And that applies particularly to children. While hardly any now live in homes without any internet connection, a substantial minority had either poor and expensive connections via mobile phones or devices that were inappropriate for online schooling.\nThis digital divide became a hot political issue during lockdown and there will be continued pressure on the government to make sure children have the digital tools they need.\nBut this report also shows that children are providing a forecast of where our media habits are heading.\nIt's a future dominated by video-on-demand and video sharing services such as YouTube and TikTok, with plenty of them creating content rather than being just passive consumers. However, broadcast TV was less and less of a habit - even in lockdown, it seems, fewer families were gathering on the sofa for a big TV moment.\nBut while there are concerns about the dangers in this era of ultra connectivity - half of 12 to 15-year-olds had had a negative online experience such as being contacted by a stranger - there are also signs that this generation is pretty clued up about how the online world works.\nThey were not far behind adults in recognising which results in Google searches were ads, and probably more savvy in realising that when an Instagram influencer plugs a product they are being paid for that."

      "text": "Democratic Unionist Party politicians are being asked to sign a letter of no-confidence in leader Arlene Foster, the BBC understands.\nThe letter is being circulated among Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MPs and Northern Ireland Assembly members.\nThe party said it would not be commenting.\nOne assembly member told the BBC he was presented with the motion on Mrs Foster, who is NI's first minister, but declined to say if he signed it.\nIt is understood 22 MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and four MPs have already signed the letter. \nIf this is the case, there is majority support within the party for a change in leadership.\nIt is only a small number of the DUP membership who will get to vote in a leadership contest - its 27 MLAs and eight MPs.\nIn addition, a letter has been sent from DUP councillors to the party chairman, Lord Morrow, stating they were \"severely worried\" about the state of the party and country and calling for Mrs Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds to resign. \n\"We as councillors and as members are deeply concerned about the future of unionism, Ulster conservatism and the DUP,\" the letter states.\n\"As members and councillors, we have received the brunt of the anger from our voter base caused by ineffective leadership.\"\nMrs Foster was elected as the first female leader of the DUP in December 2015, taking over from Peter Robinson. She had been the only candidate. \nHer time at the helm has been turbulent, having faced Brexit, which her party supported, a botched green energy scandal which subsequently led to the collapse of Stormont for three years and of course Covid-19.\nBut the fall-out from the UK's EU exit has put particular pressure on the party top brass as it faces having to weather the storm caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposes a border down the Irish Sea. \nThe party has argued that it has never supported the protocol and has actively tried to have it overthrown.\nIt has also been suggested that recent changes to NI's abortion laws, and the commitment to implement an Irish language act were causing concerns with some elected DUP representatives ahead of next year's assembly election. \nFor some time there have been rumblings of discontent, but Mrs Foster's internal enemies have lacked the numbers, or the courage, to act against her. \nEarlier, Mrs Foster played down suggestions her leadership of the party was under threat. \nIt followed a report in the Belfast News Letter, which said there was internal party unrest over her leadership. \nBut Mrs Foster said stories on leadership \"come up from time to time\".\n\"So we'll just deal with it and move on because I've bigger things to do, including getting us through this Covid pandemic, including listening to the concerns of working-class communities,\" she said. \nArlene Foster's leadership appears to be hanging by a thread.\nThe very fact her opponents within the party felt the time was right to ask MLAs to sign up and be counted is very telling.\nIt is a bold and unprecedented move within the DUP.\nBut even with that process under way, the DUP leader was adamant there was nothing to see here, telling reporters earlier these stories come up from \"time to time\".\nShe said she would deal with it and move on because she had bigger things to do, including fighting a pandemic.\nDoes dealing \"with it\" include facing down those within her party who want her out?\nIt all comes down to a numbers game as the party's elected representatives are invited to take sides.\nEarly indications suggest it may not end well for Mrs Foster.\nRead more here.\nMrs Foster has represented the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency since 2003.\nThe DUP said it would not be commenting.\n\"Whilst understanding that there will be from time-to-time public interest in party processes, these issues, in the first instance, are matters for members of the party and we are not able to make any further comment at this time,\" it said. \nMrs Foster was due to meet Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis on Tuesday evening but that has been cancelled.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "An extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine have been ordered by the UK government as it puts together plans for a vaccination booster programme in the autumn.\nIt brings the total number of Pfizer doses ordered by the UK to 100 million. \nThe expectation is that the most vulnerable groups will be offered another jab before next winter.\nNearly two-thirds of UK adults have received one dose of a Covid vaccine with a quarter having had two.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street briefing the booster programme would \"keep us safe and free here while we get this disease under control across the world\". \nThe government said the additional Pfizer jabs will be used alongside other Covid vaccines for the booster programme.\nIt is one of three jabs authorised for use in the UK, alongside the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and one made by the US firm Moderna.\nThe announcement comes as new data from Public Health England showed that one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine reduces household transmission of the virus by up to half.\nMr Hancock said this was the \"first concrete evidence\" of how vaccines reduced the transmission of the virus. \nA further 29 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test in the UK, according to the latest government figures, taking the total by that measure to 127,480.\nA further 2,166 lab-confirmed cases were reported on Wednesday.\nThese extra supplies are not about speeding up rollout now - they are an insurance policy ahead of next winter to ensure the UK has enough supplies to offer people a booster jab.\nBut there is still much to be resolved about such a programme. \nWho will get it, whether it will be given at the same time as the flu jab and how many doses will be needed has still to be decided.\nBut perhaps the biggest question of all is whether the current vaccines will need to be tweaked to tackle the new variants.\nThese extra Pfizer doses will be the same as the current jab that is being rolled out - although if a new version of the jab is made the UK could get that.\nThe deal done for one of the other vaccines on order - CureVac - is specifically aimed at new variants. \nBut even that may not be needed. Despite all the focus on new variants, there are still plenty of reasons to think the current vaccines will offer good protection.\nIt is why any booster programme is only likely to be aimed at the most vulnerable.\nMr Hancock said the vaccination programme was \"bringing back our freedom\", but warned the biggest risk to that progress was the \"risk posed by a new variant\". \nHe said the UK had been working on plans for a booster programme for more than a year.\nOverall, the UK has secured access to 517 million doses of eight different vaccines. \nIncluding first and second doses, more than 47.5 million vaccinations have been given since the start of December. \nThe overwhelming majority are Pfizer or AstraZeneca, as the Moderna jab has only recently begun to be used.\nThe UK regulator is currently assessing both the Janssen and Novavax vaccines, which have gone through successful clinical trials. Trials are ongoing for the Valneva, GSK-Sanofi and CureVac jabs.\nMr Hancock said the \"harrowing pictures\" of the coronavirus situation in India were \"a stark reminder that this isn't over yet\" but said the UK was sending packages of support, in the form of ventilators and oxygen concentrators.\nThe health secretary said \"we don't have any excess doses of vaccine in the UK at the moment\" but said the country stood \"side-by-side\" with India.\nHe said the additional Pfizer jabs were a forward order and had not been manufactured yet, but added the UK had worked closely with India to ensure it got the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab at cost.\nProf Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, told the briefing the UK was close to the \"bottom level\" of coronavirus.\n\"We are really in very low levels that are comparable to where we were in September last year,\" he said.\nMr Hancock added that, while officials would continue to monitor the data, England remained \"on track for step three\" of the government's roadmap for exiting lockdown on 17 May.\nBut Prof Van-Tam said while vaccines could reduce a third wave of coronavirus, it was \"inconceivable\" that there will not be further bumps in the road.\n\"The modelling consensus is clear, we will have what's called a third wave,\" he said, but he added he was hopeful it \"might just be a third upsurge and much less significant\" due to the vaccine rollout.\nDr Nikki Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the \"momentum\" of the vaccine programme was continuing as people aged 42 and over in England have been invited to book their jab.\nMr Hancock, who is 42, said he was \"delighted\" he would be receiving his first vaccine on Thursday and encouraged others to book theirs.\nThe government has set a target of offering a first shot to all adults in the UK by the end of July.\nVaccine invitations in Scotland have opened to over-45s and unpaid carers aged 16 to 64 can also register for a jab.\nThe Welsh government says people aged 40 and over are being offered vaccines while in Northern Ireland people aged 35 and over are now eligible."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Pfizer,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The most common side effects of the Covid-19 vaccines are pain or tenderness at the injection site - in other words, a sore arm - a UK study has suggested. \nRoughly one in four people had wider effects like fever, headache, nausea and fatigue.\nBut these only lasted on average for one day.\nResearchers involved in the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app saw fewer reactions than were seen in clinical trials. \nConfidence in the vaccines has continued to grow since the end of last year, with more than 80% saying they believe the vaccines are safe and effective, compared with about 70% who said the same towards the end of 2020, according to a survey of 5,000 people.\nThe survey, run in association with the National Institute for Health Research, found twice as many people say they want to have the vaccine as soon as possible - although the number of people saying they would actively prefer the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has fallen.\nThe ZOE study researchers looked at self-reported symptoms in 627,383 people using their app in the eight days after being vaccinated. \nAbout 70% of people having the Pfizer jab had some reaction around where the needle went in, including pain, tenderness, redness or swelling, compared with just under 60% for the AstraZeneca jab. \nThe trend was reversed for those reactions that affect the whole body rather than just the site of the injection.\nFor the AstraZeneca jab, 34% had some \"systemic\" (whole body) reaction like headache, tiredness or chills. For the Pfizer vaccine this was only 14% after the first dose and 22% after the second. \nThe most common of these side effects was a headache. \nThe study's lead scientist, Prof Tim Spector of King's College London, said these findings should reassure people the after effects of the vaccine are \"usually mild and short-lived\".\nBut he pointed out there was a wide range of responses to the vaccine, just as there was to the virus, depending on age and sex among other things. \nThe study did not look at what happened after a second dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab since hardly anyone had received it at the time of the study, which went up to 10 March. \nAmong all vaccinated users of the ZOE symptom app, one in four (25%) had one of these whole body reactions and two-thirds (66%) had a local reaction.\nWomen, people under 55 and those who had a Covid infection in the past were all more likely to experience side effects.\nIn the final stage of the Pfizer vaccine's clinical trials, roughly 77% of people had pain at the injection site compared with just under 30% in this study, while the proportion of people experiencing fatigue and headache was three to five times smaller. \nFor AstraZeneca, roughly half as many people had a whole body reaction like fever or fatigue as was recorded in clinical trials.\nThis may be because people in the clinical trials were younger and healthier, or because people enrolled in the trial of an experimental vaccine might be more nervous and so more likely to identify symptoms, Prof Spector suggested. \nDr Cristina Menni from King's College London, lead author of the paper, said the results supported the safety of both vaccines and should \"help allay safety concerns of people willing to get vaccinated\"."

      "text": "Boris Johnson will face MPs in the Commons as he battles accusations from Labour that he lied over who paid for renovations to his Downing Street flat.\nThe PM will appear at Prime Minister's Questions for the first time since his ex-adviser accused him of planning for donors to \"secretly pay\" for the work.\nA No 10 spokesman has refused to say whether Mr Johnson initially received a loan to cover the costs.\nLabour have demanded a detailed explanation from the prime minister.\nWhile it is not against the rules to receive donations, politicians must declare them so the public can see who has given them money and whether it has had any influence on their decisions.\nMr Johnson has told reporters any relevant donations would be declared \"in due course\".\nAnd his spokesman said the costs \"have been met by the prime minister personally\".\nBut No 10 has not yet made clear exactly how the works were paid for in the first place and declined to say whether the prime minister received a loan from the Conservative Party.\nMr Johnson is also likely to be asked at Prime Minister's Questions about accusations he said he would rather see \"bodies pile high\" than approve a third lockdown.\nThe Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the prime minister \"should resign\" if he did make such a comment.\nSir Ed described the reported remark, that the PM denies ever making, as \"some of the most callous comments\" a prime minister has ever made and said that Mr Johnson \"needs to be held to account for his actions and his words\".\nThe comment was first reported in the Daily Mail - but later, the BBC and ITV separately reported sources confirming Mr Johnson did make the remarks.\nHowever, No 10 strongly denied he said the phrase, and the PM described the reports as \"total rubbish\".\nA Downing Street spokesman did not deny that Mr Johnson said he would rather let coronavirus \"rip\" than impose tighter restrictions. \nQuestions over the prime minister's flat were triggered when his former aide Dominic Cummings detailed his own take on Mr Johnson's plans in a blog published on his website.\nLike many previous prime ministers, Mr Johnson chose to live in the flat above No 11 Downing Street rather than the smaller apartment in No 10.\nPrime ministers are given \u00a330,000 to spend on renovating their new home. However, it has been reported that Mr Johnson's changes cost up to \u00a3200,000.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said any loans or donations to cover the costs \"should have been declared by now\".\n\"We really need to know who's given the loan, who's given the money, because we need to know who the prime minister...is beholden to,\" he said.\n\"To be honest he lied yesterday - that's not good enough.\"\nAsked about possible donations, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"There will be a Cabinet Office report when they put out their annual accounts and everyone will be able to see exactly what happened.\"\nMr Johnson's spokesman has said the prime minister had \"acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law\".\nOn Monday, Cabinet Secretary Mr Case - the UK's most senior civil servant - told MPs the prime minister had asked him to review how the refurbishment of the No 11 flat was funded.\nSir Ed has written to Mr Case asking him to reveal the details \"as a matter of urgency\". \nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Shapps, defended donors being asked to help fund projects, saying \"a lot of people want to ensure the country is able to keep its buildings and national monuments in good shape\". \nHe said that because Downing Street is a place of work and the prime minister's living accommodation, Mr Johnson found himself in the situation of \"living above the shop\".\nHe added that he believed it was a good idea to \"look at whether there ought to be some sort of national set-up, a foundation or something else to look after that in the interests of future generations\".  \nAlso on Today, the columnist Sarah Vine, who is married to the Cabinet Office Minister, Michael Gove, backed the idea of a trust to fund refurbishment work.\nShe said the prime minister \"can't be expected to live in a skip\" and if he wants \"a pink sofa instead of a green sofa that's a perfectly reasonable thing for him to want\"."

      "text": "A commission of 10 of the UK's most powerful executives from firms including Tesco, Vodafone and Astra Zeneca has set out its plan for a post-pandemic economic recovery. \nIt hopes the biggest crisis in over 300 years will reset the relationship between business and government to boost growth and living standards.\nIt also wants more done to support UK suppliers and fight social inequality.\nTesco chair John Allan said it went beyond \"purely economic measures\".\nHe told the BBC: \"The pandemic has ensured that those who were worst off to start with have suffered more than those who were relatively well off, so that gap between the comfortably off and the less comfortably off has grown.\"\nDeprived communities exist across the UK, he said. \"They're not just in the north, the Midlands, there are an awful lot of socially deprived communities in London, for example, as well. \n\"And the view of the business people who've got together for the infrastructure commission was we needed to solve not only for growth but also to try and ensure that at least some of that growth was used to remedy this widening social inequality we're experiencing.\" \nThe Covid Recovery Commission calls for the creation of at least one new globally competitive industry hub in every part of the UK by 2030.\nIt also wants to see a radical overhaul of the Apprenticeship Levy with the establishment of \u00a310,000 lifelong training allowance for all over-25s and a detailed plan for the decarbonisation of homes over the next 15 years.\nThe relationship between business and government was tested during the Brexit years. Both sides are keen to move on from the prime minister's memorable four letter dismissal of business concerns over splitting from the UK's biggest trade partner.  \nAre you happy about a possible return to the office or workplace?  Share your experiences.\nThe authors agree with the assessment that this is a moment to kiss and make up. \nMr Allan said: \"I don't think anybody should hold any remarks about business in the past against anyone concerned. \n\"I think government has changed, business has changed enormously. There's been this growth of the need for business to be purposeful, the need for stakeholder focus not just shareholder focus, so business is ready, I think government is ready. \n\"I think it's bipartisan. We've shared our conclusions with the shadow cabinet as well as with ministers and seen a lot of interest and support in it, so I think we're at a point in history where this could be made to happen.\" \nThe truth is that the business community is still trying to figure out how this particular Conservative government sees the role of business. \nOver many decades Conservative Party orthodoxy has generally been to set tax levels as low as affordable to the public purse, regulation as light as sensible and let the job and wealth creators get on with it. \nThe argument was that lower taxes would encourage more company formation, more taxable job creation and that would translate to healthy tax receipts and lower benefit bills.\nBusiness leaders generally welcomed this approach in the past. \nAt the last budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled plans to reverse over a decade of tax-lowering measures at a stroke by increasing corporation tax to 25% in 2023, saying he needed to be honest with the challenges to the public finances. \nThe Covid Recovery Commission report says the UK also needs to conduct an honest assessment of where its strengths and weaknesses lie, double down on strengths, and help workers migrate from sectors with a less promising future. \nHowever, the report does not detail which sectors fall into that category - a tacit admission of how politically difficult some of these \"honest\" conversations may prove.\nThe government says that although it has officially abolished the idea and the label of a specific \"industrial strategy\" (a move privately lamented by the authors of this report) it remains committed to a new partnership with business to \"build back better\". It doesn't matter what you call it. \nA statement from the business department said: \"Our Plan for Growth will deliver significant public investment in the infrastructure, skills and innovation that businesses need to grow and thrive, and we will continue to build an enterprise economy that spreads opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.\""

      "text": "Arlene Foster has announced her resignation as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and as NI first minister after an internal revolt.\nMrs Foster, 50, said she would step down as DUP leader on 28 May and as first minister at the end of June.\nMore than 20 DUP NI Assembly members and four MPs signed a letter voicing no-confidence in the leadership.\nMrs Foster said it had been the privilege of her life to serve the people of Northern Ireland.  \nShe became leader of the party in December 2015 and, the following month as leader of Stormont's largest party, she was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland.\nShe was the first woman and the youngest person to hold both jobs.\nMrs Foster said it had been the privilege of her life to \"serve the people of Northern Ireland as their first minister and to represent my home constituency of Fermanagh/South Tyrone\".\n\"My election as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party broke a glass ceiling and I am glad to have inspired other women to enter politics and spurred them on to take up elected office,\" Mrs Foster said. \n\"I understand the misogynistic criticisms that female public figures have to take and sadly it's the same for all women in public life.\n\"I want to encourage you to keep going and don't let the online lynch mobs get you down.\"\nIt is understood there is majority support among the party's Stormont and Westminster ranks - about 80% -  for a change in leadership.\nIt is believed 22 of the DUP's 27 MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and four MPs signed a letter of no confidence in Mrs Foster and the party leadership. \nOnly a small number of the DUP membership - MLAs and MPs - will get to vote in a leadership contest.\nIf there is a leadership contest, it will be the first in the DUP's 50-year history. \nMrs Foster said it was important to give space over the coming weeks for the party officers to make arrangements for the election of a new leader.\nMrs Foster has endured a turbulent time as DUP leader and the fall-out from Brexit - which the party supported - has put particular pressure on the party's top brass as it faces having to weather the storm caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposed a border down the Irish Sea. \nIt has also been suggested recent changes to NI's abortion laws and the commitment to implement an Irish language act were causing concerns with some elected DUP representatives ahead of next year's assembly election. \nThis was inevitable. It was just a question of time. \nWith those numbers against her, there was no way Arlene Foster could hang on. \nShe did not want to go, and if there was a way she could have stayed, she would have stayed. \nBut I imagine she is pretty sad tonight. I know Arlene Foster well. She loved being party leader, she loved being first minister. It's been bruising at times, it's been tough. \nThe DUP, at the minute, looks like a very difficult party to lead. \nWhoever takes over has a Herculean task to get things back on track.\nMrs Foster said she was \"the first to recognise there have been ups and downs over the last five and a half years\" of her leadership. \n\"The 2016 assembly election result and our party's best ever Westminster result in 2017 stand out among the high points when the electorate sent a clear message that they wanted to keep Northern Ireland moving forward,\" she said. \nMrs Foster added that as she prepared to \"depart the political stage\", Northern Ireland would only prosper if built on the \"foundations of successful and durable devolution\".\nIn a social media post, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked Arlene Foster for her \"dedication to the people of Northern Ireland\" and said he hoped she stayed in public service \"for years to come\".\nIn November 2018, Mr Johnson gave the keynote speech at the DUP's annual conference, in which he said the UK must \"junk the backstop\", referring to efforts in the Brexit negotiations to avoid a hard Irish border.\nThis was met with rapturous applause, however, relations would later sour between Mr Johnson and Mrs Foster after he became prime minister when the Brexit deal imposed checks and restrictions to Irish Sea trade.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis also paid tribute to Mrs Foster as a \"truly dedicated public servant\" and said young women in particular would be inspired by her example to follow a path into politics.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - the joint head of the Northern Ireland government along with Mrs Foster - said the incoming DUP leader should recognise that the political landscape across the island had changed.\n\"The broad community are impatient for social reform and political change which reflects a modern and progressive society where everyone can feel that they belong on an equal basis,\" she said. \nMs O'Neill said she and Mrs Foster had a decent if challenging relationship. She said they had worked well together through the Covid pandemic.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney tweeted his best wishes to Mrs Foster.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood also extended his best wishes to the outgoing first minister. \n\"We disagree on almost everything but she has clearly been a committed servant to her party for a long time,\" he said. \nUlster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said her departure demonstrated how difficult a life in politics could be. \nHe said there was now a place for a \"progressive and modern approach to unionism\".\nTraditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said it was a difficult day for Mrs Foster, adding he had found her \"straightforward\" in his dealings with her. \nMrs Foster was elected as the first female leader of the DUP in December 2015, taking over from Peter Robinson. She was the only candidate. \nHer time at the helm has been seen many challenges, having faced Brexit, a botched green energy scandal which subsequently led to the collapse of Stormont for three years and Covid-19.\nThe aftermath of Brexit has also caused friction both internally and between the party and some of its core voters who are unhappy at the deal which led to the Irish Sea border.\nThe DUP has argued that it has never supported the Northern Ireland protocol and has actively tried to have it overthrown.\nIt was not just MLAs and MPs that voiced their discontent in Mrs Foster. Letters from a number of party councillors were also written, calling for Mrs Foster and deputy leader Lord Dodds to resign. \nA number of issues of concern were listed, ranging from the NI Protocol, abortion legislation, same sex marriage, policing and the recent gay conversion debate at Stormont. \nPossible contenders to replace Mrs Foster include NI Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson. \nThere has been speculation of a split role, with one person for first minister and then a party leader at Westminster.\nMr Poots tweeted that he wanted to thank Mrs Foster for her \"service, sacrifice and commitment to the DUP and country\".\nGavin Robinson thanked Mrs Foster for her \"dedicated service to Northern Ireland\" and said there would be \"more to say about what lies ahead in the days to come\".\nDUP rules say a leadership election should be called by 30 April. \nNormally this is simply a formality and the existing leader continues in their role, but other candidates are free to challenge them.\nOnly a small number of party members are eligible to vote in such a contest - MPs and NI Assembly members (MLAs). There are 27 MLAs that hold the party whip - including Mrs Foster - and eight MPs.\nParty rules currently state the leader of the party must be an MLA, but there has been talk of changing this rule to allow an MP to hold the role.\nThe role of first minister is separate, but as the largest party from the largest grouping (unionism) in the assembly, the DUP is entitled to nominate someone to hold the post of first minister.\nOnce Mrs Foster steps down as first minister, the DUP would then be asked to nominate a replacement within seven days and a vote would be held in the assembly.\nIf a replacement is not nominated, then the Northern Ireland secretary is obliged to call an assembly election. \nThe New Decade, New Approach deal, which was signed in January 2020 and restored the NI Assembly after a three-year hiatus, included a commitment to extend the time to appoint a new first or deputy first minister after a resignation from seven days to six weeks.\nHowever, this has not yet been legislated for.\nA UK government spokesperson told the BBC that \"good progress\" was being made with the legislation and it would be brought forward during the second parliamentary session."

Then there was a lot of sirens about 10 minutes later in the village followed by the Sea King from Portland circling overhead for about 20 minutes.\"\nBoth pilots were said to be safe and well but had been taken to Yeovil District Hospital to be checked over.\nLewis Gaylard, a military aviation journalist and former Sea Vixen team member, said: \"It's a terrible shame what has happened to Sea Fury, VX281 this afternoon. \n\"The best news is that both aircrew are safe, which is the most important. After all the hard work, time and money spent on getting the Fury back into the air, and with an appearance at Shuttleworth scheduled for this coming Sunday, it is a great shame to all involved.\n\"Hopefully there might be a way to repair the damage to the aircraft, but no doubt this will take a considerable amount of money for Navy Wings, which they have very little of.''\nIn July 2014 the Sea Fury crashed at RNAS Culdrose Air Day.\nThe Sea Fury was taking part in the aerobatic display in Cornwall when the plane lost power and crashed on to the runway.\nThe pilot walked away uninjured but the 1944 fighter - one of only three or four in the UK - was badly damaged.\nIt took three years and \u00a3350,000 to restore the plane and get it back in the air."

      "text": "A leading charity has criticised the government's plan to reduce funding for overseas water and sanitation projects during the pandemic - as details of cuts in the foreign aid budget emerge.\nFunding for water, sanitation and hygiene bilateral projects will be cut by more than 80%, a leaked memo said.\nWaterAid's Tim Wainwright criticised the timing of \"savage cuts\".\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office said Covid had \"forced us to take tough\" decisions.\nThe government announced last year it would cut UK aid spending from 0.7% of national income to just 0.5% - which amounts to a reduction of more than \u00a34bn - but has yet to confirm which programmes will be affected.\nThe \"temporary measure\" was defended at the time as being supported by voters, with some MPs saying domestic spending should come first during the pandemic. \nThis is just the start. There are hundreds of cuts to specific aid programmes that are just waiting to be revealed. \nThe government is refusing to say precisely where the axe will fall. That's partly down to precedent - normally these figures are announced retrospectively. \nBut it is also because the Foreign and Development Office has yet to make all the decisions. \nAid charities say the government announced the global cut without remembering it had pre-existing commitments to multilateral funds - like the World Bank, the EU, and the GAVI vaccine alliance. \nThis meant the cuts to bilateral aid funds would have to be even deeper and those decisions are hard. That is why support for programmes that provide water and sanitation or polio eradication is being reduced, even in the midst of a global pandemic. \nMinisters argue they have to cut the budget because of the impact the pandemic has had on the economy - and the UK will still be spending \u00a310bn on aid, more than most countries. \nBut the cuts are now beginning to bite and for some of the most vulnerable people around the world, there will be real consequences. \nThe UK contributed \u00a3176m to bilateral water, sanitation and hygiene projects in 2019 - so an 80% cut would represent a budget of around \u00a336m.\nMr Wainwright said there was \"enormous support\" for funding water projects among UK taxpayers \"who have helped to bring clean water, good hygiene, and better sanitation to 62 million people in the last five years\".\nHe said clean water and sanitation were \"the first line of defence against the twin threats of Covid-19 and the impacts of climate change\" and urged the government to reverse the cuts \"at the earliest possible opportunity\".\nIn the UK, the government has promoted hand-washing as one way the public can protect themselves from contracting coronavirus, including the slogan \"Hands, Face, Space\".\nA review of water aid projects published in March 2012 found \"strong evidence that lack of hygiene (hand-washing) increases the risk of viral respiratory infections\".\nThe leaked memo - prepared for FCDO minister Wendy Morton ahead of a meeting with MPs - predicted there would be concerns about proposed aid cuts for water supply, sanitation and hygiene - known as \"Wash\".\nIt said some MPs \"will be worried about the reduction in the UK's spend on Wash at a time when [global] Covid-19 cases are increasing\" and as the UK prepares to host the COP26 climate change conference in November in Glasgow.\nThe memo added: \"We expect criticism on the reduction in spend, particularly as the UK public views Wash as a priority area for UK aid, because hand hygiene is widely recognised as a critical intervention to counter the spread of Covid-19, and because the cuts are being announced in the year that the UK is hosting COP26.\"\nIn a section titled \"handling advice\", it said the funding reductions for Wash \"add to a pattern of declining UK support to the sector that started in 2019\".\nThe memo defended the timing of the cuts and advised Mrs Morton to \"emphasise the UK's support to hand-washing to help tackle Covid-19 will continue as previously planned\".\nIt said these steps included working with soap maker Unilever, Unicef and other organisations \"to roll out hygiene campaigns in 37 countries\" reaching a billion people to date.\nLast week, 200 charities said in a joint statement that cuts to humanitarian aid by the UK were a \"tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people\".\nAndrew Mitchell, the former international development secretary - and a critic of the aid cuts - said: \"Access to water and sanitation is consistently the UK public's top priority when polled abut what aid should be spent on...\n\"We are balancing the books on the backs of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world and it is a matter of national shame for our country to be slashing spending in this way.\"\nA FCDO statement said: \"We will still spend more than \u00a310 billion this year to fight poverty, tackle climate change and improve global health.\n\"We are working through what this means for individual programmes. Decisions will be announced in due course.\""

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nIndia's death toll due to Covid has now passed the 200,000 mark and it has seen more cases in the past seven days than any other country in the world. People have died waiting for beds, oxygen supplies are running low and hospitals are under immense strain from new patients. Follow the BBC's special day of coverage which includes a man whose wife and unborn child died on the same day.\nJust one dose of a coronavirus vaccine can reduce household transmission of the virus by up to half, a study shows. It's \"encouraging\", says Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, which carried out the research, as households are high-risk settings for transmission. The study found people given a first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines - and who became infected three weeks later - were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus on than unvaccinated people.

Funding for water, sanitation and hygiene bilateral projects will be cut by more than 80%, a leaked memo said. Covid \"forced us to take tough\" decisions, the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office said. WaterAid's Tim Wainwright has criticised the timing of \"savage cuts\".\nA sore arm, or tenderness at the injection site as it is officially described, is the most common side effect of the Covid-19 vaccines, a UK study has suggested.

      "text": "The European Parliament has ratified the post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal - a key move to ensure that tariff- and quota-free trade continues.\nThe Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) has been operating provisionally since January. MEPs voted in favour by 660 votes to 5, while 32 abstained.\nThe UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, said the vote \"brings certainty and allows us to focus on the future\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson spoke of a \"final step in a long journey\".\nThe trade deal provided \"stability to our new relationship with the EU as vital trading partners, close allies and sovereign equals\", he said.\nThe result, announced on Wednesday after a vote late on Tuesday, was also welcomed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\nEarlier Ms von der Leyen said the TCA \"comes with real teeth, with a binding dispute settlement mechanism\". And she warned that the EU would use those teeth if necessary.\nThe parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt described the deal as \"a failure for both sides, but better than nothing\". \nLord Frost's opposite number in the Brexit talks, Michel Barnier, was also less than flattering. \"This is a divorce. It is a warning, Brexit. It's a failure of the European Union and we have to learn lessons from it,\" he told MEPs.\nBrexit tensions remain, including a French threat of \"reprisals\" against the UK over new fishing restrictions. Northern Ireland trade is also a thorny issue.\nUnder a separate protocol, Northern Ireland remains de facto part of the EU's single market, so goods arriving there from Britain have to undergo EU checks. Since Brexit there has been some disruption to that trade.\nThe TCA covers EU-UK trade in goods, but not services. The UK economy is dominated by services - sectors such as banking, insurance, advertising and legal advice.\nThe TCA has still resulted in more paperwork, extra costs and less trade between the two sides, since the UK left the EU.\nA European Parliament resolution described the UK's exit from the EU as \"a historic mistake\".\nAmong the areas not covered by the deal are foreign policy, financial services and student exchanges. \nBefore the MEPs' debate started on Tuesday, French Europe Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune accused the UK of blocking fishing rights. He said the EU could respond with \"reprisals\" in financial services.\n\"The United Kingdom is expecting quite a few authorisations from us for financial services. We won't give any for as long as we don't have guarantees on fishing and other issues,\" he said on French news channel BFMTV.\nFrench fishermen have complained of being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences.\nMeanwhile, British seafood exporters have been hit by an EU ban on UK exports of live shellfish. Scottish firms account for most of that business, and some now face collapse.\nThe UK made fishing rights a key issue in the negotiations, with control over access to its waters seen as a sign of British sovereignty.\nPraising the TCA when it was agreed in December, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said \"we have taken back control of our laws and our destiny\". \nHe described it as \"a deal which will if anything allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends\".\nIn Tuesday's debate, German MEP David McAllister said Brexit \"will always be a lose-lose situation\", but he backed the TCA.\nIt is a 1,400-page deal which was not clinched until 24 December. The Brexit negotiations began in 2017 and the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Common rules remained during the UK's transition period until January 2021.\nAfter nearly four years of difficult negotiations on the UK exit from the EU and the post-Brexit relationship, it's hardly surprising that a few bruises are showing. \nThe TCA certainly hasn't solved everything. There are still big questions to resolve on issues like financial services, for example. \nMonitoring and implementing what has been agreed, in a complex network of committees, will also be a constant feature of the new relationship. \nBut it will take some time before the long-term effect on trade becomes clear. \nTrade volumes fell sharply in January before rebounding in February. But the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex says UK exports to the EU were still down by 17.2% in February compared to an average of February 2018 to 2020. \nA significant part is down to Brexit, although Covid is also a factor. \nThe most prominent post-Brexit issue so far this year, though, isn't part of the TCA itself.  Northern Ireland's trading relationship with the rest of the UK, and with the EU, won't change as a result of this agreement being ratified. \nBoth sides say they are working hard to find practical solutions in Northern Ireland, but some checks on trade between NI and Britain will remain in place. \nThe European Commission has launched legal action, accusing the UK of breaching the agreement on Northern Ireland trade and breaking international law - charges Downing Street denies. \nBrexit also means:"

      "text": "This month is provisionally the frostiest April in the UK for at least 60 years, the Met Office has said.\nApril 2021 has already seen an average of 13 days of air frosts across the UK, beating the previous record of 11 days reported in April 1970. \nNorthern Ireland had eight days of air frosts, while Scotland recorded 16.\nThe Met Office says the conditions have been challenging for farmers and growers and are advising gardeners to keep their tender plants indoors.\nThe records on frosty days go back to 1960.\nThe breakdown of frosty days by UK nation in April is:\nNorthern Ireland's record for frost in April was 11 days in 1983.\nMark McCarthy, from the National Climate Information Centre, said: \"We've been seeing a high frequency of frosts overnight throughout April, thanks largely to persistent clear skies for most. \n\"This will be reflected in the end of the month statistics, which are already showing above average sunshine duration, as well as low minimum temperature readings overnight, with some parts of northern England and Scotland reporting minimum temperatures 3.5\u00b0C lower than the average for April.\"\nBBC Weather's Gemma Plumb said there were a number of reasons for the frosty month but the main one was that high pressure had dominated the weather across the UK for much of April.\n\"High pressure can lead to clear skies overnight and this allows temperatures to fall below zero and brings frosty nights,\" she said. \n\"We have also seen the winds often coming in from the north which brings in colder air and overnight this can lead to cold and frosty nights.\n\"Another reason is that the soil is dry due to this month being drier than average across most of the UK. The dry soil allows for more radiative cooling so more frosts overnight.\"\nThe frosty conditions have been challenging for gardeners and farmers with Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society, saying that flowers such as camellia and magnolias had been \"scorched\" while cherry, plum and pear blossom had been injured so the \"fruit crop will be reduced\".\nIt is a marked contrast to last month when parts of the UK enjoyed the second warmest March day on record with temperatures hitting 24.5C (76.1F).\nAt the start of April temperatures plummeted over the Easter weekend and there was some snow in Scotland as well as parts of England."

      "tags": "Tate Modern,Northolt,Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council,Autism",
      "text": "A teenager who threw a six-year-old from the 10th floor of the Tate Modern had a history of violent behaviour.\nA serious case review found that Jonty Bravery had expressed a desire to hurt people prior to the attack in 2019.\nThe review blamed an undiagnosed personality disorder for the offence, and found professionals failed to distinguish \"callous\" traits from behaviours linked to Bravery's autism.\nIt called for \"critical lessons\" to be translated into action.\nIt highlighted a series of troubling incidents involving Bravery in the two years before the attack, including threatening to kill members of the public and putting faeces in his mother's make-up brushes.\nBut his violent behaviour had been less frequent in the period before the Tate Modern attack, while he was living in a placement with two-to-one care funded by Hammersmith and Fulham Borough Council and the NHS clinical commissioning group (CCG).\nThe report says: \"There was no recent evidence that he presented a risk to other children or adults unknown to him.\n\"It was in this context that he was progressively given more freedoms, which saw him able to visit central London unaccompanied on the day of the incident.\"\nOn 4 August 2019, Bravery made his way to the Tate Modern's viewing balcony where CCTV footage showed him following young children and looking over railings.\nHe then threw the six-year-old from the viewing platform and he fell 100ft (30m), suffering a bleed to the brain, and  other injuries, including fractures to his spine.\nBravery, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of five, was jailed for 15 years in June for attempted murder.\nThe review, by the Local Safeguarding Children Partnership (LSCP), highlights a national shortage of specialist and residential community care for children and young people with complex and high-risk behaviours.\nBravery spent various periods of time being moved from psychiatric intensive care units, specialist residential schools and hotels from the age of 15 as his behaviour became more troubling.\nHis parents thought this detrimental to his mental health, the report says.\nHis father told the review he felt \"frustrated\" at the apparent lack of expertise among private care providers dealing with his son.\nBBC special correspondent Lucy Manning\nThe key question: how was Jonty Bravery, with a history of violence, who had warned he would do something similar, allowed out alone to the Tate?\nToday's report only adds to the disbelief that he was allowed to visit the gallery unaccompanied.\nThe report says there was no \"recent\" evidence that he posed a risk to other children or adults he didn't know.\nYet in the two and a half years before the attack at the Tate, Bravery was involved in at least eight assaults. \nHe attacked and bit another child, he attacked a support worker with a brick, he dragged a care worker by her hair, he assaulted police not once but three times, he confessed he had thoughts about killing himself and others, he punched a member of staff in a restaurant and racially abused his care worker.\nThe last attack was just four months before he threw the young French boy from the Tate. \nNo-one is blamed for letting Bravery out although the system is criticised for the lack of treatment and residential places for him. \nLast year, the BBC revealed a recording from 2018 where Bravery told some of his care workers he planned to push someone off a building and go to jail. \nThe serious case review accepts the care agency's statement that it had no prior knowledge of this and says the review didn't identify anything to undermine that.\nIt's unlikely this will provide much comfort to the injured boy's family as he relearns how to walk and speak.\nDuring a four-week placement in a children's home in 2017, Bravery hit a climbing wall instructor at a leisure centre, deliberately damaged a car and assaulted a member of staff with a brick.\nLater that year, he dragged a member of staff along the floor by her hair and, in 2018, he disclosed he was planning to kill his stepmother and sister.\nThe review says: \"It is evident that professionals working with (Bravery) at this time did not think he would act on these statements, which were seen as attention-seeking behaviour.\n\"This was because all of (Bravery's) actions were viewed as products of his autistic behaviour and there was no consideration of these threats in a context of conduct disorder.\"\nA psychiatric report in 2018 said Bravery, who is now 19, had learnt to use his autism as an excuse to evade responsibility for dangerous behaviour.\nThe review says Bravery needed residential therapeutic solutions that could enable him, as an autistic young person, to engage in a treatment regime for his conduct disorder.\n\"But such a residential option did not exist,\" it adds.\nThe LCSP says it is continuing to make improvements across police, health and social care in the delivery and co-ordination of support for autistic children and those with complex high-risk behaviours.

But on reflection, that was just a show about a man being horrible to tigers and probably best that it's not been nominated for a Bafta.\"\nLate last year, Sir Steve McQueen said \"things are changing\" for black British film-makers after one part of his series, Lovers Rock, was named the best film of 2020 by Sight & Sound magazine.\n\"To be honest with you, black and brown-skinned people have not been really welcomed into the film and television community,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"But now things are sort of changing things and people are realising that things need to be sorted and things need to be changed and there's opportunities there - we've just got to take them when we get them.\"\nSir Steve added that he made the Small Axe series, which tackled a range of issues around race relations, so people like his own mother could see stories like their own reflected.\n\"Firstly, I wanted to make Small Axe for my mother, in a way that you could turn on the telly and have it accessible to her,\" he said.\n\"And that period of time from the 60s to the early 80s, for me, it was a time where things were being contested and stories, which were being sort of swept under the carpet, needed to be spoken about and needed to be seen.\"\nNominees for the Bafta Must-See Moment Award were announced on Tuesday, and include Diversity's controversial dance routine on Britain's Got Talent, which provoked thousands of complaints.\nViewers have until 17:00 BST on 24 May to vote for the winner, which will be announced as part of the Bafta TV Awards ceremony on 6 June.\nThe Bafta prizes honour shows transmitted in 2020, and comedian Richard Ayoade will to host the ceremony for the second year in a row.\nTypically an extravagant event at London's Royal Festival Hall, festivities will be more restrained due to the safeguards in place due to Covid-19 and will take place in a closed studio.\nThe winners of Bafta's TV Craft Awards, meanwhile, which celebrate behind-the-scenes achievements, will be announced by Famalam actress Gbemisola Ikumelo on 24 May.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Earth science,Antarctic,Greenland,Earth observation,Glaciers,Climate change",
      "text": "The world's glaciers are melting at an accelerating rate, according to a comprehensive new study. \nA French-led team assessed the behaviour of nearly all documented ice streams on the planet.\nThe researchers found them to have lost almost 270 billion tonnes of ice a year over the opening two decades of the 21st Century. \nThe meltwater produced now accounts for about a fifth of global sea-level rise, the scientists tell Nature journal.\nThe numbers involved are quite hard to imagine, so team member Robert McNabb, from the universities of Ulster and Oslo, uses an analogy. \n\"Over the last 20 years, we've seen that glaciers have lost about 267 gigatonnes (Gt) per year. So, if we take that amount of water and we divide it up across the island of Ireland, that's enough to cover all of Ireland in 3m of water each year,\" he says on this week's edition of Science In Action on the BBC World Service.\n\"And the total loss is accelerating. It's growing by about 48Gt/yr, per decade.\"\nThe worldwide inventory of glaciers contains 217,175 ice streams. \nSome are smaller than a football pitch; others can rival in area a mid-sized country like the UK. What nearly all have in common is that they are thinning and retreating in a changing climate, either through stronger melting in warmer air or because the patterns of snowfall that feed the glaciers have shifted.\nThe research team, led by Romain Hugonnet from the University of Toulouse, France, used as its primary source of data the imagery acquired by Nasa's Terra satellite, which was launched in 1999.\nImmense computing power was brought to bear on the process of interpreting these pictures and pulling out the changes in the glaciers' elevation, volume and mass up to 2019.\nThe team believes its approach has hammered down the uncertainties in its results to perhaps less than 5% overall. That's in large part because every single glacier examined in the study is represented based on the same methodology.\n\"This new study is a major advance as we get a high spatial resolution and, at the same time, it also provides the temporal change over the two decades directly based on satellite data, which is novel,\" explained co-author Matthias Huss from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.\n\"This data-set has been validated with an immense amount of additional, independent measurements and is highly accurate so that the uncertainties of previous studies are strongly reduced.\"\nA group led from Leeds University published its own assessment of glacier ice loss in January in the journal The Cryosphere.\nIt arrived at very similar numbers. It reported a 289Gt/yr average loss over the period 2000-2019, with a 52Gt/yr/decade acceleration. An 8% difference.\nLeeds professor Andy Shepherd told BBC News: \"Glacier melting accounts for a quarter of Earth's ice loss over the satellite era, and the changes taking place are disrupting water supplies for billions of people downstream - especially in years of drought when meltwater becomes a critical source. \n\"Although the rate of glacier melting has increased steadily, the pace has been dwarfed by the accelerating ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland, and they remain our primary concern for future sea-level rise.\""

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Lobbying in the United Kingdom,Lobbying",
      "text": "The UK's top civil servant says Boris Johnson has asked him to review how the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat was paid for. \nCabinet Secretary Simon Case was responding to MPs' questions about how the work was funded. \nThe row escalated after Mr Johnson's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings claimed the PM once planned to have donors \"secretly pay\" for the revamp.\nThe PM has said any relevant donations will be declared \"in due course\".\nLabour has called on the Electoral Commission, which regulates political donations in the UK, to launch a formal investigation. \nThe watchdog has said it is talking to the Conservative Party about whether the spending on the flat falls within its remit.\nAppearing before a Commons committee on Monday, Mr Case said a review into the refurbishment would look at \"how this has been done\".\nAsked repeatedly whether he was aware if private donations covered any of the costs, he said he had \"not been involved directly in this\".\n\"I do not have all of the facts and details at my disposal,\" he said, adding that his review would probably take \"a matter of weeks\".\nAnother day, another denial.  Another 24 hours when rather than making their arguments, the government is embroiled in arguments about the past. \nWhether it's the prime minister's alleged frustrations about lockdown, attacks from his former adviser Dominic Cummings, or the mystery over his expensive flat renovation, as one senior Tory put it, it matters, because it all relates to Boris Johnson's judgement. \nMany Conservatives have been confident however that the prime minister's reputation, his enjoyment for pushing convention, is something that many voters are even attracted to. \nBut there's a risk that confidence could turn to complacency. \nThere is a belief in the Labour Party that the unhappy mess is starting to be noticed by voters.  \nAnd no one knows when, or what might next emerge.  \nOne cabinet minister told me \"there's nothing we can do to control it.\"\nThe claims about the flat are contained in a blog posted by Mr Cummings on Friday, his first since leaving his role in No 10. \nIn the blog, Mr Cummings also denied he was behind the leaking of details of November's second coronavirus lockdown in England.\nMr Case told MPs that an internal inquiry into that leak was ongoing, but it was \"probable\" officials working on it would fail to identify any sources.\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson has denied reports he said he would rather \"let the bodies pile high in their thousands\" than order a third lockdown. \nThe Daily Mail reported the prime minister made the remarks during heated conversations within government in the autumn over lockdown restrictions.\nSources familiar with the conversation have told the BBC Mr Johnson suggested he would rather see \"bodies pile high\" during the discussions.\nLike several of his recent predecessors, the PM is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, which is larger than the one above No 10. \nSpeaking earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the prime minister had paid for the revamp \"from his own money\" .\nHe said this came \"on top of\" public money from the annual \u00a330,000 taxpayer grant available to all prime ministers for the upkeep of their accommodation. \nIn a written statement on Friday, the government said no money from this grant was spent in the 2019/20 financial year. Figures for this year are expected to be published in the summer. \n\"At all times the prime minister has complied with the rules. He's paid for it out of his own money, \" he said. \nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged a \"full and transparent investigation\" into the allegations about the Downing Street flat, arguing they risked undermining trust in government. \n\"It's all very well the prime minister saying now 'I paid for it', the critical question was: what was the original arrangement - and why is it so complicated?\"\n\"If there's a straightforward answer, well give it. And if there isn't, then there are very serious questions to be asked,\" he added.\nA No 10 spokesperson said: \"At all times, the government and ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law.\"\nDonations and loans to political parties of more than \u00a37,500 must be reported to the Electoral Commission.\nThe Conservative Party has previously said that all \"reportable donations\" are \"correctly declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them and comply fully with the law\".\nThe party said \"gifts and benefits received in a ministerial capacity\" are declared in government transparency returns.\nMr Case was also asked by MPs about the case of businessman Lex Greensill who was a part-time unpaid government adviser in David Cameron's government.\nThe civil servant boss said that situation was not \"acceptable\" and that it \"looks like there were conflicts\". He added that he didn't think there was anything of that equivalent happening in the civil service now. \nThe prime minister has already appointed the lawyer Nigel Boardman to hold a review into all the issues surrounding Greensill Capital.

      "tags": "India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A coronavirus variant identified in India is being investigated by scientists across the world. \nHowever, it is not yet known how far it has spread or whether it is driving the deadly second wave of Covid in India itself.\nViruses mutate all the time, producing different versions or variants of themselves. \nMost of these mutations are insignificant - and some may even make the virus less dangerous - but others can make it more contagious and harder to vaccinate against.\nThis variant - officially known as B.1.617 - was first detected in India in October. \nSample testing is not widespread enough across India to determine how far or quickly the variant is spreading.\nIt was detected in 220 out of 361 Covid samples collected between January and March in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.\nMeanwhile, it has been spotted in at least 21 countries, according to the GISAID global database.\nInternational travel appears to have brought the variant to the UK, where 103 cases have been identified since 22 February.\nMost travellers from India have now been banned from coming to the UK. \nPublic Health England has listed the India variant as one of several \"variants under investigation\". \nThe BBC has been told by experts that it could soon be added to the \"variant of concern\" list. \nScientists do not yet know whether this variant is more infectious or resistant to vaccines. \nDr Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University, says one of its mutations is similar to those seen in variants identified in South Africa and Brazil.\nAnd this mutation may help the virus evade antibodies in the immune system that can fight coronavirus based on experience from prior infection or a vaccine. \nBut what appears to be more worrying at the moment is a variant identified in the UK, which is dominant in Britain and has spread to more than 50 countries. \n\"I doubt whether the Indian variant is more infectious than the UK variant - and we must not panic,\" Dr Kamil says.\nMuch of the data around the India variant is incomplete, scientists say, with very few samples being shared - 298 in India and 656 worldwide, compared with more than 384,000 sequences of the UK variant. \nAnd after the first recorded cases in India, fewer than 400 cases of the variant have been detected worldwide, Dr Kamil says. \nIndia has been reporting about 200,000 Covid cases daily since 15 April - well beyond its peak of 93,000 cases a day last year. \nDeaths too have been rising. \n\"India's high population and density is a perfect incubator for this virus to experiment with mutations,\" says Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge. \nHowever, the wave of cases in India could have been caused by large gatherings, and lack of preventive measures such as mask-wearing or social distancing. \nDr Jeffrey Barrett, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, says it is possible there could also be a cause-and-effect relationship with the new variant, but there is still a lack of evidence. \nHe points out that the India variant has been around since late last year: \"If it is driving the wave in India it has taken several months to get to this point which would suggest it's probably less transmissible than the Kent B117 variant.\"\nScientists believe existing vaccines will help control the variant when it comes to preventing severe disease. \nSome variants will inevitably escape the current vaccines, according to a paper published in Nature by Prof Gupta and his fellow researchers. As a result, changes to vaccine design will be needed to make them more effective.\nHowever, the vaccinations now available are still likely to slow down the spread of the disease. \n\"For most people, these vaccines can mean the difference between little to no disease and ending up in the hospital with a risk of dying,\" says Dr Kamil. \n\"Please take the first vaccine you are offered. Do not make the mistake of hesitating and waiting for an ideal vaccine.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A single dose of a coronavirus vaccine can reduce household transmission of the virus by up to half, a study shows.\nThose given a first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines - and who became infected three weeks later - were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus on than unvaccinated people, PHE found.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock described the study's results as \"terrific news\".\nHe has urged \"everybody to get their vaccines as soon as they are eligible\".\nIn the study, protection against Covid was seen from about 14 days after vaccination, with similar levels of protection regardless of age of cases or contacts, PHE said in a statement.\nIt added that this protection was on top of the reduced risk of a vaccinated person developing symptomatic infection in the first place, which is around 60 to 65% - four weeks after one dose of either vaccine.\nDr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: \"Vaccines are vital in helping us return to a normal way of life. Not only do vaccines reduce the severity of illness and prevent hundreds of deaths every day, we now see they also have an additional impact on reducing the chance of passing Covid-19 on to others.\"\nBut, while she said the findings were \"encouraging\", she said it was important people continue to act like they have the virus, \"practise good hand hygiene and follow social distancing guidance\".\nHouseholds are high-risk settings for transmission, meaning the study provides early evidence on the impact of vaccines in preventing onward transmission, PHE said. \nSimilar results could be expected in other settings with similar transmission risks, such as shared accommodation and prisons, it added.\nUniversity of Warwick epidemiologist Mike Tildesley said the findings were significant but pressed people to continue to take up vaccination offers.\n\"We need to remember these vaccines are not 100% effective either at preventing severe symptoms or at allowing yourself to be infected but the evidence is suggesting they are providing at least some level of protection from passing the virus on if you do get infected,\" he told BBC's Breakfast.\nHe said the study was extra evidence that as many people as possible needed to be vaccinated, even if they are not at risk of developing severe symptoms, in order to get much higher levels of protection across the population and reduce the number of people who get severely ill and die from the disease.\nThis is the latest piece of evidence to indicate that vaccines are slowing the transmission of the virus as well as saving lives.\nHouseholds are among the most likely places for infection to spread, so these set of results are particularly encouraging. \nPublic Health England has said it would expect similar results in other high-risk settings, such as shared accommodation and prisons. \nAll this bodes well for the continued easing of restrictions, especially as the vaccination campaign is making good progress into younger age groups - who are more likely to spread the virus. \nAnd it also gives further reassurance to those concerned about the fact that children will not be vaccinated - and so might bring infection into households.\nA cause for concern, though, is whether newer variants of the virus, which might be more resistant to vaccines, might cause a new surge in infections. \nBut the expert opinion is that the current vaccines will provide a significant degree of protection, especially against severe illness.\nThe study, which has yet to be fully peer-reviewed, included more than 57,000 contacts from 24,000 households in which there was a lab-confirmed coronavirus case that had received a vaccination, compared with nearly one million contacts of unvaccinated cases.\nContacts were defined as secondary cases of coronavirus if they tested positive two to 14 days after the initial household case. Most of the people in the study were under the age of 60.\nPrevious PHE studies have shown that both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are highly effective in reducing Covid-19 infections among older people, with 10,400 deaths prevented in over-60s by the end of March.\nPHE is also undertaking separate studies on the effect of vaccination on transmission in the wider population."

Totally condemn.\"\nHe said that he and his family were unaware of Khan's plans.\nNick Armstrong, barrister for the family of Mr Merritt and referring to a newspaper article that pictured Khan with extremist literature, told the witness that despite his claims that his brother \"'kept everything to himself', he was literally standing in the street waving a flag\". \nHe said Khan was a \"nasty violent, self-regarding piece of work, and all the signs of that were there from childhood,\" and accused the killer's family of \"looking away\". \nThe court also heard that Khan tried to hug Steve Machin - the head of counter terrorism from HMP Whitemoor - who was at the event, less than three hours before the attack.\nMr Machin, who thought it was \"odd\", instead offered the killer a shoulder bump. \nKhan, who had been in prison for planning a terrorist training camp, had been released in December 2018, less than a year before the attack. \nThe court was previously told Khan was an \"influential\" inmate who associated with other high-profile terrorists, including Fusilier Lee Rigby's killer. \nHe had engaged with prisoner education programme Learning Together while in jail. An intelligence report made in the summer of 2018 indicated Khan \"may be behaving in a deceptively compliant manner in order to facilitate his release.\" \nHe travelled to London from his home to attend a five-year celebration event at its request on 29 November 2019.\nAsked if he had reflected on his dealings with Khan, Mr Machin said: \"It's all I've done since - as a human being it's hard not to.\"\nAfter attacking Mr Merritt and Ms Jones, Khan was pursued to nearby London Bridge by three bystanders, armed with a fire extinguisher and a narwhal tusk in an attempt to disarm him.\nKhan was then shot by police.\nThe inquest into the deaths of Mr Merritt and Ms Jones continues."
