      "title": "Covid: More than enough vaccines for under-30s, says Hancock",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,Young people,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The UK has more than enough supply of the Pfizer and Moderna jabs to vaccinate all adults under 30, the health secretary has said.\nUK vaccine advisers say people aged 18 to 29 should be offered a different vaccine due to evidence linking AstraZeneca jabs to blood clots.\nMatt Hancock said the UK is on track to vaccinate all adults by 31 July.\nHe said the AstraZeneca jab remained safe and urged those who had received one dose to take up their second.\nThe UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there was no proof the vaccine had caused the clots but the link was getting firmer, while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks.\nMr Hancock said there was \"no evidence\" of rare blood clots after the second dose of the vaccine.\nHe also urged everyone to take up the offer of a first vaccine when they were called.\nIt comes as the UK's vaccination programme recovered after a lull over Easter, with an extra 408,396 second doses administered and 99,530 first doses. The number of people fully vaccinated is now over six million.\nAnother 3,030 confirmed cases were reported and 53 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe health secretary sought to reassure the public and said they can have confidence in the safety system because regulators were \"able to spot this extremely rare event\".\n\"The safety system that we have around this vaccine is so sensitive that it can pick up events that are four in a million [the chance of developing a rare brain blood clot] - I'm told this is about the equivalent risk of taking a long-haul flight,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\nThere is \"more than enough of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine\" for the 8.5 million adults under 30 who are yet to be vaccinated in the UK to have two doses, he said.\nThe UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 17 million of the Moderna jab and also has agreements with several other companies for jabs that are still waiting for approval, including 100 million doses from Valneva and 30 million from Janssen.\nMr Hancock said Covid was a \"horrible disease\" and long Covid affected people in their 20s \"just a much\" as any other age group, sometimes with \"debilitating side effects that essentially ruin your life\".\nHe said he was looking forward to getting vaccinated \"as a healthy 42 year old\" and said when the time comes \"I will take whatever vaccine I am offered\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also urged people to have the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying he had received the jab himself and would have the second dose.\n\"I think the most important thing is that we get the vaccine programme rolled out as quickly as possible - that is the surest way through this pandemic,\" he said.\nAs of Tuesday more than 31.7 million people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, with some 5.6 million having received a second shot.\nThe recommendation to offer alternative vaccines to younger people came after a review by the MHRA found that by the end of March 79 people had suffered rare blood clots after vaccination - 19 of whom had died.\nProf Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said that both the regulators had said the AstraZeneca jab could continue to be used in all age groups.\nBut he said the committee, which advises the government on the vaccine rollout, had decided it felt more comfortable if the under-30 age group - which is at lower risk from Covid - was offered an alternative option.\nProf Stephen Reicher, who is a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), told BBC Radio 4's World at One the move to favour other jabs for the under-30s could dent confidence in vaccination, saying we are \"not being as good in the rollout of information as we have been at the rollout of the vaccine itself\".\nNeil Astles, 59, a solicitor from Warrington, Cheshire, started to have headaches and feel nauseous about a week after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 17 March.\nAround eight days later he began to lose his vision and he was taken to hospital last Friday, his sister, Dr Alison Astles, told the BBC.\nDoctors found a \"huge blood clot\" on his brain and he died on Sunday evening,\n\"The human being, the sister in me, still feels absolutely furious and very angry this has happened to my brother,\" she said. But Dr Astles, a pharmacist, said she \"strongly\" believes people should continue to have the vaccine.\n\"Overall, we will save more lives by people having the vaccine than not. The risk of a clot is very, very small and my brother was extraordinarily unlucky.\"\nRead the full story\nEuropean countries have made their own decisions on the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine with many restricting them to older age groups, while Australia has said people under the age of 50 should be given the Pfizer vaccine instead.\nProf Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme now was \"not the time to waiver\" and said people had to put their confidence in the system.\nProf Beverley Hunt, an expert in thrombosis and haemostasis at King's College London who has been working with the MHRA on the clot cases, said we do not know if the AstraZeneca vaccine causes the blood clots.\nPeople had been seeing doctors with \"the worst headache they've ever had\" four days after vaccination or sometimes later, she said, and said early treatment could improve outcomes for people.\nThe focus on the AstraZeneca jab comes as scientists tracking the epidemic have said there is increasing evidence that the England's vaccination programme is breaking the link between Covid-19 cases and deaths.\nThe React survey, run by Imperial College London, found infections had fallen by roughly two-thirds since February, but had now begun to level off."

      "tags": "Theatre,Wales business,Coronavirus vaccines,Cardiff,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A decision on vaccine passports needs to be made \"urgently\", according to the artistic director of the Wales Millennium Centre.\nGraeme Farrow said a settlement over their possible introduction \"can't come soon enough\".\nWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said the matter is being discussed between the four governments in the UK.\nOpposition parties have highlighted concerns about the plans for such a scheme in Wales.\nThe centre is hoping to be open by October and \"fully operational\" - with no social distancing - by Christmas. \nThe news about passports was a \"step forward\", Mr Farrow said.\n\"If passports are a way to reopen this building then we are all for it, and we will be discussing with government how we do that,\" Mr Farrow said. \nPassports \"would work for us\", he said, but details of how they would work would need to be examined.\n\"Anything that brings back audiences more quickly into theatres, and safely, we are going to be supportive of,\" he said.\nBut he said he feared a situation where those yet to be vaccinated, or unable to be, could not attend shows.\n\"We want to open to as many people and to as diverse an audience as we can,\" Mr Farrow said.\nBarrister Andrew Taylor said there were \"legal, ethical and security issues\" with the idea of passports.\n\"If most people can have the vaccine, which we know is the case, then that covers the majority of the population,\" he said. \n\"But not everyone is able to have it because of health considerations, or some people perhaps choose not to have it. \n\"The difficulty I see in the future is in the jobs market and, for example, the ability to go to venues could lead to a two-tier economy.\"\nHe warned of the possibility of workplace discrimination.\n\"Employers might say, 'You can only work here if you have the passport'. \n\"If you are not allowed to have the vaccine, you therefore cannot work, so what is already a situation of disadvantage for some people may become exacerbated.\"\nHe believed any policy would have to be UK-wide. \nNight Time Industries Association chief executive Michael Kill said he was against vaccine passports.\nHe said: \"There are other mechanisms that we have in place that we do very well, that I think need to be considered, as well as some further engagement with the industry as a whole, to ensure we are all very aware of the output of this, if it is something that is being considered.\"\nMr Kill called for an \"even playing field\" for different businesses.  \n\"There are some challenges around the age group we attract,\" he said.\n\"The 18-24 age group is not going to be vaccinated, or have the opportunity or choice to be vaccinated until the end of July potentially, and that has to be taken into account when you are looking at some of these measures.\"\nFirst Minister and Welsh Labour leader Mr Drakeford said there were \"practical and ethical\" problems to be solved around vaccine passports.\nHe said he was in discussions with the governments of the other UK nations and would be \"having discussions again next week\".\nHe said: \"If you can do it in a way that doesn't discriminate unfairly against people, if you can do it in a way that does not make the system vulnerable to fraud and counterfeit certificates and so on, then I think there is a part they might be able to play in Wales.\"\nThe Welsh Conservatives said talk of vaccine passports in Wales was \"unnecessary\" as there was \"a review ongoing at a UK level\".\nA spokesman said: \"The focus of ministers in Cardiff Bay should be on the vaccine rollout, accelerating the reopening of outdoor hospitality and gyms, whilst extending business support for those firms who've been badly let down by Labour's decision this week to backtrack on previous commitments.\"\nPlaid Cymru said a domestic vaccine scheme posed \"ethical and practical questions\".\nA spokesman said it was concerned about people being excluded because they were unable to take the vaccine.\n\"It could risk marginalising those groups and further entrenching divides in our society,\" he said.\n\"Plaid Cymru cannot support the introduction of vaccine certificates for domestic use until these concerns have been fully addressed.\" \nWelsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds said her party \"remain opposed to these plans\" as vaccine passports would be \"divisive and discriminatory, as well as unworkable and illiberal\". \nMs Dodds said: \"They would mean that only those over-50 would be able to visit a shop or restaurant when they reopen, and individuals in their 20s and 30s will be barred from premises for many, many months until they are offered a vaccine.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Clothing industry,Online shopping,Retailing,Asos,Fashion",
      "text": "Online fashion group Asos has said the pandemic forced it to \"rip up the playbook\" as its young customers came to terms with being cooped up at home.\nChief executive Nick Beighton said its 20-something core market normally bought clothes for going out.\nBut the company's swift \"pivot\" to casual clothing paid off, with surging sales, profits and customer numbers.\nAsos added one and a half million customers in the past six months, giving it a total of 24.9 million.\nSales rose 24% in the six months to 28 February, with profits jumping to \u00a3106.4m, up from \u00a330.1m a year earlier.\nMr Beighton told a conference call that under lockdown, there had been a greater emphasis on activewear, casual wear and beauty products.\nAsos had \"quickly pivoted the customer offer to meet demand\" in those areas, he said, with jersey tops and casual bottoms proving strong sellers.\nMr Beighton said Asos was expecting a \"shift back to occasion wear\" as lockdown restrictions eased. This would begin with daywear, then evening wear, he said.\n\"During that time, flexibility will be vital for us,\" he added.\nAsos said its integration of Topshop and other Arcadia brands, which Asos bought in February, was \"progressing to plan\".\nAs well as Topshop, Asos also acquired the Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands in a \u00a3295m deal, but not their network of about 70 shops.\nThe company said its latest \"record results\" had been driven by \"exceptional execution\".\nIn the UK, where Asos now has more than seven million customers, sales were particularly strong, climbing by 39%.\nAs an online-only business, Asos is one of the few retailers that have benefited from lockdown. \n\"For a long, long time, e-commerce has been growing,\" Mr Beighton told the BBC.\n\"What we've seen over the last 12 months is a step-change in e-commerce as a mix of total sales. So we don't think this is a high point, e-commerce is here to stay, but it can sit happily alongside stores.\"\nIn the company's results statement, Mr Beighton said he was \"delighted\" with the \"exceptional first-half performance\".\n\"Looking ahead, while we are mindful of the short-term uncertainty and potential economic consequences of the continuing pandemic, we are confident in the momentum we have built and excited about delivering on our ambition of being the number one destination for fashion-loving 20-somethings.\"\nAsos said it was still cautious about the outlook in the short term, because of uncertain economic prospects for its youthful target group.\nRisks included possible further Covid-19 peaks, as well as the timetable for the easing of global pandemic restrictions. \nHowever, it added that it was \"well positioned to capture demand for event-led product when lifestyles normalise\".\nArlene Ewing, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said Asos had beaten analysts' expectations on profits.\n\"The business is in great shape, with cash on its balance sheet and the acquisition and integration of brands such as Topshop yet to be fully reflected in performance,\" she added.\n\"With greater geographical diversification and investment in customer fulfilment over the last year or so, Asos is in a very strong position - a fact demonstrated by the more than 400% increase to its share price since the start of the pandemic.\"\nAsos confirmed that customers were still sending back fewer items than expected while coronavirus restrictions were in force, saying \"returns-related tailwinds in warehouse and distribution costs\" had given the firm a \u00a348.5m boost.\nBut Chloe Collins, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said that a post-pandemic resurgence of occasion wear and going-out styles could mean that customers resumed their old practice of returning more clothes.\nShe added: \"Though there is light at the end of the Covid-19 tunnel and Asos will be ready for increased demand for its more fashion-forward, dressy designs, shoppers' desire for more comfortable and versatile clothing is expected to be a long-term switch. \n\"Therefore, it should ensure that these styles retain a high presence on its social media platforms and that it showcases how items can be styled to suit multiple end uses.\""

A woman, in her 60s and believed to be his partner, was also stabbed and remains in a critical condition.\nThe businessman and his family's wealth was valued at \u00a3301m in the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List.   \nA 34-year-old man, from Gillingham, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. \nHe was stopped in a vehicle in the Hammersmith area of London and taken to hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. \nDorset Police said the arrested man and the victims were known to each other.\nSir Richard, who was number 435 in last year's Sunday Times Rich List, owned a string of top hotels. \nThe baronet had an extensive property and farming portfolio, including owning the freehold of the Sheraton Grand London Park Lane and the Athenaeum Hotel in Mayfair.\nA statement from the businessman's company, Sir Richard Sutton Limited, said staff were \"deeply saddened and devastated by the sudden death\".\n\"Sir Richard was a caring, generous and warm family man, who genuinely regarded those who worked for him as part of his extended family,\" it said.\nIt added he was \"passionately devoted to both his company and its people, setting the highest standards for quality in the hotel, farming and property interests within the group\".\nDescribing him as an an \"incredible individual\", the firm said Sir Richard's loss \"will be felt by everyone within the company\".\nA cordon is in place at the property and police have appealed for information.\nNorth Dorset Conservative MP Simon Hoare, who was a friend of Sir Richard, said he had received a briefing from Dorset Police and described the death as \"deeply awful\". \n\"I knew him, strangely enough I knew him before I was an MP as my company did a lot of work for his estate many years ago,\" he said.\n\"He was a charming man, he had a very good sense of humour, he was politically astute and genial.\n\"If you wanted to conjure up a picture of a country gentleman then that was him.\n\"It is a huge loss for his family in what is clearly deeply awful circumstances.\"\nThe MP added the incident was rare for his constituency and there was \"no cause or reason for alarm\" based on the police briefing. \nDorset Police said it received a report at 19:30 on Wednesday raising concerns about the welfare of the occupants of an address in Higher Langham.\nDet Insp Simon Huxter, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), said the force is appealing for anyone to come forward who saw or heard anything suspicious. \n\"Our thoughts are with the family of the man who sadly died and the injured woman at this extremely difficult time and they are being supported by specially-trained officers,\" he said. \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "The sister of a man who died from a blood clot on the brain after having the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine says she \"strongly believes\" people should keep having the Covid jab.\nNeil Astles, 59, a solicitor from Warrington, Cheshire, died on Sunday. He was vaccinated on 17 March.\nPharmacist Alison Astles told the BBC that doctors were \"99.9% sure\" the clot was due to the jab.\nBut she said he was \"extraordinarily unlucky\" and the risk was \"very low\".\nDr Astles said she felt she had a responsibility to speak out \"because, overall, we will save more lives by people having the vaccine than not\".\nThe family is still awaiting a report from the coroner on Mr Astles' cause of death.\nOn Wednesday, UK vaccine advisers recommended healthy under-30s in the UK should be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots.\nThe recommendation came after a review by the UK drugs regulator found that, by the end of March, 79 people had suffered rare blood clots accompanied by low blood platelet count after vaccination - 19 of whom had died.\nThe regulator said this was not proof the jab had caused the clots, but it said the link was getting firmer. The figures suggest the risk of dying from one of the clots following vaccination is about one in a million.\nMeanwhile, the EU's medicines regulator has said the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks.\nDr Astles, who is pharmacy lead at the University of Huddersfield, said her brother started to have headaches and feel nauseous \"a week or so\" after having his first jab.\nAround eight days later he began to lose his vision and he was taken to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital on Friday. \nDoctors found a \"huge blood clot\" on his brain, she said, and he died on Sunday evening.\nShe said she was told by doctors \"they were 99.9% sure this was due to the Covid vaccine\" and that his blood results mirrored similar cases in the UK.\nDr Astles described her brother as a much loved sibling, husband and son, adding that his death had left \"an immense hole in our lives\".\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that he had been diagnosed with a \"cerebral sinus thrombosis and subarachnoid haemorrhage\" with \"low platelets and extraordinarily high d-dimer\".\n\"The human being, the sister in me, still feels absolutely furious and very angry this has happened to my brother,\" Dr Astles told the BBC News channel.\n\"Despite what has happened to Neil and the impact on our family, I still strongly believe that people should go ahead and have the vaccine.\n\"If you've had one dose, go ahead and have your second. If you haven't had your dose yet make sure that you do. Because, overall, we will save more lives by people having the vaccine than not. \n\"The risk of a clot is very, very small and my brother was extraordinarily unlucky.\"\nDr Astles welcomed the decision to offer an alternative vaccine to the under-30s - a group which includes her son - who are much less likely to die from Covid.\nShe received the Pfizer jab but she said other family members have had the AstraZeneca jab and she would recommend they still have their second dose.\nShe said she decided to speak out about her brother's death to raise awareness of the side effects of the vaccine, adding: \"If we can save one life, one other family as a result of this, then that would be worthwhile.\"\nAnyone who suffers symptoms such as a persistent headache, blurred vision or confusion four days or more after vaccination or who experience unusual skin bruising, shortness of breath or chest pain are being asked to seek medical advice."

The soap was a launch pad for numerous pop and Hollywood stars, including Kylie Minogue and Russell Crowe.\nBut the soap has been criticised for failing to reflect Australia's ethnic diversity in its casting of actors.\nWyatt was the first indigenous actor to be added to the main cast when he appeared on the show from 2014 to 2016.\nBest known for her role in Australian drama series Wentworth, Clanton was hired to play a character named Sheila in upcoming episodes of Neighbours.\nIn her Instagram post, she said she was \"navigating ongoing counselling\" from her stint on what she called a \"highly problematic show\".\nShe made her allegations in a list of seven bullet points, without naming any individuals. One alleged that \"overt and covert levels of racism were rife\" on set. She cited several alleged examples of white actors using racist slurs, including two instances where she claimed the \"n-word\" was openly used.\nShe alleged that she was told to \"go somewhere else\" when she confronted an actor who had used the slur \"because I was making others 'uncomfortable'\".\n\"The retaliation for calling out this misconduct and racism often left me ostracised and further marginalised,\" Clanton wrote.\nWyatt expressed similar sentiments in his posts on Twitter. He said he had walked in on someone using a racist insult, \"called it out and it didn't happen around me again\".\nHe said it was \"disappointing but not at all surprising\" to hear about Clanton's allegations five years after he had left the show."

But the Times - which revealed the original scandal in 2018 - said whistleblowers were \"frustrated\" at the speed of the inquiry.\nCurrent and former Oxfam staff made allegations of sexual exploitation, bullying, fraud and nepotism against 11 people in a letter send to the charity's leadership in February, the paper said.\nSome of these complaints dated back to 2015.\nAfter claims that staff sexually exploited survivors of the 2010 Haiti earthquake were revealed in 2018, the Charity Commission concluded Oxfam had a \"culture of poor behaviour\" and was issued with a warning over its \"mismanagement\".\nWith thousands of people cancelling their regular donations and the government suspending its funding of the charity, Oxfam had to make \u00a316m of cuts."

in south Belfast, Newtownabbey and Londonderry - has been connected to the Ulster Defence Association (UDA).\nEarlier, PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said it was likely that paramilitary organisations were involved and had planned the rioting on Wednesday night.\n\"Last night was at a scale we haven't seen in Belfast or further afield in Northern Ireland for a number of years,\" he said.  \n\"We are very, very lucky no-one was seriously injured or killed last night given in particular the large number of petrol bombs thrown.\"\nPolice officers were called in from other parts of Northern Ireland to help to deal with the rioting.\nMore than 50 officers have been hurt in violence in several areas since the end of last month.\nThe bus driver whose double-decker was attacked and burned is \"very shaken by the incident but is physically unhurt\", according to the public transport provider Translink.\nThe PSNI is concerned at the potential for further trouble in the days ahead.\nAccording to police, Wednesday night's trouble involved \"equally large numbers on both sides\" of the peaceline at Lanark Way.\nIt is believed the PSNI will be paying close attention to interface areas and the risk of further clashes between communities.\nThe activities of dissident Republicans are monitored as routine and the police are wary of any attempt to escalate the situation.\nAssistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts was asked at a press conference if he feared weapons could come on to the streets.\n\"Given the history of Northern Ireland, it is something always in the back of our minds,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, a group linked to the south Belfast UDA has issued a statement urging calm.\n\"The way forward must be through politics alone,\" the message from the Ulster Political Research Group read.\n\"Rioting, street disturbances and the destruction of property will not change what must be solved by our political representatives.\"\nIt cited the Irish Sea border and policing as the main problems.\nThe group is associated with the Jackie McDonald, the man widely regarded as the UDA leader in south Belfast.\nThe Loyalist Communities Council, an umbrella body which includes representatives of the UDA and UVF, was due to meet on Thursday.\nIt has not issued any public statements since it published a letter it sent to Boris Johnson in March warning of the danger created by the Irish Sea Border.\nSome unionists have linked the violence in recent days to the decision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to prosecute anyone who attended the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey in June 2020.\nIt was attended by 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid-19 restrictions were in place.\nThey have also linked it to simmering loyalist tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal.\nIn recent days 10 people have been arrested as a result of rioting by gangs of people, some as young as 13.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"The way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality.\"\nIn a statement, the White House said it was \"concerned by the violence in Northern Ireland\" and joined other leaders in their \"steadfast\" support of \"a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard won peace peace\".\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis travelled to Belfast on Thursday to meet political parties.\nMr Lewis said he was aware of unionist concerns in recent months and he had been \"engaging and listening\" them.\nHe denied that the UK government has abandoned unionists through the new Brexit arrangements.\nLabour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer said the violence was \"completely unacceptable\" and he called on Mr Johnson to \"step up\" and \"show leadership\".\nTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin wrote on social media: \"Now is the time for the two governments and leaders on all sides to work together to defuse tensions and restore calm.\"\nThe taoiseach and prime minister spoke on Thursday afternoon. \nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told BBC News NI that political leaders need to come together to make a \"clear and strong statement that violence is not the answer\".\n\"This is a time for unity in the face of violence and concern across Northern Ireland in terms of what's been happening,\" he said. \nAll of the main political parties in Northern Ireland have criticised the disorder but they are divided over its causes.\nHowever, after an emergency meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive, a joint statement was issued from ministers, saying they were \"gravely concerned\" by the recent disorder.\n\"Attacks on police officers, public services and communities are deplorable and they must stop,\" they said.\n\"Destruction, violence and the threat of violence are completely unacceptable and unjustifiable, no matter what concerns may exist in communities.\n\"Those who would seek to use and abuse our children and young people to carry out these attacks have no place in our society.\"\nThe violence has been brought on by a combination of factors.\nNorthern Ireland politics and bigger events like Brexit are all in play here but there is no single straightforward reason.\nThere is a lot of fury over the attendance of Sinn F\u00e9in politicians at a funeral of a former IRA leader last summer which appeared to blatantly flout Covid-19 rules.\nSinn F\u00e9in's most senior politicians, among long lines of former IRA members, walked through the streets behind a cortege at a time when many people missed attending funerals for their own loved ones.\n\"Republicans do what they like and get away with it\" has broadly become one of the narratives being used to justify trouble against the police.\nHowever there were also loyalist funerals which broke rules during the pandemic.\nBrexit has been creating tension in loyalist communities for months, with the growing realisation over just how differently Northern Ireland is now being treated from the rest of the UK.\nSigns of anger over the new Irish Sea trade border are plastered on walls and lampposts in unionist and loyalist areas.\nIn these areas it feels that Boris Johnson has betrayed Northern Ireland and there is a backlash.\nBut that isn't all - there are much more localised issues too.\nLoyalist paramilitaries have been subject to a series of raids and arrests for their criminal activities and police believe in some areas these are the figures in the background helping to encourage trouble.\nUnionist political leaders - including Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader and First Minister Arlene Foster - have said PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne should resign over the force's handling of the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey in June 2020.\nLast week a decision was made not to prosecute senior Sinn F\u00e9in members who attended the funeral.\nMrs Foster tweeted on Thursday morning that she had spoken to Mr Byrne in the wake of the violence, as did Sinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald.\nThe first minister had faced criticism for not speaking to the chief constable after the violence on previous days.\nMr Byrne briefed both the Stormont executive and individual parties.\nSinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP, and the Alliance Party have accused unionist politicians of ramping up rhetoric in recent days by calling for Mr Byrne to stand down.\nMark Lindsay, the chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said removing the chief constable \"in the middle of a crisis\" would not be helpful, although he said there were \"serious issues that need to be addressed\".\nOn Thursday the Northern Ireland Assembly was recalled for politicians to consider a motion calling for an \"immediate and complete end\" to violence in loyalist areas.\nMrs Foster said the violent scenes were unacceptable, and Northern Ireland is \"faced with a number of deep and significant political challenges in the time ahead, and collectively we must work through those challenges\". \nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn F\u00e9in said the violence in Belfast on Wednesday night was a \"dangerous escalation\" of events.\nMeanwhile, Education Minister Peter Weir has confirmed the further reopening of some youth services in response to the violence. \nMr Weir said it would apply in areas of \"heightened community tensions\".\nDid you witness the violence?

      "text": "A \"livid\" pub landlord says he has spent \u00a350,000 on a chalet for outside dining only to be told a week before opening it contravenes Covid-19 rules. \nJason Kalen, who runs The Marlborough in Wiltshire, fitted a bar, pizza oven and a TV in the wooden structure. \nHe said he followed Wiltshire Council's advice to comply with the regulations.\nBut it said government guidance had not changed and outdoor roofed structures had to have at least 50% of their walls open when in use, which his did not.  \nMr Kalen said: \"It's disgusting. \n\"Less than a week before we're supposed to open saying it doesn't comply. It makes no sense.\"\nThe wooden structure was mostly built during the first lockdown in 2020 and finished in the second. A planned New Year's Eve party sold out, but had to be cancelled.\n\"I built it to their [Wiltshire Council] specifications. I've got a breathable roof with a one inch gap around the outside, I've got double doors, I've got ventilation through the ground up. Then we get an email saying it's not permitted,\" he said.\n\"It's the lack of timing. They should've sent this a month ago, it's just not fair.\"\nMr Kalen said having worked closely with the council to realise his project \"to suddenly do this to us is outrageous. I'm livid.\"\nJess Gibbons, the council's director for communities and neighbourhood services, said guidance on outdoor hospitality was emailed to more than 800 alcohol licensed premises in Wiltshire on Monday night, following the government's confirmation on moving to step 2 of the roadmap on 12 April.\nHe added: \"This guidance is not new - it is the same as the guidance issued previously, following the last re-opening just prior to Christmas which was covered by the \"all tiers\" regulations.\n\"It is based on the legal rules for smoking shelters in the smokefree legislation from 2007 which licensees will be very familiar with.\n\"We have now contacted Mr Kalen to find out more about his new structure and to work with him and offer advice on what he needs to do to ensure it meets planning and licensing regulations.\""

      "tags": "Balloch",
      "text": "A woman who survived a fatal fire at a Scottish luxury hotel has said she \"cannot fathom\" why it took three years for the case to get to court.\nHannah Munns said that not knowing the cause of the blaze at Cameron House had \"played with my mental health\".\nIt has emerged that the cause was known just five months after the fire in December 2017, which killed two men.\nBut the survivors did not know the full details until they emerged in court in December 2020.\nThe fire was started after a night porter placed a plastic bag of ashes in the concierge cupboard.\nSimon Midgley and his partner Richard Dyson died when the blaze ripped through the five-star hotel on the shores of Loch Lomond.\nAndrew Wade, an independent forensic scientist who specialises in fires and explosions, was asked by Police Scotland in May 2018 to investigate what happened at Cameron House.\nHe told the BBC that the investigation was \"relatively straightforward\".\nMr Wade viewed CCTV footage showing the night porter placing a bag of ash in the cupboard, then visited the site to thoroughly examine the physical evidence. \nThe investigator said the ground floor of the hotel was relatively undamaged with the exception of the concierge cupboard.\n\"You have to, in a way, ignore what you saw on the CCTV, establish where the fire started and then look at the possible causes,\" he said.\n\"At that stage the two halves come together and say all the physical evidence confirms what we can see on the CCTV.\n\"So at that stage I was satisfied that we were dealing with a smouldering fire from the hot embers which were put in the cupboard there.\"\nMr Wade submitted his preliminary report on 13 May 2018. \nIt took a further two years and seven months until the case came to court and the families of the men who died and the survivors found out the full details of what happened. \nThe Crown Office said subsequent reports covered a wider range of matters and led to criminal proceedings. Covid also had an impact on timings. \nThe hotel was fined \u00a3500,000 after admitting breaches of fire safety rules, while porter Christopher O'Malley was given a community payback order for breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act.\nMs Munns and her family had been staying on the same floor as the men who died. \nShe told the BBC that the time it took to get the case to court \"beggars belief\".\n\"It's really hard to articulate or understand if you haven't been through it, but not knowing what caused it, what the danger was, has really played with my mental health,\" she said.\n\"I can't fathom how it's taken so long to get to court and the amount of pain people have been through, not just me.\n\"I speak to Jane, Simon's mum, and she has been through absolute hell trying to understand what happened and why her son's not coming home. \n\"I can't imagine there is a situation where someone could tell me a reason why it has taken so long and for it to be acceptable.\"\nMs Munns is calling for a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) to be held into the fire. A decision on whether to hold an inquiry is expected later this month.\nA spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: \"COPFS appreciates the impact the time taken to conclude investigations can have on those involved and we are committed to resolving them as soon as we can. \n\"We maintained regular contact with the nearest relatives of Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson and are satisfied that our communications were appropriate having regard to the welfare and wishes of those involved.\n\"The convictions and sentences in this case were the culmination of a thorough and technical investigation carried out by Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, West Dunbartonshire Council and Police Scotland, overseen by the health and safety investigation unit of COPFS.\""

      "tags": "David Cameron,Greensill Capital,Rishi Sunak",
      "text": "The Treasury has released two text messages sent by Rishi Sunak to David Cameron amid an ongoing lobbying row.\nMr Cameron sent messages to the chancellor's private phone last year to ask for help for finance firm Greensill Capital, where he worked as an adviser.\nThe firm was run by Lex Greensill - a former unpaid adviser to the ex-PM during his time in No 10.\nThe texts show Mr Sunak told Mr Cameron his request for access to government-backed loans was being examined.\nMr Cameron's messages to Mr Sunak have not been released.\nIn a document detailing the messages, officials said Mr Cameron had sent the messages as a Greensill employee with an expectation that they would remain confidential.\nIt also revealed that the former PM had contacted two other Treasury ministers - Jesse Norman and John Glen - about the company. \nA source close to Mr Sunak said Mr Cameron had messaged the chancellor \"multiple times\" on his personal phone.\nThe source added Mr Sunak had chosen to publish the messages \"in order to reassure beyond doubt that there was no wrongdoing and that he acted with integrity and propriety\". \nBut Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said the messages \"raise very serious questions about whether the chancellor may have broken the ministerial code\", saying they suggested the firm \"got accelerated treatment and access to officials\" and Mr Sunak \"pushed officials to consider Greensill's requests\". \nAfter leaving office, Mr Cameron got a job as an adviser from his own former adviser, Mr Greensill. \nWhen advising Greensill Capital - which has now gone bust - the former prime minister texted Conservative ministers within the Treasury to appeal for access to emergency loans for Greensill Capital.\nBut the requests were rejected by Treasury officials. \nMr Cameron was investigated by a watchdog over whether he broke rules by not registering as a lobbyist for his work at Greensill - but he was cleared in March. \nHowever, critics have continued to question his access to ministers and the role Mr Greensill played in Downing Street when Mr Cameron was prime minister.\nWho has access to those in power, how is that access used - and how do those in power respond? \nThese are the questions that matter at the heart of this, or any other political row about lobbying; the attempt to exert influence on politicians. \nLabour is demanding what it calls \"a full, transparent and thorough investigation\" into Greensill Capital's connections at Westminster. \nDavid Cameron was working for Greensill Capital, a firm run by Lex Greensill, who had previously worked in Downing Street... when Mr Cameron was prime minister. \nFormer politicians have two marketable assets when they leave politics: \n1.) They know how government works. \n2.) And they know who works in government.\nMr Cameron had served the two-year lobbying ban imposed on former ministers when they leave office before he worked for Greensill.\nAnd seeking to make your case to government - as an individual, charity, trade union, or business - is an integral part of politics in a democracy.\nBut would someone who didn't happen to be a former prime minister be able to text the Chancellor, and get a reply?\nWhat is tricky in any story about lobbying is trying to prove whether the intervention of the lobbyist made any difference.\nWhile the rules on lobbying are more transparent than they were, plenty think they need to be much more so.\nIn Mr Sunak's reply to a text from Mr Cameron on 3 April 2020, the chancellor said: \"Hi David, thanks for your message. I am stuck back to back on calls but will try you later this evening and if gets too late, first thing tomorrow. Best, Rishi.\"\nIn the second reply on 23 April, Mr Sunak said: \"Hi David, apologies for the delay. I think the proposals in the end did require a change to the Market Notice but I have pushed the team to explore an alternative with the Bank that might work. \n\"No guarantees, but the Bank are currently looking at it and Charles should be in touch. Best, Rishi.\"\nThe 23 April message relates to Greensill Capital's desire to be part of a government-backed Covid loan scheme. \nThe \"Bank\" Mr Sunak refers to is understood to be the Bank of England, which was running the Corporate Covid Financing Facility - a scheme to help big firms through the crisis.\nAnd it is understood that \"Charles\" refers to Charles Roxburgh, the second most senior civil servant at the Treasury. \nThe Treasury said the firm's requests were eventually rejected by officials.\nMs Dodds added: \"The Chancellor's decision to open the door to Greensill Capital has put public money at risk. \n\"There must be a full, transparent and thorough investigation into the chain of events that saw Greensill awarded lucrative contracts, the freedom of Whitehall and the right to lend millions of pounds of government-backed Covid loans.\"\nThe SNP's Stewart Hosie accused the government of \"stumbling from one scandal to the next\", adding: \"Tory ministers and former prime ministers casually texting each other over government access utterly reeks.\"\nHe called on Mr Sunak to \"come before Parliament and set the record straight\". \nMr Greensill, the Australian founder of Greensill Capital, has yet to comment on the row. \nMr Cameron has also declined requests for a comment.

      "title": "US gun violence: Biden takes action on 'international embarrassment'",
      "tags": "US gun violence,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has issued an order targeting homemade guns, known as \"ghost guns\" because they are unregistered and untraceable. \n\"Gun violence in this country is an epidemic, and it's an international embarrassment,\" he said on Thursday. \nThe president is enacting new measures through an executive order, meaning he does not need approval from Congress. \nIt includes efforts to set rules for certain guns, bolster background checks and support local violence prevention.\nHowever, the president will have an uphill task. The right to bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment to the US Constitution and many people see gun control laws as infringing on this constitutional right. \nHours after the president's address, a gunman killed one person and injured five others at a cabinet-making shop in Bryan, Texas. A state trooper was also shot and injured while taking the suspect into custody.\nOn Wednesday, five people, including two young children, killed in South Carolina. The suspect has been named as former NFL player Phillip Adams.\nThis followed two mass shootings in March, which left a total of 18 people dead - one in Boulder, Colorado and the other in Atlanta, Georgia.\nSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday, Mr Biden said 106 people are killed every day by guns in the country.\n\"This is an epidemic for God's sake. And it has to stop,\" he continued.\nHe also offered condolences to the family killed in South Carolina.\nMr Biden's executive order gives the Justice Department 30 days to propose a rule that will help reduce the number of so-called \"ghost guns\". \nThese guns are self-assembled, which means they do not contain a serial number and cannot be traced. Background checks are also not required to purchase the assembly kits.\n\"Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist can buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a weapon,\"  Mr Biden said.\nExperts say that these homemade guns are increasingly being used in crimes. Over 40% of guns being seized in Los Angeles are ghost guns, according to federal firearms officials.\nMr Biden is also giving the Justice Department two months to come up with a rule on stabilising braces for pistols. Under the rule, a pistol used with a stabilising brace would be classified as a short-barrelled rifle, which requires much more stringent background checks under the National Firearms Act.\nThe Justice Department has also been asked to draft a \"red flag law\" which states can then use to create their own legislation. These laws authorise the courts and law enforcement to remove guns from people thought to be a risk to the community. \nGetting further gun measures through Congress would be difficult. The US Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, with Vice-President Harris holding the deciding vote. \nHowever, current Senate rules mean that in practice, 60 votes are needed to pass legislation, meaning some Republican support is required. Republicans have blocked significant gun control laws in the past. \nAfter recent mass shootings, gun-control activists called on Joe Biden to impose new regulations on firearms. And like past presidents who have sought to address US gun violence, Biden confronts a hard reality.\nThere are not enough votes in Congress to enact even modest new gun laws. And the steps a president can take unilaterally are limited in scope.\nBiden promised that he would do something about gun control, however, so on Thursday he gathered a sympathetic audience in the Rose Garden and unveiled a grab-bag of new actions.\nHe nominated a head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - a vacancy Donald Trump never bothered to fill. He instructed his Justice Department to come up with new rules for homemade guns and more heavily regulate an attachment that makes handguns more accurate. He called for new gun-violence studies and draft legislation that states could pass.\nIn a tacit acknowledgement that the scope of these actions are limited, Biden assured his audience that \"this is just a start\".\nTo go much farther, however, the political dynamic in Congress will have to change - and Biden, currently more focused on passing his infrastructure package, will have to expend more political capital.\nMr Biden's proposed measures have been praised by gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety. \n\"Each of these executive actions will start to address the epidemic of gun violence that has raged throughout the pandemic and begin to make good on President Biden's promise to be the strongest gun safety president in history,\" group president John Feinblatt said. \nHe added that the Biden administration's decision to treat ghost guns \"like the deadly weapons they are will undoubtedly save countless lives\". \nThe National Rifle Association (NRA), the biggest gun rights lobby group in the US, described the measures as \"extreme\" and said it was ready to fight.\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott labelled Mr Biden's order as \"a new liberal power grab to take away our guns\", promising not to allow this in his state.\nLater on Thursday, Mr Abbott also tweeted that he had been working with public safety and law enforcement officials in the state over the shooting in Bryan. He promised any help needed to prosecute the suspect and offered prayers for the families of victims."

      "text": "\"Women ask if I need help and offer an arm to direct me, men have taken the opposite arm and groped me.\"\nAngharad Paget-Jones, 27, is severely visually impaired and said some men have taken advantage of her under the guise of being helpful. \nONS figures from 2018 show disabled women were almost twice as likely to have experienced any sexual assault than non-disabled women.\nMs Paget-Jones said better education was needed to stop this happening.\nMs Paget-Jones, from Port Talbot, said she had been grabbed in public multiple times while out with her guide dog Tudor, which has left her \"feeling scared\".\nShe recalled one incident when she could hear a group of boys saying, \"you could just grab her, she can't see you anyway\", which led her to divert into a nearby shop for safety. \n\"Disabled women aren't valued. We're just seen as vulnerable, but we're not. It's society that makes us vulnerable,\" said Ms Paget-Jones.\nShe wants better education about how people with disabilities are targeted and better support for those who do report issues, as she said there had been times when she was not taken seriously.\n\"I reported an incident to a security officer in a well-known train station in London and he just told me my dress shouldn't have been so low cut.\"\nIn order to raise awareness Angharad has been using the hashtag #JustAskDontGrab on social media.\nThe hashtag and campaign, which encourages people to ask people with disabilities whether they actually need help, was started by visually impaired activist and campaigner Dr Amy Kavanagh in 2018. \nAngharad said the response to her tweets had been positive, however \"you always get bad with good\" and \"some men have taken offence\". \nOne man told her, \"if you don't want help, we'll just let you die\", she said.\nAmy-Claire Davies, 26, from Swansea, said she had had similar experiences.\nShe is a palliative care patient and has seizures from epilepsy along with severe chronic pain.\n\"I was in a nightclub with some friends in a manual wheelchair and a guy kept coming over and trying to interact with me. I very clearly kept saying 'no, go away',\" she said.\n\"He waited until my friends moved away. He knew I couldn't go anywhere. He came over and stuck his hand down my shirt.\"\nMiss Davies also said she had experienced being cat-called and shouted at in the street when she has been with a female carer, but not when she is with a male carer, and being disabled can encourage men to act inappropriately.\n\"When you have a mobility aid or something that people can see that makes you look more disabled, I think there are some people who will see you as more vulnerable and will take advantage of that,\" she said.\nShe added that men have a \"very different experience\" of being out in public even if they also have disabilities.\n\"A male friend of mine said after a night out why didn't I just wheel home in my chair rather than get a taxi.\n\"It was then that it kind of blew my mind of just how different an experience he has to me, I would never go out at night alone. \n\"We need to listen to the voices of women in Wales to tackle this problem.\"\nIn the three years ending March 2018, disabled women were almost twice as likely to have experienced any sexual assault in the last year (5.7%) than non-disabled women (3%).\nCharlotte Archibald, from Welsh Women's Aid, said research by the charity showed those who are disabled have a higher chance of being targeted and it was \"really important harassment and abuse is talked about in order to change these incidents\".\nShe said: \"We found that women in Wales with a disability are more likely to experience more frequent sexual harassment than non-disabled women.\n\"I think it's important that we understand that no woman experiences sexual harassment in the same way and that these experiences are often intertwined with other forms of abuse and discrimination.\"\nAfter hearing the experiences of Angharad and Amy-Claire, Ms Archibald said: \"I think it's horrible to hear that's the experience of these women, but sadly it's not also unexpected.\n\"The experiences of sexual harassment are very different for women who have a disability.\n\"They don't often have the mechanisms to remove themselves from those situations that another woman might have, and that's often overlooked.\"\nShe said that in order to make a difference, \"It's important that we really listen to the voices of disabled women in Wales and listen to their experiences and make sure that we're taking all of that on board and using that as a way to improve safety for women and Wales\"."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

A Czech court later backed the school's decision on the grounds that allowing the child to continue to go to the pre-school could endanger others.\nOther parents had been refused pre-school places, while one father was fined for failing to fully vaccinate his children.\nThe Czech Republic is not the only EU country with mandatory childhood vaccinations.\nLast year, a law came into effect in Germany requiring all parents to vaccinate their children against measles or face a fine of up to \u20ac2,500 ($3,000; \u00a32,160).\nFrance and Italy have also changed their vaccine rules following a measles outbreak in recent years, while similar suggestions were made in England amid falling uptake of the MMR jab in England in 2018-19."

His funeral took place on Wednesday.\nRothe enjoyed chart success throughout his career, and narrowly missed out on representing the UK at Eurovision 1981 - to the eventual winners Bucks Fizz.\n\"We would like to thank everyone for all their help and support during this very difficult time, especially the NHS staff and the wonderful team at The Wakefield Hospice,\" read a statement on McDonald's Twitter page.\nThe pair first dated as teenagers after meeting in a Wakefield nightclub, where she was a waitress and he - using the name Wally Rothe - was playing drums in Liquid Gold.\nThey later broke up but rekindled their romance almost 30 years later after a chance meeting on the set of This Morning, before getting engaged in 2008.\nMcDonald, who scored a number one with her eponymous debut album before going on to appear on Loose Women and host her own Channel 5 cruising show, praised Rothe for helping her with her career in her 2019 autobiography, Riding The Waves: My Story.\nWriting about their engagement, McDonald recalled: \"Suddenly, Ed cleared his throat and put his hand in his pocket. 'Jane, you are definitely the one for me, and I should have done this 26 years ago,' he said. 'Will you marry me?'\n\"I was so overwhelmed that I started crying. Then Ed started crying! People around us were mortified - thinking we'd split up'.\"\nRothe's band Liquid Gold scored a number two hit in 1980 with Dance Yourself Dizzy, which McDonald later covered herself. \nA year later their single Don't Panic was entered into the Song For Europe competition to pick the UK's entry for that year's Eurovision Song Contest. It was beaten only by the eventual winning song - Making Your Mind Up by Bucks Fizz.\nIn 1998, he replaced drummer Billy Adamson behind the kit in The Searchers - the 1960s band who had emerged alongside other Brit Invasion stars like The Beatles and The Hollies.\nHe spent more than a decade with the band, who enjoyed pop hits with Sweets For My Sweet and Sugar and Spice.\nThe team behind Loose Women, the ITV series on which McDonald was a panellist, offered their \"deepest condolences\" to her in a post on social media.\n\"Ed was a part of our Loose Women family for many years and appeared on our show on numerous occasions,\" a statement from the programme said.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. \nA range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. \nIt is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. \nThe restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. \nVaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are \"the\" exit strategy from the pandemic.\nThe three vaccine frontrunners are those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nPfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design.\nThey inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. \nThese have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. \nThe Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe.\nIt is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures.\nAll three are supposed to be given as two doses.\nA single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now been approved for use in the UK.\nTwenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year.\nBecause only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year.\nAnother jab, Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators.\nIt uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. \nThere are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. \nThe Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection.\nThe Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according to late stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised.\nThe vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death.\nIt is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. \nHowever, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid.\nNonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. \nUnderstanding which method produces the best results will be explored in challenge trials where people are deliberately infected with the virus.\nNew versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. \nHowever, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first \"real-world\" data on the new variants.\nBoth showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.\nThe results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target.\nWe may need to change the vaccines we use in the future."

      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "The number of deaths involving Covid-19 has fallen for the 10th week in a row in Wales - and  is at its lowest weekly total since the start of October.\nThere were 32 deaths involving the virus, accounting for 4.9% of all deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThis is 17 fewer deaths than registered in the previous week.\nIt takes the total number of deaths since the pandemic began more than a year ago to 7,804.\nDuring the latest week, up to 26 March, there were 12 deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area and six in Cardiff and Vale.\nWhen broken down by local authority area, there were no deaths involving Covid registered in six counties: Blaenau Gwent, Ceredigion, Denbighshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Swansea and Torfaen.\nThere were six deaths involving care home residents with Covid, which is the lowest weekly total since mid-October.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are now below the five-year average for the fourth successive week.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in a typical year is seen as a reliable measure of the  pandemic.\nThe number of deaths in Wales rose to 651 in the week ending 26 March. This was still 26 deaths (3.8%) fewer than the five-year average.\nWhen looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 40,726 deaths from all causes, 7,796 mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. This was 5,991 deaths above the five-year average.\nWhen deaths occurring up to 26 March but counting later registrations are included, the total number of deaths involving Covid rises to 7,804.\nWe can see the peak of the second wave came on 11 January, when there were 83 deaths involving Covid.\nThis was higher than the peak in the first wave, when there were 73 deaths on 12 April.\nONS found across England and Wales, the biggest decrease in the latest week was in deaths of those in their early 80s. While more than 61% of deaths involving Covid were in people aged 75 years and over, the proportion has been decreasing.\nONS takes longer to report deaths than Public Health Wales (PHW), because it waits for deaths to be registered. \nBut this is regarded as giving a fuller picture.\nThese count Covid when it is mentioned on death certificates by doctors, who either suspect or confirm it as a contributory factor in a death. But it is estimated that in Wales, around 85% of deaths where Covid is mentioned, it is the underlying cause of death - so these deaths are due to Covid.\nUnlike the PHW \"snapshot\" daily report, the ONS figures involve deaths in not only hospitals and care homes, but in hospices and people's own homes."

      "text": "The UK has more than enough supply of the Pfizer and Moderna jabs to vaccinate all adults under 30, the health secretary has said.\nUK vaccine advisers say people aged 18 to 29 should be offered a different vaccine due to evidence linking AstraZeneca jabs to blood clots.\nMatt Hancock said the UK is on track to vaccinate all adults by 31 July.\nHe said the AstraZeneca jab remained safe and urged those who had received one dose to take up their second.\nThe UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there was no proof the vaccine had caused the clots but the link was getting firmer, while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks.\nMr Hancock said there was \"no evidence\" of rare blood clots after the second dose of the vaccine.\nHe also urged everyone to take up the offer of a first vaccine when they were called.\nIt comes as the UK's vaccination programme recovered after a lull over Easter, with an extra 408,396 second doses administered and 99,530 first doses. The number of people fully vaccinated is now over six million.\nAnother 3,030 confirmed cases were reported and 53 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe health secretary sought to reassure the public and said they can have confidence in the safety system because regulators were \"able to spot this extremely rare event\".\n\"The safety system that we have around this vaccine is so sensitive that it can pick up events that are four in a million [the chance of developing a rare brain blood clot] - I'm told this is about the equivalent risk of taking a long-haul flight,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\nThere is \"more than enough of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine\" for the 8.5 million adults under 30 who are yet to be vaccinated in the UK to have two doses, he said.\nThe UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 17 million of the Moderna jab and also has agreements with several other companies for jabs that are still waiting for approval, including 100 million doses from Valneva and 30 million from Janssen.\nMr Hancock said Covid was a \"horrible disease\" and long Covid affected people in their 20s \"just a much\" as any other age group, sometimes with \"debilitating side effects that essentially ruin your life\".\nHe said he was looking forward to getting vaccinated \"as a healthy 42 year old\" and said when the time comes \"I will take whatever vaccine I am offered\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also urged people to have the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying he had received the jab himself and would have the second dose.\n\"I think the most important thing is that we get the vaccine programme rolled out as quickly as possible - that is the surest way through this pandemic,\" he said.\nAs of Tuesday more than 31.7 million people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, with some 5.6 million having received a second shot.\nThe recommendation to offer alternative vaccines to younger people came after a review by the MHRA found that by the end of March 79 people had suffered rare blood clots after vaccination - 19 of whom had died.\nProf Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said that both the regulators had said the AstraZeneca jab could continue to be used in all age groups.\nBut he said the committee, which advises the government on the vaccine rollout, had decided it felt more comfortable if the under-30 age group - which is at lower risk from Covid - was offered an alternative option.\nProf Stephen Reicher, who is a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), told BBC Radio 4's World at One the move to favour other jabs for the under-30s could dent confidence in vaccination, saying we are \"not being as good in the rollout of information as we have been at the rollout of the vaccine itself\".\nNeil Astles, 59, a solicitor from Warrington, Cheshire, started to have headaches and feel nauseous about a week after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 17 March.\nAround eight days later he began to lose his vision and he was taken to hospital last Friday, his sister, Dr Alison Astles, told the BBC.\nDoctors found a \"huge blood clot\" on his brain and he died on Sunday evening,\n\"The human being, the sister in me, still feels absolutely furious and very angry this has happened to my brother,\" she said. But Dr Astles, a pharmacist, said she \"strongly\" believes people should continue to have the vaccine.\n\"Overall, we will save more lives by people having the vaccine than not. The risk of a clot is very, very small and my brother was extraordinarily unlucky.\"\nRead the full story\nEuropean countries have made their own decisions on the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine with many restricting them to older age groups, while Australia has said people under the age of 50 should be given the Pfizer vaccine instead.\nProf Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme now was \"not the time to waiver\" and said people had to put their confidence in the system.\nProf Beverley Hunt, an expert in thrombosis and haemostasis at King's College London who has been working with the MHRA on the clot cases, said we do not know if the AstraZeneca vaccine causes the blood clots.\nPeople had been seeing doctors with \"the worst headache they've ever had\" four days after vaccination or sometimes later, she said, and said early treatment could improve outcomes for people.\nThe focus on the AstraZeneca jab comes as scientists tracking the epidemic have said there is increasing evidence that the England's vaccination programme is breaking the link between Covid-19 cases and deaths.\nThe React survey, run by Imperial College London, found infections had fallen by roughly two-thirds since February, but had now begun to level off."

      "tags": "Bitcoin,China,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "Bitcoin mining in China is so carbon intensive that it could threaten the country's emissions reduction targets, according to new research. \nChina wants its emissions to peak in 2030, and has plans to be carbon neutral by 2060. \nThe cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's ten largest cities, the study found.  \nChina accounts for more than 75% of bitcoin mining around the world, researchers said.  \nThe study was written by academics from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, Cornell University and the University of Surrey. It was published by the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications. \n\"Without appropriate interventions and feasible policies, the intensive bitcoin blockchain operation in China can quickly grow as a threat that could potentially undermine the emission reduction effort taken place in the country,\" it warned. \nSome rural areas in China are popular among bitcoin miners, mainly due to the cheaper electricity prices and undeveloped land to house the servers. \nMiners play a dual role, effectively auditing bitcoin transactions in exchange for the opportunity to acquire the digital currency.\nThe process requires enormous computing power, and in turn consumes huge amounts of energy.   \nAlready, bitcoin-related emissions in China exceed the total emissions of the Czech Republic and Qatar in 2016.  \nBy 2024, China's bitcoin operations will exceed the total energy consumption of Italy and Saudi Arabia, and would rank 12th among nations.  \nAt its peak, it could account for about 5.41% of China's electricity generation emissions.  \nThe researchers said a carbon tax would be relatively ineffective for bitcoin, and suggested \"site regulation\" policies instead. \nThe researchers said the \"attractive financial incentive of bitcoin mining\" has caused an arms race in dedicated mining hardware\nThe price of the cryptocurrency surged during the pandemic, rising from $7,000 last April to pass $60,000 in March before hitting a period of volatility.   \nBitcoin's price increase was pushed higher by well-known companies adopting it as a method of payment, including electric carmaker Tesla.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic also likely played a part, with more people shopping online and moving further away from physical currencies.\nCritics have long charged that in addition to its environmental impact, its main use is as a financial speculation tool rather than as a currency.  \nThey also worry that it is prone to market manipulation by a few large players.

      "title": "AstraZeneca vaccine: How do you weigh up the risks and benefits?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "For most people currently being offered the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  \nBut the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended that - because of an \"extremely small\" number of cases of blood clots in some who have had the jab - people under 30 should be offered other vaccines. \nEveryone's choice is different - weighing up the risk of potential side effects against the chance of contracting coronavirus and perhaps becoming seriously ill, or even dying. \nWe don't know enough to be able to plug the data into a calculator and get a simple, exact answer tailored to you. \nBut here's the best information we currently have on the possible risks and benefits.\nThe events are so rare, we need to start off with a huge number of people to make sense of them. \nSo, let's take a figure of 10 million imaginary people.  \nRegulators are continuously combing through the details of the rare clots that have occurred to work out how many might be caused by vaccination. \nAssuming the worst - that they all are - we can do some ballpark calculations to get a sense of the risks. \nBased on the figures announced on Wednesday by the UK medicines regulator, if 10 million imaginary people were given the AZ vaccine you might expect to see 40 of these clots - with about 10 clots having fatal consequences.  \nTen deaths out of 10 million people vaccinated is a one-in-a-million chance. \nThat's roughly the same risk as being murdered in the next month or - if you get in a car and drive for 250 miles - the risk of you dying in a road accident on that journey.\nRoughly 40 men and 100 women in our imaginary group of 10 million might expect to have one of these clots in any given year without vaccination, with more seen in younger people.\nThat's about 12 a month - so seeing a larger number in just a few weeks after vaccination is part of the picture of higher risk.\nOne review of this condition says that about three-quarters of those people would go on to make a good recovery, but a small number, say one or two people, might die within a month of the clot.\nThe European medicines regulator has said that by mid-March, they might have expected to see between one and two cases of this clot in people under 50 given the vaccine, but they had seen 12 - about nine times higher than they would expect.\nThese clots happen more often to pregnant women or people taking female hormones.  \nIn general, if you're on the pill the risk is about six times higher than if you're not.\nSo the risks of having a clot for those taking a contraceptive pill seem, at first glance, to be in a similar ballpark to the risks potentially linked to the AZ vaccine, but we can't know for sure with the data we have. \nTo be really sure, we would need to compare them directly in a single study. \nAnd whether or not you take a medicine depends on the benefits, as well as the risk.\nIf you delayed vaccinations for our 10 million people by a week, about 16,000 might catch coronavirus, based on current levels of the virus. \nIf they were all older adults, say 60-year-olds, maybe 1,000 would end up in hospital and 300 of them might be expected to die, far more than the 10 deaths from clots after vaccination that we mentioned earlier. \nBut for younger adults the risks of hospitalisation or death are considerably lower. \nGiven the same number of infected 40-year-olds, 16 might be expected to die. And the number of expected fatalities would be even lower for people in their 20s and 30s.\nSo for younger age groups the choice over whether to have the AZ vaccine is not as clear cut, especially when there are so many uncertainties in all these figures.\nBut death isn't the only issue. About a quarter of people who end up in intensive care with Covid have some form of clot resulting from the virus.\nAnd long Covid is more likely to affect 30-year-olds than 70-year-olds. On average, just over 2,000 of our group would still be dealing with Covid symptoms three months later, and more than half of them would be limited in their daily activities by those symptoms. \nWhile there's no simple number for everyone, for most people with a high risk of catching Covid or dying from Covid, the current data suggests very strongly \"your chances of remaining alive and well will go up if you take the vaccine and will go down if you don't\" as JCVI member Adam Finn explains.\nBut it does change for younger people.\nEngland's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty says: \"The closer you get to someone who's right down at 20, and otherwise blameless in their health, the more you have to think through these really very rare side effects - the risk/benefits might get closer to parity.\"\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article said that the annual incidence of CVT in the general population was 40 per 10,000,000 instead of 140 per 10,000,000."

      "tags": "Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "An expert witness has testified that \"excessive\" force was used by ex-officer Derek Chauvin during the arrest of unarmed black man George Floyd.\nSgt Jody Stiger, a use of force expert for the Los Angeles Police Department, said that \"deadly force\" was used after Mr Floyd was placed in handcuffs.\nMr Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd for over nine minutes during Mr Floyd's arrest last May.\nHe is on trial for murder and has denied the charges against him.\nThe footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on Mr Floyd's neck sparked global protests against racism.\nThe trial is in its second week and is expected to last for at least one month. The defence is due to begin arguing its case next week.\nProsecutors continued to argue that Mr Chauvin had used undue force, while the defence team sought to draw attention to Mr Floyd's alleged drug use, claiming he could be heard saying \"I ate a lot of drugs\" in bodycam video.\nAs police officers are rarely convicted or charged at all for deaths that occur in custody, the verdict in this trial is being seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future.\nSgt Stiger, who reviews use of force investigations for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) testified for the prosecution over two days.\nOn Tuesday, he was one of four police officers who condemned Mr Chauvin's handling of the arrest, which was sparked by Mr Floyd's alleged use of a counterfeit $20 bill.\nOn Wednesday, he argued that \"deadly force\" was used by the officers who pinned Mr Floyd to the ground. \nHe added that \"no force\" was necessary after Mr Floyd had been placed in handcuffs and that continuing to press down on Mr Floyd could have caused \"positional asphyxia, which could cause death\".\n\"He was in the prone position. He was handcuffed. He was not attempting to resist,\" Sgt Stiger said. \"He was not attempting to assault the officers, kick, punch or anything of that nature.\"\nBeing handcuffed with hands behind the back makes it difficult for a suspect to breathe, he said. \n\"When you add body weight to that, it just increases the possibility of death,\" he continued.\nHe said that officers are trained to be able to make arrests while being confronted by a hostile crowd, and that in his view, he did not perceive the onlookers \"as being a threat\". \nHe was also asked about \"pain compliance,\" meaning moments when officers can lessen the amount of pain inflicted on a suspect in exchange for compliance.\n\"What if there's no opportunity for compliance?\" asked prosecutor Steve Schleicher, arguing that Mr Chauvin appeared to bend one of Mr Floyd's handcuffed hands in an effort to cause him pain and make him obey officer's orders.\n\"At that point, it's just pain.\" Mr Stiger responded.\nAlso on Wednesday, state forensic investigators testified that Mr Floyd's blood was found in the back of the police patrol car used that day. The experts also told the court that pills found at the scene had tested positive for illegal drugs. \nTwo packets of Suboxone, a drug used to treat opioid addiction, were also found in the vehicle Mr Floyd was driving.\nMr Stiger acknowledged defence attorney Eric Nelson's point that an officer's actions must be viewed from the point of view of an officer at the scene, not in hindsight.\nMr Stiger agreed with Mr Nelson that all use of force policies have qualifiers - that is, the context of the situation, security, and experience must be taken into account when examining potential violations.\nHe also concurred that it would have been reasonable for Mr Chauvin to arrive on scene with a heightened sense of awareness as dispatchers had described Mr Floyd as over six feet tall (2m) and possibly under the influence.\nWhen Mr Nelson pointed to still images taken from officer's body cameras to argue that Mr Chauvin's knee was on Mr Floyd's shoulder blade, Mr Stiger disagreed, saying that pressure was still being applied to the neck area. Mr Stiger also testified that Mr Chauvin did not appear to move his knee from Mr Floyd's neck for the entire period he was on top of him.\nThe defence team also claimed that Mr Floyd could be heard saying \"I ate too many drugs\" in bodycam footage of the incident. \nMr Stiger testified that he could not hear the phrase in the clip, though another witness, Special Agent James Reyerson of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, initially agreed it appeared to sound that way. \nHe later retracted that statement, saying he believed Mr Floyd had in fact said \"I ain't do no drugs\".\nAnalysis by BBC Correspondent Gary O'Donoghue, Minneapolis \nIn a dramatic reversal, the chief investigator in the case of Derek Chauvin has retracted his view that George Floyd told police officers at the scene that he had \"ate too many drugs.\"\nDefence counsel earlier extracted the acknowledgment from James Reyerson from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension after he was played police body cam footage twice. He accepted after the second occasion he was shown the video that Mr Floyd said those words as he was being restrained on the ground.\nIt's a central part of the defence case that George Floyd died as a result of fentanyl and methamphetamine found in his body and not the more than nine minutes Derek Chauvin knelt on him.\nIt also emerged in cross-examination that it was defence lawyers who spotted the existence of a pill in the back of one of the vehicles from the scene - more than six months after the event itself.\nThe prosecution has taken evidence from a string of current and former police officers who have told the court that the force used on Mr Floyd was excessive."

      "text": "The health of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is deteriorating and he is beginning to lose sensation in his legs and hands, his lawyer says.\nVadim Kobzev said Navalny, who has been sent to a penal colony for two and a half years, had been diagnosed with two spinal hernias.\nLast week, Navalny started a hunger strike to demand proper treatment for acute back and leg pain.\nThe White House said reports that his health was worsening were disturbing.\nMr Kobzev, who visited Navalny on Wednesday, said on Twitter (in Russian): \"Alexei is walking himself. He feels pain while walking. It is very concerning that the illness is clearly progressing in terms of losing sensation in his legs, palms and wrists.\" \nEarlier this week, Navalny, 44, was moved to a sick ward in the prison in the town of Pokrov with symptoms of a respiratory illness. He had complained of a persistent cough and temperature.\nHis temperature was oscillating and had fallen to 37C (98.6F) on Wednesday after reaching 39C (102F) on Monday, according to the lawyer, who said Navalny was losing 1kg (2lbs) a day due to a hunger strike.\nIn an Instagram post, Navalny said prison authorities were trying to undermine his hunger strike by roasting chicken near him and placing sweets in the pockets of his clothes.\nAlso on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration considered Navalny's imprisonment \"politically motivated and a gross injustice\" and called for his immediate release.\nEarlier, human rights group Amnesty International said Navalny had been incarcerated in conditions that amount to torture and may slowly be killing him. Campaigners say the prison is known for its especially harsh conditions.\nNavalny's lawyers, who have been visiting him in custody, say there are no doctors at the colony and the medical unit on-site is run by a single paramedic. \nLast week, Russia's prison service denied Navalny's allegations that he was not receiving proper treatment, saying he had been given \"all the necessary medical assistance in accordance with his medical indications\".\nOn Monday, he said as many as three people from his unit had been taken to hospital with tuberculosis recently, a claim the Russian prison service denied.\nNavalny was given a suspended sentence for embezzlement in 2014, a conviction widely seen as politically motivated.\nHe was airlifted to Germany for treatment after he was poisoned in Siberia with a Novichok nerve agent. When he returned in January he was immediately taken into custody and a court jailed him for defying the probation terms of the suspended sentence while he was being treated in Germany."

      "tags": "Pensioners,Department for Work & Pensions,Personal finance,Women,Gender pay gap",
      "text": "Women on \u00a31-a-week state pensions could be owed tens of thousands of pounds, the BBC has learned.\nUntil recently, Carole Davies, 76, from Merstham in Surrey, was told she was entitled to less than \u00a31 a week.\nBut Mrs Davies, who retired in 2003, had been underpaid, not knowing she was actually eligible to receive a married woman's pension. \nEarlier this year, she discovered she was owed \u00a361,000 and entitled to \u00a382.45 per week. \nMrs Davies, a stay-at-home mum who worked in an administrative role for only a short period of time, had built up almost no entitlement to a state pension in her own right, as she had not built up enough National Insurance (NI) contributions.\n\"When I retired in 2003, my state pension was so low - 40p a week - I was told that it would be paid once a year,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Despite my husband Michael questioning this after he retired in 2005, we were told I wasn't due anything more.\"\nBut after watching a TV programme about pensions in November, she decided to contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) again, convinced she should be getting more. \n\"It's been pretty horrendous really and it just took so long. They just didn't seem to want to know and it was an uphill battle.\n\"In a letter I told them: 'I think you are waiting for me to die before you give me any money', and we still didn't hear anything back for weeks and weeks.\"\nWhen she finally heard how much she was owed, she said: \"I was totally, utterly stunned. I couldn't believe it.\n\"They should have written to everyone and told them what they were entitled to, but nobody did, so we didn't have a clue.\n\"It'll make a huge difference to our lives. My husband is 80 and I'm nearly 77. We should have had it earlier, it's so disgraceful what they've done.\"\nThe pension system is highly complex and many are unaware of the special rules for married women.\nIn March, documents revealed in the Budget showed an estimated 200,000 pensioners could be collectively owed up to \u00a33bn after the under-payment of state pensions for decades. \nA review, involving a team of more than 100 civil servants, is taking place to trace all the women who have been affected by systemic failures to automatically award pension pay rises, stretching back to 1992. The process could take up to five years.\nMs Davies is among 5,000 women entitled to potentially huge refunds, many of whom will not be captured by the DWP's search, due to a rule change in 2008.\nFormer pensions minister and partner at Lane Clark and Peacock LLP, Steve Webb, first highlighted the problem and the scale of the underpayments.\nHe told the BBC that under a little-known rule, the women who qualify for this concession are those who are getting a tiny amount of what is known as \"graduated retirement benefit\" (GRB) under the old state pension system, which ran until 1975.\nThe average amount they are receiving is around \u00a31.24 per week, but this is enough to qualify for a married woman's pension. They can backdate their claims to their husband's 65th birthday and could be in line for tens of thousands of pounds.  \n\"It is incredible that there are thousands of women getting such tiny pensions, but even more incredible that many could potentially be entitled to tens of thousands in back payments,\" said Mr Webb.\n\"It is as if they are sitting on unclaimed winning lottery tickets. It is very important that women on these very small pensions make contact with the DWP as soon as possible to see if they could be entitled to a windfall\".\nUnlike in other cases, this boosted payment is not automatic and women have to claim for it. That means many women know nothing about it and have missed out on this increase for years. \nA DWP spokesperson told the BBC: \"The action we are taking now will correct the historical underpayments that have been made by successive governments and anyone impacted will be contacted by us to ensure they receive all that they are owed.\"\nOver the years, the pension system has gone through many changes. \nWhen the state pension for all was first set up after the Second World War, men were often the main income earners. \nChildcare responsibilities meant some women didn't work for as many years.  \nUntil 2016, these women were therefore given a proportion of their husband's state pension - they could claim a 60% basic state pension, based on their partner's record of contributions.\nSince March 2008, they should have automatically got that increased payment - but a DWP error meant for thousands, that didn't happen. \nOver 1.3 million adults of pension age live in poverty - that is more than one in 10 of our elderly population struggling with debt, according to the poverty charity Turn2us. \n\"This money is going to make such a meaningful and positive difference to the finances of women affected,\" said Anna Stevenson, a welfare benefit expert at Turn2us. \n\"It is going to mean not having to worry about where the next meal comes and paying off those bills that have been looming large.\" \nShe added that it was vital that the DWP \"not let anyone slip through the net\". \n\"It is worrying that they plan to take five years to reimburse everyone. It is vital people get their money as soon as possible,\" she said. "

The winners of each country's title progress to the overall Mrs World competition. \n\"There is a rule that prevents women who have already been married and are divorced, so I am taking steps to make the crown go to second place,\" Mrs Jurie told the audience.\nShe placed the crown on the runner-up, prompting a tearful Mrs De Silva to walk off stage, a video of the incident showed. \nIn a Facebook post, Mrs De Silva said she went to hospital to be treated for head injuries after the incident.\n\"There are a lot of single mums like me today who are suffering in Sri Lanka,\" she later told a press conference. \"This crown is dedicated to those women, those single mums who are suffering to raise their kids alone.\"\nShe added that she would take legal action for the \"unreasonable and insulting\" way she was treated.\nAnother Sri Lankan model involved in the fracas was also arrested.\n\"Police arrested Caroline Jurie and model Chula Padmendra over Sunday's incident on charges of simple hurt and criminal cause,\" police spokesman Ajith Rohana told the BBC.\nBoth Mrs Jurie and the chief organiser of Mrs Sri Lanka pageant, Chandimal Jayasinghe, were questioned by police on Thursday. Mrs Jurie and Chula Padmendra were bailed to appear in Colombo Magistrates Court on 19 April.\nMrs De Silva has now been re-crowned, and the pageant's organisers have said they expect Mrs Jurie to issue a public apology. \nMr Jayasinghe told the BBC earlier: \"We are disappointed.

      "text": "Weekly deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales have dropped 92% since the peak of the second wave in January, according to official figures.\nMeanwhile, the total number of deaths registered in the UK over one week is 5% below the five-year average.\nIt comes amid continued efforts to reassure the public over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's possible link to rare blood clots.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the jab remained safe.\nHe urged those who had received one dose to take up their second and said the UK was on track to vaccinate all adults by 31 July.\nFigures from the Office of National Statistics showed there were 712 deaths involving Covid in the week ending 19 March, down from 8,945 in late January.\nThe largest falls were seen among the oldest age groups, with deaths falling 92.9% among those aged 80 and over and 93.4% for the 75 to 79 age group, compared to 83.7% for those aged 60 to 64.\nSeparate figures showed the number of deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 26 March was 11,439, which was 5% below the five-year average. Last week, deaths were 8% below the 5-year average.\nSome 799 of these deaths involved coronavirus.\nAdults aged over 80 were the second priority group for vaccination, followed by over-75s and over 70s. The government says everyone in these groups was offered a jab by mid-February.\nFigures on Thursday showed the UK's vaccination programme had recovered after a lull over Easter, with an extra 408,396 second doses administered and 99,530 first doses. The number of people fully vaccinated is now over six million, while 31.8 million have received just one dose.\nAnother 3,030 confirmed cases were reported, along with 53 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nSeeking to reassure people who have received a first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, Mr Hancock said there was \"no evidence\" of the rare blood clots after the second dose of the vaccine.\nThe UK changed policy on Wednesday to offer under-30s an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine, after weighing the benefits of vaccination compared to a potential very rare risk of blood clots.\nThere had been 79 incidents of the clots and 19 deaths among the 20 million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses administered, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said. That equates to a one-in-a-million risk of a fatal side effect.\nIt said there was no proof the vaccine had caused the clots but the link was getting firmer. Both the MHRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks, however.\nMr Hancock said people should have confidence in the safety system for vaccines because it was \"able to spot this extremely rare event\".\nThe risk was about the same as taking a long-haul flight, he said.\nAnd he said there was \"more than enough\" doses of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna due to arrive to offer an alternative to the 8.5 million UK adults under 30 yet to be vaccinated.\nThe UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 17 million of the Moderna jab and also has agreements with several other companies for jabs that are still waiting for approval, including 100 million doses from Valneva and 30 million from Janssen.\nA government scientific adviser said communication of the benefits and side-effects was \"critical\" to avoiding a loss of confidence in the vaccines.\nProf Stephen Reicher told BBC Radio 4's World at One that having a Covid jab is \"actually one of the safer things you do in the day\".\n\"Something like 30 or 40 people drown in the bath every year, something like 1,000 people die falling down the stairs, something like 200 die from choking on their breakfast, and that's many, many more deaths than we get from these vaccines,\" he said."

      "text": "A pig destined for the slaughterhouse is looking forward to a long life after a dramatic escape.\nSmallholder Sarah Allan, from Langtree in north Devon, had been driving three pigs to an abattoir 11 miles (18km) away in Holsworthy.\nBut when she arrived she was astonished to find that one of the animals had jumped out of the trailer. It was later found in a field in Milton Damerel.\nMs Allan said: \"I don't think I have it in me to send him back.\" \nThe pig, now named Milton by her children, made its leap for freedom on Monday from a trailer with a high back.\nMs Allan thinks it could have only succeeded in its bid by launching itself from another pig's back.\n\"We got to the abattoir and my husband checked the trailer and said, 'We are missing a pig'.\n\"There were only two pigs in the trailer, I could not believe it.\n\"We had been driving very slowly and we had not seen or felt a thing.\"\nHer immediate concern was the pig may have caused an accident so they made calls to neighbours and friends, police and vets.\nThe pig was later found in a field at Milton Damerel as they returned from the abattoir.\nAnd it is now back where it started, with little chance of leaving.\n\"He doesn't like trailers anyway, he hates going in them,\" said Ms Allan.\n\"He even tried to get out again on the way home.\n\"And I really admire his determination to survive.\n\"He's back, and that's where he's going to stay.\"\nFollow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Young people,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Under-30s in the UK are to be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots.\nThe recommendation comes after a review by the UK drugs regulator found that by the end of March 79 people had suffered rare blood clots after vaccination - 19 of whom had died.\nThe regulator said this was not proof the jab had caused the clots.\nBut it said the link was getting firmer.\nThe review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found: \nMeanwhile, the EU's medicines regulator says unusual blood clots should be listed as a possible very rare side effect of the AstraZeneca jab, but that the benefits outweighed the risks. Some European countries have restricted the vaccine's use.\nThe World Health Organization said the link between the vaccine and blood clots was \"plausible\" but not confirmed, adding that the clotting incidents were \"very rare\" among nearly 200 million people who have received the jab worldwide.\nNo treatment or vaccine is risk free. The key question is whether it does more good than harm.\nWednesday's update once again demonstrates the AstraZeneca vaccine does - even if you assume it's causing these clots, which has not been proven yet.\nThe risk of dying from one of them following vaccination is incredibly small - about one in a million.\nBy contrast, Covid kills one in eight people who are infected over the age of 75, and one in 1,000 infected in their 40s among those who develop symptoms.\nIt is less clear cut for those under 30, who are much less likely to die of Covid - although the AstraZeneca vaccine still presents more benefit than risk.\nHowever, other vaccines may be an even better bet.\nThe risk might look worrying, but it is actually very low, and usually we don't think about things just in terms of risk.\nFor example, travelling 250 miles in a car also carries with it a one-in-a-million chance of dying in an accident. How many think about that when they get behind the wheel?\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK's review confirmed that the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is \"safe, effective and the benefits far outweigh the risks for the vast majority of adults\". \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the AstraZeneca vaccine had \"already saved thousands of lives\" and the new advice should ensure people of all ages \"continue to have full confidence in vaccines\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also urged people to \"trust in our doctors and scientists\" and said he was looking forward to receiving his second AstraZeneca dose.\nAstraZeneca said both the MHRA and the EMA reviews reaffirmed that the benefits of the vaccine \"continue to far outweigh the risks\". \nThe UK reported a further 45 deaths from Covid-19 and another 2,763 confirmed cases on Wednesday. Vaccinations remained low after the Easter weekend, with 186,793 second doses administered and 85,227 first doses.\nJune Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said the side-effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine were \"extremely rare\" - and more work was going to identify if the vaccine was definitely causing the clots. \n\"The balance of benefits and known risks is still very favourable for the majority of people,\" she said.\nBut she said for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\". \nShe added: \"The public's safety is at the forefront of our minds.\"\nDr Raine said there was a \"reasonably plausible\" link between the vaccine and the blood clots.\nThe review prompted the UK government's vaccine advisory group, the JCVI, to recommend that people aged 18 to 29 be offered an alternative vaccine where available.\nProfessor Lim Wei Shen, of the JCVI, said the move was being made \"out of the utmost caution rather than because we have any serious safety concerns\".\nProf Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chairman of the Commission on Human Medicines, said the risks had to be weighed against the consequences of Covid-19, which also causes clotting.\nHe said 7.8% of coronavirus patients suffer blood clots on the lungs, while 11.2% will suffer deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs.\nPeople who have had their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should still get their second dose, the MHRA said. Only those who suffered one of these rare blood clots after the first dose should not get vaccinated, it added.\nPregnant women and people with blood disorders that leave them at risk of clotting should discuss the benefits and risks of vaccination with their doctor before going for a jab.\nAnyone who suffers symptoms such as a persistent headache, blurred vision or confusion for four days or more after vaccination or who experience unusual skin bruising, shortness of breath or chest pain are being asked to seek medical advice.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, described the move as a \"course correction\" - and said it was normal in medicine to change preferences in this way.\nHe also said the impact on the government's promise to offer all adults a jab by the end of July should be \"zero or negligible\" as long as the expected supplies of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines - the other two Covid vaccines in use in the UK - arrived as expected in the coming months."

      "text": "Identical clothing was sold at different prices across Boohoo's brands due to a \"genuine mistake and not business practice\", the retailer says.\nThe same coat was sold by Dorothy Perkins at \u00a355 and Coast at \u00a389 and the Coast item had the brand name cut off.\nJoanna Sikora ordered a skirt from Karen Millen and found it had an Oasis label with that branding crossed out. \nBoohoo said it had not realised its companies had bought the same items and branded and priced them differently.\nIt comes as the BBC was sent further examples of coats on the Oasis and Coast websites at different prices.\nJess, who asked us not to use her last name, spotted the khaki coats pictured, which have since been removed from both sites.\nShe said: \"You buy a brand in good faith that what you are getting is exclusive to the company. I initially assumed that the previous instances were a slight mix up, however after finding these myself I now realise that this is common practice in Boohoo. It doesn't speak well for the company if fooling the customer is their main method for turning a profit.\"\nBoohoo said these coats were part of an issue that arose when the coronavirus pandemic hit.\nThe closure of non-essential stores to stop the spread of Covid saw thousands of High Street fashion chains shut their shops for good.\nBoohoo bought up the online businesses of some of the fashion brands that went into administration.\nMost recently, it bought Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton from Arcadia. It acquired Karen Millen and Coast in August 2019.\nRetailers that were forced to close their doors cancelled their orders with suppliers, a statement from Boohoo said.\nThese suppliers then offered products they had already made for sale to other retailers that were still trading, it said.\nSome of Boohoo's brands bought some of this excess stock to fill gaps in their ranges as clothing stock began to run down.\n\"Our mistake was not realising that some of our brands had purchased the same items from suppliers,\" the statement said.\n\"Therefore we failed to make sure prices were the same across our group of brands.\"\nBoohoo said the problem affected \"about 10 lines out of thousands\", it was confident the issue was fixed and has apologised to customers.\nIt is not an offence for different retailers to sell the same item at different prices even if they are owned by the same company.\nBut \"it could be misleading if consumers think they are buying a particular brand, when this is not the case,\" said Sylvia Rook, a lead officer from the Chartered Trading Standards institute.\n\"Consumers may expect that items from one retail outlet are superior to another, and therefore be willing to pay a premium for this,\" she said.\nA trader could be in breach of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 if an advert misleads consumers and causes them, either to make a purchase they would not have made, or to pay a higher price,\" she explained.\nOli Townsend, assistant deals and features editor at MoneySavingExpert.com said irregular pricing was not unique to one group.\nIn 2019, an MSE investigation found shoppers were paying up to 34% more for the exact same item at Littlewoods compared to Very - even though both are owned by the same company.\nMr Townsend said: \"There's a question of ethics when there's such a price disparity between retailers under the same parent company - especially when in some cases they may share the same warehouse, courier and returns department.\n\"These brands risk their customers feeling ripped off and losing trust in that brand.\"\nHe said MSE encouraged shoppers to do price comparisons online to make sure they were getting the best deal. \n\"But if some retailers are cutting off or obscuring the original brand name, it makes this difficult and puts consumers at a disadvantage,\" he said.\nAdam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said customers would \"understandably see this practice as dishonest\". \nHe said: \"Companies who switch items between brands for different prices and cover up or remove the previous label risk losing consumer trust.\""

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is \"deeply concerned\" about scenes of violence in Northern Ireland. \nPolice were attacked, petrol bombs thrown and a bus set on fire in another night of disorder in Belfast. \n\"The way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality,\" he said. \nThe disturbances took place on both sides of an interface in the loyalist Shankill and nationalist Springfield Road areas of the city on Wednesday.\nForty-one police officers were injured in disturbances in parts of Northern Ireland over the Easter period, involving children as young as 13.\nThe BBC's Ireland correspondent Emma Vardy said crowds of a few hundred on each side threw petrol bombs in both directions on Wednesday night.\nThe disruption took place close to where a number of loyalist protesters had earlier gathered. \nPolice confirmed a vehicle was set alight at the junction of Lanark Way and the Shankill Road in the west of the city.\nOur correspondent said the arrival of a line of police cars interrupted the attacks over the peace wall.\nNorthern Ireland's power-sharing Executive will meet on Thursday to be briefed about what Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill denounced as \"the violence and street disorder which is causing huge distress in local communities\".\n\"Those involved in violence, criminal damage, manipulation of our young people and attacks on the police must stop,\" said Sinn F\u00e9in's vice-president.\nPolice also confirmed they had received a report of an assault on a press photographer.\nThe Police Federation for Northern Ireland said the violence could \"set our society back years\".\nCalling for the ongoing street disorder to stop, PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said he was \"open to dialogue with anyone who is willing to work with me to resolve the issues facing our community\". \nAddressing the rioters, he tweeted: \"Violence is not the answer.\"\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster condemned what she called \"vandalism and attempted murder\" and said it did \"not represent unionism or loyalism\". \nShe said the actions \"only serve to take the focus off the real law breakers in Sinn F\u00e9in\", and her thoughts were with the driver of the hijacked bus. \nJustice Minister Naomi Long of the Alliance Party said \"these are 'real law breakers', burning buses, terrorising passengers and attacking police.\n\"Let's focus on that and getting this stopped before someone loses their life.\"\nUlster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said the violence was \"unacceptable and unjustified\". \nTaoiseach (Irish PM) Miche\u00e1l Martin tweeted that he \"utterly condemned\" the unrest, adding: \"Now is the time for the two governments and leaders on all sides to work together to defuse tensions and restore calm.\"\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the scenes were \"very disturbing\" and that \"attacks on police, journalists and citizens must be condemned by all\".  \n\"There are peaceful, democratic and legal channels to address all issues and concerns. Calm and positive leadership needed from all,\" he said. \nThe attack on the press photographer, Kevin Scott from the Belfast Telegraph, took place on Cupar Way.\nMr Scott told BBC News NI: \"I cover everything as fairly and impartially as possible, working at both sides of the community covering both the positive and the not so positive,\" he said. \n\"I won't be deterred from covering stories that are important and note-worthy.\" \nNI Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said the hijacking and attack on a bus was \"sickening\".\n\"Those responsible for this and ongoing attacks on the PSNI need to stop,\" she tweeted.\nA number of Belfast services, including the Glider buses, have been suspended.\nIn total, 10 arrests have been made across Northern Ireland during disorder over the past week. \nThe Easter disturbances have been blamed on loyalist frustrations over a Public Prosecution Service decision not to prosecute people who attended the large-scale funeral of republican Bobby Storey in June 2020, as well as concerns about the NI Protocol in the Brexit deal.\nThe leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party, Ulster Unionist Party, Traditional Unionist Voice and Progressive Unionist Party have said the position of Chief Constable Simon Byrne is untenable over the PSNI's handling of the funeral.\nThat event was attended by a number of senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians, including the deputy first minister."

      "tags": "Volodymyr Zelensky,Russia,Nato,Ukraine conflict,Vladimir Putin,Ukraine",
      "text": "A top Russian official has warned that Moscow could intervene to help Russian-speaking residents in eastern Ukraine if Ukraine launches an all-out assault on separatists there. \nRussian-backed separatist rebels and Ukrainian troops have been clashing in the east of the country.\nRussia has also been building up troops on the border with Ukraine. \nThe official, Dmitry Kozak, said that Russian forces could intervene to \"defend Russian citizens\".  \n\"Everything depends on the scale of the conflagration,\" he said. He is deputy head of Russia's presidential administration. \nHe also warned that an escalation could mark the \"beginning of the end\" for Ukraine - \"not a shot in the leg, but in the face\".\nThe Ukrainian military says one of its soldiers was killed on Thursday by shooting from the separatists. The rebels used machine-guns, grenades and mortars several times and Ukrainian forces fired back, the military was quoted as saying.\nThe Ukrainian army commander, Gen Ruslan Khomchak, said \"we see the build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine's state border. \n\"However, this does not mean that our country is being encircled. The situation is under control.\" \nEarlier the rebels said one of their fighters was killed when Ukrainian troops fired mortars at a village on the outskirts of the city of Donetsk. \nThe United States and Germany have both expressed concern at the increase in tensions. \nRussia has been increasing the number of troops at the Ukrainian border, but at the same time maintains that they should not be seen as a threat. \nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Russian troop numbers there were the highest since 2014, when the conflict in eastern Ukraine began. She described the situation as \"deeply concerning\". \nRussia has not detailed troop numbers, but the Ukrainian military asserted at the end of March that some 20,000 Russian troops had been moved towards Ukraine's border. Video has emerged on social media of Russian trains moving heavy weaponry, apparently towards the region. \nFor months there have been sporadic clashes between Ukrainian troops and the Moscow-backed rebels in the Donbas region, violating a fragile ceasefire daily. \nUkraine says 25 of its troops have been killed in the conflict zone so far this year, and 50 died in the whole of last year. \nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the region on Thursday to see \"the locations of the escalation\" and \"be with our soldiers in the tough times in Donbas\". \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the conflict in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.\nShe urged Russia to \"de-escalate tensions\" by pulling troops back, while Mr Putin accused Ukraine of inflaming the situation in the east. \nIn Moscow, Mr Kozak likened the current situation of the separatists to Srebrenica, the town in Bosnia-Herzegovina where 8,000 Muslim men were killed by Bosnian Serb forces in 1995. \n\"If, as our president says, there is a Srebrenica there, we shall probably have to come to their defence,\" Mr Kozak said. \nPresident Putin first suggested in 2019 that Russian-speaking residents might suffer a Srebrenica-like massacre if Ukraine regained full control of Donbas without guarantees. He has always made it clear the Russian state reserves the right to defend ethnic Russians abroad, and in 2019 signed a law making it easier for people in separatist areas to obtain Russian passports.\nThere is no sign that Ukraine is preparing any such Bosnian Serb-style \"ethnic cleansing\" campaign. \nMr Kozak suggested the rebels could hold their own for now against Ukrainian forces, as they consisted of \"battle-hardened units\". \nThe roots of the conflict go back to March 2014, when Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych had fled the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in February, after massive street demonstrations and clashes. \nRussia's military intervention sparked a major rift with Western nations, prompting the European Union and the US to impose sanctions on Russia. \nA month later, Russian-backed rebels in the mainly Russian-speaking Donbas seized much of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. \nWestern governments and Nato accused Russia of sending regular troops over the border into Ukraine, but Russia maintains any Russian fighters there are \"volunteers\".  \nUkraine's President Zelensky came to power promising to bring about peace, and a ceasefire was signed last July. Both sides have since accused each other of violating it. \nThe conflict is estimated to have killed 14,000 people. "

It's annoying that Welsh government are making changes all the time.\"\nMichaela Breeze, a Commonwealth Games weightlifting champion who owns her own gym in Swansea, said the news was \"fantastic\" but she was \"pulling my hair out in despair\" because she had already spent money planning to open on the previous date.\n\"That decision has cost me several thousands of pounds,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We are trying to run businesses here - it requires time, it requires practice and it requires planning to notify members.\"\nDylan Allsopp, a personal trainer in Treforest, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said: \"It's great we have been given the opportunity to open early, but realistically we are still back of the queue with no data to back it up.\n\"When you look at the data and you see gyms contribute to two cases in 100,000 visits, you wonder why you aren't being allowed to open.\"\nAlthough she admitted to not being an avid user of gyms, molecular epidemiologist Dr Helen Wimalarathna said there was a risk to reopening them, but this needed to be balanced against the benefit to people's health.\n\"It's a question of ventilation and how much people exhale in a gym environment,\" she said.\n\"Getting hot and sweaty and breathing out over the equipment, then there's a high degree of sanitisation that needs to take place afterwards before it is safe for someone else to use that space.\n\"But obviously exercise is really important for people, physically and mentally, and we know that physical health and underlying factors like obesity have really contributed to the worst of this pandemic, so it is good to give people the opportunity to keep in shape.\"\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmed that lockdown changes which had been planned for 12 April would go ahead. \nThis means, from Monday, all remaining children will return to school for face-to-face learning, non-essential shops will reopen, and close-contact services, such as beauticians, will be allowed to reopen. \nNon-essential retailers have been closed since Wales went into lockdown on 20 December. \nTravel across the border between Wales and England will also be permitted from Monday. \nWales' \"stay local\" rule was removed on 27 March, allowing people to travel anywhere within its borders, but the changes will allow travel across the whole of the UK. \nThe decision follows a rapid drop in the number of new coronavirus cases in Wales. \nDates for the reopening of the hospitality industry in Wales have not changed, despite the other alterations to lockdown easing dates. \nPubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to open outdoors from 26 April and indoor service could be allowed from the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. \nPubs in England can reopen outdoors from Monday. \nWales' case rate, which measures the number of infections per 100,000 people over a seven-day period, stands at 21, compared to 37 last week.\nConfirmed cases in hospital beds are 26% lower than last Thursday, the lowest number since 22 September.\nMr Drakeford said: \"Last week, we set out our programme to further reopen the economy and relax the restrictions we have lived with for so long, as part of our careful, step-by-step approach to keeping everyone safe. \n\"This week, because of the improvements we continue to see, we can bring forward some of our plans. This is only possible because of the efforts everyone is making to protect themselves and their loved ones.\"\nAny of the changes proposed after 6 May could depend on the outcome of the Senedd elections and which party is in power.\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: \"Plaid Cymru has been pressing the case for gyms to reopen as quickly and as safely as is possible because they are crucial for people's mental health and well-being. This new date, whilst welcome, is still not early enough. \n\"The scenes of unregulated drinking over recent days has been a serious cause of concern and many will question the Labour government's decision not to move the reopening of outdoor hospitality forward. A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option.\"\nAndrew RT Davies, the Senedd leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: \"The great British vaccination programme protects more and more lives every day and gives us the ability to restore freedoms in a safe but accelerated manner.\n\"Pressure from the public and Welsh Conservatives have forced Labour ministers to act, but there is still more they can do in accelerating the roadmap with the safe resumption of activities such as outdoor hospitality and gyms.\"\nJane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: \"This is welcome news. Gyms and fitness centres play an important part in both the physical and mental health of so many people across Wales. Everyone who has abided by the rules has played a part in bringing this announcement forward.\n\"The public must remember however that the virus has not gone away and they need to stick to the rules including with regard to social distancing.\""

      "text": "Wales has given 84% of people eligible for Covid boosters a vaccination, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales.\nThe programme has slowed down since before Christmas, delivering 3,752 booster doses a day in the last week.\nAt its height, 50,524 doses were given out on 21 December.\nTwo-thirds of vaccines given out in the past weeks were boosters, while more than 13,000 second doses, mainly to 12 to 15-year-olds.\nPeople can receive a booster three months after receiving their second vaccine, so it means that 84% of those eligible for a booster vaccine have now been reached in Wales.\nThat figure on 27 January was also 84% in Scotland, 81% in England and 75% in Northern Ireland.\nTo reach the remaining eligible people, at the current rate, it would take just over three months.\nThe situation is complicated by those who catch Covid having to wait before they can receive a booster, with higher proportions of the 18 to 40 age group infected since Christmas.\nThe total is 1,875,473 boosters given out by 27 January.\nThese include more than 42% of 18 to 29-year-olds and more than half of those in their 30s.\nWe can see that by last Sunday, 68% of adults had received their booster jab.\nMonmouthshire (78.6%) had reached the most and Cardiff (61.7%) the fewest.\nWith the over-50s, Monmouthshire has reached more than 88% and Powys, Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend and Caerphilly more than 87%. Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot (about 82%) have reached the fewest.\nAround 77% of people in their early 50s had also been given the booster and 81% of those in their late 50s.\nFor care home residents, the range is from just over 82% in Pembrokeshire to 96.6% of those on Anglesey having a booster.\nWales is slightly behind Scotland with the proportions of their populations given a first jab - 79.1%.\nBy 27 January, 2.5m people in Wales had been given their first dose. \nA total of 2,361,042 people have received a second jab, or 74.5% of the total population. \nMore than 64% of 16 and 17-year-olds have now received a second dose.\nWales (74.9%) and Scotland (75.3%) are close together on the proportions of second vaccinations.\nBy 27 January, England was on 71.6% and Northern Ireland trailing a little on 69.1%.\nFor the proportion of its population with booster doses, Wales is ranked fifth in the world, compared with other nations with a population above 1 million.\nWhen we look at figures within Wales, we can see Powys reached nearly 81% of its total population with two doses and 67.9% with boosters. \nSwansea Bay has reached the fewest proportion for vaccines, for all three doses (54.2%).\nNearly 62% of the youngest age group offered vaccines have taken a first dose in Wales by Wednesday.\nBut there is a big variation between counties. This ranged up to last Sunday from 74.1% in Monmouthshire and 70% in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) to less than half of 12 to 15-year-olds in Neath Port Talbot taking up the offer.\nRCT and Merthyr Tydfil have so far reached nearly half of this age group with second doses too."

      "tags": "Merthyr Tydfil,Cardiff,Newport,NHS Wales,Mountain Ash,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?\nHere we update some of the key areas of data for measuring the pandemic and we also try to explain some of the different measures being used. \nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 led to record case numbers and fears that a surge in cases could put pressure on hospitals already struggling - as a result, tighter rules were imposed on 26 December.\nBy the second week of January, case numbers began to fall quickly. One week later, the Welsh government was confident the peak had passed and Wales moved to the lowest level of restrictions - alert level zero - on Friday. \nWe saw record numbers of Covid cases in the community in the days after Christmas but this did not translate into a significant rise in hospital cases, with the number of Covid patients now falling for more than a week.\nThere was a rolling average of 560 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on 27 January, a 22% drop on a week ago, although the daily figure has now risen for two successive days to 566.\nThere were two and a half times as many people in hospital with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2021. \nWhen we include patients with suspected Covid and recovering from Covid, there are an average of 1,028 patients. They make up 12% of all hospital patients.  \nThere are now 470 patients who are recovering, so they no longer test positive for Covid but are either still rehabilitating or waiting for a discharge or care support or place to become available. This is the highest number of these patients since last March.\nThe number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stood at 20 on 27 January. This is a figure we last saw in early August.\nThe average daily number has fallen from 28 to 21 in a week.\nAbout 90% of these patients are primarily being treated for Covid.\nThere are seven times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. \nAt the same point in 2021, there were 134 critically ill Covid patients.\nThe mortality rate of a critical care Covid patient, in the most recent study of 623 Welsh patients since May 2021, is about 35%, including those who died later in a general ward.\nAbout half had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic.\nThe average age is 55, nearly two-thirds are men and they are more likely to be overweight. Nearly half are from more deprived parts of Wales. Just under a third are aged under 50.\nThe study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 25 a day - lower than the average of 40 last week - and make up 2.3% of all hospital admissions.\nWe can also see how they are running lower than modelled scenarios, based on various estimates based on vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can see from a comparison with December-January 2020-21, that despite much higher numbers of cases in the community, the hospital admissions rate is much lower.\nAccounting for a 10-day lag between cases being confirmed and hospital admissions, on 24 January, Covid hospital admissions were just less than 1% of positive Covid tests, compared to 9.4% at the same point in 2021.\nAdmissions have been considerably lower compared to the second wave.\nNearly six in 10 cases of patients in hospital with confirmed Covid in the last week were patients being treated for other conditions.\nOnly 41.5% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus.\nBut that proportion rises to 90% of those in critical are.\nThe figures on these \"incidental\" Covid cases are only just being published and reflect the fact there has been a lot of people being infected out in the community, while in the latest week there were 220 patients who caught Covid \"probably\" or \"definitely\" while in hospital for other reasons.\nNearly 10,000 patients have hospital-acquired Covid since the start of the pandemic.\nIt doesn't mean that these patients can't have complications because of having Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.\nSeparate analysis of Covid admissions to Welsh hospitals between the start of the pandemic and August 2021 in Wales estimated that 71.2% were directly due to Covid.\nIn cases where Covid wasn't the primary cause, trauma injuries made up nearly one in five cases, with Welsh Government scientists saying acute illnesses were known to increase the propensity to fall, which on top of reduced physical activity and consequent muscle loss due to shielding and self-isolation issues, \"would increase the likelihood of hip fractures\".\nOne indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which has been 90.7% on average for the week, at its highest level over the last two weeks.\nThe other measure is NHS staff absence.\nLatest figures show NHS staff sickness related to Covid-19 in Wales has improved slightly over the last two weeks after being at its highest level since the start of the first wave.  \nOverall staff absence was slightly higher last winter.\nA total of 1.5% of staff were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 24 January. Another 1% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the weekly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. \nThe total absence proportion has dropped to 7.1%.\nAbout 84% of those eligible for a booster in Wales have now received one.\nThere have been an average of 3,494 boosters given out a day in the past week, which has seen a drop off, as the programme works through people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Before Christmas, the daily average was 42,500.\nAt the peak of the vaccine programme in March, between 38,000 and 40,000 daily vaccines were given out. \nAbout 61% of all vaccines being given out are boosters, with nearly two thirds of 12 to 15-year-olds now having a second dose.\nThe chart above shows the number of people admitted to hospital who have had two doses of vaccine, and those who have had none, for every 100,000 people.\nIt shows the rate of admissions for over-60s who have not had a jab is nearly triple that of those who have been double jabbed and is also far higher for the 18-59 age group.\nThe latest infection survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests - based on swab samples of 9,430 people - that one in 30 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 22 January.\nThat is 99,500 people, or 3.27% of the population.\nThat's estimated to be highest in youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nThis shows another decrease, compared to the estimate of 112,100 the previous week.\nWhen it comes to age groups, the highest proportion of people infected are youngest children - 10% of two-year-olds.\nCase rates are becoming more problematic to interpret, because three-quarters of people who test positive for lateral flow tests are no longer asked to take follow-up PCR tests.\nThe infection survey is a useful indicator, as it picks up asymptomatic people.\nONS says it shows Covid infections fell in Wales, as in England and Scotland, with an uncertain trend in Northern Ireland. Similar surveys showed infections were one in 30 in Scotland too and one in 20 in England and Northern Ireland. \nIt's now more than two weeks since results from the new testing criteria started coming in, which meant most asymptomatic people no longer needed to take follow-up PCR tests if they tested positive with a lateral flow device. \nAround 80% of those testing positive for lateral flows did not take a follow-up test in the latest week.\nWe know that there were 17,000 people with positive LFTs in the week to 22 January, who did not have follow-up PCR tests and so were not included in the case rate figures - set against 16,000 positive PCR results in the same period. LFT results are published weekly and so we have to be careful with comparisons and interpretation.\nBut if we look at the trend from those figures taken roughly together, in the latest week they would have pushed up the case rate more noticeably than it has risen in recent days. But this is still well down on the numbers we saw in early January.\nThe positivity rate has levelled out - at 34.4% - roughly the same as the week before.\nThe nature of this wave so far has been defined by the age profile.\nThis can also be seen in the big change in January 2022, compared to the week in 2021.\nAround 10% of Covid cases in Wales were in the over-60s, compared to 22% in the very early days of the vaccine roll out in January 2021. \nThere has been a big rise in the proportion of cases in the under 19 age group, now making up a third of all cases.\nThis is back to a share not seen since September and early October and can probably be linked to schools going back.\nAbsence for Covid-related reasons in primary schools has been an average of 4.7% and 2.7% in secondary schools in the last week.\nMost age groups are showing a decline, although there has been a recent rise in the under 16 age group.\nThis week, the proportion of cases among the under 19 age group reached 37% of all positive tests for the first time since September.\nThe 30 to 39 age group remained the largest group. \nCouncil areas in Cardiff and Vale and the Aneurin Bevan health board area all showed rises, as 13 of Wales' 22 local authority areas showed falls in under 25s in the week ending 20 January.\nNewport (1122.9 cases per 100,000) had the highest rate in the under 25s, as it did for case rates as a whole, showing how younger people have generally driven rises in case rates.\nNewport also had above average case numbers in the over 60s.\nMeanwhile, the R-number - reproduction number - for Wales has been estimated at the slightly lower range, between 1.1 and 1.5, up to 13 January. This is a calculation which looks at various factors to work out a transmission rate for Covid. It suggests that for every 10 people with Covid, another 11 to 13 people would be infected.\nRecent modelling, published on 7 January, indicated a rise over the following two weeks, with the situation unlikely to ease. \nBut a fall in cases led First Minister Mark Drakeford, a week later, to say there were \"positive signs that the peak may have passed\" although he added caution over a \"fast-moving and volatile variant\".\nBy 21 January, after a sharp drop, he could say \"confidently\" that Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron wave and the \"incredibly high levels of infections we have seen across Wales\".\nThe latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests that 97.4% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.\nAlthough slightly less than the other UK nations, it is an increasing proportion and the highest yet recorded, since estimates began more than a year ago.\nThe estimate is 97.2% of 16 to 24-year-olds would have tested positive for antibodies, although it falls to 96.4% for those aged over 80. It is as high as 98.2% for people in their 70s. \nONS also estimates that 88% of 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales have antibodies.\nIn the most recent week, up to 14 January, 69 people in Wales had a death which involved Covid-19 - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate.\nThis compared to 61 deaths registered in the previous week, according to the ONS.\nIn 77.4% of cases (across England and Wales) in the latest week, Covid was the underlying cause of death - so deaths were due to Covid. This is a lower proportion than seen in earlier months, when it averaged 87%.\nThere were no deaths from Covid in only three counties in the latest week: Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Powys.\nThe Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 18 deaths.\nDuring 2021, there were 4,007 deaths involving Covid, of those registered up to now.\nThat includes 204 deaths in December. Back in December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.\nThe second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths alone on 11 January 2021 - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.\nA total of 9,384 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales - with 65 actually occurring, rather than just being registered, over the most recent week.\nThe ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.\nBecause Public Health Wales' \"snapshot\" measure only includes deaths within 28 days and after a positive Covid lab test, mostly in hospitals, it excludes deaths involving Covid elsewhere, including many deaths in the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds of deaths in people's own homes and where doctors suspect Covid has been a contributory factor.\nONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared to the five-year, non-pandemic average.\nSo since March 2020, there have been 6,520 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.\nDeaths ran above average for the last half of 2021 and in the latest week were the same as the five-year norm. \nNearly a fifth of all Covid deaths (19%) registered have occurred in care homes.\nThere were 10 deaths involving a care home resident in the latest week.\nCare Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,019 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid- 16.1% of all reported deaths.\nDeaths in people's own homes have also been running at more than a third higher than average.\nWe can also see how deaths in the third wave have been at much lower levels than in the second wave.\nCovid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in Wales in December. \nMortality analysis by the ONS showed it accounted for 5.4% of all registered deaths. This compares with 5.2% of all deaths in England.\nCovid was the third leading cause of death in the previous three months and had been ranked as the leading cause of death in six months since the pandemic began.\nDementia, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases were the three leading causes of death in Wales in December. Flu and pneumonia ranked seventh, with the mortality rate significantly lower than normal levels.\nCovid was the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease throughout 2021.\nThe ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 59.3 deaths per 100,000 - significantly lower than the previous month. This was lower than five of the nine English regions: the north west, north east, east and west Midlands and the highest in London (70 deaths per 100,000).\nFour health board areas in Wales had mortality rates in December higher than the Welsh average - the highest was 107 deaths per 100,000 in Cardiff and Vale due to Covid.\nAcross the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is the same in Wales and England - 147.4 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (126.9) and Northern Ireland (132.5) both lower in the 22 months to the end of December.\nThe age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England, than in Wales.\nWhen a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales again.\nONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found since the pandemic began, Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 79.6% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales. \nThis is a fall from 83.9% in November. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic it has been 87%.\nIn around 3% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".\nA doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. \nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.\nBy the second week of January, RCT and Cardiff each had a total 1,024 deaths.\nRCT also has the seventh highest mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales.\nSix of its communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates are broken down further.\nThe area with the highest number of deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic was Tonyrefail, with a total of 57 deaths due to Covid, followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot (52) and Porth East in Rhondda Cynon Taf (48 deaths), by the end of April 2021.\nWhen translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Llanelli Bigyn is the highest, followed by Port Talbot East.\nAnd there is one community remaining which has had no Covid deaths at all through the pandemic - Llandudno Junction South & Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.\nIn the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.\nThe ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing:\nPublic Health Wales' daily updates on its online dashboard show numbers of deaths and positive tests for coronavirus:\nThe graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW. There is also a similar count used by the UK government, which takes the PHW statistics and involves people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid.\nThere is a difference of about 2,620 deaths.\nAccording to the PHW measure, on 28 January, there had been a total of 6,804 deaths with Covid, with the daily average running at four a day in the last week.\nMore than eight million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic so far.\nNHS Wales labs have capacity to handle 15,000 a day but private labs process most of the test results.\nAlthough PHW figures show more than 765,000 positive tests, this is not the total number of people who have had Covid as mass testing was not available until the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic.\nSince the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, more lateral flow tests (LFTs) of asymptomatic people have been undertaken, which saw more positive tests eventually feeding into the system - adding about 10% to numbers.\nThe most recent week has seen more than 383,000 LFTs, with a record 21,127 positive. This positive proportion of 11% in the week ending 23 January, was another record. \nThe highest incidence is still among the under 20s - 8,873 positive tests, an 87% rise - and the positivity rate of 24.9% is also the highest  -which is likely to be associated with schools going back.\nIt is the only age group showing a rise, although figures will not show up in overall case numbers.\nFrom 6 January 2022, most people who take LFTs are not being asked to take a follow-up PCR test if positive. This will affect the number of cases which appear - only counting those who come forward with symptoms. This will have to be taken into account when interpreting case data.\nAbout 19,000 tests are routinely taken in hospitals each week and 25,000 in care homes. \nThe number of tests processed in the last two weeks have showed a big drop - half what they were a fortnight ago.\nAbout 96% of tests requiring a rapid turnaround were completed within one calendar day.\nThere have been 1,068 positive tests in care homes among residents and staff in the latest week, following routine testing. This is down on two weeks before, which set a record high since the programme returned in October 2020.\nCare Inspectorate Wales figures also show 235 (22.3%) care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.\nThis is also fall on the previous week.\nIn the last two weeks, there have also been 39 reported deaths of residents with confirmed or suspected Covid.\nThe dominant variant in Wales is now Omicron, with more than 12,344 new cases sequenced.\nNumbers are now only being reported weekly, as the variant has taken hold.\nPHW increased lab capacity in readiness for sequencing more cases. About 20-30% of positive cases in Wales, which are flagged as being more likely to be variants, have swabs sent for sequencing, with results coming back a few days after people get their normal test results.\nWe can also see more people reporting symptoms of \"long Covid\" - 58,000 estimated in Wales to be experiencing the long-term effect of having the virus. \nThis includes 21,000 people estimated to still be reporting symptoms a year or more after their infection."

      "text": "Three people were arrested as campaigners protested against the felling of a woodland said to have inspired Roald Dahl. \nNatural England issued licences last week permitting the felling of two-thirds of Jones' Hill Wood, which is in the path of HS2. \nCampaigners said they wanted to \"fight for the woodland\" in Buckinghamshire.\nA spokesman for the high-speed rail line said 4.1 hectares (10 acres) of new woodland would be created nearby.\nThe three have been charged with obstructing a public highway, while a fourth was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence dating to last month, and released under investigation.\nThe estimated final cost of the HS2 project is now more than \u00a3100bn.\nRoald Dahl wrote his stories in the Buckinghamshire town of Great Missenden, and classics like Fantastic Mr Fox are said to have taken inspiration from the beech wood.\nIts felling had been delayed since last year after bats were discovered roosting at the site, which is in the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\nOn 30 March, Natural England's director for wildlife licensing and enforcement cases Dave Slater said: \"After careful assessment, we have determined that the felling of a small number of trees at Jones' Hill Wood will not be detrimental to the overall conservation status of the bat populations in this area.\" \nHe added \"mitigations\", including the creation of new roosts, had been put in place. \nA protester in her mid-20s, who called herself Pigeon, was involved in an aerial stand-off with a bailiff on Wednesday that went on for several hours.\nSpeaking to the BBC from high in the branches of a beech tree, she said she was \"here to fight for the woodland - I'm making a stand\".\nShe said: \"I'm here in physical form because the legal system is not designed to protect the environment.\n\"HS2 isn't encouraging rail travel - if it were then it would be making it cheaper and more accessible than car travel. \n\"It will be more expensive, and it won't be carbon neutral in its 120-year lifetime.\"\nThe campaigner, who has been at the site on-and-off for nearly a year, added: \"The damage that is being done to facilitate this railway is extreme.\" \nDahl, a keen walker, wrote Fantastic Mr Fox in 1970.\nThe much-loved story tells the tale of wily Mr Fox, who outwits farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean.\nThe real-life Bunce family still farms the area. Peter Bunce told the BBC that he played in the wood with his brother and sisters as a child and added he was \"gutted\" at its destruction. \n\"It's disappearing as we look in front of us,\" he said. \"It's just hollow. There's no feeling left. \n\"It used to be full up with primroses, foxgloves, bluebells, wood anemones, all sorts of things \u2026 it's disgusting what they have done.\"\nThe construction and operation of Phase One of HS2 is authorised by the High Speed Rail (London - West Midlands) Act 2017. \nIt plans to create a new woodland, planting 22,000 trees, which will link to the remains of Jones' Hill Wood, connecting it to another wood.\nAlex Towse, construction director with HS2 contractor Fusion JV, said: \"What we are doing through the compensation is to look at the native species that are already within the landscape and design a mitigation scheme that is sympathetic to what is around it. \n\"And by joining up those existing habitats, it creates a green corridor along the route.\"\nHS2 said it would plant up to seven million trees and shrubs along the first phase of the line and create more than 33 sq km (12.7 sq miles) of new woodland, wildlife and river habitats. \nIt claims to be one of the most sustainable high-speed railways in the world, supporting the UK's transition to a net zero economy. \nFollow Claire on Twitter"

      "title": "George Floyd died from lack of oxygen, not fentanyl, says expert",
      "tags": "Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "George Floyd died from a lack of oxygen during his arrest, a doctor at the trial of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis has said.\nContradicting the defence, Dr Martin Tobin said fentanyl did not cause Mr Floyd's death. He said even a \"healthy person...would have died\".\nMr Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May.\nThe ex-officer is on trial for murder and has denied the charges against him.\nThe footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on African-American Mr Floyd's neck sparked global protests against racism.\nProsecutors are trying to prove Mr Chauvin's use of force resulted in Mr Floyd's death, while Mr Chauvin's defence are seeking to show he was following his training and that drugs may have caused Mr Floyd's death.\nThe trial is in its second week and is expected to last for at least one month. The defence is due to begin arguing its case in court next week.\nA toxicology report released last June said that Mr Floyd had the painkiller fentanyl and the drug methamphetamine in his system. \nSince then, the defence has argued that the fentanyl caused Mr Floyd's loss of oxygen.\nHowever Dr Tobin, an intensive care doctor, said that Mr Floyd's breathing did not slow down enough for the painkiller to have been a factor in his total loss of oxygen.\nForensic toxicologist Daniel Isenschmid, whose laboratory tested Mr Floyd's blood and urine samples following his death, said there was evidence that some of the fentanyl had metabolised, meaning that an overdose was less likely.\nThe defence also questioned Kentucky police surgeon Dr Bill Smock, an expert in forensic emergency medicine.\nDr Smock said Mr Floyd displayed \"air hunger\", a term for when the body becomes desperate for oxygen. While a fentanyl overdose can slow down breathing, he said people who are overdosing are not aware that they are lacking oxygen and often appear sleepy. In contrast, he said Mr Floyd appeared to be alert.\nOn cross-examination, he agreed with the defence that there was \"no safe\" amount of methamphetamine to be in someone's system, and that an overdose of methamphetamine and fentanyl combined may look different from fentanyl alone.\nDr Smock also told the court that while viewing the footage, he heard Mr Floyd complain about being unable to breathe before he was restrained on the ground.\nAsked about the positioning of the handcuffs behind Mr Floyd's back, coupled with the downward pressure of Mr Chauvin's weight against him, Dr Tobin - an expert in pulmonary medicine - said that Mr Floyd's ability to expand his chest to breathe was severely impaired.\nIt was, Dr Tobin said, like the left side of his chest was \"in a vice\".\nDr Tobin said the positioning of the handcuffs was also significant.\n\"It's how they're being pushed, where they are being pushed, that totally interfere with central features of how we breathe.\"\n\"[Mr Floyd] has used up his resources and is literally trying to breathe with his fingers and knuckles against the street to try to crank up his chest, to try to get air into his right lung,\" he added.\n\"You can see he's conscious, you can see slight flickering and then it disappears. One second he's alive, one second he's no longer.\"\nDr Tobin said that Mr Floyd had already shown signs of brain injury about four minutes before Mr Chauvin took his knee off his neck, and that a healthy person who was put through this \"would have died\" too.\nAbout three minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee, Dr Tobin said, there was \"not an ounce of oxygen left in his body\".\n\"The knee remains on the neck for another three minutes and 27 seconds after he takes his last breath,\" Dr Tobin said. \"After the officers have found themselves that there's no pulse, the knee remains on the neck for another two minutes and 44 seconds.\"\nDr Tobin used footage captured during Mr Floyd's arrest to provide his medical opinion on the ninth day of Mr Chauvin's trial.\nDuring his cross-examination, defence attorney Eric Nelson suggested that Dr Tobin's assessment was \"conditioned upon [Mr Floyd] being a healthy individual\".\n\"We understand that Mr Floyd had some heart disease,\" Mr Nelson said. \"That's going to affect blood flow in a person?\"\nDr Tobin said that if Mr Floyd had been suffering from a coronary condition at the time he would have been \"complaining of chest pain and demonstrating a very rapid respiratory rate,\" adding: \"We don't see either.\"\nThe court has heard from witnesses, medical experts and police officers. The moments leading to Mr Floyd's encounter with police, as well as the footage that sparked nationwide protests, have been closely scrutinised.\nThe early stages of the trial saw often tearful testimony from onlookers. The teenager whose video of the arrest went viral said \"it's been nights I stay up apologising and apologising to George Floyd for not doing more\".\nThis week the Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo said Mr Chauvin had violated the agency's policy on using force. An expert witness also said that the use of force was \"excessive\". \nThe defence has sought to show Mr Chauvin acted lawfully in a volatile situation. His lawyer said the evidence \"is clearly more than about nine minutes and 29 seconds,\" referring to the videos of Mr Floyd's death. \nThe jury's verdict must be unanimous and US police officers are rarely convicted or charged at all for deaths that occur in custody."

      "text": "An aspiring Hollywood actor has been accused of scamming millions from film investors by tricking them with fake Netflix deals to fund a lavish lifestyle.\nZachary Horwitz, 34, was arrested on Tuesday by FBI agents on suspicion of running a $690m (\u00a3502m) Ponzi scheme.\nMr Horwitz, whose stage name is Zach Avery, allegedly raised funds from investors for film licensing deals with Netflix and HBO that did not exist.\nHe was charged with wire fraud.\nIf convicted, he could be jailed for up to 20 years.\nThe criminal complaint was filed by prosecutors and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday. \nIt accuses Mr Horwitz of using investor funds for \"lavish personal spending\", including extravagant trips to Las Vegas, flights on chartered jets, payments for high-end cars and the purchase of a $5.7m mansion in Los Angeles.\n\"We allege that Horwitz promised extremely high returns and made them seem plausible by invoking the names of two well-known entertainment companies and fabricating documents,\" Michele Wein Layne, a senior SEC official, said in a statement on Tuesday.\nAs an actor, Mr Horwitz has not had the most illustrious career in Hollywood. Other than an uncredited part in Fury - a 2014 American war film starring Brad Pitt - Mr Horwitz has mostly appeared in low-budget films with mediocre ratings.\nA lawyer for Mr Horwitz, Anthony Pacheco, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nAt first glance, Lucia's Grace - an Italian comedy released in 2018 - doesn't seem like a lucrative prospect for investors.\nIn a largely scathing review, Variety magazine critic Jay Weissberg said the film \"can generously be called a pleasant comic bauble\", panning its script as lacking \"cohesion\" and trying too hard to be \"as blandly populist as possible\".\nThe tone of the review is reflected in the film's 43% critics' rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website.\nStill, with the backing of major streaming platforms, the film theoretically had potential to make money.\nAt least that's what investors told prosecutors they were led to believe by Mr Horwitz.\nFrom 2015, he promised investors that his company, 1inMM Capital LLC, would use their funds to buy the rights to distribute films in Latin America, Africa and New Zealand.\nDistribution deals had been struck with Netflix and HBO, Mr Horwitz allegedly told investors.\nThrough these deals, backers were promised returns of at least 35% within a year.\nBut in reality, 1inMM had no business relationship with either company, prosecutors say.\nMr Horwitz allegedly showed investors fabricated agreements and emails regarding the purported deals with HBO and Netflix.\n\"I believed that if HBO was involved, my investment was safe,\" one investor was quoted as saying in the criminal complaint.\nAt some points, Mr Horwitz was able to pay some investors, using funds raised from other investors to do so. But prosecutors say the scheme collapsed in 2019 when 1inMM Capital began defaulting on payments.\nThe criminal complaint alleges Mr Horwitz \"deposited or transferred at least some investor funds to his personal bank accounts\". \nSome of the payments listed in the complaint include $691,800 to a celebrity interior decorator,  $165,408 for luxury cars, $137,072 for chartered jets flights and f $54,600 for a watch subscription service. \nAt a court appearance on Tuesday, a judge set Mr Horwitz's bond, or bail, at $1m."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Young people,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Under-30s in the UK are to be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots.\nThe recommendation comes after a review by the UK drugs regulator found that by the end of March 79 people had suffered rare blood clots after vaccination - 19 of whom had died.\nThe regulator said this was not proof the jab had caused the clots.\nBut it said the link was getting firmer.\nThe review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found: \nMeanwhile, the EU's medicines regulator says unusual blood clots should be listed as a possible very rare side effect of the AstraZeneca jab, but that the benefits outweighed the risks. Some European countries have restricted the vaccine's use.\nThe World Health Organization said the link between the vaccine and blood clots was \"plausible\" but not confirmed, adding that the clotting incidents were \"very rare\" among nearly 200 million people who have received the jab worldwide.\nNo treatment or vaccine is risk free. The key question is whether it does more good than harm.\nWednesday's update once again demonstrates the AstraZeneca vaccine does - even if you assume it's causing these clots, which has not been proven yet.\nThe risk of dying from one of them following vaccination is incredibly small - about one in a million.\nBy contrast, Covid kills one in eight people who are infected over the age of 75, and one in 1,000 infected in their 40s among those who develop symptoms.\nIt is less clear cut for those under 30, who are much less likely to die of Covid - although the AstraZeneca vaccine still presents more benefit than risk.\nHowever, other vaccines may be an even better bet.\nThe risk might look worrying, but it is actually very low, and usually we don't think about things just in terms of risk.\nFor example, travelling 250 miles in a car also carries with it a one-in-a-million chance of dying in an accident. How many think about that when they get behind the wheel?\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK's review confirmed that the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is \"safe, effective and the benefits far outweigh the risks for the vast majority of adults\". \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the AstraZeneca vaccine had \"already saved thousands of lives\" and the new advice should ensure people of all ages \"continue to have full confidence in vaccines\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer also urged people to \"trust in our doctors and scientists\" and said he was looking forward to receiving his second AstraZeneca dose.\nAstraZeneca said both the MHRA and the EMA reviews reaffirmed that the benefits of the vaccine \"continue to far outweigh the risks\". \nThe UK reported a further 45 deaths from Covid-19 and another 2,763 confirmed cases on Wednesday. Vaccinations remained low after the Easter weekend, with 186,793 second doses administered and 85,227 first doses.\nJune Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said the side-effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine were \"extremely rare\" - and more work was going to identify if the vaccine was definitely causing the clots. \n\"The balance of benefits and known risks is still very favourable for the majority of people,\" she said.\nBut she said for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\". \nShe added: \"The public's safety is at the forefront of our minds.\"\nDr Raine said there was a \"reasonably plausible\" link between the vaccine and the blood clots.\nThe review prompted the UK government's vaccine advisory group, the JCVI, to recommend that people aged 18 to 29 be offered an alternative vaccine where available.\nProfessor Lim Wei Shen, of the JCVI, said the move was being made \"out of the utmost caution rather than because we have any serious safety concerns\".\nProf Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chairman of the Commission on Human Medicines, said the risks had to be weighed against the consequences of Covid-19, which also causes clotting.\nHe said 7.8% of coronavirus patients suffer blood clots on the lungs, while 11.2% will suffer deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs.\nPeople who have had their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should still get their second dose, the MHRA said. Only those who suffered one of these rare blood clots after the first dose should not get vaccinated, it added.\nPregnant women and people with blood disorders that leave them at risk of clotting should discuss the benefits and risks of vaccination with their doctor before going for a jab.\nAnyone who suffers symptoms such as a persistent headache, blurred vision or confusion for four days or more after vaccination or who experience unusual skin bruising, shortness of breath or chest pain are being asked to seek medical advice.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, described the move as a \"course correction\" - and said it was normal in medicine to change preferences in this way.\nHe also said the impact on the government's promise to offer all adults a jab by the end of July should be \"zero or negligible\" as long as the expected supplies of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines - the other two Covid vaccines in use in the UK - arrived as expected in the coming months."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Unusual blood clots in the brain have been detected in a handful of people after they were injected with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThese \"cerebral venous sinus thromboses\" or CVSTs have led some countries - including Germany, France and Canada - to restrict who can be given the jab. The World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks.\nScientists and medicines safety regulators around the world are trying to figure out if the vaccine is genuinely causing these strokes, how big any risk might be and what that might mean for vaccination programmes. \nAt the moment, we do not know. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA), which has been reviewing the safety data, says it is \"not proven, but is possible\".\nThe organisation has to figure out whether the reported clots are a side-effect or a coincidence that would have happened naturally. This is incredibly hard when dealing with rare events. If, on the other hand, one in every 10,000 people was having serious blood clots then the answer would be obvious.\nI have spoken to respected scientists some of whom are sceptical, others increasingly convinced. \nSome point to the highly unusual nature of the clots as a sign something could be going on. They are often appearing at the same time as low levels of blood platelets, which are one of the main components of a clot, and antibodies linked to other clotting disorders appearing in the blood. \nOthers say there is not enough proof and the reported cases could plausibly be down to Covid, which itself is linked to abnormal clotting. \nIt remains entirely possible the risk is zero as vaccines are not proven to cause the brain clots. \nGermany's Paul Ehrlich Institute has reported 31 cerebral venous sinus thromboses and nine deaths out of 2.7 million people vaccinated there. \nThe most recent UK data reported 30 clots linked with low platelet counts and seven deaths out of 18 million people vaccinated. \nThe European Medicines Agency, which has assessed data from around the world, estimates there is around a one in 100,000 risk of a CVST in people under the age of 60 who have been given the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThe organisation's head of safety monitoring, Dr Peter Arlett, said that was \"more than we would expect to see\". \nHowever, it is uncertain what the background rate of these blood clots in the brain truly is. Estimates vary from around two cases per million people every year to nearly 16 in every million in normal times and coronavirus itself may be causing them too. \nYou might expect to see the same numbers of CVSTs in different countries if they were genuinely being caused by the vaccine. Yet the UK has reported roughly the same number of cases despite giving the vaccine to nearly seven times as many people as Germany.\nOne argument is the type of people being vaccinated is different. \nThe UK has, largely, been working from the oldest age groups down, while Germany was one of the countries that initially refused to use the vaccine in the over 65s because of a lack of trial data. Instead nearly 90% of Germans given AstraZeneca are thought to be under 60.\nSide-effects in general tend to be more severe in younger people as they have a stronger immune response, which has been one speculated reason why the UK has had fewer cases. \nHowever, CVSTs are inherently more common in younger women and taking the pill increases the risk. So the natural risk levels - whether people are vaccinated or not - could have a role too. \nTeasing all this apart is challenging, but the EMA said it had found no specific risk factors such as age, gender or medical history. \nNothing in medicine in completely safe and even therapies that are highly toxic are used in the right circumstance. \nChemotherapy drugs can have brutal side effects, but are hugely valuable; and even over-the-counter painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen have severe side-effects, they are just incredibly rare. \nThe real decision is always whether the benefits outweigh the risks. \nThis is particularly challenging in a pandemic. Normally medicine would rely on the \"precautionary principle\" to prove adequate safety before giving a new medicine to large numbers of people. But in a pandemic, any delays in vaccinating people will also cost lives. \nBased on the Germany data alone, if you vaccinate a million people then you would expect 12 to have a blood clot and four of them to die. \nBut if a million 60-year-olds catch coronavirus then around 20,000 would die of Covid-19. If a million 40-year-olds catch coronavirus then around 1,000 die. It would be a few hundred people in their 30s.\nThe benefits of vaccination clearly increase with age and countries like Germany and Canada have allowed the AstraZeneca vaccine to be used in older age-groups. These decisions will also be driven by which alternative vaccines they have available and who still needs to be immunised. \nThe world is scrutinising the data intensely, but clarity will still take time. \nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "University students in Wales are unlikely to have summer graduation ceremonies for a second year due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nAberystwyth is the latest university to postpone its ceremonies because of uncertainty about when large-scale events can go ahead.\nThe National Union of Students in Wales said it was \"upsetting for students\".\nBut a spokesperson for Universities Wales said the decision had \"not been taken lightly\" by universities.\nNo graduation ceremonies were able to take place in Wales last year and many universities had also hoped to hold delayed ceremonies for 2020 students this summer. \nLast month Cardiff University and Cardiff Metropolitan University said they hoped their ceremonies could be moved to next year, while Swansea University said it would look to reschedule when \"safe and appropriate\".\nBangor University's website still advertises ceremonies in July, but it is understood it will review the decision. \nWrexham Glynd\u0175r University said no decision had been made yet on its ceremonies, which are held during the winter. \nThe latest announcements mean tens of thousands of students will have to wait until at least 2022 before they can put on their caps and gowns.\nGiulia Bellan, 24, said she now faced graduating almost three years after finishing her degree at Cardiff University.\n\"I was an MA student in Journalism for the year 2018-19 and for master's students the graduation is already in the summer of the next year,\" she said.\n\"With this situation I will be celebrating my graduation in 2022.\"\nGiulia said she was disappointed but understood the university's decision. \n\"The university definitely did the right thing, in order to allow everyone and their families to participate in safety, but it's been so long now.\"\nHowever Katie Parker, 21, who is a final year undergraduate of History and Philosophy at Cardiff University, said she thought universities should have considered more options.\n\"It just feels like the universities haven't been thinking with students at the forefront,\" she said.\n\"Graduation is important to students because it gives them an endpoint where they can celebrate the hard work they've put in over their time. \n\"It's a time when you feel like your time at university is officially recognised.\n\"I would have thought that ceremonies with smaller groups of students, potentially socially distanced, or with no audience could have been something they could have seriously looked into.\"\nPostponing the ceremonies does not effect students' ability to graduate from their course. \nNUS Wales President Becky Ricketts said she was \"disappointed\" for students. \n\"Graduation represents the end of the student journey, so to not have the opportunity to celebrate is upsetting for students across Wales,\" said Ms Ricketts.\n\"This has been a uniquely difficult year for students, so it's vitally important that universities guarantee that students who have missed out on graduation are given the opportunity to celebrate their outstanding achievements in person when it's deemed safe to do so.\" \nA spokesperson for Universities Wales said: \"The decisions taken by institutions about this year's graduation ceremonies are incredibly difficult ones, and are not being taken lightly.\n\"The safety and wellbeing of students and staff is the top priority for universities in Wales and - as they have done so throughout the pandemic - any decisions taken will reflect current restrictions, and public health and government advice.\n\"Welsh universities are determined to celebrate the achievements of graduating students who have completed their degrees amidst the challenge of a global pandemic.\n\"Institutions will be doing all they can to help graduates to mark and celebrate this important occasion including holding online virtual celebration events.\""

      "text": "Islamic scholars and NHS leaders are urging Muslims not to let fasting over Ramadan stop them getting a Covid jab.\nDuring Ramadan many Muslims abstain from food and drink in daylight hours. \nIslamic teaching says Muslims should refrain \"from anything entering the body\" between sunrise and sunset.\nBut Qari Asim, an imam in Leeds, said that because the vaccine goes into the muscle rather than the bloodstream and is not nutritious, it does not amount to breaking the fast. \n\"The majority of the Islamic scholars are of the view that taking the vaccine during Ramadan will not invalidate the fast,\" Mr Asim, who chairs the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, told the BBC. \nHe said his message to the Muslim community was: \"If you are eligible for the vaccine and have received your invite, you need to ask yourself: do you take the vaccine which has proven to be effective or do you risk catching Covid, which can make you quite ill, and you may potentially miss the whole of Ramadan and possibly end up in hospital?\"\nSome NHS vaccine sites in Nottingham and Brighton are extending their opening hours so Muslims can come after they have broken their fast. \nBut Dr Farzana Hussain, a senior GP from The Surgery Project in east London, said there was no need to avoid daylight hours. \n\"We know that a lot of Muslims are a bit concerned about having their Covid vaccination during Ramadan. Many people believe that having an injection actually breaks the fast,\" she said. \"But it doesn't at all because it's not considered nutrition.\"\nShe added: \"The Quran says saving your life is the most important thing: 'To save one life is to save the whole of humanity.' It's a responsibility of a practising Muslim to take their vaccine.\"\nSome mosques are being used as vaccination centres in an effort to boost take up among minority communities. \nPolling from Ipsos Mori suggests a dramatic increase in ethnic minority Britons who say they have had, or are likely to have, the vaccine - from 77% in January to 92% in March.\nRamadan, which is expected to begin on Monday evening after the sighting of the Moon over Mecca, is traditionally marked by regular communal prayers in mosques and shared meals - or Iftars - to break the fast after sunset. \nAlthough communal worship is allowed across the UK, social distancing must be enforced and different households cannot mix indoors.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association (BIMA) has issued guidance for mosques during Ramadan. They recommend keeping Taraweeh - the main evening prayers - short, increasing ventilation, and say imams should wear \"properly fitted double masks to protect congregants\".\nDr Shehla Imtiaz-Umer, a GP in Derby and representative of the BIMA, told the BBC: \"We've seen a lot of devastation in our communities because of the Covid pandemic and we want to try and make sure that our future Ramadans are not affected to this extent.\n\"Unfortunately it's been affected last year and this year.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe UK has more than enough supply of the Pfizer and Moderna jabs to vaccinate all adults under 30, the health secretary says. It comes after the UK drugs regulator advised that people aged 18 to 29 should receive an alternative vaccine due to evidence linking the AstraZeneca jab to rare blood clots. Matt Hancock said the vaccine programme remained \"on track\" despite the change. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said there was no proof the vaccine had caused the clots but the link was getting firmer, while the European Medicines Agency have said the benefits of the jab outweighed the risks.\nThe UK's vaccination programme is beginning to break the link between Covid-19 cases and deaths, scientists tracking the epidemic say. A study found infections had fallen by roughly two-thirds since February, before beginning to level off. While the decline in cases has stalled - probably because people are beginning to mix more - deaths did not follow the same pattern. After a significant fall between February and March, cases were \"just about flat\", says Prof Stephen Riley at Imperial College London, one of the study's authors. \nA public health worker who cared for her mum before she died with bowel cancer in April last year, aged 74, says doing so during lockdown was hard as \"the system was just under so much pressure that we had to manage largely on our own\".  Susan Lowe, from Solihull, says she struggled to get the right pain relief medication for her mother Sheila in her final weeks, telling the BBC: \"My biggest regret is that my mum died in pain.\" Her story reflects a survey that has found unpaid carers struggled to access pain relief during the pandemic. The government says it had taken action to support unpaid carers. \nChina\u2019s response to the Covid-19 outbreak has been scrutinised since the virus was first detected in Wuhan. In response, Beijing has tried to take greater control of what is said about its role in the pandemic - sometimes with questionable tactics. Radio 4 and BBC Monitoring\u2019s Krassi Twigg look at events that have shaped Beijing\u2019s experiment with global misinformation. Have a look at what they found.\nI don\u2019t really like working from home, says the BBC's Tim McDonald from Singapore. Sure, there are advantages, but I find it isolating. I\u2019m sick of sitting in my apartment. I prefer to interact with colleagues face-to-face.  In preparation for this, Tim tried out a new type of workspace. It\u2019s a pay-by-the-minute desk in a booth at a shopping centre.

      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "text": "A marked decline in infections between January and February may have slowed, according to scientists tracking coronavirus in England.\nInfections fell by two-thirds over lockdown, but one in 200 people still have the virus.\nLower virus levels are needed to get the best out of the vaccination programme, Imperial College's React study says.\nSchools are reopening on Monday in England in the first easing of rules.\nBased on swab tests of a random sample of 165,000 people between 4 and 23 February, the study findings estimate that 0.5% of people in England had the virus - down from 1.57% in January.\nThe figures show \"substantial falls\" in household infections in all age groups and in most regions since early January, while lockdown restrictions have been in place.\nIt comes as official figures continue to show sharp falls in confirmed cases, hospital admissions and deaths linked to Covid-19 going back several weeks.\nBut the study found some evidence of smaller falls in infections in Yorkshire and the north-east, and apparent rises in London, the south-east and the Midlands - although this was based on only a few days' worth of data in February.\nAlthough the researchers say it's too early to detect the effect of the vaccination programme on rates of infection in the study, they stress the need to keep infections low while Covid vaccines are being rolled out.\nProf Steven Riley, from Imperial College London, said this was so people \"don't get infected before they get the vaccine\".\nMore than 20 million people across the UK have now received a first dose, with a target to invite all over-50s by mid-April and people in their 40s and 30s after that.\nTo reach the mid-April target, another 12 million people still have to be vaccinated.\nThe researchers say their findings highlight the need for people to continue to follow social-distancing guidelines while the remainder of the population receive their jabs.\nThe React study also found some workers were more likely to be infected than others. They included healthcare workers, care home workers and those working in education, nursery or childcare. \nPublic transport workers had the highest risk, being more than twice as likely as other workers to be infected.\nThose working at home were least likely to have the virus.\nAmong ethnic groups, the highest levels of infection in January and February were found in Bangladeshi people. There were also high infection rates among black, Indian and Pakistani people."

      "text": "Victoria Spence says she fell into a \"deep, dark hole\" about her own body image as a teenager, leading to her developing an eating disorder. \nFrom staring at pictures of \"girls with thigh gaps\" on social media to having her weight shared during a science class, she eventually hit rock bottom, telling her mum that she had begun to hate herself. \nBut when Victoria's parents tried to seek help, her doctor told her that her Body Mass Index (BMI) wasn't low enough for treatment. \n\"I came away and just got worse and worse and worse, because I saw what the doctor said to me as 'you are not thin enough yet, there is still more to go, you should still lose weight',\" the 26-year-old from Manchester told the BBC.\nAfter seeking private treatment and her parents being warned she could die, Victoria is on the road to recovery and shares her story on Instagram with over 100,000 followers, offering support to others. \nShe is now backing the findings of an inquiry by MPs calling for BMI to be scrapped.\nThe report from the Women and Equalities Committee has also branded the government's obesity strategy \"dangerous\", saying some of the measures - such as calorie labels on menus - could affect those with, or at risk of developing, eating disorders.\nThe government says NHS England does not support the use of \"BMI thresholds\" and that its approach is \"guided by the latest research and emerging evidence\".\nBMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight by the square of their height. \nIt gives a number that then fits on a scale, concluding whether someone is underweight, a healthy weight, overweight or obese. \nBut while it is a simple tool, a number of scientists have questioned its validity as a measure of a person's health, saying other factors are not included and it is based on the physique of a European man.\nDuring its inquiry into body image, the committee looked into BMI and concluded it \"inspires weight stigma\".\nIts report said for those with higher BMIs, serious medical issues were being disregarded as simply the patient being \"overweight\" and patients were being made to feel \"shamed\" into losing weight.\nIt also pointed to stories like Victoria's, saying some GPs had \"an over-reliance on BMI, particularly when diagnosing eating disorders\". \nCommittee chair Caroline Nokes said the measure needed to be scrapped and replaced with a \"health at every size\" approach instead.\nThe Tory MP added: \"We know BMI is an absolutely lousy measure of good health in an individual. It works as an average across populations, but for individuals, it really doesn't help at all.\n\"We have seen instances of people who have been refused treatments because their BMI is too high or they have been refused access to eating disorder services because their BMI isn't low enough - and what a dreadful target that is to set anyone with an eating disorder. \n\"We want young people to be enjoying their childhood, we want them to be healthy and active, not obsessing over numbers like BMI.\" \nThe call was backed by eating disorder charity Beat, which said BMI \"should never be used as the sole factor in diagnosing eating disorders, or for determining who is 'unwell enough' to access treatment\".\nIts director of external affairs, Tom Quinn, said: \"This can lead to potentially dangerous delays, and can drive people deeper into eating disorders in order to be taken seriously.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said that NHS England \"had been clear it does not support the use of BMI thresholds\".\nHealth Minister Nadine Dorries also acknowledged to the committee that there was \"good and bad\" in the use of BMI - although she said doctors needed to gauge whether a person is a healthy weight or not.\nThe report also criticised the government's obesity strategy, saying it was \"at best ineffective and at worst perpetuating unhealthy behaviours\".\nBoris Johnson unveiled his plan in July 2020 amid the pandemic, saying it would \"reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus\".\nIt included banning \"buy one get one free\" deals on unhealthy food, as well as restrictions on where those foods can be promoted in-store, and new rules for displaying calories on menus.\nBut the committee said there had been no reviews of the effectiveness of the current or previous obesity strategies before the plan was published, and called for an urgent review to examine the evidence behind the measures.\nOther conclusions of the report included:\nMs Nokes said: \"The government must ensure its policies are not contributing to body image pressures.\"\nResponding to the committee's report, a Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the government's approach was \"guided by the latest research and emerging evidence\".\nShe added: \"We know poor body image can be a factor in disordered eating for both men and women and we are committed to improving outcomes for those with eating disorders and related mental health issues - with record funding to expand dedicated services in the community.\"\nBut, she added: \"With over six in 10 adults overweight or living with obesity, it is important that we take action to help people live healthier lives.\"\nIf you need support with an eating disorder, visit the BBC Action Line website for details of organisations that can help.

Again the chief magistrate said a plea of not guilty should be entered.\nAbedi, Hassan and Saeed are next due to appear at Woolwich Crown Court on 5 May."

Another worker at the home, Robert Shook, was also shot and taken to hospital where he has undergone multiple surgeries.\n\"Both men involved in this incident are long-standing, beloved members of our family at GSM,\" the company wrote on Facebook.\nDr Lesslie had been married to his wife for over 40 years, according to an online biography. He was a well-known doctor and author of books about medicine.\nHe also founded the Riverview Medical Center and Riverview House Calls/Riverview Hospice and Palliative Care.\nMr Adams played in 78 NFL games over five seasons for six teams, including the San Francisco 49ers and New York Jets.\nIn the 2010 season, he suffered a severe ankle injury that left him with screws in his leg, according to CBS News. In 2012, he suffered two concussions over three games while playing for the Oakland Raiders.\nA man who claimed to be Mr Adams' father told WNCN-TV that his son was the attacker. \"I think the football messed him up,\" Alonzo Adams told the station.\n\"He didn't talk much and he didn't bother nobody,\" he added.\nOn Thursday, an NFL spokesperson expressed condolences in a statement, saying: \"Our hearts go out to the families and friends of the victims of this devastating tragedy.\"\nMr Biden was already scheduled to announce new gun restrictions on Thursday. He paid tribute to the victims during his address at the White House Rose Garden.\n\"As I was coming to the Oval Office I got the word that in South Carolina a physician, with his wife, two grandchildren and a person working at his house were gunned down. All five.\"\n\"So many people sitting here today know that well,\" Mr Biden told the audience, who included victims of gun crime. \"They know what it's like when the seconds change your life forever.\""

Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

That's what I'm doing,\" she told the programme.\nBut she said that over the coming years she hoped to put her energy back into painting, as well as \"being happy, smiling more, just enjoying life\". \n\"I never realised how much I wanted to live until I thought I was going to die,\" she said.\nEmin, who is known for her frank, confessional art, said she had her bladder removed, a full hysterectomy, her urethra removed, her lymph nodes removed, \"half of my vagina removed\", and part of her intestine removed to stop the spread of the cancer.\nShe now has a urostomy bag, which replaces the bladder and urinary system. It is a \"major disability\" because it needs to be emptied as frequently as every 20 minutes, she said.\n\"You never know when it's going to happen,\" she said.\nWhat is bladder cancer?\nThe extensive surgery meant her bladder cancer \"couldn't actually latch on to anything else\". Following the clear three-monthly scan, she will now move to annual scans, she said.\nBest known for such installations as her unmade bed and the tent Everyone I Have Ever Slept With, Emin was speaking ahead of the re-opening of a joint exhibition of her work with paintings by Edvard Munch on 18 May, which had been closed by England's lockdown this winter.\nThe Margate-based artist said when she began working on the Royal Academy of Arts exhibition four years ago she had \"no idea that there was a possibility that I was never going to see this show\".\nEmin said she resisted suggestions to cancel the show before the lockdown because \"if something happens to me, what else have I got? I've just got to do this\".\nThe government made a \"big mistake\" in categorising museums and galleries alongside nightclubs when it comes to reopening, she said, describing the decision as \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\"I think it's because the majority of the government at the moment have never probably been to museums or art galleries,\" she said. \n\"If they had and if they knew and if they knew the soulful benefits of looking at art, they would have kept them open or found some system to make it work.\"\nThe full interview with Tracey Emin will be shown on Newsnight on Friday 9 April from 22:45 GMT and afterwards on BBC iPlayer."

      "text": "The police watchdog is assessing whether the Met needs to be investigated over its handling of the disappearance of Richard Okorogheye.\nThe student was found dead in a pond in Essex after being reported missing by his family two weeks earlier.\nAfter Mr Okorogheye's body was found, the Met Police made a mandatory referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).\nThe IOPC said it would look to see if any \"future involvement is required\". \nThe Met said as a matter of routine a referral had also been made to its Directorate of Professional Standards, as the 19-year-old had been reported missing by his family before his body was found.\nAfter making the initial missing persons report on 22 March, Mr Okorogheye's mother Evidence Joel alleged that when his disappearance was first reported, police \"did nothing\".\nMs Joel said she was initially told her son was an adult, who could go out and come back whenever he wanted.\nShe said she told officers her son, who had sickle cell disease, had \"no jacket, no money, so I'm worried, I'm concerned about his wellbeing\" but that it was only on the following Sunday and Monday after his disappearance that she \"felt like they were doing something\".\nAfter leaving the family home in Ladbroke Grove, west London, on 22 March, Mr Okorogheye took a taxi to a residential street in Loughton, Essex, where he was last seen on CCTV in the early hours of the following day, walking towards Epping Forest.\nMs Joel previously said her son had been \"struggling to cope\" with his business and IT degree at Oxford Brookes University. \nHis body was found in a pond in Epping Forest on Monday evening.\nMr Okorogheye's death is currently being treated as unexplained. A post-mortem examination found no evidence of physical trauma or assault.\nFurther tests are being carried out to establish the cause of his death."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,Transport,Bus travel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Bus services in England should return to pre-pandemic levels by Monday, according to industry body CPT. \nCPT, which represents the bus and coach sector, said passenger levels were at about 40% just before Easter. \nBut companies are expecting more people to be travelling as lockdown measures ease further from 12 April, with shops and outdoor hospitality reopening.\nIn Wales services are at 80% of normal levels, while in Scotland they are at 95%, according to CPT. \nFrom Monday in England, non-essential shops and close-contact services like hairdressers and beauty salons can reopen, while pubs and restaurants can serve customers outdoors, as part of the next stage of the roadmap out of lockdown. \nIn Wales, non-essential shops and close-contact services can also reopen from Monday, while in Northern Ireland the stay-at-home message is being relaxed and non-essential retail can operate click-and-collect. \nBut in Scotland people will have to wait until at least 26 April for more of the economy to reopen. \nBus services fell to around 80% of pre-pandemic levels in England during the third lockdown that began in January, compared to around 50% during the first lockdown in March last year, according to CPT. \nHowever, they increased to 100% as measures were eased over the summer. \nA spokesman for CPT said: \"Operators have reacted flexibly during the pandemic to respond to passenger demand and with the reopening of non-essential retail and outdoor hospitality now is the right time to increase service levels to help people visit shops and see family and friends. \n\"The industry will be closely monitoring passenger demand as restrictions ease to ensure that services are at a level that allows passengers to travel safely.\" \nWelcoming the return to normal services, chief executive of the Bus Users charity Claire Walters said: \"Buses are the most used form of public transport and are vital to the UK's recovery. \n\"Millions rely on them to access work, education, training, health services, leisure facilities and shops, so the sooner we can get people back on board, the better for everyone.\""

      "text": "Beijing is now home to more billionaires than any other city in the world, according to the latest Forbes' annual rich list.\nThe Chinese capital added 33 billionaires last year and now hosts 100, said the business magazine.\nThis narrowly beats New York City, which hosts 99 and has held the top ranking for the last seven years.\nChina's quick containment of Covid-19, the rise of its technology firms and stock markets helped it gain top spot.\nAlthough Beijing now has more billionaires than the Big Apple, the combined net worth of New York City's billionaires remained US$80bn (\u00a358bn) greater than that of their counterparts in Beijing. \nBeijing's richest resident was Zhang Yiming, the founder of video-sharing app TikTok and chief executive of its parent firm ByteDance. He saw his net worth double to $35.6bn. \nIn contrast, New York City's richest resident, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, had a fortune worth $59bn.\nChina, along with the US, has seen its technology giants become even bigger during the pandemic as more people shopped online and looked for sources of entertainment.\nThis saw the massive creation of personal wealth for the founders and shareholders of these tech titans.\nChina, whose figure included Hong Kong and Macao in the Forbes count, added more billionaires to the list than any other country globally, with 210 newcomers.\nHalf of China's new billionaires made their fortunes from manufacturing or technology ventures, including female billionaire Kate Wang, who made her money from e-cigarettes.\nWith 698 billionaires, China is closing in on the US, which still leads with 724 billionaires. \nA record 493 newcomers joined the list globally last year, roughly one new billionaire every 17 hours, according to Forbes.\nIndia had the third-highest number of billionaires, with 140. In total, the 1,149 billionaires from Asia Pacific were worth $4.7tn, compared with the US billionaires' $4.4 tn. \nJeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, remains the world's richest person for the fourth consecutive year. His net worth grew by $64bn to $177bn last year. "

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar",
      "text": "Myanmar's ex-ambassador in London spent Wednesday night in his car after saying he was locked out of his embassy.\nKyaw Zwar Minn said staff were asked to leave the building by Myanmar's military attach\u00e9, and he was dismissed as the country's representative.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has condemned the \"bullying actions,\" but the UK has accepted the change.\nMyanmar's military seized power in a coup on 1 February, sparking protests and escalating violence.\nKyaw Zwar Minn has criticised the military coup, and called for Myanmar's ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi to be released.\nAbout 600 people - including dozens of children - have been killed so far as pro-democracy protesters demand a return to power of elected leader Ms Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.\nThrough a spokesman out the front of the embassy on Thursday morning, Kyaw Zwar Minn urged the UK government not to recognise the military junta's newly appointed ambassador, and to send them back to Myanmar.\n\"There was a coup in Myanmar in February. Now there is the same situation in central London,\" he said, adding embassy staff were being threatened with \"severe punishment if they don't continue to work for the military general\".\nPolice were reportedly called to stop staff re-entering the building. Protesters gathered outside after news spread that the ambassador had been locked out. \nAccording to the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, an ambassador's job officially ends once the host country has been informed.\nThe Foreign Office confirmed it received the notification, and that it \"must accept the decision taken by the Myanmar regime\".\nDeputy ambassador Chit Win is said to have taken over as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in London, Reuters reported, citing diplomats with knowledge of the matter. However, the Foreign Office said it has \"received no formal notification of his replacement\".\nA charg\u00e9 d'affaires serves as the head of a diplomatic mission in the absence of an ambassador. \nIn March, Kyaw Zwar Minn called for the release of Ms Suu Kyi and told the BBC that Myanmar was \"divided\" and could be at risk of civil war. \nHe maintained that his remarks were not \"betraying the country\", adding that he was standing on \"middle\" ground. In response, the Myanmar government issued a statement saying he had been summoned home, but he stayed in London.\n\"He's trying to work in the middle ground but there is no doubt which is the right side,\" the spokesman for Kyaw Zwar Minn said.\nDiplomacy has its rules. Most are set out in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. These are clear that governments choose who they want to represent them abroad. \nSo if the military regime in Myanmar wants to sack its ambassador in London, it can. Under Article 43 of the Convention, it simply has to notify the Foreign and Development Office formally that \"the function of the diplomatic agent has come to an end\". And that is what has happened here. The UK government has no choice but to accept that. \nThe foreign secretary can say as many supportive things as he likes about the ambassador but he can't get him back in his job. \nThis presents a dilemma for the government. By accepting the ambassador has been sacked, it will face accusations that it is tacitly accepting the authority of the regime in Myanmar. And this is something it does not want to do. So the question may turn to whether the UK will also recognise the now ex-ambassador as some kind of representative of the deposed administration. \nIt follows another day of deadly protests in Myanmar. In the northwest town of Taze, at least 11 anti-coup demonstrators were killed in clashes with security forces on Wednesday night. Local media are reporting the troops fired at protesters who fought back with hunting rifles and firebombs.\nMyanmar's military seized power on 1 February after overthrowing the government and declared a state of emergency.\nJust days later, a protest movement began to emerge, which quickly gained momentum, leading to hundreds of thousands of people taking part in street protests.\nA popular model and actor, Paing Takhon, was arrested as part of a growing crackdown on artists and actors. The 24-year-old was active in both online protests and in-person rallies, and has millions of fans in Myanmar and Thailand.\nLast week, Ms Suu Kyi was charged with breaking a colonial-era official secrets law, which carries a term of up to 14 years in prison. \n8 April: This story was updated after the UK Foreign Office amended the wording of its statement.

      "tags": "Climate change,Environment,Prince William, Duke of Cambridge,Banking",
      "text": "The Duke of Cambridge has urged banks to \"invest in nature\" to help fight global climate change. \nSpeaking at an IMF and World Bank meeting, Prince William said protecting nature continued to play only a small part in combating global warming. \nHe said investing in reforestation and sustainable agriculture were \"cost effective\" ways of tackling the issue. \nBanks have come under increasing pressure to step up efforts to help fight climate change.\nJust this week, Barclays' London headquarters was the target of a protest staged by climate activist group Extinction Rebellion. Members held placards and broke several windows as they called on the bank to stop financing fossil fuel companies.\nAddressing central bankers and finance ministers at the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, the duke said the world's natural habitats continue to decline at an \"alarming rate\". \n\"We cannot recover sustainably from coronavirus, eradicate global poverty, achieve net-zero emissions, or adapt to climate change, without investing in nature,\" he said. \nThe duke said investing in nature accounted for only a \"fraction of the money that is spent on the fight against climate change\". \n\"We must invest in nature, through reforestation, sustainable agriculture and supporting healthy oceans\u2026 because doing so is one of the most cost effective and impactful ways of tackling climate change.\n\"It removes carbon from the atmosphere, helps build more resilient communities, tackles biodiversity loss and protects people's livelihoods.\" \nThe spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank are taking place virtually this week bringing together central banks, policymakers and business leaders to discuss the state of the world's economy. \nA key focus of the discussions will also centre on climate risks and building a sustainable economic recovery post Covid. \nThe duke said: \"All of you here at the World Bank and across each of the multilateral development banks have that crucial part to play by supporting a green, inclusive and resilient recovery from the pandemic, by valuing nature and putting it at the heart of your work, and by increasing investment in a future where the natural world can thrive.\" \nThe decisions taken at the next UN climate change summit in Glasgow later this year will be a \"vital step\" in putting nature centre stage, the duke added. \nThe duke has become a vocal campaigner on environmental issues. He launched a competition to try to inspire people to solve \"some of the world's greatest environmental challenges\". \nThe Earthshot Prize will recognise ideas and technologies that can safeguard the planet offering five prizes of \u00a31m to support environmental and conservation projects. \nThe duke's comments come amid growing pressure from shareholders on banks to take a tougher stance on climate change. \nHSBC announced last month it would stop financing coal projects across the EU by 2030, and all other markets by 2040, following pressure from a coalition of investment firms.\nShareholders at Barclays are set to table a resolution at the bank's upcoming annual general meeting calling on the bank to phase out financing for coal, oil and gas companies. \nMeanwhile a group of central banks are reviewing ways to use monetary policy to tackle climate change. \nOptions include greener asset purchases and lending schemes, according to report by the Network for Greening the Financial System.

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nA pharmacist whose brother suffered a fatal blood clot after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine has urged people to keep having the jab. Neil Astles, 59, a solicitor from Warrington, Cheshire, had the vaccine in March. His sister, Dr Alison Astles, told the BBC that doctors were \"99.9% sure\" the clot was due to the jab, but he had been \"extraordinarily unlucky\". The UK's medicine regulator says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people - read more about the risks here.\nMore than six million people in the UK are now fully vaccinated after receiving a second dose of a Covid jab. After a lull in the vaccination programme over Easter, the number of people who received a second dose jumped to 408,396 on Wednesday - up from 186,793 the previous day, while another 99,530 first doses were administered. The latest figures also showed there were a further 3,030 confirmed coronavirus cases, while another 53 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test.\nBus services in England should return to pre-pandemic levels by Monday - when non-essential shops and outdoor hospitality are reopening, according to industry body CPT. Passenger levels were at about 40% just before Easter, says CPT, but companies are expecting more people to be travelling as lockdown measures ease further. Here's a reminder of what you can do as part of the next stage of the roadmap out of lockdown in England.\nA pub landlord says he has spent \u00a350,000 on a chalet for outside dining - only to be told a week before opening that it contravenes Covid-19 rules. Jason Kalen, who runs The Marlborough in Wiltshire, fitted a bar, pizza oven and a TV in the wooden structure. He says he followed the council's advice - but Wiltshire Council says the structure doesn't comply with the guidance. \nThe traditional summer opening of Buckingham Palace's state rooms, which normally attracts thousands of people, has been cancelled for a second year due to the pandemic. Instead, the Royal Collection Trust says it will offer visitors the chance to wander around its gardens unguided for the first time, as well as being able to picnic on the lawns.

      "tags": "Carers,Solihull,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Unpaid carers looking after terminally ill friends and relatives during the pandemic struggled to access pain relief, with some patients dying in unnecessary pain, a survey has found.  \nThe survey of 995 unpaid carers by Marie Curie also found people had difficulties getting personal care and respite nursing for loved ones. \nFigures show the number of people dying at home rose by 42% in the past year.\nThe government said it had taken action to support unpaid carers.\nNearly two-thirds of carers surveyed by the charity said their loved one did not get all the pain relief they needed when they were dying.\nSusan Lowe, from Solihull, cared for her mother Sheila before she died with bowel cancer in April last year, aged 74. \nShe said caring for her mum during lockdown was hard as \"the system was just under so much pressure that we had to manage largely on our own\".\nThe public health worker says she struggled to get the right pain relief medication for her mother in her final weeks and spent hours travelling to different chemists.\nSusan, 50, told the BBC: \"My biggest regret is that my mum died in pain - more pain than she needed to be. She really wanted to be comfortable at the end. She knew she was dying. \n\"What she really wanted - and this is what she was assured would happen - was to be comfortable. She was told she would get the drugs that she needed for it to be as bearable as possible.\n\"I remember breaking down in tears a couple of times in the pharmacy when I was told the medication mum needed wasn't in stock.\"\nMichele Chilvers, looked after her wife Terri, 49, who had been diagnosed with incurable bowel cancer. The 53-year-old, from Hull, struggled to get access to respite care due to support nursing staff being furloughed.\nShe said: \"I was sleeping on the sofa for the last 10 days. Terri was very restless and very noisy and quite agitated so I didn't get much sleep. When I asked if I could have a night sitter, I was told they were going to try and get me one but this was difficult because by this point, we were in lockdown.\n\"They eventually got me two nights. And on the second night when the sitter arrived, I had to tell her Terri had died five minutes earlier. It was really lonely, and really hard.\"\nAlthough she struggled to get enough respite care, Ms Chilvers, who works in a school as a head of year, stressed that she \"could not fault\" the nursing staff who treated her wife.\nHospices also experienced shortages of essential PPE, medicines, equipment and staff, separate research compiled by Marie Curie, the University of Cambridge, University of Hull and Kings College London says.\nIt adds that palliative care was not classified as \"frontline NHS\" in the pandemic and as such it has been compromised.\nMarie Curie said that the past year has been a stress test for community-based palliative care in homes. \n\"Many people will not be able to forget the deaths we have experienced this last year and it is vital that the government, local health and social care leaders, and providers learn vital lessons from the pandemic,\" its chief executive, Matthew Reed, said.\n\"It's heartbreaking to see that people dying at home and their carers struggled behind closed doors.\n\"The government must now ensure that end of life care is seen as essential and not a forgotten after-thought ... no-one should be allowed to die in pain and without the essential care they need.\"\nThe charity is calling for the government to sustainably fund end-of-life care, with a particular emphasis on ensuring people dying at home always receive the support they need.\nThe Office for National Statistics figures showed the number of those dying in their own homes rose by 42% in England, Scotland and Wales in the year to March 2021.  \nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Unpaid carers continue to perform an incredibly important role and throughout the pandemic we have taken action to support them.\n\"This includes funding through a number of charities, tailored guidance, and ongoing work to help carers access the support they need, with many prioritised for vaccination.\""
