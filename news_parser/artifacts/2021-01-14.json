      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Brazil,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Hospitals in the Brazilian city of Manaus have reached breaking point while treating Covid-19 patients, amid reports of severe oxygen shortages and desperate staff.\nThe city, in Amazonas state, has seen a surge of deaths and infections.\nHealth professionals, quoted by local media, warned \"many people\" could die due to lack of supplies and assistance.\nBrazil has recorded more than 205,000 virus deaths - the second-highest tally in the world, behind the US. \nA new coronavirus variant has recently emerged in Brazil, with several cases in travellers arriving in Japan traced back to the Amazonas region.  \nAmazonas suffered heavy losses in the first wave of the pandemic but is also being badly hit by a new rise in infections. \nRefrigerated containers were brought to hospitals to help store bodies last week, as authorities declared a state of emergency.\nJessem Orellana, from the Fiocruz-Amazonia scientific investigation institute, told the AFP news agency that some hospitals in Manaus had \"run out of oxygen\" with some centres becoming \"a type of suffocation chamber\" for patients.\nThe researcher told Brazilian media she had received reports from the front-line of \"dramatic\" scenes playing out in some hospitals.\nReports in the daily Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper described desperate staff having to try to keep patients alive through manual ventilation. \nIn a widely shared video from the region, a female medical worker asks the internet for help: \"We're in an awful state. Oxygen has simply run out across the whole unit today.\"\n\"There is no oxygen and lots of people are dying,\" she says in the clip.  \"If anyone has any oxygen, please bring it to the clinic. There are so many people dying.\"\nAmazonas Governor Wilson Lima said the state was \"in the most critical moment of the pandemic\" and has announced a nightly curfew will begin at 19:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Friday to try to stem the spread. \nMarcellus Campelo, a local health secretary, said the state needed three times the amount of oxygen it can produce locally and appealed for help. \nBrazil's vice-president shared images on Twitter of the air force transporting hospital supplies, including oxygen cylinders and stretchers, to the city as reports of the situation spread throughout the country.\nHealth officials also say some patients will be airlifted to other states for treatment due to the demand for intensive care units, Reuters reports. \nFelipe Naveca, deputy director of research at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that the new variant had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same characteristics: \"Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern.\"\nMr Naveca said that they did not yet have any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective against the new variant. \"We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question,\" he said.\nHowever, on Thursday UK officials announced a ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde due to the new strain.

      "tags": "Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers.\nThe British Medical Association is appealing for a higher grade of face mask to guard against coronavirus infection. \nIt says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols.\nThese are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19.\nThis follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units.\nPublic Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updated in October 2020.\nEarly in the pandemic, it was widely believed that to catch the disease you had to either be close to an infected person and hit by droplets from their coughs or sneezes or touch a surface they had contaminated.\nBut research during the course of last year highlighted how it is also possible for the virus to be carried in what are called aerosols, drifting and accumulating in the air. \nMost infections are thought to have occurred indoors in badly ventilated rooms, and many studies have shown that the 'airborne route' can be an important factor. \nAcross the UK, the guidance for hospital staff is to wear surgical masks in most areas. \nMore sophisticated masks - a type known as FFP3 that includes an air filter - are only required in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that are known to generate aerosols.\nIn their letter, the consultants, doctors and nurses say healthcare workers are three to four times more likely to become infected than the general population. \nBut they point out that staff in intensive care units, who have the best level of protection, have about half the risk of catching the virus than colleagues on general wards. \nThe letter states: \"It is now essential that healthcare workers have their PPE upgraded to protect against airborne transmission\".\nBarry McAree, a consultant surgeon in Northern Ireland, is one of many healthcare workers to be ill with Covid. \nHe is self-isolating at home right after his testing positive for the second time. \nA signatory to the letter, he says his hospital in Antrim followed the guidance about which type of masks should be worn in which areas, but he became infected nonetheless. It is not clear how and when he caught it.\n\"There's so much evidence that we are talking about an airborne infection that it has to be said that it is not appropriate just to wear FFP3 in environments when aerosol generating procedures take place.\"\nHe believes that with such high levels of the virus in the community and in hospitals, staff should be wearing the higher-grade masks whenever they're close to patients.\nSurgical masks can be bought online for about 10p each, while the FFP3 masks are far more expensive about \u00a35.00.  \nDr Barry Jones, a retired gastroenterologist and leading expert on aerosols, says that's nothing compared to the cost of a patient with Covid,\nHe points to data showing that roughly a fifth of people needing hospital treatment for Covid may have acquired the infection in hospital in the first place. \n\"We should do everything we can to reduce that possibility - it's the air we share that's killing us.\"\nA few hospitals have decided to break with official guidance.\nIt's understood that hospitals in Cambridge, Plymouth and Exeter have decided to equip staff with FFP3 masks if they face patients diagnosed with Covid or suspected of having it. \nOne consultant, who did not want to be named, said: \"When you realise patients are more infectious at an earlier stage of disease and are presenting at general wards with poorer ventilation than intensive care units and staff are wearing a poorer quality of PPE, you really want those in a position of leadership to listen and to act.\"\nRCN General Secretary Dame Donna Kinnair, said: \"Without delay, they must state whether existing PPE guidance is adequate for the new variant. \n\"While more research is carried out, we ask for the precautionary principle to be applied and staff to be given a higher level of PPE if working with suspected or confirmed cases.\"\nPublic Health England said this was a matter for NHS England to comment on.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"The safety of NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work tirelessly to deliver PPE that protects those on the frontline.\n\"UK guidance on the safest levels of PPE is written by experts and agreed by all four chief medical officers. Our guidance is kept under constant review based on the latest evidence and data.\n\"Emerging evidence and data, including on variant strains, will be continually monitored and reviewed, and the guidance updated accordingly if needed.\""

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,FBI,United States",
      "text": "Exactly 100 days since the 6 January riot that saw a pro-Trump mob storm the US Capitol, prosecutors have their first guilty plea.\nJon Schaffer, 53, a member of the Oath Keepers militia group, pleaded guilty to two charges - obstruction of an official proceeding and entering a restricted building with a dangerous weapon.\nSchaffer, who is also a heavy metal guitarist in the band Iced Earth, had originally faced six charges including using a chemical irritant designed for grizzly bears on police officers during clashes.\nHe turned himself to FBI agents in Indiana two weeks after his arrest, and after a photo of him inside the Capitol wearing a hat reading \"Oath Keepers Lifetime Member\" appeared on the front pages of US newspapers.\nHe is facing 30 years in prison and is expected to co-operate with investigators. \nThe suspects in the Capitol riot are a varied group: they include an ousted West Virginia lawmaker, several police officers and a left-wing activist from Utah.\nMost of the rioters were allowed to leave the crime scene, forcing investigators to conduct a national manhunt for the pro-Trump crowd that stormed the halls of Congress.\nInvestigators for the District of Columbia says they have identified over 540 suspects and charged some 400 people in connection with the Capitol siege. \nJust weeks after the rampage in January, FBI officials said they had already been inundated with 140,000 videos and photos from members of the public.\nOfficials say they are considering filing serious charges of seditious activity against some individuals who were involved in the siege on the Capitol.\nAccording to federal criminal code, seditious conspiracy means an effort to conspire to overthrow the US government. The punishment is severe: up to 20 years in prison.\nThe rioters facing federal charges hail from 42 out of the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, according to the George Washington University extremism tracker.\nOnly a few came from pro-Trump strongholds. Most came from districts that voted for Joe Biden in the November election.\nIn March, the FBI made its first arrest of a Trump appointee, former State Department aide Federico Guillermo Klein. Mr Klein, 42, is accused of multiple felonies related to the riot, including beating police with a stolen riot shield. He was still employed by the State Department as a staff assistant when he joined the mob on 6 January. He is also a former Trump campaign employee, US media report. \nFive of those arrested were police officers. Nearly 30 were active-duty or retired members of the military.\nAbout 90% of those arrested have been white, according to an analysis by the Chicago Project on Security and Threats.  \nMost have been over the age of 40, surprising given that the average age for those involved in political violence around the world is late 20s to early 30s.\nMany of those arrested were employed, or even wealthy, including Dr Simone Gold, 55, from Beverly Hills, California. \nShe was among a group of doctors that last year spread misleading claims about the coronavirus, including that hydroxychloroquine - a drug touted relentlessly by Mr Trump - was an effective treatment.\nJenna Ryan - a real estate broker from Dallas, Texas - garnered attention on social media after she flew to DC by private jet to join the march to the Capitol.\nAnalysis by BBC Monitoring and BBC Reality Check\nRobert Keith Packer\nOne of the most striking images from that day showed a man wearing a hoodie with the words: \"Camp Auschwitz\". Auschwitz was a Nazi extermination camp where more than a million people, mostly Jews, were murdered during World War Two by Germany.\nMr Packer was arrested in Virginia and has been charged with trespassing in a federal building and \"violent entry and disorderly conduct\" on Capitol grounds.\nJake Angeli - 'Q Shaman'\nJacob Anthony Chansley, known as Jake Angeli or as he describes himself the \"Q Shaman\", is a well-known follower of the unfounded QAnon conspiracy theory who lives in Glendale, Arizona.\nQAnon supporters believe Mr Trump and a secret military intelligence team are battling a deep state cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles in the Democratic Party, media, business and Hollywood.\nKnown for appearing with a painted face, fur hat and horns while carrying a \"Q sent me\" banner in public, Mr Chansley, 33, has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct after appearing in multiple images inside the halls of Congress and the Senate chamber.\nIn videos posted to his social media accounts, he shouts about child-trafficking in front of government buildings or inside shopping malls, and attends pro-Trump or QAnon-linked \"save our children\" rallies.\nLike many of his fellow QAnon followers, Mr Chansley says he believes Covid-19 is a hoax.\nMr Trump - viewed as a hero by the movement - has stopped short of endorsing the conspiracy theory but has described QAnon activists as \"people who love our country.\"\nDoug Jensen - QAnon \nDoug Jensen, 41, from Des Moines, Iowa, appeared in one video showing a lone African American officer holding back the mob.\nMr Jensen has been arrested and faces five federal charges, including violent entry and disorderly conduct and obstructing a law enforcement officer during a civil disorder.\nIn it, he can be seen chasing a police officer up a flight of stairs inside the Capitol wearing a shirt with the QAnon slogan \"trust the plan\".\nMr Jensen later identified himself on his Twitter account, tweeting: \"You like my shirt?\" and \"Me\u2026\" under images of him inside the Capitol shared by fellow QAnon supporters.\nOn his Twitter, Mr Jensen regularly expresses support for President Trump, engages with well-known QAnon accounts, and tweets QAnon phrases such as WWG1WGA - short for \"where we go one we go all\" - a rallying cry for the conspiracy's adherents.\nNick Ochs - Proud Boys\nNick Ochs was arrested at an airport in Honolulu, Hawaii, by the FBI, as he returned home from Washington DC.\nHe's accused of unlawful entry of restricted buildings or grounds, after he posted a picture smoking a cigarette inside the Capitol building, tweeting: \"Hello from the Capital lol\".\nMr Ochs describes himself as a \"Proud Boy Elder from Hawaii\". The Proud Boys is an anti-immigrant and all male far-right group founded in 2016.\nPresident Trump addressed this group specifically in the first presidential debate. In response to a question about white supremacists and militias he said: \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.\"\nRichard Barnett\nRichard Barnett is the man pictured with his feet on a desk in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. He was also pictured outside the Capitol with a personalised envelope he took from her office.\nHe's been arrested for unlawful entry, disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and theft of public money, property, or records.\nMr Barnett is 60 years old and from Arkansas.\nLocal media reports say Mr Barnett is involved in a group that supports gun rights, and that he was interviewed at a \"Stop the Steal\" rally following the presidential election - the movement that supports Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.\nDerrick Evans\nLess than a month after he was sworn in as a Republican delegate in the West Virginia state legislature, Mr Evans filmed himself pushing through the crowd as he stormed the Capitol wearing what appears to be a motorcycle helmet.\n\"We're going in,\" he said in the now-deleted Facebook live stream. \"We did it! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!\" he yelled, adding, \"patriots inside, baby!\"\nHis participation in the riot led lawmakers in his home state to consider cutting off his access to the West Virginia statehouse. \nBut within a week of the riot, he had resigned. He is facing federal charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct.\nRiley June Williams\nThe 22-year-old Pennsylvania woman, is accused of stealing a laptop from the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\nThe FBI has said that Ms Williams' former romantic partner told them that she had appeared in pictures of the Capitol riot. \nShe allegedly had said that she hoped to sell the laptop to Russian intelligence agents.\nAn aide to Mrs Pelosi said the computer was only used for presentations. It has yet to be recovered by investigators.\nFederal cases are ongoing across the country and could lead to some significant prison sentences for those involved.\nActing US Attorney Michael Sherwin said in February: \"The scope and scale of this investigation in these cases are really unprecedented, not only in FBI history but probably [Department of Justice] history.\"  \nDozens of suspects have requested public defenders - lawyers provided by the government - leaving taxpayers to pay millions of dollars in defendants' legal bills. \nThe cases have also flooded the Washington DC legal system, where semi-returned judges have been called upon to hear the influx of cases. At least one defendant has argued that their case should be heard out of Washington because they would be unable to get a fair trial there.\nAt least seven of the key suspects have told investigators that they travelled to the Capitol after President Trump told them to go in a speech that preceded the riot.\nThe so-called Q Shaman requested a pardon from Mr Trump before he left office, citing \"the peaceful and compliant fashion in which Mr Chansley comported himself\" during the riot.\nAccording to a local ABC news station, a judge has agreed that Mr Chansley should be \"provided food in line with a shaman's strict organic diet\" after he refused to eat the meals provided at the jailhouse.\nRiley June Williams, the woman accused of stealing a congressional laptop, was ordered to stay off the internet after she allegedly attempted to delete her information and encouraged others to do the same.\nA man allegedly seen in viral photos carrying a Confederate flag in the Capitol during the riots was charged on 14 January.\nAuthorities in Delaware charged Kevin Seefried and his son Hunter with entering a restricted building, violent entry and disorderly conduct.\nAccording to court documents cited by the Delaware News Journal, the duo got into the Capitol building through a window that Hunter helped break, before they \"verbally confronted\" US Capitol Police officers and the son took a selfie.\nThe Confederate flag is widely seen as a racist symbol as it was the banner of the slaveholding southern states that lost the US Civil War (1861-65).\nA left-wing activist was also arrested after tweeting video of himself inside the US Capitol as protesters breached security.\nJohn Sullivan, 26, was charged with entering a restricted building and violent entry or disorderly conduct. He claimed in media interviews that he was just \"documenting\" the rampage, though the affidavit notes he has no press credentials.\nThe court document says Mr Sullivan can be heard saying in a video he filmed of the Capitol riot: \"Let's burn this shit down.\" He has identified himself in media interviews as a Black Lives Matter supporter, but rejects any association with antifa, a loosely affiliated group of far-left protesters.\nFollowing the death of George Floyd last year, Mr Sullivan founded an activist group in Utah that advocates for racial justice. He was charged in July 2020 with felony riot and criminal mischief over civil unrest in Provo, Utah.\nTwo men who were allegedly pictured bringing plastic restraints into the Capitol were also arrested this month.\nAuthorities say Eric Gavelek Munchel is the individual seen carrying a number of plastic zip ties inside the Senate chamber. He was detained in Tennessee. Larry Rendell Brock, who is accused of entering the Capitol with a white flex cuff - a restraining device used by law enforcement - was arrested in Texas.\nSo far, neither has been accused of plotting to use the restraints, but face disorderly conduct and violent entry charges."

      "title": "Covid-19: France PM Castex announces tighter curfew",
      "tags": "France,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "French Prime Minister Jean Castex has announced a new evening curfew will begin nationally across France starting at 18:00 (17:00 GMT) on Saturday.\nThe move is a tightening of a curfew already in place since December, which restricts movement from 20:00-06:00.\nAnnouncing the measure on Thursday, Mr Castex described the country's situation as \"worrying\" with infections remaining at a \"high plateau\". \nHe also announced new restrictions for people arriving into the country.\nFrance has so far recorded more than 69,000 coronavirus deaths - the seventh-highest death toll in the world. \nThe new national curfew will stay in place for at least 15 days and means everyone must be at home, unless they are returning from school or work, by 18:00 every day.\nAll shops and businesses will have to close when the curfew begins, except for emergency services. \nThe tighter evening restriction was already in place in some hard-hit eastern regions of the country before Thursday's announcement and, according to the French Scientific Council, has led to infection rates slowing. \nHowever some people have criticised the curfew, claiming that it will create larger groups of people, all trying to get home in time before it comes into force. \nWomen's rugby coach Felicie Guinot lives in Marseille, where an earlier curfew is already in place. She told AP news agency that rush hour traffic in Marseille was heavy.\n\"It's a scramble so everyone can be home by 6pm,\" she said. \nAll those arriving from outside the EU will now have to test negative for the virus within 72 hours before their travel into France, and then isolate for seven days and test negative again, Mr Castex said.\nThe border controls are partly to limit the extent to which new mutant strains of the virus spreading abroad can become dominant in France. There is particular concern over the more transmissible variant first detected in the UK - which the French health minister says now accounts for about 1-1.5% of new cases nationally.\n\"We must do everything to prevent this variant from spreading in France,\" Health Minister Olivier Veran told a Thursday news conference.\nThe prime minister said Thursday that the situation in France is \"under control compared to neighbouring countries but still fragile\" with pressure on hospitals remaining high.\nThe curfew is seen as a way to avoid a full national lockdown, but Mr Castex said further restrictions would be imposed \"without delay\" if the situation deteriorated further.\nIt is hoped that an earlier curfew will put a stop to people gathering for drinks in the evenings, despite the government advising citizens to limit their social contacts to six people. \nThe country will aim to carry out at least one million Covid-19 tests per month in schools to help keep them open, but indoor sport activities have been banned again.\nThe government is also aiming to have more than one million people vaccinated against the virus by the end of January, amid criticism of a slow rollout by some. So far, 318,000 people have been vaccinated, according to the Health Ministry. \n\"The sooner we can vaccinate the most vulnerable, the sooner our hospitals will be spared the risk of being overwhelmed,\" Mr Castex said Thursday. \nThe earlier six o'clock curfew is important because it should help to \"counter the ap\u00e9ro effect\". These words are from Stanislas Gu\u00e9rini, a leading figure in President Macron's party.  \nWhat he means is that the two hours between six and eight o'clock have been identified as a weak spot in the government's anti-Covid strategy because that is when - even after all the warnings - people still can't resist getting together for post-work, pre-dinner aperitifs.  \nThe six o'clock measure is already in force in a quarter of France, where apparently it is having an effect. Extending it nationwide represents a graduated response to a situation which the government says is worrying, but not alarming.\nAn average of 16,000 new cases a day is way more than the official target, but it is also a lot less than daily case numbers in the UK. Covid uptake in intensive care hospital beds is likewise on a \"high plateau\" - persistent but not out of control. \nSo the French government will continue with this weekly fine-tuning, hoping that - with a vaccination programme that is at last gathering speed - the skies will possibly clear by the summer.\nFrance is one of several countries to currently enforce a curfew to curb the spread of the virus. \nIn Hungary, people must have a written note from their employers in order to leave their homes between 20:00 and 05:00. \nLatvia has brought in a curfew every Friday, Saturday and Sunday until 25 January. People cannot go outside between 22:00 and 05:00 unless they have a certificate. \nBelgium has different curfews depending on which region you are in. Flanders has a curfew from midnight until 05:00, while Brussels and Wallonia have asked residents to stay at home from 22:00 until 06:00.\nIn Italy, people must stay inside from 22:00 until 05:00. \nMinisters in the Netherlands are said to be looking into a possible curfew there, according to local media.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A provisional 270 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been secured by the African Union (AU) for distribution across the continent.\nAll of the doses will be used this year, promises current AU head South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.\nThis is on top of 600 million doses already promised but is still not enough to vaccinate the whole region.\nThere are fears that poorer countries globally will wait far longer than richer nations to be inoculated.\nAlthough infection numbers and death rates are comparatively lower across most of Africa, cases are spiking again in some areas. \nA new variant of Covid-19 in South Africa is causing particular alarm and makes up most of the new cases.\n\"As a result of our own efforts we have so far secured a commitment of a provisional amount of 270 million vaccines from three major suppliers: Pfizer, AstraZeneca (through Serum Institute of India) and Johnson & Johnson,\" President Ramaphosa said on Wednesday.\nAt least 50 million of the doses will be available \"for the crucial period of April to June 2021,\" he said.\nIn addition, the region is expecting around 600 million doses from the global Covax effort which aims to provide vaccines to lower-income countries.\nBut officials are still waiting for details and are now \"happy we have alternative solutions,\" Nicaise Ndembi, senior science adviser for the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told the AP news agency.\nMr Ramaphosa said officials are worried that the doses from the Covax effort released in the first half of 2021 will only be enough to inoculate health care workers. With a population of 1.3 billion people and each person requiring two vaccine jabs, Africa would need around 2.6 billion doses to eventually vaccinate everyone.\n\"These endeavours aim to supplement the Covax efforts, and to ensure that as many dosages of vaccine as possible become available throughout Africa as soon as possible,\" he explained.\nAfrica has recorded more than three million cases of Covid-19 and nearly 75,000 deaths. By contrast, the US has reported close to 23 million infections and more than 383,000 fatalities.\nThere has been a global rush to buy vaccines, with richer countries accused of buying up most of the supply.\nAs many had feared, Africa appears to be at the back of the queue to get Covid-19 vaccines. \nThe announcement of 270 million doses by South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa - who is also the current chair of the African Union - is good news. This is in addition to those secured by the Covax facility, which is led by the World Health Organisation and the Vaccine Alliance, Gavi. The facility has secured 600 million doses - enough to vaccinate only a fifth of the continent.  \nBut it may be a while before any of them get to the continent. The announcements are agreements to supply vaccines. There is still the actual procurement process that needs to happen. Negotiations are ongoing. \nWealthier nations had a head start. They already acquired the bulk of the early doses being produced through advance purchase deals with manufacturers. The race is on to meet that demand. \nAfrica, on the other hand, still faces funding deficits. There are questions also about the continent's readiness to receive the vaccines. Ultra-cold refrigeration is needed for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Countries are working on building their cold chains. But even this is marred by a shortage of funds. \nSo, the continent can only wait. "

      "text": "More than 100,000 Covid-19 vaccinations had been issued in Northern Ireland by Tuesday evening, Robin Swann has said.\nThe health minister said, of that figure, 91,419 people had received their first vaccine dose.\nHe added that 95% of care home residents had received their first dose and about 20% of those aged over 80 have received their first dose.\nIt comes as leading GP said the goal to begin a mass vaccine rollout by summer is \"achievable\" but hinges on supply. \nThe Department of Health published its plan to deliver vaccines in Northern Ireland on Tuesday.\nDr Alan Stout said the timeline was \"very sensible\" but was \"almost 100%\" dependent on getting enough of the vaccine. \nAt Wednesday's health briefing, Mr Swann said the programme had made a \"strong start\" but there was more to do.\nHe also said he has decided to issue tighter visiting guidelines for hospitals.\n\"I have ensured visiting will be permitted to hospices and care homes, but visits to general medical wards will no longer be permitted from this Friday\", he said.\nThe minister added that the measure would be kept under constant review.\nMr Swann also confirmed a new rapid test for Covid-19, which can return results in 12 minutes, would be used in emergency departments.\nHe said a pilot programme has been carried out using the LumiraDX nasal swab, which will enable health staff to \"very quickly identify patients who do not have Covid-19\".\nHe also repeated that the current lockdown restrictions were working and had helped to reduce NI's rate of infection, but warned the executive would still have \"difficult decisions\" to take in relation to decisions about whether to extend some restrictions in the coming weeks. \nOn Wednesday, a further 19 Covid-related deaths were announced by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.\nA further 1,145 new cases of the virus were also reported.\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer warned there was \"no doubt\" that levels of the new, more transmissible variant of coronavirus are rising in Northern Ireland.\nSpeaking at Stormont's executive briefing, Dr Michael McBride said that the new variant was making the job to contain it \"twice as difficult\".\nThe new variant is said to be up to 70% more transmissible, but there is no evidence it is more dangerous.\nThe first confirmed case of the new strain was detected in Northern Ireland on 23 December, but officials had said levels in Northern Ireland remained lower than in other areas of the UK.\nDr McBride said there would now be situations where the variant could spread, where previously it may not have.\n\"We need to be extremely cautious in the weeks ahead,\" he warned, adding that the virus would not \"magically disappear\" on 6 February, when the current lockdown is due to end.\nStormont ministers have to review the regulations on or before 22 January, with that scheduled for next Thursday.\nDr Stout, the chair of NI's GP committee, said practices needed another 22,000 doses to finish vaccinating people aged over 80.\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster, he said he was \"very confident\" the next doses would come through shortly. \n\"I have been overwhelmed by the desire of practices, the determination just to get going and the one thing we need to give them is vaccine - we need to get the supply in as quickly as possible. \n\"This is such a good news story that everybody wants the vaccine and everybody wants to give it.\"\nThe plan is for the vaccine to be given to the general population in summer 2021. \nGP clinics should have received their first delivery of the vaccine by Tuesday.  \nResponding to reports in The Daily Telegraph that GPs administering the vaccine in England had been asked to \"slow down\" to let other regions \"catch-up\", Dr Stout said Northern Ireland had taken a different approach to how it rolled out vaccines to GPs. \nHe said vaccines were shared among all practices in Northern Ireland.\n\"We just don't have the full amount of vaccine in practice to give. We could have given all of the vaccine that a certain number of practices needed to start with but there were issues with inequality and discrimination ... so that's why an amount has gone to every single practice, so at least they have some.\""

      "text": "There have been calls for an inquiry into mother and baby homes in Northern Ireland.\nIt comes as the Irish government is to apologise after an investigation found an \"appalling level of infant mortality\" in the Republic of Ireland's homes.\nAbout 9,000 children died in the 18 institutions under investigation.\nMothers and babies who were in similar homes in Northern Ireland want a full inquiry to be held in NI too. \nStormont commissioned research into whether or not there should an inquiry held into the homes which operated in Northern Ireland, is due to be published by the end of January.\nPatrick Corrigan from Amnesty International said the issue of forced adoptions also needs close scrutiny.\n\"We have had cases of mothers telling us that ultimately, many decades later, when they tried to track down their long-lost children they found adoption certificates where they said their signature had actually been forged,\" he said.\n\"So I think that there is criminality to investigate here and that it behoves the Northern Ireland Executive to set up the inquiry that has long been sought here and long been denied.\"\nIn 2017 research into infant mortality rates at former mother and baby homes in Northern Ireland had prompted initial calls for a public inquiry.\nBBC News NI previously spoke to Eunan Duffy who was 47 years old when he found out he was adopted from Marianvale mother and baby home in Newry, County Down.\nIt was one of a network of institutions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland which offered women the voluntary option, for those who were unmarried, to give birth in private and give their babies up for adoption\nAmnesty says there were more than a dozen mother-and-baby institutions in Northern Ireland. \nIt said about 7,500 women and girls gave birth in the Northern Ireland homes, operated by both Catholic and Protestant churches and religious organisations.\nIn Northern Ireland, research into mother and baby homes and Magdalene laundries was commissioned three years ago and was initially expected to take 12 months.\nIt was completed in February last year, but was then sent to those facing criticism to give them an opportunity to reply.\nA Department of Health spokesperson said: \"A paper will be brought to the executive shortly for its consideration. Subject to executive approval, it is intended to publish the research report before the end of January 2021.\"\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the commission that investigated the homes found that the number of children who died was about 15% of all those who were born in the institutions.\nTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) M\u00edche\u00e1l Martin said the report, which can be read in full here, described a \"dark, difficult and shameful chapter\" of Irish history.\nSolicitor Claire McKeegan, who represents the Birth Mothers for Justice group, welcomed the apology in the Republic of Ireland, but said mothers and children in NI had not received one.\n\"The crimes perpetrated on them have yet to be investigated,\" she said.\n\"Those perpetrators who forced them into arbitrary detention, hard labour and colluded in the forced adoption of their babies, remain unchallenged in this jurisdiction.\"\nMary O'Neill became pregnant when she was 18 and was sent to Marianvale in Newry in the late 1970s.\nThere she gave birth to a baby girl who was taken away from her almost immediately after the birth. \nShe wanted to keep the baby, but was not allowed and was told the baby would be put up for adoption.\nMs O'Neill told Good Morning Ulster she eventually tracked down her daughter after 40 years.\n\"It was a long search, everywhere you went you were up against a brick wall,\" she said.\n\"There was no help, the social workers didn't want to tell you anything.\"\nShe finally found out her daughter was living in America but was coming home for her 40th birthday.\nShe said when she met her it was like meeting a stranger.\n\"But thank God we have met and we have a good relationship. She's still keeping in touch,\" Ms O'Neill said.\n\"It means the world to me, because you always wondered where was she? Was she happy? Did she know about you? \n\"It was always in the back of your mind. It never went away, the tears and the heartache.\"\nMs O'Neill said she was happy the victims in the Republic of Ireland were getting an apology, but wishes the homes in Northern Ireland could have been included.      \nMechelle Dillon's mother was 21 and pregnant when she was sent to Marianvale in Newry in 1969.\nShe was placed in foster care a few months after her birth. \nHer mother returned to her home village and then moved to England. But she came back for Mechelle when she was around eight or nine-months-old. \nShe said she believed she was not adopted because she was born with a cyst on her mouth.\n\"I would have maybe been classed as a reject, if you want to put it that way,\" she said.\n\"It's the same as if you go to look for a little puppy and if the puppy doesn't feel right and you think 'Oh God, I'll have a lot of vet bills here, I don't want that puppy' - I would have probably been classed the same because I would have had that defect.\"\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said \"the executive should move quickly to publish the research report and then call a full public inquiry\"."

      "tags": "Impeachment of Donald Trump,US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump,US politics,United States",
      "text": "President Donald Trump has just become the only US president to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives. He was impeached on Wednesday for \"incitement of insurrection\" following last week's riot at the US Capitol. However, a recent poll suggests that a majority of Republicans still support President Trump and don't hold him responsible for the violence.\nWe've been hearing from lawmakers - but what do Americans think? We asked members of our BBC voter panel to weigh in.\nBelinda is an attorney and devoted Trump supporter of Native American and African American ancestry. She says this second impeachment vote is wrong and misconstrues the facts of what happened last week in favour of political expediency.\nThis is unprecedented. There is no justification, no legal or constitutional basis for this impeachment. He did not even receive due process. It's a rush to judgment for ulterior motives and a dark stain on our country. I'm afraid our Constitution is on its deathbed. I hope the American people will stand up against this outrage. It's indicative of what would happen in a communist country where we have no free speech rights.\nThose who broke in should be charged appropriately for whatever laws they violated. But why would anybody who's rational think that our president meant for people to go break into the Capitol? His rallies have always been peaceful and most of the people on Wednesday were middle-aged and elderly, with children and grandchildren. \nIndividuals who violated the law should definitely be prosecuted but I don't see how you can blame someone for a speech and someone else's criminal activity. It can't be selective enforcement of the law.\nMelissa is a Filipino American small business owner with two children who had told us the country could not afford four more years of Donald Trump. She says the behaviour he displayed last Wednesday was undoubtedly an impeachable offense.\nEverything he has done is unconstitutional and, as a president, the number one thing he should be doing is upholding the Constitution. \n[Republican Congresswoman] Liz Cheney said that, if not for the president, last week would not have happened and she's right. If not for him continually fighting the election results, if not for him repeatedly sending the false message the election was stolen, if not for him holding that rally near the Capitol, if not for him talking about an 'uprising', last week would very likely not have happened.\nEven three months ago, before all the lawsuits and everything else he was saying, I was not shocked by his behaviour. It's all completely predictable because it's just within his character. So the argument by politicians that impeachment could divide us more, I don't see that as the goal of impeachment. \nIt can't help but I don't think it will have any impact on deterring violence. There needs to be some kind of statement that the president is not allowed to attack another branch of government. It's a chance for the Republican Party to rid itself of Trump's stranglehold on them.\nGabriel is a regional coordinator for the New York Young Republicans and is an outspoken 'Latino for Trump'. He condemns the violence of last Wednesday but says the reaction has been unfair and worries about where the party will go from here.\nI do not think that Donald Trump should be impeached. I was in DC at the rally on 6 January - I did not go near the Capitol and went back to my hotel room - but I saw the president speak with my own eyes and he did not call for anyone to storm the building or cause harm. \nThis is just a way to ensure he will not run in the next four years. It is political and it will create a bigger divide between left and right. I fear that people will become reactionary and elected officials will use impeachment in the future not as a last resort to uphold our republic but as a tool to remove whoever they don't agree with.\nAll violence should be condemned fairly and justly. It was a very sad outcome, but I do not believe it was the most horrible day in our country's history and it was not a coup. It's important to dictate that violence is not the answer. The day was supposed to be different. January 6 did something to the Republican Party. The actions of the few will discourage many of the new voters that Trump brought in and made his base.\nWilliams is a first-generation Mexican American college student in Atlanta who has been extremely concerned about what he has seen in his country over the past four years. He says the events of the past week justify today's vote in the House.\nI believe he should have been impeached. Not only is he a threat to our national security, but he doesn't condemn white supremacy and other threats. That affects us internally within the United States as well as abroad. \nIt's more of a symbolic impeachment at this point because he'll be out soon, but it's necessary nonetheless. Impeachment failed once, but now he has set the precedent that a president can be impeached more than once. \nIn processing the past week, all I could do at first was to ignore it and joke about the situation. It's deeply saddening to me."

      "text": "The government must review its strategy to end rough sleeping in England by 2024 after coronavirus showed it to be \"out of step\", a watchdog warned. \nA National Audit Office report praised the 'Everyone In' scheme, which housed about 33,000 people in the crisis.\nBut the plan highlighted issues with the current strategy - with thousands more needing help than expected.\nThe government said it was \"regularly taking into account the lessons learned\" from the pandemic.\nBoris Johnson made the pledge to end rough sleeping by the end of this Parliament shortly before he won the general election in 2019. \nAt the time, a snapshot figure taken by the government one evening showed 4,266 people were sleeping on the streets in England.\nBut it did not include people in night shelters or assessment centres, and could have missed people sleeping hidden from view.\nResearch by the BBC carried out in February 2020 showed more than 28,000 people across the UK had been recorded as sleeping rough in the previous 12 months - and in England, councils were seeing figures five times higher than the snapshot. \nThe 'Everyone In' scheme, launched in March 2020, aimed to provide emergency shelter for all rough sleepers during the first wave of the pandemic.\nFunding was ended two months later to the anger of many charities, but the government said it had made a number of more targeted funding pledges to tackle the issue since.\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) carried out an investigation into the housing of rough sleepers in the pandemic and praised the \"considerable achievement\" of 'Everyone In'.\nThe head of the watchdog, Gareth Davies, said the government \"acted swiftly to house rough sleepers and keep transmission rates low during the first wave\".\nBut the NAO investigation found between the end of March and November 2020, 33,139 people were given accommodation through the scheme - a number almost eight times greater than the annual snapshot of rough sleepers.\nExamples included Bristol City Council which reported it accommodated 400 people in March, despite its most recent snapshot count being 98 rough sleepers.\nAnd the London Borough of Southwark had 25 known rough sleepers in March 2020, but within hours of 'Everyone In' launching, it had taken 200 people into hotels, with nearly 1,000 accommodated by November.\nThe government pledged to carry out a review of its strategy to end rough sleeping early in 2020, but the plans took a back seat as the crisis unfolded.\nThe NAO said there was \"an ongoing need for a review of the strategy as it is out of step with the government's target\", adding there were now \"important lessons from Everyone In to consider\".\nMr Davies said the scale of the rough sleeping population in England has now been made clear, and it \"far exceeds\" previous government estimates. \n\"Understanding the size of this population, and who needs specialist support, is essential to achieve its ambition to end rough sleeping\", he added.\nThe report also highlighted the large number of people remaining in emergency accommodation unable to move on as they have no recourse to public funds - a condition put into the residence permit of some immigrants meaning they cannot access benefits.\nThe NAO also called on the government to \"keep under close review\" its more targeted response to the current coronavirus resurgence, whether it will \"protect vulnerable individuals as decisively\" as 'Everyone in'.\nA spokesman from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said they were pleased the NAO recognised its achievements with 'Everyone In'.\nHe added: \"By November, we had supported around 33,000 people, with nearly 10,000 in emergency accommodation and more than 23,000 in longer-term accommodation.\n\"We recently announced an additional \u00a310m to help accommodate rough sleepers and ensure they are registered with a GP to receive the vaccine, and we will invest \u00a3750m next year as part of our commitment to end rough sleeping.\"\nAsked whether the review into the ending rough sleeping strategy would take place, the spokesman said: \"Our ambition to end rough sleeping within this parliament still stands, and we are regularly taking into account the lessons learned from our ongoing pandemic response, including 'Everyone In'.\""

In London, a total of 199,986 first doses were given and in the East the figure was 186,291. \nThese include care home residents, frontline heath and care staff, the over-80s and people who are clinically extremely vulnerable, who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill and dying from the Covid-19.\nThe percentage of the whole population to have received a first dose so far ranged from 4.3% in the north-east and Yorkshire to 2.2% in London. \nMr Khan said he was \"hugely concerned\" that Londoners had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country.\n\"The situation in London is critical with rates of the virus extremely high, which is why it's so important that vulnerable Londoners are given access to the vaccine as soon as possible,\" he said.\nHe said he would hold talks with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi to ensure more vaccines were delivered to reflect the level of need in the city.\nLondon has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions.\nDr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said vaccinating over a third of all over-80s was \"a great achievement\".\nBut she said people must continue to follow the guidance that is in place to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n\"These data will help us to evaluate the protection from the vaccine and to effectively target the roll-out of the programme to help control the virus and save lives,\" she added."

      "text": "Donald Trump faces trial in the Senate after becoming the first US president to be charged with misconduct in office for a second time.\nMr Trump is accused of inciting a mob that stormed Congress last week after he repeated false claims of election fraud. Five people died.\nThe trial will be held after the president leaves office next Wednesday.\nIf Mr Trump is convicted, senators could also vote to bar him from ever holding public office again.\nThe trial follows Wednesday's vote in the House of Representatives that formally charged - or impeached - the president with \"incitement of insurrection\" for his role in the riot.\nThe Republican president has rejected responsibility for the violence. In a video released by the White House after the vote, he called on his supporters to remain peaceful, without mentioning his impeachment.\nThe FBI has warned of possible armed protests planned for Washington DC and all 50 US state capitals in the days before Joe Biden, a Democrat, is inaugurated as the new US president.\nThe Senate - the upper house of the US Congress - will hold a trial to determine the president's guilt but this will not happen during Mr Trump's remaining week in office. \nRepublican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said there was \"simply no chance that a fair or serious trial\" could conclude given \"the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents\" that govern trials involving presidents.\nA two-thirds majority will be needed to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote with Democrats in the evenly split, 100-seat chamber.\nAs many as 20 Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. In a note to colleagues, Mr McConnell said he had not made a final decision on how he would vote.\nIf Mr Trump is convicted, senators could then hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again, which he has indicated he planned to do in 2024.\nMr Trump was impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine, but acquitted by the Senate.\nImpeachment charges are political, not criminal. The president was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House.\nHe urged them to \"peacefully and patriotically\" make their voices heard, but also to \"fight like hell\" against an election that he falsely told them had been stolen.\nFollowing Mr Trump's remarks, his supporters broke into the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to suspend certification of election results and take shelter while the building was placed on lockdown.\nThe article of impeachment stated that Mr Trump \"repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were fraudulent and should not be accepted\".\nIt says he then repeated these claims and \"wilfully made statements to the crowd that encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol\", leading to violence and loss of life.\n\"President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government, threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperilled a coequal branch of government.\"\nDonald Trump has made history once again, this time as the first president to be impeached twice.\nA year ago, the move was opposed in lockstep by the Republican Party. This time, a handful of conservatives backed the move. It is a reflection not only of the gravity of the moment, but also the president's declining influence in the final days of his administration.\nImpeachment sets up a Senate trial for Mr Trump that now appears destined to stretch into the early days of Joe Biden's presidency, creating yet another challenge for the incoming president. It also will stoke an ongoing debate among Republicans over the direction their party takes in the days ahead.\nThe party is on a path that splits in two very different directions. On one side is continued allegiance to the president's brand of politics - one that created a new coalition of voters that delivered the White House and Congress in 2016, but lost both in 2020.\nOn the other is an uncertain future - but one free from the president's unique style of heat and rhetoric - unfiltered invective that even many Republicans now believe contributed to last week's Capitol riot\nRead more from Anthony\nFor two hours, members of the Democratic-controlled House made statements for and against the vote on impeachment while National Guard troops kept watch inside and outside the Capitol. \nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said: \"The president of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country. He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\"\nMost Republicans did not seek to defend Mr Trump's rhetoric, instead arguing that the impeachment had bypassed the customary hearings and calling on Democrats to drop it for the sake of national unity.\n\"Impeaching the president in such a short time frame would be a mistake,\" said Kevin McCarthy, the House's top Republican. \"That doesn't mean the president's free from fault. The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters.\"\nMr Trump was impeached by 232-197, with ten Republicans siding with Democrats. Among them was the third-ranking House Republican, Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney.\nWith a sombre and conciliatory tone, Mr Trump said in his video after the vote: \"Violence and vandalism have no place in our country... No true supporter of mine would ever endorse political violence.\"\nMr Biden said he hoped senators would not neglect the \"other urgent business of this nation\", such as approving his cabinet nominees, coronavirus relief and the nationwide vaccination programme.

What sets the individual analyses apart is the different ways the agencies go about handling quirks and biases in the data. For example, how do you incorporate the Arctic where we have relatively few measurements but where we know temperatures are rising faster than most other places? \nThe different agencies have their own ways to extrapolate from nearby instrument stations to gauge what's going on in this region. It's best not to get hung up on the small differences between the curves. Look instead at the trend. On this they all absolutely agree 100%. Planet Earth is warming.\nOne of the key concerns in the data from 2020 is the way that the warming driven by humans is over-compensating for natural events that help reduce temperatures.\n\"The exceptional heat of 2020 is despite a La Ni\u00f1a event, which has a temporary cooling effect,\" said WMO Secretary-General, Prof Petteri Taalas.\n\"It is remarkable that temperatures in 2020 were virtually on a par with 2016, when we saw one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1o warming events on record. This is a clear indication that the global signal from human-induced climate change is now as powerful as the force of nature.\"\nThe fact that 2020 saw global temperatures rising 1.2C above the pre-industrial figure is a growing concern. \nUnder the Paris Agreement, governments have promised to make their best efforts to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C this century, as scientists have shown it makes a massive difference to keeping our planet habitable. \nIn fact, if you just look at the temperatures on land, 2020 breached this limit. \nAccording to Noaa, the globally-averaged land surface temperature for 2020 was 1.59C above the 20th Century average. This is the highest among all years in Noaa's 141-year record and surpasses the previous record set in 2016 by 0.05C.\n\"2020 has proved to be another notable year in the global climate record,\" observed Dr Colin Morice, senior scientist in the Met Office's climate monitoring team.\n\"With all datasets showing a continued rise in global average temperature, the latest figures take the world one step closer to the limits stipulated by the Paris Agreement.\"\nAnother factor that helped drive up temperatures in 2020 was air pollution, or the lack of it.\nGlobal lockdowns meant fewer cars on the roads and airplanes in the sky.\nAs the dirty air disappeared this allowed more sunlight to hit the Earth's surface, boosting temperatures. \n\"The cars that we drive produce a lot of what's called NOx, nitrogen oxides. And those went down pretty much everywhere, where we had restrictions,\" said Dr Schmidt. \n\"And what that has done is it has removed a little bit of that reflective air pollution. Our calculations and (those of) others suggest that that may have warmed the climate just a little bit over the last year.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Companies",
      "text": "Primark says it has no plans to sell its clothes online despite warning that lockdown store closures could cost it more than \u00a31bn in lost sales. \nSome 305 of Primark's 389 global stores are shut - including all 190 UK outlets - but unlike rivals it has no online arm to fall back on.\nCustomers have said they would welcome the retailer setting up an online shop.\nBut Primark, which saw a 30% sales fall to \u00a32bn in the 16 weeks to 2 January, says the cost would mean price rises. \nIt contrasts with online only fashion retailers such as Asos and Boohoo, whose sales rose by around 40% in the last four months of 2020.\nOn Thursday, consumers called on Primark to embrace e-commerce with one tweeting: \"Online sales are thru the roof during the pandemic. You're missing out on a LOT of money.\"\nBut the retailer tweeted back: \"We prefer to sell our products in our physical stores but thanks for the suggestion.\"\nSince March last year, non-essential shops in the UK and overseas have faced strict curbs and prolonged closures and all are currently shut in England. \nIn a statement, Primark said that if all of its stores stayed closed until 27 February 2021, it expected to miss out on \u00a31.05bn of sales - up from a previous estimate of \u00a3650m. \nThe retailer said it would partially mitigate this by cutting its costs, but did not say if that would mean job losses. It added that it only expected to break even in the first half of the financial year, after seeing healthy operating profits of \u00a3441m last time around. \nIn the past Primark has said it won't sell online because the cost of manning the operation and processing high volumes of returns would mean it could no longer offer low prices.\n\"As a fast fashion retailer they are on a low margins anyway -  they have to be very competitive on price,\" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData told the BBC.\nHe said pure online players like Asos and Boohoo could make it work because they were \"geared up for it in terms of logistics\". \n\"But Primark would be starting from scratch, and would have to integrate any new online operation with its existing store structure which would be costly.\"\nDespite this Mr O'Brien said the retailer was still likely succeed, pointing to the surge in sales it saw when its shops reopened after the first lockdown. \nBut Retail Economics' Richard Lim said Primark was at risk of \"potentially alienating its customers\" who increasingly expect to be able to shop online. \n\"They have very loyal customers who love the brand, but they are crying out to be able to access it online. \n\"The longer they are not online, the more disruptive it is. The more their customers are discovering new brands and ways to shop.\" \nAssociated British Foods also owns food and agriculture businesses. Sales across the group were down 13% in the 16 weeks to 2 January at \u00a34.8bn. \nThere are always winners and losers in retail but this Christmas the picture is more polarised than ever thanks to the effects of the pandemic. Just contrast the fortunes of Primark, which doesn't sell online, with Boohoo and Asos which have both reported soaring growth in sales.\nAll our big supermarkets have now reported bumper Christmas trading, too, which is no real surprise given we can't go out to eat and so many of us are working from home. This growth has also been driven by an extraordinary rise in internet orders. \nWhile Primark is bracing itself to lose \u00a31bn in business as a result of store closures, Tesco says it added \u00a31bn of extra sales online this festive quarter. It's been very tough for many traditional non-food retailers, big and small, who've been unable to make up for all the lost sales from their High Street shops. Looking ahead, the big question is where the online dial will settle when our lives eventually return to normal. "

      "tags": "Swansea Bay University Health Board,Coronavirus lockdown measures,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic,Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board",
      "text": "How is Covid-19 affecting Wales? Nearly a month since the latest lockdown came into force, hospitals have more patients with the virus than ever before and weekly deaths are close to the peak levels seen at the end of April.\nBut case rates seem to be easing off and the vaccination rollout has started, if a little stutteringly.\nHere is a snapshot - in six charts - to show where we are.\nIn the week before Christmas, Merthyr Tydfil had the highest case rate in the UK for Covid-19.\nFrom that peak of 1,349 cases per 100,000, it has been cut considerably. The latest figures show 545.5 cases per 100,000, which is 29 positive cases in the past week.\nBut while the south Wales valleys and Bridgend were showing up as hotspots for weeks, concerns have switched to north Wales - and the north east region in particular.\nHealth officials believe the faster-spreading variant of Covid-19 has taken root and is responsible for at least 70% of cases in north Wales.\nWrexham has seen a steady rise in its case rate. It now stands at 970.9 cases per 100,000 - its highest point.\nTwelve of its communities make up the highest 20 localised hotspots in Wales, when those figures are broken down further.\nWith at least 30% of recent positive cases in south Wales also due to the new variant, health officials will be anxious to keep a lid on its spread.\nThe case rate in Wales as a whole was for a period in December one of the highest in the world but it has been falling since the week before Christmas.\nIndeed England - including six of its regions - and Northern Ireland are now ahead of it.\nThe chief medical officer for Wales Frank Atherton cautiously welcomed this \"small fall.\" He also said around 20% of tests were now coming back positive, down from 25% last week.\n\"This is heading in the right direction but is still too high and shows that there's still a lot of coronavirus circulating in the community,\" he said.\nDoctors believe it could be at least a month before falling case rates work their way through to hospitals.\nThe pressures within Welsh hospitals have been growing - with 36% of all patients in beds having Covid. This is twice the proportion we saw in May. \nIn the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, which covers Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf, more than half its hospital patients have the virus.\nThere are also record numbers of recovering Covid patients - now more than 1,000. These are people who no longer have the virus but are too sick from the effects of it to be allowed home.\nThe numbers in critical care or on ventilators are the highest seen since the peak of the pandemic in April.\nThe challenges of containing Covid-19 infections within hospitals themselves have proved difficult. There have now been more than 3,300 infections linked to hospital outbreaks since the start of October, with 271 new cases in the most recent week.\nNot seen in the figures themselves are the effects on staff, who were said by NHS Wales bosses on Wednesday to be exhausted and on a \"constant treadmill.\"\nThe number of Covid-19 deaths during the pandemic passed the 5,000 mark in Wales in the latest weekly update from the Office for National Statistics.\nRhondda Cynon Taf has the worst mortality rate - and by one measure has the highest across England and Wales.\nOn the day the most recent lockdown came into force, there were 65 deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales - the worst in a single day since April.\nIt is still running at an average of 43 a day in the past week.\nLooking at the five-year average - seen as a reliable measure - so far this year there have been 3,945 \"excess\" deaths in Wales.\nBehaviour has changed over lockdowns, as revealed by the mobile phones we carry around. Mobility data tracked from the likes of Google show dramatic drops in journeys to work, on public transport and to shops. This information is gleaned by scientists and policy-makers as part of the overall picture on formulating the restrictions to reduce transmission of the virus.\nWe can see again how the lockdown just before Christmas caused some of the most dramatic shifts yet - but partly of course, people would be spending more time at home anyway.\nMore people in Wales were back grocery shopping, and more quickly, than after previous lockdowns. But it is still not back to the period before Christmas and is 20% below the baseline, where we were back in May.\nWorkplace data also suggests not as many are working from home than during the April-May lockdown.\nAfter an admittedly slow start off the blocks, Wales' vaccine rollout programme saw more than 10,000 first doses administered at the start of the week, almost double the number the previous day.\nAlthough the overall proportion is still behind the other UK nations, there was a sign of drawing closer to England and Scotland's rate in the latest daily figures.\nWales will hope to catch up as it aims to reach 1.5 million people in the first phase."

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "Donald Trump has been acquitted of a single impeachment charge that he incited a mob to storm the US Capitol. So what did the president say prior to the violence?\nOn 6 January, thousands of Trump supporters gathered at a \"Save America\" rally organised to challenge the result of last November's presidential election.\nThey listened as Mr Trump spoke to them on the National Mall, near the White House in Washington DC.\nIn a 70-minute address, Mr Trump exhorted them to march on Congress where politicians had met to certify Democrat Joe Biden's win. The attack began moments after he took the applause. \nThose words have now played a central part in his second impeachment, which lawmakers voted in favour of last month.\nSo what did he say? Here are five key quotes, followed by some legal analysis from Professor Garrett Epps of the University of Baltimore.\nThis was three minutes into his speech. It was a false assertion that Democrats used as the starting point for the incitement charge - not just because he said it on this day but for weeks before.\nThis quote appears in the article of impeachment, the charge that was backed by the House of Representatives, lower chamber of Congress.\nIn the months preceding the Joint Session, President Trump repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials. Shortly before the Joint Session commenced, President Trump, addressed a crowd at the Ellipse in Washington, DC. There, he reiterated false claims that \"we won this election, and we won it by a landslide\".\nThe article has been sent to the Senate, where Mr Trump's trial will begin on Tuesday.\nHere Trump was echoing the slogan of the movement to fight Mr Biden's election victory, which was started a day after the result was declared. \nIt soon gathered pace on social media and led to rallies across the US. The largest one yet was the one Mr Trump addressed on 6 January.\nThis was Mr Trump saying in the clearest terms yet that he will never accept Mr Biden's win. \nReferring to himself and his supporters collectively, Mr Trump said there would be no concession.\nHe went on: \"You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore.\"\nAt one point, Mr Trump said the Biden presidency had to be challenged.\n\"You will have an illegitimate president. That is what you will have, and we can't let that happen.\"\nThis is the longest quote from Mr Trump's speech that appears in the article of impeachment. It could also be the one that his lawyers will find hardest to defend in the trial.\nHe also wilfully made statements that, in context, encouraged - and foreseeably resulted in - lawless action at the Capitol, such as: \"if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore\".\nHowever, Mr Trump's lawyers have argued his use of the word \"fight\" was figurative, which has long been accepted in public discourse.\nThis was the part of Mr Trump's speech that his defenders have seized on to show that he never incited the crowd.\nHe said: \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\"\nThe language was very different from other sections, which borrowed more from combat or war.\nIndeed, Mr Trump's lawyers have suggested they will highlight his use of the word \"peacefully\" in the trial.\nThe president used \"we\" but he didn't join them as his supporters took the short walk from the rally to Congress.\nHe said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.\"\nWhat is incitement under the law?\nIncitement is not a crime under the First Amendment unless it meets certain criteria. \nFirst of all, it has to be intended to cause violence (and you infer that intent from the circumstances). It also has to be likely to cause violence. \nIf I go downtown and I say to two drunks standing in front of a bank, \"let's rob this bank right now\", I haven't really incited anybody, because it's not very likely they'll rob the bank. \nIf I say let's meet here tomorrow and rip things up, I'm not inciting because - in the words of the Supreme Court - where there is time for better counsels to prevail, the remedy for speech is more speech.\nThe speech has to be likely to cause - and this is very important - imminent violent action.\nIf this was a court of law, does Trump cross the line?\nIt's quite rare that somebody can be convicted of incitement. In applying that to the president's speech at the rally, it's an agonisingly close case. \nIt's pretty goddamn imminent because he's telling people to march to the Capitol and I will march with you. There wouldn't be any time for better counsels to prevail because you're just going to leave the Ellipse and walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. \nHe said we have to fight and show strength, but he also said we're very peacefully and patriotically going to ask, so he's covering himself. In the end, I think it's a jury question.\nI'm not sure he's entitled to a dismissal of charges as a matter of law. There's some discussion that government leaders have more leeway, but I don't know how that would play out. \nHe clearly knew there were people in that crowd who were ready to and intended to be violent, and he certainly did nothing to discourage that. He not only did nothing to discourage it, he strongly hinted it should happen. \nReporting by Sam Cabral"

      "text": "Top Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou has been sent bullets in the mail while under house arrest in Vancouver, according to court testimony.\nIt was one of several alleged death threats revealed on Wednesday by the company providing her security.\nMs Meng was detained in 2018 on charges relating to allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's dealings in Iran.\nHer case has created a rift between China and Canada, with Beijing repeatedly calling for her release.\nThe chief financial officer of Huawei was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the US, where she is facing charges of bank fraud and potentially causing HSBC to break US sanctions.\nDays after she was released on bail, she was placed under house arrest in Vancouver. She has been fighting against her extradition to the US, which wants her to stand trial.\nThe threats were revealed at the British Columbia Supreme Court by Doug Maynard, chief operating officer of security firm Lions Gate Risk Management. \nHe said Ms Meng received \"five or six\" threatening letters at her residence in June and July 2020 and that the letters were \"easily identifiable by markings on the outside\". He added that \"sometimes there were bullets inside the envelopes\".\nThe role of the Vancouver police and any investigations is unclear.\nMs Meng has been in court pushing for conditions of her bail to be loosened, including dropping the daytime security detail that constantly follows her.\nShe is permitted to leave home between 6am and 11pm and pays for a round-the-clock security detail. She also wears a GPS tracking anklet as stipulated by her bail conditions.\nThe government has also granted family members of Ms Meng permission to travel to Canada, sparking controversy.\nConservative MP Raquel Dancho said the exception was an \"insult to the millions of Canadians who were told by this government not to visit loved ones\" over the holidays. \nShe called the move disappointing, noting that Beijing detained two Canadians soon after Ms Meng's arrest in December 2018 and has held them in prison ever since, subjecting them to interrogations.\nMs Meng's defence lawyer has argued that Canada is effectively being asked \"to enforce US sanctions\".\nHuawei has been one of the main targets of the Trump administration's attack on Chinese companies that it deems are security threats and pass data to the government.\nThe US has placed harsh restrictions on Huawei and has banned its 5G equipment from its networks. It also added 38 names linked to Huawei to a trade blacklist.\nThis week Huawei came under fire for technology that identifies people who appear to be of Uighur origin among images of pedestrians. \nHuawei had previously said none of its technology was designed to identify ethnic groups."

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 100,000 Covid-19 vaccinations had been issued in Northern Ireland by Tuesday evening, Robin Swann has said.\nThe health minister said, of that figure, 91,419 people had received their first vaccine dose.\nHe added that 95% of care home residents had received their first dose and about 20% of those aged over 80 have received their first dose.\nIt comes as leading GP said the goal to begin a mass vaccine rollout by summer is \"achievable\" but hinges on supply. \nThe Department of Health published its plan to deliver vaccines in Northern Ireland on Tuesday.\nDr Alan Stout said the timeline was \"very sensible\" but was \"almost 100%\" dependent on getting enough of the vaccine. \nAt Wednesday's health briefing, Mr Swann said the programme had made a \"strong start\" but there was more to do.\nHe also said he has decided to issue tighter visiting guidelines for hospitals.\n\"I have ensured visiting will be permitted to hospices and care homes, but visits to general medical wards will no longer be permitted from this Friday\", he said.\nThe minister added that the measure would be kept under constant review.\nMr Swann also confirmed a new rapid test for Covid-19, which can return results in 12 minutes, would be used in emergency departments.\nHe said a pilot programme has been carried out using the LumiraDX nasal swab, which will enable health staff to \"very quickly identify patients who do not have Covid-19\".\nHe also repeated that the current lockdown restrictions were working and had helped to reduce NI's rate of infection, but warned the executive would still have \"difficult decisions\" to take in relation to decisions about whether to extend some restrictions in the coming weeks. \nOn Wednesday, a further 19 Covid-related deaths were announced by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.\nA further 1,145 new cases of the virus were also reported.\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer warned there was \"no doubt\" that levels of the new, more transmissible variant of coronavirus are rising in Northern Ireland.\nSpeaking at Stormont's executive briefing, Dr Michael McBride said that the new variant was making the job to contain it \"twice as difficult\".\nThe new variant is said to be up to 70% more transmissible, but there is no evidence it is more dangerous.\nThe first confirmed case of the new strain was detected in Northern Ireland on 23 December, but officials had said levels in Northern Ireland remained lower than in other areas of the UK.\nDr McBride said there would now be situations where the variant could spread, where previously it may not have.\n\"We need to be extremely cautious in the weeks ahead,\" he warned, adding that the virus would not \"magically disappear\" on 6 February, when the current lockdown is due to end.\nStormont ministers have to review the regulations on or before 22 January, with that scheduled for next Thursday.\nDr Stout, the chair of NI's GP committee, said practices needed another 22,000 doses to finish vaccinating people aged over 80.\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster, he said he was \"very confident\" the next doses would come through shortly. \n\"I have been overwhelmed by the desire of practices, the determination just to get going and the one thing we need to give them is vaccine - we need to get the supply in as quickly as possible. \n\"This is such a good news story that everybody wants the vaccine and everybody wants to give it.\"\nThe plan is for the vaccine to be given to the general population in summer 2021. \nGP clinics should have received their first delivery of the vaccine by Tuesday.  \nResponding to reports in The Daily Telegraph that GPs administering the vaccine in England had been asked to \"slow down\" to let other regions \"catch-up\", Dr Stout said Northern Ireland had taken a different approach to how it rolled out vaccines to GPs. \nHe said vaccines were shared among all practices in Northern Ireland.\n\"We just don't have the full amount of vaccine in practice to give. We could have given all of the vaccine that a certain number of practices needed to start with but there were issues with inequality and discrimination ... so that's why an amount has gone to every single practice, so at least they have some.\""

      "text": "High demand and heavy snow have had a \"severe impact\" on Yorkshire's ambulances, with bad weather also affecting coronavirus vaccinations.\nThe county ambulance trust declared a major incident, urging calls only in a \"serious or life-threatening emergency\" due to poor road conditions.\nA vaccination centre in Barnsley was closed, with patients told to await new appointments. \nCovid testing centres in Kirklees and Bradford also suspended operations. \nA yellow Met Office warning for snow and ice is in force until 21:00 GMT.  \nMark Millins, strategic commander at Yorkshire Ambulance Service, said \"very snowy conditions across West, South and North Yorkshire\" had caused gridlock and made driving difficult.\nStaff were \"working extremely hard to reach patients\", he said, but \"hazardous driving conditions and blocked roads mean that it is taking us longer than normal in the worst-hit areas.\"\nIn Barnsley, the town's Clinical Commissioning Group issued a tweet advising that it had postponed all Covid vaccinations at one centre from 15:00 on Thursday.\nIt asked those due to receive jabs at the Priory Campus in Lundwood after this time not to travel, and said patients would be contacted with a rescheduled appointment.\nThe group said its two remaining centres at Goldthorpe and Apollo Court, in Dodworth, remained open, but those unable to attend would also get a new time and date. \nWest Yorkshire Police said it had also seen a surge in calls and urged people not to call 101 for \"non-urgent matters\".\nSupt Chris Bowen said the force had received 300 calls to the 999 and 101 numbers in the space of an hour on Thursday morning.\nA large snowball fight on Woodhouse Moor in Leeds was criticised for an apparent lack of social distancing after footage was posted on social media.\nLiam Ford, who recorded the video, said he saw the \"awful scenes\" after he \"heard the commotion while on a walk round the block\". \nMotorists reported hazardous driving conditions on many routes and police warned people to stay at home or allow extra time for essential journeys. \nPhil Airey said his usual 30-minute commute from Boston Spa to Harrogate took 90 minutes due to the poor conditions.\n\"The gritters have been doing their job but any sort of hill then it's not very good and if you go off onto the little roads well they are not good at all,\" he said.\nWest Yorkshire's road policing unit said it was dealing with a number of crashes while the North Yorkshire force said the A59 was blocked near Skipton due to a number of vehicles getting stuck in the snow. \nElsewhere:\nThe Met Office has not issued a weather notice for Friday, but a yellow warning for snow and ice on Saturday  is in place across most of northern England and Scotland.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Yoweri Museveni,Bobi Wine,Uganda election 2021,Uganda",
      "text": "The internet is blocked and security has been stepped up in Uganda as counting gets under way after polls closed in a hotly contested election.\nA 38-year-old singer is challenging Yoweri Museveni, 76, in one of the world's youngest countries.\nRobert Kyagulanyi, known by his stage name Bobi Wine, says he represents the younger generation, while Mr Museveni says he is standing for stability.\nDozens of people have been killed in the run-up to the election.\nPolls closed at 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) but remain open for those still queuing at the time.\nSome polling stations did not open for close to two hours and voters in the queue had grown angry and had started shouting at the polling gate officials as the cause of the delay was not clear, the BBC's Patience Atuhaire reports from the capital, Kampala. \nAs vote counting began, lorries carrying soldiers drove through the city and police and local defence units were also seen patrolling, she says.\nTwenty-six people from a coalition of civil society groups have been arrested for allegedly manning an illegal vote-tallying centre at a hotel in the capital.\nAhead of the vote, the electoral commission banned the setting up of alternative polling centres.\nEarlier, the police said they intended to deploy officers on rooftops of Kampala during the election period, saying that opposition activists commanded protests from high-rise building in November, when more than 50 people were killed after Bobi Wine was arrested.\nDressed in military fatigues, Mr Museveni gave a stark warning during a televised speech on Tuesday evening: \"If you try to disturb peace, you will have yourself to blame. The security forces, following the law, are ready to deal with any troublemaker.\"\nResults are not expected before Saturday.\nAs well as being unable to get online, people are even having trouble sending text messages. \nEarlier in the week the authorities ordered the blocking of social media, messaging apps and certain sites for virtual private networks (VPNs) which people use to get around social media blocks. \nThe Ugandan authorities appear to have ordered internet providers to shut down the whole internet at 19:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on the eve of the election, according to a letter shared by journalist Samira Sawlani .\nIn the letter, which we have not verified, the Uganda Communications Commission orders internet providers to \"implement a temporary suspension of the operation of all your internet gateways and associated access points\". \nWhile it said the order was temporary, the letter did not state when the suspension should end.\nThe internet access advocacy group Access Now has urged telecoms providers to challenge the order, saying they should be \"enablers of human rights, not gatekeepers\".  \nBy Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC News, Kampala\nCoronavirus guidelines on social distancing and handwashing are proving hard to implement but here in Kibuli, which sits in the shadow of downtown Kampala, everyone queuing up is wearing facemasks.\nThere are reports that a new biometric system to verify people's identities is not working in some areas. The electoral commission's spokesperson would not confirm whether this was because the internet has been cut off.   \nThere are questions about how results from around the country will be transmitted to the national tally centre in Kampala without the internet. The electoral commission told the BBC it has systems in place to do this but didn't explain further. \nHow bad was the violence during the campaign?\nViolence has been at an unprecedented level.\nSecurity forces cracked down on gatherings ahead of the election and dozens have been killed.\nThe government says the ban on gatherings was to prevent the spread of coronavirus while the opposition say it was a smokescreen for repression.\nBobi Wine and others out of the 10 opposition candidates have been arrested on several occasions.\nIt depends who you ask.\nThe government has previously said the election would be free and fair.\nBut the US cast doubt over the electoral process and withdrew its election observers after most of its accreditation requests were denied.\nIn response, Mr Museveni's spokesman Don Wanyama tweeted that there were observers from the African Union and East African Community.\n\"I don't remember when Uganda last sent election observers to the US,\" he added. \nBobi Wine has called on voters to remain at polling stations on Thursday and use their mobile phone cameras to record the tallying process in an effort to prevent vote rigging.\nMr Museveni is standing for a sixth elected term in office, as leader of the National Resistance Movement (NRM).\nHe came to power on the back of an armed uprising in 1986 and has long been depicted to Ugandans as a liberator and peace bringer. \nBut he has managed to maintain his grip on power through a mixture of encouraging a personality cult, employing patronage, compromising independent institutions and side-lining opponents, says the BBC's Patience Atuhaire.\nBobi Wine is widely thought to be the strongest of the 10 opposition candidates in the presidential race.\nThe 38-year-old reggae star is known by his supporters as the ghetto president.\nHis party, the National Unity Platform (NUP) party campaigns for basic needs like improving access to healthcare, education, clean water and justice. \nOver the last two decades Bobi Wine's musical output has been filled with songs about these issues and they have inspired a fervent following.\nHe grew up in Kampala's Kamwokya slum where he went on to build his now world-famous recording studio."

      "tags": "Live music,Brexit,Music",
      "text": "The EU has insisted it was the UK government's choice to end visa-free touring for musicians on the continent, following an outcry from performers.\nOfficials in Brussels told the BBC that the UK \"refused\" a plan that would have let musicians tour without visas.\nThe response came after Downing Street re-affirmed that its own \"ambitious\" proposals had been rejected by the EU.\nThe EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the result was one of the \"inevitable consequences\" of Brexit.\n\"I very much regretted that the British didn't have more ambition for people's mobility,\" Mr Barnier told reporters on Thursday.\n\"From last March, we made fairly ambitious proposals in terms of mobility, including for specific categories such as journalists, performers, musicians and others,\" he went on. \"But you need to be two to make a deal.\"\nPressure has been mounting on the two sides to negotiate an exemption to the new restrictions for musicians, with performers and crews saying livelihoods could be at risk.\nSince Brexit, British musicians and crews are no longer guaranteed visa-free travel and may need extra work permits to play in certain European countries. \nUnder the terms of the deal, British bands can tour Europe for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. But tours in Germany and Spain, for instance, will now require extra visas for paid work, while those in France and The Netherlands will not.\nPopular European touring routes could now see them take on extra costs and paperwork. According to the Association of British Orchestras, truck drivers carrying stage equipment must now return to the UK after visiting two EU member states.\nA petition signed by more than 250,000 people - including Laura Marling, Biffy Clyro and Dua Lipa - is calling on the the government to \"negotiate a free cultural work permit\" that would allow \"bands, musicians, artists, TV and sports celebrities that tour the EU to perform shows and events and carnet exception for touring equipment\".\nThe government later responded to the petition, saying the EU \"turned down proposals\", while noting that \"there is scope to return to this in the future\".\nOn Thursday, Musicians' Union general secretary Horace Trubridge demanded greater support from Prime Minister Boris Johnson for UK artists hoping to tour in Europe again once it's safe to do so.\nA \"reciprocal agreement\" for EU artists arriving into the UK would be \"in the interests of the UK and EU\", he said.\n\"Our industry has been incredibly badly hit by the Covid-19 crisis and if our members are also restricted by additional costs and red tape on touring once things start to go back to normal, we will see a real downturn in what is a unique British success story: Music.\"\nMr Johnson vowed on Wednesday during Prime Minister's Questions to meet MPs to discuss the matter. \"I know that our friends in the EU will be wanting to go further to improve things for not just musicians, but business travellers of all kinds. There is a mutual benefit,\" he said.\nAn EU spokesperson told the BBC: \"The UK has chosen to no longer allow the free movement of EU citizens to the UK. It also refused to include a chapter on mobility in the agreement.\n\"These choices inevitably mean that travel between the EU and the UK - including for business purposes - will no longer be as easy as it was while the UK was a member state.\"\nHe added that the UK \"refused to include a commitment on visa-free short stays\", which could have meant people like musicians, sportspeople and journalists would not have needed individual visas.\n\"As a result, it is now up to each member state to determine if a visa is required for short-stay visits for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. This is fully in line with EU law.\"\nThe EU would not be drawn on whether it would re-open talks around music touring visas.\nThe government has previously said it \"pushed for a more ambitious agreement with the EU on the temporary movement of business travellers, which would have covered musicians and others, but our proposals were rejected by the EU\".\nOn Tuesday, it added that \"the door remains open should the EU change its mind\".\nThen on Wednesday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden blamed the EU for \"letting down music on both sides of the Channel - not us\".\nProf Catherine Barnard, deputy director of research organisation UK In A Changing Europe, told BBC News: \"The bottom line is that the EU did offer up to 90 days, and with the possibility of being paid.\n\"I suspect the UK probably said no because they have a very hard line on anything that may even look like free movement of persons, which of course the UK had committed itself to stopping.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers.\nThe British Medical Association is appealing for a higher grade of face mask to guard against coronavirus infection. \nIt says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols.\nThese are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19.\nThis follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units.\nPublic Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updated in October 2020.\nEarly in the pandemic, it was widely believed that to catch the disease you had to either be close to an infected person and hit by droplets from their coughs or sneezes or touch a surface they had contaminated.\nBut research during the course of last year highlighted how it is also possible for the virus to be carried in what are called aerosols, drifting and accumulating in the air. \nMost infections are thought to have occurred indoors in badly ventilated rooms, and many studies have shown that the 'airborne route' can be an important factor. \nAcross the UK, the guidance for hospital staff is to wear surgical masks in most areas. \nMore sophisticated masks - a type known as FFP3 that includes an air filter - are only required in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that are known to generate aerosols.\nIn their letter, the consultants, doctors and nurses say healthcare workers are three to four times more likely to become infected than the general population. \nBut they point out that staff in intensive care units, who have the best level of protection, have about half the risk of catching the virus than colleagues on general wards. \nThe letter states: \"It is now essential that healthcare workers have their PPE upgraded to protect against airborne transmission\".\nBarry McAree, a consultant surgeon in Northern Ireland, is one of many healthcare workers to be ill with Covid. \nHe is self-isolating at home right after his testing positive for the second time. \nA signatory to the letter, he says his hospital in Antrim followed the guidance about which type of masks should be worn in which areas, but he became infected nonetheless. It is not clear how and when he caught it.\n\"There's so much evidence that we are talking about an airborne infection that it has to be said that it is not appropriate just to wear FFP3 in environments when aerosol generating procedures take place.\"\nHe believes that with such high levels of the virus in the community and in hospitals, staff should be wearing the higher-grade masks whenever they're close to patients.\nSurgical masks can be bought online for about 10p each, while the FFP3 masks are far more expensive about \u00a35.00.  \nDr Barry Jones, a retired gastroenterologist and leading expert on aerosols, says that's nothing compared to the cost of a patient with Covid,\nHe points to data showing that roughly a fifth of people needing hospital treatment for Covid may have acquired the infection in hospital in the first place. \n\"We should do everything we can to reduce that possibility - it's the air we share that's killing us.\"\nA few hospitals have decided to break with official guidance.\nIt's understood that hospitals in Cambridge, Plymouth and Exeter have decided to equip staff with FFP3 masks if they face patients diagnosed with Covid or suspected of having it. \nOne consultant, who did not want to be named, said: \"When you realise patients are more infectious at an earlier stage of disease and are presenting at general wards with poorer ventilation than intensive care units and staff are wearing a poorer quality of PPE, you really want those in a position of leadership to listen and to act.\"\nRCN General Secretary Dame Donna Kinnair, said: \"Without delay, they must state whether existing PPE guidance is adequate for the new variant. \n\"While more research is carried out, we ask for the precautionary principle to be applied and staff to be given a higher level of PPE if working with suspected or confirmed cases.\"\nPublic Health England said this was a matter for NHS England to comment on.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"The safety of NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work tirelessly to deliver PPE that protects those on the frontline.\n\"UK guidance on the safest levels of PPE is written by experts and agreed by all four chief medical officers. Our guidance is kept under constant review based on the latest evidence and data.\n\"Emerging evidence and data, including on variant strains, will be continually monitored and reviewed, and the guidance updated accordingly if needed.\""

      "text": "The licence fee is the \"least worst\" way of funding the BBC, its incoming chairman Richard Sharp has said.\nBut Mr Sharp told MPs he had an \"open mind\" about how the corporation should be funded in the future, and it \"may be worth reassessing\" the current system.\nHe also said he didn't think the BBC's Brexit coverage was biased overall, but \"there were some occasions when the Brexit representation was unbalanced\".\nQuestion Time \"seemed to have more Remainers than Brexiteers\", he said.\nThe \u00a3157.50 licence fee is due to stay in place until at least 2027, when the BBC's Royal Charter ends, with a debate about how the broadcaster should be funded after that.\nMr Sharp, who spent 23 years working as a banker for Goldman Sachs, told the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee: \"At 43p a day, the BBC represents terrific value.\"\nThe government is currently reviewing whether its cost should continue rising with inflation from 2022, and whether non-payment should remain a criminal offence. Mr Sharp said he was \"not in favour of decriminalisation\".\nHe said other possible options for funding the BBC in the future could include a household tax like the one used in Germany, \"which amounts to the same amount of money\".\nHe added: \"So when we next get the chance to review the structure of this then it may be worth reassessing.\"\nAsked whether he believed the BBC's coverage of Brexit had been unbalanced, he replied: \"No, actually I don't.\n\"I believe there were some occasions when the Brexit representation was unbalanced.\n\"So if you ask me if I think Question Time seemed to have more Remainers than Brexiteers, the answer is yes, but the breadth of the coverage I thought was incredibly balanced, in a highly toxic environment that was extremely polarised.\"\nQuestion Time has said it has robust processes in place to ensure balance on its panels.\nMr Sharp said he was \"considered to be a Brexiteer\" and had donated around \u00a3400,000 to the Conservative Party over the past 20 years.\nHe said the biggest issue now facing the BBC is impartiality, and that \"trust in leadership and trust in processes\" must be rebuilt after high-profile equal pay cases with journalists such as Carrie Gracie and Samira Ahmed. \n\"Clearly some of the problems it's had recently are really rather terrible and reflect a culture that needs to be rebuilt, so everybody who cherishes the BBC and works at the BBC feels proud and happy to work there,\" he said. \"Then in my view that would produce a better output inevitably.\"\nMr Sharp also told the committee he would give his \u00a3160,000 salary as BBC chairman to charity. \nWhen asked \"what's in it for you?\" Mr Sharp, whose heritage is Jewish, said: \"We're all a product of our upbringing and I was very fortunate with the parents I have, my great grandparents came to this country escaping tyranny.\n\"I think I won the lottery in life to be British and if I can make a contribution, I couldn't be happier to.\n\"The BBC is part of the fabric of all our national identities, it offers education and enrichment and is also important for our position in the world... It is a massive privilege to be chair of the BBC.\"\nSir David Clementi, the current BBC chairman, steps down in February.

      "tags": "Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs,Scotland Brexit,Scotland economy,Denmark,Scotland business,European Union,Fishing industry",
      "text": "A Scottish shellfish firm has warned it is on the brink of bankruptcy as delays continue at ports following the introduction of post-Brexit red tape.\nLochfyne Langoustines managing director Jamie McMillan said his firm had already lost some consignments after they were found to be rotten by the time they arrived in France.  \nHe also warned EU customers were now going to Denmark to buy langoustines. \nMr McMillan described it as a \"very, very serious situation\".\nHis comments came after transport company DFDS announced a further delay in exports of group consignments of seafood to the EU.\nIt halted groupage exports last week after delays in getting new paperwork for EU border posts in France. \nDFDS said it would not resume those exports until Monday.\nMr McMillan told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We've been screaming for the last six months - eight months - that we have to get our produce to market within 12 to 24 hours. \n\"Any delays in that process, our shellfish will arrive in France dead. \n\"We lost two pallets last week. It took five days to arrive in Boulogne from Scotland, so our goods were rotten on arrival.\"\nHe added: \"Customers are not buying from us any more - we have become unreliable suppliers.\n\"Everybody has stopped buying. This has happened for the past two weeks. We can't continue this to happen for another week because we will be out of business. \n\"We have had no sales to the EU, our biggest market for live shellfish, in the last two weeks. \n\"If we go another week without that, we are finished.\"\nMr McMillan said there were \"sticking points\" in both the UK and France, with transportation hubs in Scotland struggling with increased paperwork and checks by vets.\n\"There are sticking points down in France as well,\" he said. \n\"There are delays at the borders in France for up to 30 hours, I'm hearing, to clear customs by the time they do all their checks.\"\nThe UK government's Scotland Office minister David Duguid said he did not underestimate the struggles the industry was facing with paperwork, IT and ports.  \nHe said the UK and Scottish governments, fish exporters and the EU needed to come together to work through the issues, which he estimated would last \"weeks\" and not months.\nHe told Good Morning Scotland: \"What I can commit to is that the UK government, whether that's through Defra or the Scotland Office, we are working day and night in resolving the issues that we know about and that we can fix directly. \n\"The other issues that are maybe the responsibility of the Scottish government, or indeed the EU on the other side of the channel, Defra are engaging heavily with those parties as well.\" \nHowever, when asked directly on the programme how long the problems would last, Mr Duguid responded: \"How long is a piece of string?\"\nFish ate up a lot of the time in negotiating the deal for departing the European customs union and single market.\nNow grown to become a much bigger political predator, it has started the post-Brexit era by threatening to devour UK ministers with the task of making the deal work.\nThe fisheries minister admitted she was preparing for Christmas rather than seeing how the deal had turned out on 24 December. Asked how long it will take to sort out delays, a Scotland Office minister asked: \"How long's a piece of string?\"\nThe prime minister says there will be compensation, but it seems that is due to come from the fund intended to expand the fishing fleet. \nAnd Michael Gove, who appears to have more of a grasp of the detail, was in the Commons on Wednesday, acknowledging there's a vast amount for the government yet to sort out - and that was only for Northern Ireland.\nAt least the province got a grace period before consignments of food require the paperwork now needed to send fish to France. That was sought by fish and meat exporters. \nIt's not clear if the request was made of EU negotiators, but it hasn't materialised. Yet coming the other way, the UK has given a six-month preparation period for EU exporters to Britain.\nBecause seafood is freshly delivered, it is the product that hit the obstacles first. Meat and dairy are sure to follow. \nBeef exporters to Europe are beginning to face delays, while Brexit chickens are coming home to roast."

It is a very difficult circumstance,\" he said.\n\"We are trying to do the best and what is right for as many pupils as possible in looking at various permutations and combinations of criteria\". \nEducation Minister Peter Weir said it was \"a very disappointing day\" for many families.\n\"The transfer test, while it has never been about being compulsory for either a school or indeed an individual parent, does enable a level of parental choice and that has been dramatically reduced as a result of that,\" he told Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"But sadly what we have seen is for this year, the pandemic has prevented those transfer tests taking place, and I am very disappointed and entirely understand the disappointment and frustration of many families today.\"\nMr Weir said there had been \"a lack of consistency\" from AQE.\n\"I don't think the way things have worked out from AQE's point of view, particularly over the last couple of weeks, have been particularly helpful,\" he said.\nThe minister also apologised for \"clumsy language\" in a statement he issued on Wednesday night.\nWriting on Twitter about the cancellation of the transfer test, Mr Weir said: \"This severely limits parental choice and children's opportunities.\"\n\"There was no adverse intention towards non-selective schools,\" he said in relation to his tweet.\n\"I think both selective and non-selective schools have got excellent records in Northern Ireland.\"\n\"But once the opportunities for entry to any school is reduced then that is a reduction in opportunities for all.\"\nUUP MLA Robbie Butler has proposed that pupils' results in tests in primary schools could be given to parents and then used by grammar schools to decide which children get a place.\nMr Butler said that he had some favourable responses from some grammars and some primary schools to that proposal.\n\"Whilst I don't think my solution is absolutely perfect I do believe it to be absolutely fair and absolutely compassionate,\" he told MLAs on the committee.\n\"We have the genesis of a solution for these P7 pupils.\"\nBut, speaking on Wednesday, Mr Weir replied that there were issues with that approach.\n\"There are very major problems, I'm being honest with you, in terms of the models that have been put forward for academic selection without the test,\" he said.\nThe minister said it would be difficult to get comparable information for pupils across all primaries.\n\"While it's not entirely ruling out those and there is the option for schools to do it, it does leave them in a very difficult position making comparability between pupils on a fair basis,\" he said"

      "text": "A large London plumbing firm plans to rewrite all of its workers' contracts to require them to be vaccinated against coronavirus.\nPimlico Plumbers chairman Charlie Mullins said it was \"a no-brainer\" that workers should get the jab.\nIf they do not want to comply with the policy, it will be decided on a case-by-case basis whether they are kept on, he said.\nEmployment lawyers said the plan carried risks for the business.\nThe NHS is seeking to vaccinate 15 million people from priority groups by mid-February as part of efforts to try to control the spread of Covid-19.\nBut Mr Mullins said he was prepared to pay for private immunisations for people at the firm, should they become available, which would be done on the company's time.\nDoctors have warned that key hospital services in England are in crisis, with reports of hospitals cancelling urgent operations after a surge in Covid patients in recent weeks.\nPimlico Plumbers plans to change its contracts for new joiners to require immunisation. It will rewrite its contracts with existing workers and employees as soon as is practical, depending on vaccine availability.\nThe firm has about 350 plumbers working as contractors and about 120 employees. \nMr Mullins said the firm was \"not putting anyone under any pressure\" to have the jab.\nHowever, new starters who were not immunised would not be taken on, he said.\nMr Mullins said employees approved of the policy.\n\"It's a no-brainer,\" he said. \"I've talked to people who have said: 'I will queue up all night to get the vaccine.' \n\"I think it will be the norm in five or six months. To go into a bar or cinema, or go on a plane, you have to have a vaccine,\" he added.\nMr Mullins said he had set aside \u00a3800,000 to pay for private vaccinations, but estimated costs more in the region of \u00a3100,000.\n\"Whatever it costs, I will pay,\" he said. \"I would pay \u00a31m tomorrow to safeguard our staff.\n\"If people don't want the vaccine, let them sit at home and not have a normal life,\" he added.\nHowever, employment lawyers said this vaccination policy could be risky.\nLegally, companies cannot force employees to take a vaccine, said Thrive Law managing director Jodie Hill.\n\"They can't jab a vaccine in your arm,\" she said.\nPeople who refuse vaccination and are dismissed may have grounds to make a legal claim, she said.\n\"Even if they put that [requirement] in a new contract, I don't think they'd get away with it,\" she said.\nEmployees with more than two years' service could claim unfair dismissal. But this option is not open to workers and self-employed contractors.\nBroadly, people can refuse a vaccination for legitimate reasons such as being pregnant or breastfeeding, for religious reasons, because of disability or allergy, or for ethical vegan reasons if the jab contains animal products.\nThe two vaccines approved for use in the UK, from Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech, do not contain any components of animal origin, a Department for Health and Social Care spokesman confirmed.\nDismissal for employees with one or more of these protected characteristics could give rise to a discrimination claim.\nPeople who are hesitant about taking the vaccine for personal reasons would not be able to claim discrimination, but could potentially claim unfair dismissal if they have been with the firm for two years or more.\nPeople with strong anti-vaccination beliefs may be protected under equality law, Ms Hill added.\nThe company and Mr Mullins have previously faced a lengthy legal battle with one of its former contractors, Gary Smith.\nIn 2018, Mr Smith won a Supreme Court ruling over holiday and sick pay. However, an employment tribunal later ruled that he was not entitled to make a claim for the back pay, as he had not completed the necessary paperwork.\nMr Mullins insisted that the vaccination change to contracts \"will be done legally\", but said that he was willing to take this matter to the Supreme Court as well, if necessary."

      "text": "The co-founder for Cyberpunk 2077's developer has released a new video explaining what went wrong with the game.\nCD Projekt's Marcin Iwi\u0144ski admitted they \"underestimated the task\" of adapting the game for consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One.\nGamers reported glitches including choppy frame rates and screen tearing.\nMarcin says he's \"deeply sorry for this and this video is me publicly owning up\".\nThe game was arguably the most anticipated release of 2020 but the launch just before Christmas was a disaster.\nThe problems led to Sony and Microsoft removing the game from online stores and gamers were offered refunds. \nCyberpunk 2077 is a set in the fictional Night City - a dystopian future where pollution and crime are rampant and social inequality is the norm.\nIn the video, Marcin explains issues originated from Cyperpunk's \"huge\" scope, particularly the high number \"of custom objects, interacting systems, and mechanics\", making it a complex game.\nAs this was \"condensed in one big city\" rather than spread over a bigger space - it needed greater hardware capability.\nSo despite working well for high-end PCs, it couldn't be adjusted to older generation consoles such as the PS4 and Xbox One, making in-game streaming difficult.\n\"We hit the ground running on PC. While not perfect, it's a version of Cyberpunk we're very proud of.\"\nMarcin adds that testing did not \"show a big part of the issues\" that gamers experienced.\n\"As we got closer to the final release, we saw significant improvements each and every day.\"\nHe also blames the coronavirus pandemic for creating issues for CD Projekt as they tried to improve performance after launch. \n\"A lot of the dynamics we normally take for granted got lost over video calls or email. And we took that hit too.\"\nMarcin added the \"incredibly hard working and talented\" development team should not be blamed for problems, saying the final decision came down to him and the board.\n\"Believe me, we never ever intended for anything like this to happen. I assure you that we will do our best to regain your trust\".\nAs part of that, he says they intend to fix the problems and improve the game across platforms.\n\"Our ultimate goal is to fix the bugs and crashes,\" he says, with updates to the game expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks.\n\"We treat this entire situation very seriously and are working hard to make it right.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "tags": "Portugal,Coronavirus testing,Brazil,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A ban on travellers to the UK from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde will begin on Friday due to a new Covid variant identified in Brazil.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the rules would come in from 04:00 GMT.\nBritish and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights will still be able to travel but must isolate for 10 days.\nOn Thursday the UK reported a further 1,248 coronavirus deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nThe previous day had seen a record figure of 1,564. There were also another 48,682 daily Covid cases.\nThe number of people in the UK to have received the first dose of a vaccine has risen to 2,918,252 - up by 278,943 from Wednesday.\nThe new travel ban applies to people who have travelled from, or through, the South American countries of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela in the last 10 days.\nPortugal, including the islands of Madeira and the Azores, is also banned, along with the central American nation of Panama and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde, off the West African coast. \nMr Shapps said he \"can't provide an end date\" to the new rules.\nHe said the current restrictions on global travel meant he didn't \"expect a large number of Brits to have jaunted off to South America and we're not expecting to see a big repatriation issue as a result\".\nPortugal had been included \"given its strong travel links with Brazil\", he said, but added that there would be an exemption for hauliers travelling from the country to allow the transportation of essential goods.\nHe said suspending travel from that European country would act \"as another way to reduce the risk of importing infections\".\nQatar and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba have also been removed from the UK's travel corridor lists, meaning anyone arriving from these countries after 04:00 GMT on Saturday will have to quarantine for 10 days.\nJon Dent, 31, from Wolverhampton, travelled to Brazil with his wife Carla, 32, in October so that her family - who live in Goiania - could see their daughter Luiza, one, for the first time. \nThey are due to fly back to the UK on 6 February but Jon now fears they may be stuck out there for months due to the travel ban. \n\"We had planned to visit in February 2020 but we had to postpone because of the lockdown and that was rough on my wife, she suffered a lot.  \n\"Now I think my mum is suffering as she's expecting Luiza to be back, but who knows now? \n\"My initial reaction was worry because it's so unknown. The thought of not being able to return home and being stranded is not a nice feeling. \n\"I'm hoping British residents will be able to get home but I don't know if the government will organise flights. I think it's a long shot. I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months.\n\"We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible.\" \nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"very concerned\" about the Brazilian variant of the virus.\nNew variants of Covid-19 have previously been identified in the UK and South Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations.\nSeveral Central and South American nations had already restricted travel from the UK, including Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama, while others such as Argentina and Uruguay have closed their borders to non-resident foreign nationals. \nThe Department for Transport said under the ban no exemptions would apply, including those for employment, and people who live with someone who has travelled from one of the banned countries will have to self-isolate for 10 days.\nBBC News online health editor Michelle Roberts said there was no sign that any of the new variants were more dangerous, with scientists confident that vaccines would work against them.\nFelipe Naveca, deputy director of research at the Brazilian state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said the new variant was \"of concern\" and its origin was \"undoubtedly\" from the Amazon region.\nHe told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson the new variant had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same mutations.\n\"Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern,\" he said, adding: \"We have to stop the virus from circulating, because we're giving it the opportunity to evolve.\"\nBy Vanessa Buschschl\u00fcter, News Online Latin America editor\nThe Covid pandemic may have arrived in South America later than in Europe but it did so with a vengeance. In May, the World Health Organization warned that it had become the new epicentre of the pandemic with Brazil soon joining the top three countries with the most confirmed cases.\nBut the travel ban is not about numbers; some of the countries on the list have had relatively few Covid cases, like Guyana with fewer than 7,000.\nThis is about the new strain and how it could spread quickly through travel in the region. Brazil borders 10 countries and cross-border business is brisk.\nPanama, also on the list even though it is further to the north, is a major travel hub for flights from South America to Europe and the US.\nAnd tourism has not stopped either. On 25 December, Brazil suspended all flights from the UK over the new UK strain, but air travel from other countries continued, especially over Christmas - the main holiday season in the southern hemisphere. \nThe travel ban comes after it was announced a requirement for arrivals into England to test negative for coronavirus 72 hours before their journey will now come into force at 04:00 GMT on Monday. The Scottish government said the delay meant it would also wait until Monday.\nWales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own plans in the coming days.\nMr Shapps said the new rules had been delayed from Friday to allow British nationals to be able to get home, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said people would be \"bewildered\" by the delay and would \"feel that we're exposed\".\nMeanwhile, Covid-19 case rates have fallen in most regions of England, according to the latest data from Public Health England's weekly surveillance report. \nLondon continues to have the highest rate of any region but its rate of new cases stood at 864.9 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 10 January, down from 1,043.9 in the previous week. \nThe North East, East Midlands, East, South East and Yorkshire & the Humber also recorded a week-on-week fall. \nHowever, the rate increased in the North West, South West and the West Midlands. \nIn other developments:\nAre you due to travel back to the UK from any of the affected countries?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Northern Ireland Assembly",
      "text": "Passengers arriving into NI from outside the UK and Republic of Ireland will soon have to produce a negative Covid-19 test before departure.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster confirmed the executive had agreed the plan on Thursday.\nPeople arriving from countries not on the government's travel corridors list will also still have to self-isolate for 10 days.\nThe move has already been agreed in the Republic of Ireland.\nPassengers arriving there will be subject to the new rules from Saturday, with the measure taking effect in England and Scotland from Monday.\nNegative tests 72 hours prior to arrival are already a requirement in the Republic of Ireland for passengers travelling from Great Britain and South Africa.\nSpeaking at Stormont's press conference on Thursday, the first minister said Northern Ireland's R-number had also fallen to between 0.7 and 0.9 for new cases of the virus.\nThe reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the drop showed the \"very real\" effect of lockdown restrictions imposed on 26 December, but she warned there was still \"no room for complacency\".\nShe said she still believed there needed to be an \"two-island approach\" to travel restrictions, including discussions with the British and Irish governments as a \"matter of urgency\".\nMrs Foster said Stormont ministers had also expressed frustration at the executive meeting over a lack of data-sharing from authorities in the Republic of Ireland, and called for it to be escalated.\nPSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said 40 penalty notices a day are being handed out to those who breach the Covid-19 regulations.\nHe told the press briefing that if people continued flouting rules, they could expect \"firm and swift enforcement\".\n\"We won't turn a blind eye when people break the rules.\"\nOn Thursday, 16 more deaths related to Covid-19 were reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 1,533. \nThere have been 973 new cases diagnosed in the past 24 hours, while 58 Covid-19 patients are being treated in ICUs across Northern Ireland, of which 44 are on ventilators. \nMrs Foster said she found it \"incredible and frankly unbelievable\" that some people were still holding house parties and gatherings, despite the pandemic rates and the lockdown. \nOn Wednesday, health officials warned that levels of the new, more transmissible variant of the virus are rising.\nMr Swann said that meant more \"difficult decisions\" on lockdown restrictions could be required.\nNorthern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19.\nThe executive is due to review the current restrictions on 21 January.\nThe first and deputy first ministers said they would take evidence from health officials before deciding whether an extension of the lockdown would be required.\nMinisters have also expressed concerns about some larger retailers \"gaming\" the regulations and keeping open non-essential parts of their businesses.\nA meeting between the first and deputy first ministers and representatives of the retail sector is due to happen on Friday afternoon.\nElsewhere, the Chief Medical Officer has confirmed that unpaid carers looking after Clinically Extremely Vulnerable individuals should receive the first dose of their vaccine when phase two of the vaccination programme begins next month.\nDr Michael McBride told Stormont's Health Committee they are provided for on a list of prioritisation provided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which decides the order of vaccination delivery.\nMr Swann was asked if his department was \"putting all its eggs in the vaccine basket\".\nHe said it was \"not the entirety of the answer\", adding: \"It will take time for the benefits of it to bed in.\n\"And while it is doing it, we still have to follow those restrictions that are in place.\n\"We may actually have to introduce more.\"\nOn Thursday afternoon the department tweeted that 121,711 vaccines have been administered in Northern Ireland.\nMrs Foster said that by end of this month, it is hoped all care home residents, health staff and those aged over 80 in Northern Ireland will have received their first vaccination.\nShe said that would be an \"incredible achievement\" and make Northern Ireland one of the top-performing countries in rolling out its vaccination programme. \nMeanwhile, the chairman of the Police Federation for NI (PFNI) has said officers need more powers to enforce Covid-19 regulations.\nAt present officers can only issue guidance and advice on the public health regulations.\nPFNI chairman Mark Lindsay said that puts officers in a \"difficult position\".\nThe federation represents thousands of rank and file PSNI officers.\n\"I think we are well past the stage where police officers are the people that should be giving advice around the guidance,\" Mr Lindsay told BBC Radio Foyle."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Welsh government,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of Covid patients in Wales' hospitals is now more than double the previous peak seen last April.\nWelsh NHS Chief Executive Andrew Goodall said 2,870 Covid patients were being treated.\nThe effect of lockdown restrictions will take some weeks to be felt, he told coronavirus briefing.\nThere are some signs that coronavirus levels are starting to stabilise, although an official warned rates remained high in parts of north Wales.\nDr Goodall told Wednesday's press conference that - at current levels - the NHS would have to make \"some very difficult decisions\" about the services it could provide.\nIt was already the most challenging winter of his career, he said, adding it would be \"a while yet\" before the number of admissions to hospital began to fall.\n\"The impact of the restrictions, including the lockdown measures, will take some weeks to be felt in the NHS,\" he said.\nA further 66 people are reported to have died in Wales with coronavirus, according to Public Health Wales, along with 1,533 new cases.\nThe number of Covid patients in hospital on 12 January was 2,879, 107 more than the week before. Numbers have been running at record levels\nIt had risen by 17% in the Betsi Cadwaladr heath board and reflects the pressures at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, which suspended routine surgery to cope.\nOf those in hospital on 12 January, 1,610 were confirmed Covid-19 patients, 195 were suspected of having Covid and 1,074 were recovering from the virus and are too ill to be discharged. \nThis number is by far the highest level we've seen since then - but because recovering patient figures were not reported until the end of May, so it is a little difficult to compare figures with April.\nChief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said there were some encouraging signs over the past few days \"that coronavirus is beginning to stabilise in Wales\".\nThere are 410 cases for every 100,000 individuals at the moment, down from about 650 per 100,000 in mid-December, he said.\nBut Dr Atherton struck a cautious tone, saying there were high rates in areas of Wrexham and Flintshire.\nThere are now 14 hospitals at level three or four - the two highest levels used by the NHS to measure pressure on services. Three hospitals are at level four.\nDr Goodall warned new variants of the coronavirus could lead to further increases in transmission in Wales in the coming weeks.\nPublic Health Wales said at least 30% of recent positive tests in south east Wales are of the new variant, with at least 70% of cases having the variant in north Wales.\nDr Goodall said his greatest concern was \"the impact on critical care\" with 150 people now in intensive care units with coronavirus.\n\"This is the highest level we have seen during the second wave. This is almost our entire non-pandemic critical care capacity,\" he said.\nThe average age of patients in critical care is 59, with almost twice as many men as women.\nMeanwhile, 186 patients are in field hospitals, with that number increasing, Dr Goodall said.\nHe said staff were \"exhausted\" and sickness levels were higher than normal for this time of year.\nAbout 9% were off sick, compared to the usual 5-6%.\nClose to half of that was due to Covid-19 - either because staff were ill or had to self-isolate. Dr Goodall said it had been a \"constant treadmill\" for staff.\nA senior Welsh doctor said there could be another four-to-five weeks of \"serious issues\" in hospitals.\nDr David Bailey, of the British Medical Association, said: \"It's good that the numbers have started to drop, but that's going to take three, four, five weeks to work its way through to the medical workload at the sharp end, in medical units, in emergency admissions and in critical care.\n\"People stay in critical care for a couple of weeks; you develop a serious illness with Covid maybe 10 days after you start, so all of these things move down the way in terms of when they come through in the health service.\"\nPaul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said: \"We need to roll out the vaccine as soon as possible because that's the way out of tackling the virus.  \n\"327,000 doses have been received (in Wales) but only 101,000 people have received the vaccine and we are falling behind other parts of the UK.\"\nThe Welsh Government has said there has been a significant acceleration in the roll out.\nMeanwhile, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething told a Senedd committee NHS bodies would not achieve the efficiency savings of previous years this year or next due to Covid-19.\nHe said it would be \"wholly unrealistic and unfair\" to expect 1% savings \"during the middle of the pandemic\"."

      "tags": "Home Office,Penally,Refugees and asylum seekers,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Asylum seekers housed in a military training camp have claimed the \"very bad\" conditions are making them feel increasingly desperate. \nThe Home Office decided to house up to 250 asylum seekers at the site in Penally, Pembrokeshire, from September. \nBut some housed at the camp claim the conditions are unsafe and putting them at risk of coronavirus.\nPlaid Cymru has called for an urgent inspection, but the Home Office said it was safe and \"Covid-compliant\".\nOn Thursday afternoon, the independent chief inspector for borders and immigration David Bolt said he hoped an inspection can begin \"within a few weeks\" and was awaiting further details he requested from the Home Office.\nProtests and counter-protests have taken place at the camp, with concerns conditions breach human rights.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has said the facility was \"unsuitable\" for vulnerable people who have \"fled terror and suffering\".\nNow, asylum seekers have spoken to the BBC about their experiences of living in the camp during the pandemic, with some claiming the site does not abide by Covid-19 rules.\nOne man, who wishes to remain anonymous, arrived at the camp on 1 October.\nHe said he had pain from \"old injuries\" obtained in Syria, but had to wait \"four days\" to see a doctor. He also has concerns about hygiene facilities at the camp.\n\"There is no observance of the Covid safety laws,\" he said, claiming \"six men\" share a small bedroom, dozens eat in the same room, and some staff preparing food do not wear face masks. \nVideo footage and photographs of the camp, seen by BBC Wales, show bathroom floors covered with water, every toilet in one bathroom blocked, beds in communal rooms less than 2m (6ft) apart and a bathroom where all the soap dispensers are empty.\nThe Home Office said medical need determined GP appointments, social distancing was required, and soap was replenished at the site.\nThe man said the camp's conditions had left him in a \"bad psychological state\" and others had attempted self-harm: \"Should I try to hurt myself to get out of here?\"\nHe said he and other residents were able to leave the camp as long as they are back by 22:00 GMT, but said he was reluctant to go out due to the \"humiliation, abuse and racism\" he has experienced. \nWhile some have welcomed the refugees, posting welcome notes outside the gates, the camp has been described as a target for \"hard-right extremist\" protesters. \nThe Home Office said that, where someone claims their mental health is suffering, it would consider if their needs can be met at the site.  \nAnother resident, from Eritrea, north-east Africa, said life in the camp was stressful, and people were being \"treated like prisoners\".\n\"For the Eritrean community in this camp, the most difficult thing is we escaped from our country from indefinite military service and illegal imprisonment,\" he said.\n\"So we feel like we are imprisoned in a military camp. It is all coming back to us.\"\nThe man said he had been told to be careful and to abide to Covid rules, but there was \"no protection\" as he was sleeping in a room with five others.\n\"Most of the bathrooms - they are broken,\" he said.\n\"They are filled with tissues, masks, everything you can find, they are blocked, they don't work.\" \nHe said he had not been offered a coronavirus test since arriving about three months ago.\nThe Home Office said residents had often entered the UK some time ago, and had been mainly placed in the camp after being in the south-east of England and around London.\nIt added that coronavirus tests were only necessary in line with Welsh Government guidance. \nIt added that Clearsprings Ready Homes, which manage the camp, took immediate steps to repair damage.\nBut Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster, Liz Saville Roberts, has called for an \"urgent\" and \"transparent\" inspection of the site.\nIn a letter to the UK's Independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, David Bolt, the MP said: \"We are now not only in the middle of winter, but cases of Covid-19 in Wales are rising at an alarming rate. \n\"I am extremely worried that the conditions at the old military barracks are wholly unsuitable to deal with the cold weather and to facilitate effective social distancing.\n\"This shows a clear disregard for the health and wellbeing of those being kept in the camp.\" \nShe told BBC Radio Wales: \"If we aspire to be a nation of sanctuary, surely we should be looking at how people, while they are with us, are integrated into our communities and given all the services that they need, rather than putting them in a convenient enclosed space in a tiny community which is ill equipped itself to deal with this... Let alone far right protests outside and all the pressure that's put on the local population.\n\"We need to make sure that this doesn't set a precedent into the future.\" \nMr Bolt told Ms Saville Roberts he had \"received assurances\" from the Home Office that the Penally camp had an independent Covid-19 audit on 4 November.\nIn a letter, he said he hoped an inspection could be held \"within a few weeks\".\nHe said he was keen to understand how the Home Office \"was assuring itself\" individuals who were particularly vulnerable, including torture victims, potential victims of modern slavery, and those with complex health and other needs, were being identified and action taken to safeguard them.\nHe said: \"While on site I would expect the only restrictions to be those relating to Covid-19 and that inspectors would be free to examine the premises and facilities, observe daily life and interview staff and service users, and I would look to the Home Office to ensure that whoever is responsible for managing the site understands that they must cooperate with the inspection team.\"\nIn December, the Welsh Labour Government deputy minister Jane Hutt called on the Home Secretary Priti Patel to close the camp, describing the conditions as \"unsafe\" and \"inhumane\".\nTom Nunn, a solicitor representing some of the residents at camp, said the Home Office had said the camp should only be used as short-term accommodation for single, asylum-seeking males with no known vulnerabilities. \nBut he said 20 clients had been transferred away from the camp due to being vulnerable, and feared a serious incident would happen if things did not change.\n\"The majority of them have been detained and/or tortured in their country of origin, many have been exploited on their journey to the UK and a large number have fairly severe mental health problems,\" he said.\n\"It should not be the case that the only effective way of being transferred out is through making submissions through lawyers, and we are concerned about a large number of individuals who for a myriad of reasons may be unable to obtain this representation.\" \nThe UK's Minister for Immigration Compliance, Chris Philp, said: \"We provide asylum seekers in Penally with safe, Covid-compliant and weather-proof accommodation along with free, nutritious meals, all paid for by the taxpayer.\n\"We take the welfare of those in our care extremely seriously and asylum seekers can contact the 24/7 helpline run by Migrant Help if they have any issues.\n\"We are fixing our asylum system to make it firm and fair. We will be bringing forward legislation which will stop abuse of the system while ensuring it is compassionate towards those who need our help, welcoming people through safe and legal routes.\""

That is something we are having to think about,\" he said.\n\"I can't say specifically about other regional hospitals but I know that they are under extreme pressure and it's just something we have to think of as a region.\n\"Can we supply oxygen adequately for the amounts of oxygen we are using in hospitals?\"\nThe number of Covid positive hospital in-patients has increased significantly since last week - up from 599 a week ago to 850 on Thursday.\nThe number of people in ICU has also risen from 44 to 58 in the past week.\nDr Magee said staff were concerned about having to cope with \"large volumes\" of patients requiring respiratory support.\nHe said the number of younger patients becoming increasingly sick with the virus was growing.\nOn Wednesday, the Mater Hospital moved six patients who had been on wards into ICU and also took patients from the Southern Health Trust.\n\"Recently I saw a 29-year-old patient, also three who were in their mid 30s that all required respiratory support on a ward,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"They are frightened they are wearing specialist masks CPAP masks that help them breathe. They are scared.\" \nThe relentless pressure of the past 10 months and the prospect of a further surge in admissions over the next fortnight is weighing heavily on the minds of medics.\n\"We are really worried about next week,\" said Dr Magee. \n\"It's very busy this week, we are coping well but we are particularly concerned about next week.\n\"Normally, if we had somebody who needed a lot of respiratory support we would involve a high dependency unit but all the respiratory wards are becoming like high dependency units. \n\"Volume of sicker, younger patients is much greater and it's not something that I would [have] ever seen before,\" he added.\nThe Southern Health and Social Care Trust said its hospitals had limited infrastructure to manage high numbers of patients requiring oxygen so a regional agreement was in place to share resources across Trusts to support Covid-positive patients. \n\"As a result some patients have been diverted to Belfast or SE Trust to help reduce pressure on the Southern Trust hospital system,\" a statement said. \n\"Craigavon and Daisy Hill hospitals remain very busy with high numbers of Covid-19 positive patients who are dependent on oxygen therapy. \n\"These protocols are in place as part of regional surge planning to ensure that we can safely manage the current high volume of Covid-19 patients needing hospital care. \n\"Patients who are currently being treated in Craigavon and Daisy Hill have secure supplies of oxygen.\""

We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT. \nMost people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months, a study led by Public Health England shows. But scientists say some people do catch Covid-19 a second time and can infect others, with officials stressing people should follow the stay-at-home rules whether or not they have had the virus.\nAs the UK reports 1,564 people dying within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the highest toll since the pandemic hit our shores - Fergal Keane revisits St Mary\u2019s and Charing Cross hospitals, in London, from where he sent a moving report last April.\nThe first six of 200 High Street pharmacies in England are to start vaccinating people against coronavirus later, as part of a plan to offer jabs to 15 million people across the UK in four priority groups by mid-February. However, pharmacists say many more chemist shops should be allowed to administer the injection.\nA man says the pandemic is threatening to cost him and his partner the new home they had saved for years to buy. Greg Saunders, 31, applied to the government's Help to Buy scheme, so he and boyfriend David Leith, 36, could afford the townhouse in Salford. But Covid-related delays mean it will not be built before the scheme in its current form is due to end. \"We can't buy the house without the scheme as it's unaffordable,\" says Greg. The government says it's monitoring the situation.\nWith many music venues struggling to survive since the pandemic forced them to close their doors, fans have been clubbing together to save their favourite haunts. And now folk-punk singer Frank Turner is once again picking up his guitar to help by livestreaming fundraising gigs. As he puts it: \"Drinking a beer and watching some live music is a magic, magic thing and I miss it terribly.\"\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nIf you're thinking about ordering a takeaway, you can find out what we know about how safe it is in our explainer.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),China,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A World Health Organization (WHO) team has arrived in the Chinese city of Wuhan to start its investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe long-awaited probe comes after months of negotiations between the WHO and Beijing.\nA group of 10 scientists is set to interview people from research institutes, hospitals and the seafood market linked to the initial outbreak.\nCovid-19 was first detected in Wuhan in central China in late 2019. \nThe team's arrival on Thursday morning coincides with a resurgence of new coronavirus cases in the north of the country, while life in Wuhan is relatively back to normal. \nThey will undergo two weeks of quarantine before beginning their research, which will rely upon samples and evidence provided by Chinese officials.\nTeam leader Peter Ben Embarek told AFP news agency just before the trip that it \"could be a very long journey before we get a full understanding of what happened\".\n\"I don't think we will have clear answers after this initial mission, but we will be on the way,\" he said.\nThe probe, which aims to investigate the animal origin of the pandemic, looks set to begin after some initial hiccups. \nAnalysis by BBC correspondent Robin Brant in Wuhan\nChina resisted this investigation because it doesn't want to look back. It sees the potential for more blame, from a group of foreigners. It has its official version of what happened already. \nThe government paper published months ago declared \"victory\" in the war against the virus. But it didn't have a verdict - not one it made public anyway - on where the new coronavirus came from nor how it passed to humans. There's been global pressure to answer that, to prevent repeat pandemics. \nThe WHO team will be heavily reliant on their Chinese hosts for access: to key places in Wuhan and beyond, and crucially to research material, human and animal samples and data gathered by China's authorities over the past year. The man leading the WHO team said he is open minded. No theories - and there is a range of theories - are off the table. All sides have talked about the importance of the science. But the investigators arrived here as a propaganda effort, lead by China's state media, is in full swing, to question whether the pandemic originated here in the first place. \nDespite a lack of any credible evidence it's reported for months now that it was in Spain, Italy or maybe the US before it was seen in China. A campaign intended to undermine the very reason the WHO is, finally, here in Wuhan.\nEarlier this month the WHO said its investigators were denied entry into China after one member of the team was turned back and another got stuck in transit. But Beijing said it was a misunderstanding and that arrangements for the investigation were still in discussion.\nChina has been saying for months that the although Wuhan is where the first cluster of cases was detected, it is not necessarily where the virus originated.\nProfessor Dale Fisher, chair of the global outbreak and response unit at the WHO, told the BBC that he hoped the world would consider this a scientific visit. \"It's not about politics or blame but getting to the bottom of a scientific question,\" he said. \nProf Fisher added that most scientists believed that the virus was a \"natural event\".\nThe visit comes as China reports its first fatality from Covid-19 in eight months. \nNews of the woman's death in northern Hebei province prompted anxious chatter online and the hashtag \"new virus death in Hebei\" trended briefly on social media platform Weibo.\nThe country has largely brought the virus under control through quick mass testing, stringent lockdowns and tight travel restrictions. \nBut new cases have been resurfacing in recent weeks, mainly in Hebei province surrounding Beijing and Heilongjiang province in the northeast."

      "tags": "Archaeology,Asia,Art,Indonesia",
      "text": "Archaeologists have discovered the world's oldest known animal cave painting in Indonesia - a wild pig - believed to be drawn 45,500 years ago.\nPainted using dark red ochre pigment, the life-sized picture of the Sulawesi warty pig appears to be part of a narrative scene.\nThe picture was found in the Leang Tedongnge cave in a remote valley on the island of Sulawesi.\nIt provides the earliest evidence of human settlement of the region.\n\"The people who made it were fully modern, they were just like us, they had all of the capacity and the tools to do any painting that they liked,\" said Maxime Aubert, the co-author of the report published in Science Advances journal.\nA dating specialist, Mr Aubert had identified a calcite deposit that had formed on top of the painting, and used Uranium-series isotope dating to determine that the deposit was 45,500 years old.\nThis makes the artwork at least that old. \"But it could be much older because the dating that we're using only dates the calcite on top of it,\" he added. \nThe report says that the painting, which measures 136cm by 54cm (53in by 21in), depicts a pig with horn-like facial warts characteristic of adult males of the species.\nThere are two hand prints above the back of the pig, which also appears to be facing two other pigs that are only partially preserved.\nCo-author Adam Brumm said: \"The pig appears to be observing a fight or social interaction between two other warty pigs.\"\nTo make the hand prints, the artists would have had to place their hands on a surface before spitting pigment over it, the researchers said. The team hopes to be able to extract DNA samples from the residual saliva as well. \nThe painting may be the world's oldest art depicting a figure, but it is not the oldest human-produced art. \nIn South Africa, a hashtag-like doodle created 73,000 years ago is believed to be the oldest known drawing. \nJonathan Amos, Science Correspondent\nSulawesi is in a key location. It's the largest island in a group that scientists often refer to as Wallacea after the great 19/20th Century naturalist Alfred Wallace. \nThe group sits on a dividing line, either side of which you find very different animals and plants. \nBut Wallacea's significance also is that it must have been a stepping stone for modern humans as they made their way to Australia. We know they were on that landmass some 65,000 years ago, so it's reasonable to assume they were also on Sulawesi at the same time or even earlier. \nThis raises the tantalising prospect of there being figurative art out there, either on Sulawesi or the immediate islands, that's older still than 45,500 years old. \nThe limestone hills about an hour's drive from Makassar have innumerable nooks and crannies, just like the cave at Leang Tedongnge. \nStand by for more discoveries."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS,Intensive care,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid-19 patients in England's busiest intensive care units in 2020 were 20% more likely to die, University College London research has found.\nThe increased risk was equivalent to gaining a decade in age. \nBy the end of 2020, one in three hospital trusts in England was running at higher than 85% capacity. \nEleven trusts were completely full on 30 December, and the total number of people in intensive care with Covid has continued to rise since then. \nThe link between full ICUs and higher death rates was already known, but this study is the first to measure its effect during the pandemic. \nTighter lockdown restrictions are needed to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, says study author Dr Bilal Mateen.\nResearchers looked at more than 4,000 patients who were admitted to intensive care units in 114 hospital trusts in England between April and June last year. \nThey found the risk of dying was almost a fifth higher in ICUs where more than 85% of beds were occupied, than in those running at between 45% and 85% capacity.\nThat meant a 60-year-old being treated in one of these units had the same risk of dying as a 70-year-old on a quieter ward. \nThe Royal College of Emergency Medicine sets 85% as the maximum safe level of bed occupancy. \nHowever, the team found there was no tipping point after which deaths rose - instead, survival rates fell consistently as bed-occupancy increased.\nThis suggests \"a lot of harm is occurring before you get to 85%\".\nPatients admitted to ICUs that were less than 45% full were 25% less likely to die than average.\nUsually if a very sick patient's heart stops, everyone on the ward will rush to help them, Dr Mateen explained.\nBut when there are too many patients, staff's time is inevitably split, so \"it makes sense that the quality of patient care would be sacrificed\", he said. \nWhile extra beds and equipment can, and have, been provided through the Nightingale hospitals and the private sector, finding enough qualified staff has been an issue.\n\"You can't just create an ICU nurse who knows how to operate a mechanical ventilator overnight,\" Dr Mateen told the BBC.\nThese are highly-skilled roles that take years of training and sometimes decades of experience, he added. \nInstead, a \"robust vaccination programme\" and tighter lockdown restrictions are needed to bring down cases and hospitalisations, he believes.\nCo-author Prof Christina Pagel at UCL added: \"This paper highlights for the first time that putting such strain on ICUs during pandemic peaks does, sadly, mean that that chances of someone dying in intensive care are higher. \n\"Our work underlines the urgency of both vaccinating vulnerable groups as soon as possible and reducing Covid transmission in the community to relieve pressure on intensive care.\"\nIt's difficult to say for sure that fuller ICUs are actually causing more deaths - it's possible that as they get fuller, only the sickest patients are admitted.\nBut Dr Mateen says there was no evidence of rationing - of sick patients being turned away.\nEven pre-Covid, data suggests larger ICUs had lower death rates - with a 25% increase in bed numbers linked to a corresponding 25% fall in mortality. \nAnd the findings are supported by a wealth of evidence from before the pandemic and from around the world.

I'm done with this'... and it's scary, it fills you full of fear when you have got 13 ambulances outside, queuing around the carpark. Where do you go from that?\"\nShe said it was the team that kept her going: \"I started looking around to all the staff working tirelessly and just trying to remember what we're here for and why I became a nurse. \n\"I know it sounds soppy but it's literally the humanitarian effort that has gone into [fighting] this pandemic that has kept people going.\n\"It's the sheer determination and guts of the staff working in these times that is so powerful, that keeps the shift going.\"\nDr Farrow, emergency medicine consultant, said staffing and bed numbers were of particular concern.\n\"In the emergency department the challenge we have is with regards to flow, so that is our daily challenge,\" she explained. \n\"And we say it's like playing a game of Tetris trying to work out which patient you can put where.\"\nShe said the second wave of the virus had also seen more staff off sick with Covid and isolating - with some becoming very ill. \n\"We've had staff in as patients and one of my colleagues - I saw them when they were critically ill and ended up going to intensive care,\" continued Dr Farrow. \n\"So it's very emotional time for everyone as well you know, looking after the sick patients and looking after your colleagues.\n\"There's a level of anxiety still around -  will you be the next person to get this disease?\"\nShe said although fewer people were attending A&E, they were seeing more people arriving by ambulance and presenting with more complex needs.\n\"The group of patients we are seeing this time I think is different, we're definitely having more younger people with Covid that are becoming sick, the volume is very high in the community.\n\"I think people are afraid of come into the hospital as well, so there are still quite a lot of patients who leave it maybe a bit too late before they're seeking hospital attention.\"\nHelen Whatmore, 45, from Beddau, has been hospital since early December after developing Covid symptoms. \nSpeaking from her intensive care bed, she said she had been unwell in February so assumed she had already caught the virus.\n\"I honestly didn't believe it was as bad until I caught [Covid] this time,\" she said. \n\"This time it's absolutely knocked the socks off me. It's nearly killed me. \n\"A friend of mine passed away as I came into hospital and I came down very rapidly with Covid, kidney problems and pneumonia.\"\nShe said she was grateful for the care she had received: \"The nurses are coming in [working] all shifts, they're fighting for your loved ones, from the time they enter right until the time they leave, then they're changing over and doing the same again.\n\"People are passing away\u2026 how much more have they got to do?

      "text": "People needing to travel by rail during lockdown are being urged to double-check train times, as services are being reduced.\nServices in England are being cut from 87% of normal levels to 72%, industry body the Rail Delivery Group said.\nIt said the number of trains would reflect the drop in passengers, and provide better value for money for taxpayers who are subsidising services.\nPeak services will be prioritised to help key workers, it added.\nWhile some timetables have already changed, others will be altered in the next few weeks.\nSince the early days of the pandemic, the government has spent billions of pounds covering the fall in ticket revenues for rail companies, owing to low passenger numbers.\nCutting some services will save public money, the government said.\nRail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: \"It is critical that our railways continue to deliver reliable services for key workers and people who cannot reasonably work from home, and that they respond quickly to changes in demand.\"\nRail usage has slumped, with passenger journeys falling more than 90% to 35 million journeys for the three-month period to June, according to the Office of Rail and Road. \nThe figures recovered a little to 134 million for the three months to September - the latest published.\nWith fewer passengers, the government argues, it makes sense to run fewer services. \nNot least because right now, the government are footing much of the bill; since the start of the pandemic, the government has spent more than \u00a34bn covering the fall in ticket revenues because of low passenger numbers. \nThe cuts aren't as deep as they were in March - then services were running around 55% of pre-pandemic levels - which is partly because the train companies want to make sure it doesn't take as long getting the services back up again when they are needed. \nLonger term, rail companies are nervous about how quickly passengers, particularly commuters, will return, but for now the message is still firmly \"stay at home\". \n\"Train timetables must still meet the needs of those who have to travel, said Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith. \n\"Many key workers rely on the first and last services of the day so it's important that these are maintained. Providing enough capacity for those who are travelling to properly social distance remains vital.\" \nAlthough timetables were restored when restrictions were eased over the summer, rail franchising has since been scrapped and replaced with a model which means the taxpayer is currently liable for the losses on the railways.\nIn September, the bill had run to more than \u00a33.5bn - and the Department for Transport has said \"significant\" support is still needed."

      "tags": "Medicine,Diet & nutrition,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There are mounting questions about whether vitamin D can help fight coronavirus. \nThe Scientific Advisory Commission on Nutrition and the health watchdog the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have done a rapid review of the evidence. \nWith more people staying indoors during the pandemic, some may have been deprived of vitamin D. \nNormally, many of us get it by spending time outside. Our skin makes it when exposed to the sun.\nThe NHS says people should consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day if they are spending a lot of time indoors. \nScottish and Welsh governments and Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency issued similar advice during lockdown.\nBefore the pandemic, people in the UK were already advised to consider taking supplements from October to March.\nPublic Health England recommends vitamin D throughout the year if:\nPeople with dark skin may also not be getting enough, even if they spend time outdoors, and should consider an all-year-round supplement. \nThere is evidence that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with coronavirus.\nVitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. A lack of it can lead to a bone deformity illness called rickets in children, and a similar bone weakness condition called osteomalacia in adults.\nThere are also suggestions that vitamin D boosts the immune system and helps fight off infections. \nSome studies suggest adequate vitamin D levels help when we have common colds and flu, for example. But evidence from research is inconsistent. \nThe Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) says studies on using vitamin D for treating or preventing chest infections showed insufficient evidence to recommend it for this.  \nA review of research by NICE suggests there is no evidence to support taking vitamin D supplements to specifically prevent or treat coronavirus.\nBut experts think that it may have some broader health benefits during the pandemic to keep people as nutritionally fit as possible.\nSome researchers have suggested that vitamin D deficiency might be linked with poorer outcomes if someone catches coronavirus. But other underlying risk factors, such as heart disease, are common in these patients too, making it hard to draw conclusions.\nProf Jon Rhodes, Emeritus Professor of Medicine at the University of Liverpool, says vitamin D has anti-inflammatory effects, and some research suggests it may dampen down the body's immune response to viruses. \nThis could be relevant in very ill coronavirus patients, where severe lung damage can result from an inflammatory state in response to the virus, he says, although much more research is needed.\nNo. Although vitamin D supplements are very safe, taking more than the recommended amount every day can be dangerous in the long run. \nIf you choose to take vitamin D supplements:\nHigher doses may sometimes be recommended by a doctor for patients with proven vitamin D deficiency.\nSome people with certain medical conditions, such as kidney problems, cannot safely take vitamin D.\nVitamin D supplements are widely available from supermarkets and chemists. They may be just vitamin D or part of a multivitamin tablet.\nThe ingredient listed on the label of most Vitamin D supplements is D3, the one made by your skin. Vitamin D2 is produced by plants.\nVitamin drops are available for babies. \nAlthough eating a well-balanced diet can help ensure the normal functioning of the immune system, no individual nutrient, food or supplement is going to \"boost\" it beyond normal levels.\nIt's difficult to get enough vitamin D from food alone. \nEating a well-balanced diet is important for good health and is advisable even outside a pandemic.\nIt can include vitamin D-rich foods like oily fish and eggs. Some breakfast cereals, margarines and yoghurts are fortified with vitamin D.\nAlthough you cannot overdose on vitamin D through exposure to sunlight, strong sun burns skin so you need to balance making vitamin D with being safe in the sun. \nCover up or protect your skin with sunscreen to prevent burning and damage.\nThe advice is:\nThe dose for adults (10 micrograms a day) applies to pregnant and breastfeeding women.  A higher dose may be recommended for pregnant women with dark skin or with high-risk pregnancies. "

      "text": "Hundreds of students are preparing to take part in rent strikes after paying for \"hardly used\" rooms during the pandemic.\nSome Welsh universities have already offered refunds to students who have been living away due to Covid-19.\nBut students in Cardiff, Swansea and Bangor claim they are being treated unfairly and are threatening to withhold rent.\nUniversities said they were trying to work out the implications of Covid-19.\nAnd a solicitor warned students they could face legal action for not paying rent, with long-term implications possible if they lose.\nFace-to-face teaching was suspended and many students moved back home before Christmas as coronavirus cases continued to rise.\nStaggered returns are being introduced in order to \"help stop the spread of the virus in student accommodation\", according to the Welsh Government.\nStudents attending universities across Wales had demanded rent rebates.\nThey said they had not been living in the rooms or using facilities, despite paying for them, because they were abiding by Welsh Government guidelines.\nCardiff Metropolitan University, Aberystwyth University, Swansea University, Bangor University and Cardiff University have now offered eligible students rebates or discounts for time not spent living on campus.\nUniversity of South Wales said it will be offering a \"rent holiday\" on university-owned accommodation in Treforest, Rhondda Cynon Taf, for the period 4 January to 12 February.\nUniversity of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD) said on Thursday it is now offering refunds to students who have not returned to university-owned accommodation while teaching is solely online.\nBut students say the offers are inadequate for students already paying \u00a39,000-a-year tuition fees at a time when most of the teaching was online, and they had been unable to use facilities in halls.\nWhile the students cannot hold their protests in person due to coronavirus laws, hundreds are now planning to cancel their direct debits, withholding thousands of pounds of rent from universities.\nMichelle Francis, who formed the Bangor Rent Strike campaign, said the university's offer of a 10% discount to eligible students living in university-owned accommodation did not go far enough.\nShe said students who had chosen to go home for Christmas were not eligible, despite being unable to use facilities paid for during the first term.\n\"[We were] advised to have left university from the beginning of December and to come back at 8 February,\" she said.\n\"That's 25% of our halls that we've been paying and we're not there... we should be allowed to have that back.\"\nSo far over 300 students have joined the campaign to cancel their direct debits paid to Welsh universities and campaigners said the numbers were growing daily.\nOn Wednesday, Cardiff University joined other Welsh universities in offering a rent rebate to students living in university-owned accommodation during the pandemic.\nBut the full rebate, for the time students are unable to return to live in their accommodation, will not be applied until April.\nSwansea University has also confirmed a rent reduction to students in university halls who have been asked to remain at home. \nOisin Mulholland of Swansea Rent Strike said the group wanted the university to commit to fairly \"assessing the situation\", including for the coming term, and students who had already moved in should be given rebates as well.\n\"There was a window in January, where the Welsh Government said return, but the English government said don't return, and the university said nothing,\" he said.\n\"Many students came back and are now trapped in Swansea and can't go back because of lockdown\"\nIbrahim Khan, of the Cardiff Rent Strike campaign, said the rebate was \"too late\" for students struggling financially now.\n\"The university should be giving us the rebate this January as opposed to the third instalment in April,\" he said.\nLawyers have warned that students would in breach of contract if they cancel the direct debit for their rent.\nSi\u00f4n F\u00f4n, a solicitor at Darwin Gray, encouraged students to discuss the issue with their families and student unions before taking action.\n\"I think a case could be brought forward pretty easily against somebody not paying rent,\" he said.\nBut he said students may have a case against the university due to not being able to access advertised facilities, but if the university took legal action it could have long-term consequences for individuals.\n\"If the students lose, and even after losing don't pay the rent, that would come up on credit scores, or with the bank, if they're trying to get a mortgage or a credit card it would come up on their record,\" he warned.\nA spokesperson for Cardiff University said technical reasons meant they had to wait until the April instalment of accommodation fees to provide the rebate.\nSwansea University said some students had already returned when the stay at home guidance was issued, and it was working through the \"implications of this\".\n\"To help with this the university will not generate invoices for any students with university accommodation until May when we have been able to look at these cases,\" a spokesman said.\nBangor University said it did not wish to add anything further following its rebate announcement. \nThe Welsh Government said it had provided an extra \u00a340m to help universities, including \u00a310m for towards student hardship and support.\n\"It would seem fair that students should be eligible for a rebate for the period when a course is online only and we welcome moves by universities to address this,\" a spokesman said.\n\"We are actively considering how we can support our students and universities even further.\""

      "text": "Tesco says it has seen some disruption to food supplies in Northern Ireland since trading arrangements with the EU changed on 1 January. \n\"We see this as a challenge at the moment, but not a crisis,\" boss Ken Murphy said.\nBut he said the retailer was working closely with government on both sides of the Irish Sea to \"smooth the flow\". \nSince 31 December, Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that has stayed in the EU's single market for goods.\nMr Murphy said certain foodstuffs had faced supply chain disruption going into both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \n\"Ready meals have been the most affected as they have an eight-day shelf life so any wait is more likely to have an impact,\" he said.\n\"Some processed meat and some citrus fruit has also been impacted, but it is important to stress that our availability in the Republic and Northern Ireland is strong and is very strong in the mainland UK.\nLast week, all the major grocers wrote to Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove asking him to take urgent action. \nBut Tesco said its \"comprehensive preparations and... strong relationships with suppliers\" had allowed it to maintain strong levels of availability during the Brexit transition period.\nMr Murphy said he was confident Tesco would have the right measures in place to supply Northern Ireland after end of a three month grace period on certain rules and regulations with the EU on 31 March.\nHe also said there had also been \"teething problems\" with supply flows from continental Europe to Great Britain.\n\"Inevitably there are bedding-in issues, teething issues, that you would expect with any new process that's been set up at relatively short notice,\" he said.\n\"We're working our way through those and we would hope over the coming weeks and months that we will end up with a much smoother flow of product.\"\nUnder new trading arrangements, food products entering Northern Ireland from Britain need to be professionally certified and are subject to new checks and controls at ports.\nA three month \"grace period\" means that supermarkets currently don't need to comply with all the EU's usual certification requirements until 1 April - but there has still been disruption. \nM&S has temporarily reduced its range of food products and Sainsbury's has been sourcing Spar-branded products from an NI wholesaler.\nThis week the bosses of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Iceland, Co-Op and Marks & Spencer warned that trade into Northern Ireland would become \"unworkable\" if further new certification requirements were introduced in April .\nThe government said a new dedicated team has already been set up and will be working with supermarkets, the food industry and the Northern Ireland Executive to develop ways to streamline the movement of goods.\nTesco's comments came as the supermarket giant reported record sales for the Christmas period after customers looked to \"treat themselves\" amid tough Covid restrictions across most of the UK.\nUK like-for-like sales were up 8.1% in the six weeks to 9 January, as the supermarket saw a surge in demand for goods in its Tesco Finest range. \nBig grocers have benefited at a time when most non-essential shops and restaurants are closed, prompting consumers to spend more on their weekly shop. But they have faced criticism too. \nLast month, Tesco said it would repay \u00a3585m of business rates relief after it was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders during the crisis. Most big grocers followed suit. \nTesco was later criticised for keeping its shops open on Boxing Day despite union calls to give staff the day off.\nIn its results the grocer said it had given all frontline staff a 10% bonus over Christmas. It also said it had shielded vulnerable staff and taken on nearly 35,000 additional temporary staff for the season."

      "tags": "Medical research,Dexamethasone,Coronavirus vaccines,Flu,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "Vaccines have transformed the pandemic, but there is still a huge need for drugs which can treat Covid.\nImmunity from vaccines can wane, and access is still a major problem around the world. Also, new variants emphasise the possible need for a back-up.  \nThere are now many drugs that target the virus or our body in different ways:\nThese are all needed at different stages of the infection. They range from dirt cheap to spectacularly expensive, and some are more resilient to new variants than others.\nWhen you catch Covid, your body releases a flood of chemicals to warn that you're under attack. \nThis chemical alarm is called inflammation, and is vital for rallying your immune system to boot out Covid. \nBut if you don't get rid of the virus quickly, then inflammation can spiral out of control and eventually damage vital organs such as your lungs. It's this excessive inflammation that kills.\nAn anti-inflammatory steroid that already existed before Covid - dexamethasone - was the first drug proved to save the lives of people with Covid. \nIt's given to seriously ill patients with breathing troubles - it cuts the risk of death by a fifth for patients on oxygen, and by a third for those on ventilators. \nIt is also so cheap that it has become the go-to drug around the world - with everywhere from Brazil to China using it.\nOther anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to work, including the steroid hydrocortisone.\nThere are more advanced and targeted anti-inflammatory drugs such as tocilizumab and sarilumab. Tocilizumab has been widely used in hospitals in China, India and Australia.\nThese are also effective, but up to 100 times as expensive as dexamethasone. This has restricted their use - although they are still cheaper than an intensive care bed. \nAnti-inflammatories work best later on in the disease, but an asthma drug called budesonide has been shown to help vulnerable people with early Covid symptoms recover more quickly at home.\nAn anti-viral directly targets the ability of the coronavirus to make copies of itself inside our bodies.\nSuch a drug keeps levels of the virus in the body low, so there is less of it for your immune system to deal with.\nBoth Paxlovid and molnupiravir are best taken soon after symptoms appear.\nPfizer expects to make 80 million courses of Paxlovid by the end of 2022 and has said it will allow generic makers in 95 low-income nations to produce and distribute it at cost price.\nMerck is allowing Indian generic drug firms to turn out molnupiravir cheaply for 100 low and middle-income countries. \nAnother anti-viral, remdesivir, is given through a drip and cuts recovery time from Covid. \nThe third approach is to give people an infusion of antibodies that can attack the virus.\nThese stick to the surface of the coronavirus and mark it for destruction by the body's immune system. \nThe body makes its own antibodies when it is attacked by coronavirus. The most effective of these have been studied in the lab, grown and given to patients. This is known as monoclonal antibody therapy.\nVulnerable NHS patients to be offered new drug\nThese therapies are often reserved for seriously ill patients who are struggling to make their own antibodies.\nAgain, the earlier the drugs are given the better the chances of success.\nAnti-inflammatories should work against all variants because they target our own bodies, rather than the virus itself.\nThere is more concern about whether monoclonal antibodies would work with new variants, as they rely on being a close match for the virus. If a new variant is heavily mutated then it theoretically makes the drugs weaker. \nHowever, GSK says it has tested its therapy against the Omicron variant and it remains effective in laboratory studies.\nAnti-virals are expected to hold up against the variants seen so far. None of the mutations seen in Omicron should affect the ability of the drugs to work. However, if the drugs are used widely then there is the potential for drug resistance to emerge.\nA number of drugs have been heralded as potential therapies for Covid - sometimes with no sign that they actually make any difference. \nIvermectin has been controversially promoted for use in many parts of the world, despite no evidence that it works.\nTaking antibodies from survivors' blood - known as convalescent plasma therapy - has been touted, but has not reduced deaths.\nThere was also speculation that drugs used to treat malaria and HIV might work, but this has come to nothing.\nFollow James on Twitter"

For a president who likes to boast about the historic successes of his presidency, it is an ignominious ending to his time in office.\nThe single article of impeachment accuses the president of inciting the riot that broke out at the US Capitol after he spoke to a crowd of thousands at a pro-Trump rally near the White House on Wednesday morning. It will now be forwarded to the US Senate, where the 100-member body will once again sit as a jury presided over by the chief justice of the US Supreme Court.\nThe outcome of that trial, which will not begin until after Joe Biden's inauguration, is very much in doubt. At this point, however, the political implications for the House's action can begin to be assessed. \nJust over a year ago, the House of Representatives impeached Trump the first time without a single Republican vote. This time around, 10 members of his own party broke ranks to support the resolution - and more condemned his words and actions on the day of the capitol riot.\nLiz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in the chamber and the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, was the most notable defection.\n\"There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,\" she wrote in a statement that was frequently quoted by Democrats during the impeachment debate.\nAlready there is word that some Republicans in the Senate are open to voting to convict the president of the charges. The New York Times reported on Tuesday night that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was \"pleased\" that Trump was on the verge of being impeached and hoped that the process would allow the party to make a clean break with a president. \nHe has since said he will reserve judgement until the trial is concluded - but such reports from the senator's usually tight-lipped office do not materialise out of thin air. Battle lines within the party, even tentative ones, are being drawn.\nThe split in the House on Wednesday sets up a choice for Republicans in the days ahead. On one hand is continued allegiance to the president's brand of politics - one that created a new coalition of voters that delivered the White House and Congress in 2016, but lost both in 2020.\nOn the other is an uncertain future - but one free from the president's unique brand of heat and rhetoric.\nIn the hours after last week's riot, Democrats grappled with how best to respond to - and punish - the president for instigating an attack that, in their view, not only threatened US democracy but also put their lives at risk.\nIn the end, they decided making Trump a twice-impeached president, despite coming in the final week of his presidency, was their most effective move.\nDemocrats on Wednesday were not just impeaching Donald J Trump, however. They were indicting Trumpism as a whole. The impeachment article specifically referenced the months that Trump spent attacking and undermining November's general election. And during debate in the House of Representatives, they attacked Trump's behaviour over the course of his presidency and went after Republicans in Congress who echoed the president's rhetoric.\nThere may be Republicans who want to move on from Trump and Trumpism, but it's clear at least some Democrats in Congress will try to tie the president - and last week's riot - around the neck of the entire Republican Party. \nImagine, for a moment, an alternate course of history over the past few months. \nDonald Trump, instead of vociferously challenging his election defeat, quietly conceded in November. The Republicans would probably have won at least one of the run-off elections in Georgia and would still control the Senate. Trump, instead of facing a very real threat from Republicans eager to bury him, would be a kingmaker for the party. \nAnother presidential run in 2024 would be a very real possibility.\nInstead, Trump is on the ropes. He's been silenced from social media, including his beloved Twitter account. Even if he is not prohibited from running for office by a Senate conviction, his power and influence within the Republican Party has been dented.\nPublic opinion polling, as well as his vocal defenders in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, suggest the president still has a significant well of support within his party. But the past weeks will embolden his adversaries, who sense an opportunity to deliver a lasting knockout to the president while he's down.\nHe's at greater risk now than ever before.\nFor five years, Trump has been proving critics and prognosticators who penned his political epitaph wrong. He's survived scandals and controversies that would take down most other politicians.\nThis time, at long last, could be different.\nUpon taking the oath of office, President-elect Biden will have to contend with a pandemic that is claiming the lives of more than 4,000 Americans a day and an economy that is once again worsening. Now he'll have to do so while a Senate grapples with the impeachment trial of his predecessor.\nRepublicans warned on Wednesday that impeachment would further inflame and divide Americans at a time when the nation needs to heal. It would, they say, make Biden's promise to unify the nation all the harder.\nThat may end up being the case, although Democrats have been quick to counter that talk of healing rings hollow after Republicans waged a lengthy campaign to undermine the legitimacy of Biden's election.\nThe impeachment trial, however, presents some very real practical challenges for Biden in the early days of his presidency. A Senate preoccupied with the process of passing judgement on Trump is one that will be unable to focus on enacting Biden's ambitious first-100-day agenda. It is also one that may not be able to quickly confirm Biden's administration appointees, limiting his ability to successfully manage the sprawling apparatus of the federal government.\nBiden has asked whether the Senate could conduct a part-time trial of Trump, working on confirmations and legislation when it is not sitting as a jury for the ex-president. \nThere's no guarantees that Republicans or the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian will go along with that plan, however.\nThe first 100 days are a pivotal time for any new president - a moment when his or her political influence is at its highest. At least some of Biden's power will be drained away by this particular fight."

      "text": "Passengers arriving into NI from outside the UK and Republic of Ireland will soon have to produce a negative Covid-19 test before departure.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster confirmed the executive had agreed the plan on Thursday.\nPeople arriving from countries not on the government's travel corridors list will also still have to self-isolate for 10 days.\nThe move has already been agreed in the Republic of Ireland.\nPassengers arriving there will be subject to the new rules from Saturday, with the measure taking effect in England and Scotland from Monday.\nNegative tests 72 hours prior to arrival are already a requirement in the Republic of Ireland for passengers travelling from Great Britain and South Africa.\nSpeaking at Stormont's press conference on Thursday, the first minister said Northern Ireland's R-number had also fallen to between 0.7 and 0.9 for new cases of the virus.\nThe reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the drop showed the \"very real\" effect of lockdown restrictions imposed on 26 December, but she warned there was still \"no room for complacency\".\nShe said she still believed there needed to be an \"two-island approach\" to travel restrictions, including discussions with the British and Irish governments as a \"matter of urgency\".\nMrs Foster said Stormont ministers had also expressed frustration at the executive meeting over a lack of data-sharing from authorities in the Republic of Ireland, and called for it to be escalated.\nPSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said 40 penalty notices a day are being handed out to those who breach the Covid-19 regulations.\nHe told the press briefing that if people continued flouting rules, they could expect \"firm and swift enforcement\".\n\"We won't turn a blind eye when people break the rules.\"\nOn Thursday, 16 more deaths related to Covid-19 were reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 1,533. \nThere have been 973 new cases diagnosed in the past 24 hours, while 58 Covid-19 patients are being treated in ICUs across Northern Ireland, of which 44 are on ventilators. \nMrs Foster said she found it \"incredible and frankly unbelievable\" that some people were still holding house parties and gatherings, despite the pandemic rates and the lockdown. \nOn Wednesday, health officials warned that levels of the new, more transmissible variant of the virus are rising.\nMr Swann said that meant more \"difficult decisions\" on lockdown restrictions could be required.\nNorthern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19.\nThe executive is due to review the current restrictions on 21 January.\nThe first and deputy first ministers said they would take evidence from health officials before deciding whether an extension of the lockdown would be required.\nMinisters have also expressed concerns about some larger retailers \"gaming\" the regulations and keeping open non-essential parts of their businesses.\nA meeting between the first and deputy first ministers and representatives of the retail sector is due to happen on Friday afternoon.\nElsewhere, the Chief Medical Officer has confirmed that unpaid carers looking after Clinically Extremely Vulnerable individuals should receive the first dose of their vaccine when phase two of the vaccination programme begins next month.\nDr Michael McBride told Stormont's Health Committee they are provided for on a list of prioritisation provided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which decides the order of vaccination delivery.\nMr Swann was asked if his department was \"putting all its eggs in the vaccine basket\".\nHe said it was \"not the entirety of the answer\", adding: \"It will take time for the benefits of it to bed in.\n\"And while it is doing it, we still have to follow those restrictions that are in place.\n\"We may actually have to introduce more.\"\nOn Thursday afternoon the department tweeted that 121,711 vaccines have been administered in Northern Ireland.\nMrs Foster said that by end of this month, it is hoped all care home residents, health staff and those aged over 80 in Northern Ireland will have received their first vaccination.\nShe said that would be an \"incredible achievement\" and make Northern Ireland one of the top-performing countries in rolling out its vaccination programme. \nMeanwhile, the chairman of the Police Federation for NI (PFNI) has said officers need more powers to enforce Covid-19 regulations.\nAt present officers can only issue guidance and advice on the public health regulations.\nPFNI chairman Mark Lindsay said that puts officers in a \"difficult position\".\nThe federation represents thousands of rank and file PSNI officers.\n\"I think we are well past the stage where police officers are the people that should be giving advice around the guidance,\" Mr Lindsay told BBC Radio Foyle."

They divide us\u2026.And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous.\" \nHe also addressed criticism that just a handful of tech bosses can make decisions on who does and doesn't have a voice on the internet - and on accusations of censorship.\n\"A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same,\" said Mr Dorsey. \nThe decision to remove users, posts and tweets has been criticised by some for violating First Amendment - free speech - rights. \nHowever, big tech firms generally argue that as they are private companies, and not state actors, this law does not apply when they moderate their platforms. \nFacebook and YouTube have taken steps to silence the president, while Amazon shut down Parler, an app widely used by his supporters.\nNow Snapchat has also announced that Mr Trump will be permanently banned from its platform too.\nIt had already announced an indefinite suspension, but has now decided that \"in the interest of public safety and based on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence\" to permanently terminate his account.\nOn Monday, the German chancellor's spokesperson said she found the social media ban \"problematic\". And the Mexican president said: \"I don't like anybody being censored.\"\nIncoming US President-elect Joe Biden has said he wants companies like Facebook and Twitter to do more to take down hate speech and fake news. \nHe has previously said he wants to repeal Section 230, a law protecting social media companies from being sued for the things people post. \nIt's not clear how Mr Biden intends to regulate Big Tech, though it's likely to be a legislative focus of his."

We'll have another update for you on Friday morning.\nTravel from South America and Portugal to the UK is being banned, other than for British or Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights. The new ruling is being brought in because of concerns about the new Brazilian coronavirus variant and comes into force from 04:00 GMT on Friday. The ban applies to people who have travelled from, or through, these countries in the 10 days before their departure for the UK: Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela. Find out more about the new variants here. \nDoctors have warned that the recent surge in Covid hospital cases has left key hospital services in England in crisis. Accident and Emergency departments are facing rising delays in admitting extremely sick patients on to wards, NHS data shows. The total number of people facing year-long waits for routine treatments is more than 100 times higher than it was before the pandemic - and cancer specialists are warning of a \"terrifying\" disruption to their services that would cost lives. \nThe government has told schools not to provide free meals to eligible pupils' families over half term, with food to be provided by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme instead. The Department for Education said vulnerable families would continue to receive meals outside of term time through the welfare support they have made available. But councils say the government should be responsible for providing food vouchers during the February half-term, like it did over summer.  \nA top scientist has said the coronavirus growth rate in the UK is slowing, with the number of infections starting to level off in some areas. Prof Neil Ferguson told the BBC that in some NHS regions there is a \"sign of plateauing\" in cases and hospital admissions. But he warned the overall death toll - currently standing at over 80,000 - would exceed 100,000. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the national lockdown measures in place across the UK are \"starting to show signs of some effect\" but warned that it was still early days.  \nMany people feel they've put on weight during the pandemic, due to staying indoors more and turning to comfort food. Samantha Hicks, from Portishead, North Somerset, thought she was one of them - but what she believed was a few extra pounds of weight was actually a baby. She gave birth to her daughter Julia just 10 days after discovering she was pregnant. Her pregnancy was even missed when she was taken to hospital in November with Covid-19. She said: \"My tummy was a bit swollen but again, because I felt sick and I wasn't great, it never occurred to me I was pregnant.\"\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe UK travel rules have been updated again.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Social distancing,Welsh government,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The decision to keep schools closed has hit both pupils and parents across Wales. \nMost children will now be out of the classroom and learning from home until at least February half-term, unless there is a big drop in Covid cases. \nThe Welsh Government's decisions on coronavirus are assisted by its Technical Advisory Cell (TAC), a group of experts who assess all the latest scientific advice on the virus.\nSo what exactly is the official scientific advice when it comes to schools? \nDr Heather Payne, a consultant paediatrician and a member of TAC, describes her role as helping to get together the \"best advice\" to inform ministers making decisions. Here she answers some questions.\n\"I think the most important thing is that the overall rates of coronavirus infection were going up. We know now that was due to this new variant,\" explained Dr Payne.\n\"It is coronavirus but it's much more infectious than the original one that we were dealing with last year. That in itself led to changing our advice around the operation of schools.\"\n\"Now it might be tempting to think that children are spreading it in schools,\" she said.\n\"But when we break down the data we find that actually schools are safe, secure environments for children.\"\nHowever, Dr Payne acknowledged that keeping schools open had meant there were more opportunities for \"social mixing,\" which may help the virus spread, such as walking to and from school, or attending after-school activities. \n\"Unfortunately, the advice had to change to moderating the amount of time that people spent in school because it was clear that it was associated with greater rates of infection,\" she said.\nDr Payne said, despite efforts, scientists were still unable to say for certain where in school environments coronavirus might be passed on.\n\"I think the problem is that we really don't know, we've asked this question to some of the best scientists in the country,\" she said.\n\"Even the head of the Office of National Statistics agrees that we just don't have the evidence of where, during the school day, from leaving the house in the morning to getting back in the evening, transmission really takes place.\"\nHowever, Dr Payne said some areas were riskier than others.\n\"We know that it's more likely when people are moving around and coming within close contact with each other so that they can have a face-to-face conversation,\" she explained. \n\"Communal areas, so in the corridors, or just being in large groups in the school. \n\"We have said that it should be strongly advised that people wear face coverings during that period [between lessons] so that reduces the risk in what are likely to be higher risk areas.\"\nDr Payne said teachers had also been urged to open classroom windows towards the end of lessons \"so that fresh air can come in and wherever possible.\"\n\"We are looking at all possibilities,\" explained Dr Payne.\n\"We have to go back and look at everything.\"\nShe said scientists would consider whether schools needed any other measures to be brought in before re-opening, and were continuing to look at issues including Covid testing and face coverings. \nSchools currently have the choice on whether or not they want to take up testing for pupils when they return. Those that opt in to the roll-out will be given online training for staff.\nIn secondary schools, pupils and staff are currently advised to wear face coverings in all areas outside the classroom.\nOn Wednesday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the Welsh Government was reviewing its guidance on schools to see how it could \"make those environments even more secure.\"\nShe said it was looking at how to reinforce messages on \"safe behaviours\" for things like walking to school, where children might consider sharing \"mobile phones and cans of fizzy drink.\"\nDespite looking at this range of measures, Dr Payne said one of the biggest factors determining when it might be safe to re-open schools was simply whether enough people were sticking to basic rules outside, like social distancing and not mixing with other households.\n\"There is some really important research that does show that children can have a wide range of symptoms in coronavirus,\" explained Dr Payne, who is also the Welsh Government's consultant paediatrician.\nHowever, she said any child would also have one of the two main symptoms of coronavirus alongside anything else. \n\"They will have one of the core symptoms, the cough, or the fever. What we've always said is that children present in all sorts of different ways.\"\nDr Payne said it was more common for children to have a fever with coronavirus, but if there was any doubt, people should look to get a test.\n\"If you're worried about your child, you should get helpful medical advice from the usual routes, so don't suffer in silence,\" she said.\n\"Don't sit on a child with a temperature, always take advice.\"\n\"Nurseries are a vital part of supporting both children and the economy and allowing people to work,\" said Dr Payne.\n\"They have not had to restrict their operations, partly because of the intelligence that we're getting. The evidence is that we are not seeing very many cases in nurseries. If that changes as we monitor it, then it's possible that advice might have to change.\n\"You have to be conscious of any downside of actions to restrict the spread of infection. \n\"This is the balance that has been arrived at, for the moment.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Skiing,Coronavirus pandemic,Switzerland",
      "text": "A British tourist has been blamed for a spike in coronavirus cases that led officials to cancel Switzerland's famous Lauberhorn ski race.\nThe resort of Wengen, where the race is held, had recorded only 10 cases of the virus by mid-December. \nBut the number soon began to rise and many cases have since been linked to the new highly infectious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK.\nAt least 27 cases are connected to one British tourist, contact tracers say.\nThe tourist stayed in a hotel in Wengen over the holiday period.\nThe Lauberhorn course is the longest downhill run in the world, and racers can reach speeds of 160km/h (100 mph).\nOfficials desperately tried to save the race, shutting schools and offering to close off the resort to everyone but the competitors. \nSwiss health officials initially agreed with the plan, but a further jump in cases at the start of this week prompted them to pull the emergency brake and cancel the event.\nWengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is one of the top competitions on the World Cup ski circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own homegrown talent, such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka, have triumphed there.\nMoreover, the long love affair between Switzerland and British winter tourists has frosted over to some extent.\nIt was only last month that the vanishing Brits of Verbier, who reportedly fled Switzerland rather than accept the government mandated quarantine, triggered a flurry of negative headlines. \nNow the high point of Switzerland's skiing calendar has been abruptly cancelled, and some Swiss blame the British.\nOthers say Switzerland only has itself to blame. \nWhile neighbours France and Italy closed their resorts over the festive period, the Swiss government opted for a precarious balancing act. It kept its slopes open, but closed all bars and restaurants and limited ski lifts to two-thirds capacity. \nMost Swiss resorts are quiet, with just a few locals enjoying the runs. But still some tourists arrived and, as Wengen's experience shows, just one infected guest is enough to cause major damage. \nInstead of hosting a major ski race, Wengen officials are now racing to control the virus. Mass testing has already begun in the resort.\nSwitzerland's government has extended the closure of bars, restaurants, museums, and theatres until the end of February in a bid to control the new variant. It has also ordered non-essential shops to close and made working from home obligatory.\nAs for the Lauberhorn, Switzerland's oldest and fiercest skiing rival, Austria, will now host the postponed event. Nothing could have been calculated to upset the Swiss more.\nThe event was first moved to the Austrian ski resort of Kitzb\u00fchel, but an outbreak of coronavirus there has prompted another move, this time to Flachau, 100km to the east.\nThe cluster of cases in Jochberg near Kitzb\u00fchel broke out among a group of mainly British trainee ski instructors."

What are these variants and why are they causing concern?\nAll viruses naturally mutate over time, and Sars-CoV-2 is no exception.\nSince the virus was first identified a year ago, thousands of mutations have arisen.\nThe vast majority of mutations are \"passengers\" and will have little impact, says Dr Lucy van Dorp, an expert in the evolution of pathogens at University College London.\n\"They don't change the behaviour of the virus, they are just carried along.\"\nBut every once in a while, a virus strikes lucky by mutating in a way that helps it survive and reproduce.\n\"Viruses carrying these mutations can then increase in frequency due to natural selection, given the right epidemiological settings,\" Dr van Dorp says.\nThis is what seems to be happening with the variant that has spread across the UK, known as 202012/01, and a similar, but different variant, recently identified in South Africa (501.V2).\nThere is no evidence so far that either causes more severe disease, but the worry is that health systems will be overwhelmed by a rapid rise in cases.\nIn a rapid risk assessment of these \"variants of concern\", the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said they place increased pressure on health systems.\n\"Although there is no information that infections with these strains are more severe, due to increased transmissibility, the impact of Covid-19 disease in terms of hospitalisations and deaths is assessed as high, particularly for those in older age groups or with co-morbidities,\" the EU agency said.\nThe variants have different origins but share a mutation in a gene that encodes the spike protein, which the virus uses to latch on to and enter human cells.\n Scientists think this could be why they appear more infectious.\n\"The UK and South African virus variants have changes in the spike gene consistent with the possibility that they are more infectious,\" says Prof Lawrence Young at the University of Warwick.\nBut as Dr Jeff Barrett, director of the Covid-19 genomics initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK, points out, it's the combination of what the virus is doing and what we're doing that determines how fast it spreads.\n\"With the new variant, the situation changes more quickly as restrictions are relaxed and tightened, and there is less room for error in controlling the spread,\" he says. \n\"We don't have any evidence, however, that the new variant can fundamentally evade masks, social distancing, or the other interventions - we just need to apply them more strictly.\"\nWith vaccine roll-out underway, scientists are racing to understand the repercussions for vaccines, which are based on the spike protein sequence.\nThere is particular concern about the South Africa variant, which has several changes in the spike (S) protein. \nMost experts think vaccines will still be effective, at least in the short term.\nDr Julian W Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester, says vaccines can be modified to be \"more close-fitting and effective against this variant in a few months\". \n\"Meanwhile, most of us believe that the existing vaccines are likely to work to some extent to reduce infection/ transmission rates and severe disease against both the UK and South African variants - as the various mutations have not altered the S protein shape that the current vaccine-induced antibodies will not bind at all.\"\nScientists are carrying out laboratory studies to find out more about the variants. And they are tracking every move of the virus as it hopscotches around the world.\nBy taking a swab from an infected patient, the genetic code of the virus can be extracted and amplified before being \"read\" using a sequencer.\nThe string of letters, or nucleotides, allows genomes and mutations to be compared.\n\"It is thanks to these efforts, and UK testing laboratories, that the UK variant has been flagged so quickly as a potential cause of concern,\" Dr van Dorp says.\nProf Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health at the University of Liverpool, says that, through the efforts of scientists to sequence the virus, \"we've got a really good handle on variants that emerge\".\nIn the short-term, only the harshest of lockdowns will reduce case numbers, he says.\n\"What lockdown does is reduce the number of people with the virus and reduce the amount of virus out there and that's a good thing.\"\nBut in the long term, Prof Hiscox suspects, we may face a scenario like flu, where new vaccines are developed and administered every year.\n\"The problem is, the more variants we get, the greater the chance the virus will be able to escape part of the vaccine - and this may reduce [its] efficacy,\" he says.\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A further 1,564 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began.\nIt brings the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767.\nDr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said there have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first.\nAnd the prime minister warned there was a \"very substantial\" risk of intensive care capacity being \"overtopped\".\nSpeaking to the Commons Liaison Committee, Boris Johnson said the situation was \"very, very tough\" in the NHS and the strain on staff was \"colossal\". \nHe appealed to the public to follow lockdown rules, which require people in England to stay at home and only go out for limited reasons, such as for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. \nSimilar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nA further 47,525 new cases have also been recorded.\nPerhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here.\nPeople who are dying now are likely to have been infected three or so weeks ago, around Christmas time.\nThat was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this being reported.\nToday's figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays in reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards.\nCurrently around 1,000 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account.\nBut the figures also provide some hope. For the third day in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000.\nThere have been several days where they have exceeded 60,000.\nIf that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling.\nBut it is going to take some weeks for that to happen.\nThese are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far.\nEarlier, during Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said lockdown measures were \"starting to show signs of some effect\".\nLabour's Sir Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions in England, asking why they were weaker in this lockdown compared with March.\nDuring the first lockdown, nurseries were closed to most children and it was not permitted to exercise with someone from another household.\n\"We keep things under constant review,\" Mr Johnson replied. \"If there is any need to toughen up restrictions - which I don't rule out - we will of course come to this House.\"\nHe stressed that it was early days, but said: \"The lockdown measures we have in place combined with tier four measures that we were using are starting to show signs of some effect.\"\nLater, asked by the Commons Liaison Committee whether schools could reopen after February half-term, Mr Johnson said: \"It is far, far too early for us to say [early signs of progress mean] we can go into any kind of relaxation in the middle of February, we've got to work very hard to achieve that.\"\nThe prime minister also said on Wednesday that Covid vaccinations will be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week as soon as supply allows.\nThe number of people in the UK who have received the first dose of a vaccine has risen to 2,639,309 - up by 207,661 from the day before. \nCommenting on the latest daily figures, PHE's Dr Doyle said: \"With each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus.\"\nShe added: \"It is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.\"\nThe vast majority of the deaths reported on Tuesday happened over the past week. However, at least 100 were in 2020, with one death dating back to May. \nThe previous highest daily death toll was on Friday, when 1,325 people were reported to have died. \nThese government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive, but there are other ways of measuring the total number of deaths.\nWhen all deaths where coronavirus is mentioned on the death certificate are counted, plus deaths known to have occurred more recently, the number of deaths involving Covid in the UK is more than 100,000.\nAnother method is to count excess deaths - all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year.\nMeanwhile, the prime minister has said he is \"concerned\" about a new coronavirus variant that is believed to have emerged in Brazil. He acknowledged it is not yet clear how effective existing vaccines will be against the latest new variant. \nThe UK is taking steps to make sure it is not brought into the country, Mr Johnson said. \nA government Covid committee is meeting on Thursday to discuss the possibility of stopping flights from Brazil.\nArrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days. \nAnd from Monday, anyone arriving into the UK from any country will have to present a negative Covid test. The new rule had been due to come into force this week but the government said it was being put back to give travellers more time to prepare."

      "tags": "Live music,Brexit,Music",
      "text": "The EU has insisted it was the UK government's choice to end visa-free touring for musicians on the continent, following an outcry from performers.\nOfficials in Brussels told the BBC that the UK \"refused\" a plan that would have let musicians tour without visas.\nThe response came after Downing Street re-affirmed that its own \"ambitious\" proposals had been rejected by the EU.\nThe EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the result was one of the \"inevitable consequences\" of Brexit.\n\"I very much regretted that the British didn't have more ambition for people's mobility,\" Mr Barnier told reporters on Thursday.\n\"From last March, we made fairly ambitious proposals in terms of mobility, including for specific categories such as journalists, performers, musicians and others,\" he went on. \"But you need to be two to make a deal.\"\nPressure has been mounting on the two sides to negotiate an exemption to the new restrictions for musicians, with performers and crews saying livelihoods could be at risk.\nSince Brexit, British musicians and crews are no longer guaranteed visa-free travel and may need extra work permits to play in certain European countries. \nUnder the terms of the deal, British bands can tour Europe for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. But tours in Germany and Spain, for instance, will now require extra visas for paid work, while those in France and The Netherlands will not.\nPopular European touring routes could now see them take on extra costs and paperwork. According to the Association of British Orchestras, truck drivers carrying stage equipment must now return to the UK after visiting two EU member states.\nA petition signed by more than 250,000 people - including Laura Marling, Biffy Clyro and Dua Lipa - is calling on the the government to \"negotiate a free cultural work permit\" that would allow \"bands, musicians, artists, TV and sports celebrities that tour the EU to perform shows and events and carnet exception for touring equipment\".\nThe government later responded to the petition, saying the EU \"turned down proposals\", while noting that \"there is scope to return to this in the future\".\nOn Thursday, Musicians' Union general secretary Horace Trubridge demanded greater support from Prime Minister Boris Johnson for UK artists hoping to tour in Europe again once it's safe to do so.\nA \"reciprocal agreement\" for EU artists arriving into the UK would be \"in the interests of the UK and EU\", he said.\n\"Our industry has been incredibly badly hit by the Covid-19 crisis and if our members are also restricted by additional costs and red tape on touring once things start to go back to normal, we will see a real downturn in what is a unique British success story: Music.\"\nMr Johnson vowed on Wednesday during Prime Minister's Questions to meet MPs to discuss the matter. \"I know that our friends in the EU will be wanting to go further to improve things for not just musicians, but business travellers of all kinds. There is a mutual benefit,\" he said.\nAn EU spokesperson told the BBC: \"The UK has chosen to no longer allow the free movement of EU citizens to the UK. It also refused to include a chapter on mobility in the agreement.\n\"These choices inevitably mean that travel between the EU and the UK - including for business purposes - will no longer be as easy as it was while the UK was a member state.\"\nHe added that the UK \"refused to include a commitment on visa-free short stays\", which could have meant people like musicians, sportspeople and journalists would not have needed individual visas.\n\"As a result, it is now up to each member state to determine if a visa is required for short-stay visits for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. This is fully in line with EU law.\"\nThe EU would not be drawn on whether it would re-open talks around music touring visas.\nThe government has previously said it \"pushed for a more ambitious agreement with the EU on the temporary movement of business travellers, which would have covered musicians and others, but our proposals were rejected by the EU\".\nOn Tuesday, it added that \"the door remains open should the EU change its mind\".\nThen on Wednesday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden blamed the EU for \"letting down music on both sides of the Channel - not us\".\nProf Catherine Barnard, deputy director of research organisation UK In A Changing Europe, told BBC News: \"The bottom line is that the EU did offer up to 90 days, and with the possibility of being paid.\n\"I suspect the UK probably said no because they have a very hard line on anything that may even look like free movement of persons, which of course the UK had committed itself to stopping.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Domestic abuse,Companies",
      "text": "Employers \"have a duty\" to support staff who suffer domestic abuse but few have adequate policies in place, the government says.\nIt said bosses were in a unique position to help but a \"lack of awareness and stigma\" held them back. \nCalls to domestic abuse services have surged in the pandemic as couples spend more time at home.\nBusiness Minister Paul Scully said employers could be a \"bridge between a worker and the support they need\".\n\"It was once taboo to talk about mental health, but now most workplaces have well-established policies in place. We want to see the same happen for domestic abuse, but more quickly and more effectively,\" he said in an open letter to employers.\nManagers and colleagues are often the only other people outside the home that victims talk to each day and so \"uniquely placed\" to spot signs of abuse, he said. \nThese include becoming more withdrawn than usual, sudden drops in performance, mentions of controlling or coercive behaviour in partners, or physical signs such as bruising.\nEmployers did not have to become \"specialists\" in handling domestic abuse, Mr Scully said, but could do more to help, including:\nFirms already taking action include Vodafone, which offers specialist training to HR and line managers and support for victims including counselling and additional paid leave. \nIn August, law firm Linklaters strengthened its policies and now offers people who need to flee their home but can't stay with others three nights' accommodation in a hotel. \nIt also offers the option of paid leave, plus one-off payments of \u00a35,000 to help victims trying to become financially independent.\nDomestic violence charity Refuge said it saw an 80% increase in calls to its helpline during the first national lockdown, a trend the government believes has continued.\nAnd in November, 43% of respondents to a survey by charity Surviving Economic Abuse showed an abuser had interfered with someone's ability to work or study from home during the crisis. \nExamples included hiding phones or computers, removing wi-fi connections, and phoning an employer claiming a breach of lockdown rules, in an apparent effort to get them sacked.\nDomestic abuse isn't a new problem, nor does today's call to businesses apply only during a pandemic. \nBut coronavirus has highlighted new and existing risks. \nFor many victims and survivors, work is a place of respite. \nBeing based at home, or on furlough, can reduce communication with team members, and prevent face-to-face chats with colleagues. \nI've heard of employers finding simple yet effective ways of supporting staff during the pandemic. \nFor example, finding a plausible reason for an employee whose remote communications were being overlooked, to go into the office as a one-off, so they could talk freely and hand over an ID document for safe keeping. \nOf course, not every business can afford to offer emergency accommodation or financial support to those in urgent need.  But the focus of today's letter is on awareness, using free support and removing stigma.\nThe charity Surviving Economic Abuse wants the government to go further, and put paid leave for domestic abuse victims into law.\nElizabeth Filkin, who chairs the Employer's Initiative on Domestic Abuse, argues there are real benefits in supporting staff - including around productivity, loyalty and reputation. \nEmployment lawyer Sarah Chilton, a partner at CM Murray, told the BBC that all employers have a duty to protect their staff's health and safety while working from home. That includes if they are being subjected to domestic abuse. \n\"Where an employee is required to work at home during, for example, the pandemic, the employer should take account of any risk to that person's physical and mental health and safety in the environment in which they work.\" \nAngela Ogilvie, global director of HR at Linklaters, said training was vital to spot signs of abuse, especially now. \n\"Victims may avoid calls or videos for example. They may become quiet, anxious or tearful, secretive about their home life. \n\"And it's being conscious of how you start those conversations because they may be overheard, so you may have to switch your conversation to email or text.\"\nMr Scully said the government would consult on ways to help domestic abuse victims at work, for instance by making it easier to request flexible working.\nThe government's Domestic Abuse Bill also continues to make its way through parliament.\nIt will bring into law a statutory definition of domestic abuse that includes coercive or controlling behaviour as well as emotional and economic abuse."

      "tags": "Las Vegas,Magic",
      "text": "Siegfried Fischbacher, one half of celebrated magic double act Siegfried and Roy, has died from pancreatic cancer in Las Vegas at the age of 81.\nThe pair were among the biggest names in the world of magic and were known for working with lions and tigers.\nPaying tribute, David Copperfield called him a \"legend in magic\", and Penn Jillette said Siegfried and Roy were \"pure showbiz and pure class\".\nRoy Horn died from Covid-19 complications last May.\nThe pair \"invented the full length magic show headlining Vegas\", according to Jillette, who is known as part of the duo Penn and Teller.\nSiegfried and Roy teamed up in their native Germany in the 1950s, and the highlight of their extravagant shows was their performances with white lions and white tigers. \nHorn was attacked by a 400lb white Bengal tiger named Montecore during a performance in Las Vegas in 2003, leaving him partially paralysed and using a wheelchair.\nHe underwent lengthy rehabilitation and was later able to walk again, but the attack ended the duo's long-running Las Vegas residency.\nFischbacher and Horn, whose real name was Uwe Ludwig Horn, had met on a cruise ship and were later signed up by a liner company.\nAfter being spotted and signed to perform at a nightclub in Bremen, they went on to tour Europe and brought tigers into their act. \nBut they shot to worldwide fame after launching their Las Vegas shows in the 1960s.\nTheir unique brand of magic and artistry consistently attracted sell-out crowds. They performed an estimated 5,000 shows for 10 million fans in the city after 1990, when they began performing at the Mirage hotel-casino. \nThey were also estimated to have grossed more than $1bn by 2001, which included their thousands of shows at other venues in earlier years.\nIn 2004, their act became the basis for the animated comedy Father of the Pride, about the mischievous adventures of a family of white lions who perform with Siegfried & Roy in Las Vegas. \nHorn's condition improved and by 2006 he was able to talk and walk with assistance from Fischbacher.\nIn 2009, the duo staged a final appearance with a tiger (said to be Montecore, but this was disputed by some) at a benefit for the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute in Las Vegas.\nThey retired from showbusiness in 2010. After Horn's death last year, Fischbacher said: \"Today, the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend.\n\"From the moment we met, I knew Roy and I, together, would change the world. There could be no Siegfried without Roy, and no Roy without Siegfried.\"\nFischbacher recently had a 12-hour operation to remove a malignant tumour.

      "text": "Richard Leonard has resigned as Scottish Labour leader, saying it is in the best interests of the party for him to stand down.\nMr Leonard said he believed speculation about his leadership had become a \"distraction\".\nAnd he said he would be stepping down with immediate effect.\nHis resignation comes just months ahead of the Scottish Parliament election, which is scheduled to be held  in May. \nMr Leonard had been leader of the party for three years after succeeding Kezia Dugdale.\nThe former union official had faced open calls to quit from some of his own MSPs last year amid concerns that his leadership style could damage the party in the forthcoming Scottish Parliament election. \nPolls have suggested that many Scottish Labour supporters struggle to recognise him, and he is closely associated with former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. \nScottish Labour had dominated politics in Scotland for decades, but is currently the third largest party at Holyrood behind the SNP and Conservatives.\nAnd Mr Leonard's critics had questioned whether he was capable of turning the party's fortunes around. \nIn a statement, Mr Leonard said the decision to resign had not been easy - but he felt it was the right one for him and his party. \nHe said: \"I have thought long and hard over the Christmas period about what this crisis means, and the approach Scottish Labour takes to help tackle it. \n\"I have also considered what the speculation about my leadership does to our ability to get Labour's message across. This has become a distraction.  \n\"I have come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of the party that I step aside as leader of Scottish Labour with immediate effect.\"\nHe also insisted that Scotland now needs a Labour government more than ever, and accused both the Scottish and UK governments of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic.\nMr Leonard added: \"While I step down from the leadership today, the work goes on - and I will play my constructive part as an MSP in winning support for Labour's vision of a better future in a democratic economy and a socialist society.\"\nHis decision leaves Scottish Labour looking for its fifth leader since the independence referendum in 2014 - with Johann Lamont, Jim Murphy and Kezia Dugdale all having held the job since then.\nA Procedures Committee, to oversee the election of Mr Leonard's successor, has been formed and will have its first meeting on Friday.\nMeanwhile, Labour's Scottish Executive Committee will also meet in the coming days to agree a timetable for the process.\nMSP Jackie Baillie, who was Scottish Labour's deputy leader, has taken charge of the party on an interim basis.\nThis sudden resignation four months from the Holyrood elections seems to have taken Scottish Labour by surprise.\nMSPs I've spoken to said they did not see it coming. \nThere have been times when Richard Leonard has been under severe pressure from some in his party to stand down.\nWhen several MSPs publicly called for him to quit because the party had gone backwards at successive elections on his watch, he stood firm.\nHis critics seemed to have accepted that he would lead them and a divided party into the Holyrood election.\nThat has now changed and interim leader Jackie Baillie has to quickly organise a contest to replace him.\nIt's a contest in which Anas Sarwar, if he stands, would be an obvious frontrunner - even although he lost last time to Mr Leonard, who was seen as much closer to the then UK party leader, Jeremy Corbyn.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Leonard should be \"very proud\" of his achievements as leader of the party in Scotland.\nSir Keir added: \"I would like to thank Richard for his service to our party and his unwavering commitment to the values he believes in.\n\"Richard has led Scottish Labour through one of the most challenging and difficult periods in our country's history, including a general election and the pandemic.\"\nMr Leonard had been due to face a confidence vote at the party's ruling Executive Committee last September - but the motion was withdrawn at the last minute.\nIt came after four Scottish Labour MSPs called for him to go, warning that the party faced \"catastrophe\" at the ballot box under his leadership.\nThey pointed to the party's dismal performance in previous elections under Mr Leonard.\nScottish Labour finished fifth in the European election in May 2019, and then lost all but one of its MPs in the general election in December of the same year. \nMr Leonard insisted at the time that he intended to lead the party into this year's Holyrood election, and accused his opponents of waging \"internal war\" against him.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who faced Mr Leonard in her weekly question session in the Scottish Parliament, tweeted that she had \"always liked Richard Leonard\" despite their political difference. \nShe added: \"He is a decent guy and I wish him well for the future.\"\nRuth Davidson, who quit as leader of the Scottish Tories in 2019 before returning to lead the party at Holyrood, said she had always found Mr Leonard to be a \"thoroughly decent man and a committed campaigner.\"\nAnas Sarwar, who was defeated by Mr Leonard in the leadership contest in 2017 and is seen as one of the favourites to replace him, said he was sure Mr Leonard would \"continue to fight for a fairer, more just and more equal society today, tomorrow and long into the future.\"\nBut Labour MSP Neil Findlay, an outspoken supporter of Mr Leonard, took aim at those who had sought to oust him last year - describing them as \"flinching cowards\" and \"sneering traitors\"."

However, customers will still be able to collect John Lewis orders from its Waitrose stores.\nFace coverings are compulsory across the UK when in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres, unless you are exempt.\nSeveral supermarkets including Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have said they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks who are not  medically exempt.\nYou do not have to wear a face covering if you are a child, if you cannot wear one because of a physical or mental illness or disability, or if its use will cause severe distress. \nOfficial guidance makes it clear that you do not have to show any written evidence for why you are exempt.\nThe government does not provide exemption cards or badges. \nIf you are self-isolating because you have coronavirus symptoms or have been in contact with someone who has tested positive, or you are in quarantine after travelling, you must not go shopping.\nPubs, bars and restaurants across most of the UK are currently closed, although they can offer takeaway food and drink with certain restrictions. Alcohol cannot be sold via click-and-collect, but can be ordered for delivery.\nIn Scotland, from Saturday 16 January, premises offering takeaways can no longer allow customers indoors, and must operate from a hatch or doorway.\nCustomers aren't allowed to eat and drink outside premises, although there are some exceptions, such as airports.\nAcross the UK, hair, beauty, tanning and nail salons are closed - along with tattoo parlours, spas, massage parlours, and body and skin piercing services. These \"close contact\" services cannot take place in other peoples' homes either.\nIn addition, hotels, hostels and guest houses are shut to most guests. They can open to business travellers and those who need accommodation to self-isolate, or attend medical appointments or a funeral.\nAll indoor leisure and entertainment venues are shut, from gyms and swimming pools to theatres, cinemas and museums.

      "text": "President Donald Trump has become the first president in history to be impeached twice by the US House of Representatives - and remains one of just three to have been impeached at all.\nHere's what happened to the others.\nIn the shadow of the Civil War, President Andrew Johnson - a Democrat - sparred constantly with the Republican-held Congress over how to rebuild the defeated US South.\nThe \"Radical Republicans\" of this period pushed for legislation to punish former Confederate leaders and protect the rights of freed slaves. Johnson used his presidential veto to block the Republican efforts at every turn.\nIn March, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, crafted to curtail the president's ability to fire members of his cabinet without approval from the Senate.  In defiance, Johnson suspended a cabinet member and political rival, Edwin Stanton, while Congress was in recess. \nIf today's proceedings seem like a lot of political theatrics, it is in keeping with impeachment tradition: Stanton responded to his firing by locking himself in his office and refusing to leave. \nStanton's removal proved to be the final straw - the House Republicans rushed to draft 11 articles of impeachment. \nAfter a vote along party lines the articles were presented to the Senate, where he was acquitted, but only just. It was a single vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict. \nAccording to some accounts, Johnson wept at the news of his acquittal, vowing to devote himself to restoring his reputation.\nIt didn't work. \nHe served out the rest of his presidential term, but his final months in office were beset with the same power struggles that warped his tenure prior to impeachment.\nAnd in 1869, Democrats lost the White House to Republican candidate General Ulysses S Grant, who allowed his party's plan for Radical Reconstruction to continue. \nBeing impeached.  \nAnd buying Alaska in 1867 for a cool $7.2m.\nJohnson was also one of the poorest presidents. He never went to school.\nThe near-impeachment of Richard Nixon traces back to the 1972 break-in of the Democratic party's headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington DC. \nAs investigations revealed that the burglars had been paid with funds from Nixon's re-election campaign, the Watergate scandal spread far beyond the break-in, implicating top White House officials. \nFor nearly two years, Nixon scrambled to cover up his role in the conspiracy, leading to his eventual demise.\nThe Republican president's efforts proved futile. In August 1974, as the House Judiciary Committee prepared impeachment articles, Nixon was forced to release Oval Office recordings in which the president is heard ordering his staff to have the CIA tell the FBI to stop its investigation into the Watergate break-in.\nThis now-infamous \"smoking gun\" tape marked the final breakdown of Nixon's attempted cover-up. \nOn 27 July, the House Judiciary Committee voted to pass three articles of impeachment - obstruction of justice, misuse of power and contempt of Congress - and sent them to the House for a full vote.\nBut, the vote never occurred.\nOn 8 August, 1974, Nixon announced his resignation. He remains the only US president in history to have done so. \n\"I have never been a quitter,\" he said in his resignation speech. \"To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as president, I must put the interest of America first.\" \nVice-President Gerald Ford was sworn in as president and pardoned Nixon for any crimes he had committed while in office. \nUp for election less than two years later, Ford lost the White House to Democrat Jimmy Carter. \nNo contest. It's the Watergate scandal. Though he never admitted to any criminal wrongdoing, his actions remain a cautionary tale of abuse of presidential power.\nNixon died in April 1994, 20 years after he resigned in disgrace. \nSpeaking at his funeral, then-President Bill Clinton focused on Nixon's work in foreign affairs.\n\"Let us say: may the day of judging President Nixon on anything less than his entire life and career come to a close,\" Mr Clinton said.  \nJust a few years after President Bill Clinton preached forgiveness for Nixon's failings, the Arkansas Democrat was facing his own political crisis. \nWithin one year of taking office, Mr Clinton found himself under investigation by a Justice Department special prosecutor.\nUnder special counsel Kenneth Starr, the scope of the probe into real estate dealings expanded in January 1998 to include the president's affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. \nAs part of a separate lawsuit against the president - the sexual harassment of Paula Jones - Mr Clinton was asked about his relationship to Ms Lewinsky. Under oath on 17 January, Mr Clinton denied having a relationship with the former White House aide.\nDays later, Mr Clinton famously doubled down on his denial.\n\"I want you to listen to me,\" President Clinton said to media at a White House appearance. \"I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky. I never told a single person to lie, not a single time, never.\" \nOn 9 September 1998, Mr Starr released his report to Congress. The public, too, soon got to see the 445-page Starr report which included salacious testimony from Ms Lewinsky, who had struck an immunity deal with the independent counsel in exchange for her co-operation. \nThe report also included 11 possible grounds for impeachment. In December 1998, the House of Representatives voted along party lines to impeach Mr Clinton on two counts: perjury and obstruction of Congress.\nIn February, Mr Clinton was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate.  \nFor the year that the Lewinsky-Clinton scandal consumed the country, the president resisted growing calls to resign. \nIt was during this period, at the end of January 1998, that Mr Clinton laid claim to one of his highest-ever opinion poll ratings. In a poll for CNN, Gallup found that 67% of Americans approved of the president.  \nIn the end, the only politicians to lose their jobs during the impeachment crisis were Republicans. \nThe Republican plan to ride the scandal to victory in the 1998 midterms backfired: Democrats made gains in both the House and the Senate. \nMr Clinton left office in January 2001 with a 65% approval rating - the highest of any of his predecessors in half a century. \nBut his party lost the White House when George W Bush beat Al Gore after a recount in Florida.\nDepends who you ask but the Monica Lewinsky scandal would be up there for most people as the first thing they think of. The impeachment that followed? Less so. \nHis high popularity ratings throughout the process suggest he was not as damaged by it as the previous two presidents who faced it."

      "text": "The government has defended its scheme to offer free food to struggling families in England over half term - after criticism from teachers' unions and council leaders.\nFood will be provided for children by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, rather than through schools.\nBut councils say the government should provide food vouchers over half term.\n\"Vulnerable families will continue to receive meals,\" said a Department for Education (DFE) spokeswoman.\n\"Our guidance is clear: schools provide free school meals for eligible pupils during term time. \n\"Beyond that, there is wider government support in place to support families and children via the billions of pounds in welfare support we've made available,\" said the DFE spokeswoman.\nBut the Local Government Association (LGA), representing councils, said \"the government should provide food vouchers to eligible families during February half-term as it did last summer\" - and that the \u00a3170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme should be used for other support.\n\"During the last full national lockdown, government recognised the significant extra pressures on low income families and extended free school meal provision into the school holidays,\" said Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's resources board.\n\"Government was explicit that the Covid Winter Grant Scheme was not intended to replicate or replace free school meals, but was to enable councils to support low income households, particularly those at risk of food poverty as we moved towards economic recovery.\"\nThe row follows the DFE's publication of guidelines on free meals, after an outcry over pictures of food packages to replace free school meals during the lockdown.\nThe prime minister and other ministers criticised the quality of what was being sent out by some school food firms.\nThe DfE guidance says: \"Schools do not need to provide lunch parcels or vouchers during the February half term. \n\"There is wider government support in place to support families and children outside of term-time through the Covid Winter Grant Scheme.\"\nThe DFE insists that even though schools will not provide food parcels or vouchers during half term, children will still be supplied with food through the Covid Winter Grant Scheme.\nThis aims to support those most in need with the cost of food, energy, water bills and other essentials.\nCouncils are required to work out their own local approach to eligibility, using benefits data and their local knowledge to decide how to support vulnerable families.\nMoving to this scheme for a replacement for school meals during half term, with the added pressure of a lockdown, has drawn criticism from head teachers and teachers.\nKevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned that switching schemes meant \"yet more disruption to free schools meals could lie ahead in half term\".\nHe said using this scheme could cause an \"unnecessary logistical nightmare\", suggesting continuing with providing meals through schools would be more simple.\nMr Courtney said: \"This week, Matt Hancock, Gavin Williamson and Boris Johnson made public statements about how appalled they were by the quality of food parcels shared on Twitter,\" said Mr Courtney.\nBut he said ministers should now \"hang their heads in shame\" for threatening more \"chaos and confusion\" over providing food.\n\"These are battles which should not have to be repeatedly fought,\" said Mr Courtney.\nNational Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman accused the the government of \"badly thought out and last-minute schemes to help with holiday hunger\" which he said were \"leaving families and children anxious\".\n\"The government must urgently clarify for families how they will be helped during the upcoming half term holiday so they can be assured that they will not go hungry,\" said Mr Whiteman.\nLabour's Tulip Siddiq, shadow minister for children and early years, said: \"Time and time again this government has had to be shamed into providing food for hungry children over school holidays.\" \nFood charities and anti-poverty campaigners, including footballer Marcus Rashford, have repeatedly clashed with the government over the issue of food for poor pupils during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly over school holidays.\nThe footballer forced the government to back down in the summer over its plans not to offer free meals in the holidays to poor pupils, whose families were likely to be suffering with reduced incomes.\nBut over the October half-term when the provision was withdrawn many local authorities continued to offer them from their own budgets."

      "tags": "Marcus Rashford,Free school meals,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A mother who posted a photo on social media of a food parcel she received has told of the \"sense of sadness\" she felt on seeing what it contained.\nThe mother, who wants to be anonymous, told the BBC: \"As I unpacked that food parcel... and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and depressing.\"\nChartwells, the firm which supplied the parcel, has apologised.\nThe education secretary said schools will be able to offer vouchers rather than food parcels from next week.\nGavin Williamson told the education select committee on Wednesday that he was \"absolutely disgusted\" by the photo of the food parcel's contents, and that his department had made it clear \"this sort of behaviour is just not right [and] will not be tolerated\".\nHe said the government would \"support any school that needs to take action\" and \"name and shame those that are not delivering against the standards\" set by the Department for Education.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Boris Johnson on online images of the \"disgraceful\" food parcels during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs).\nThe PM insisted the government had \"massively increased the value of what we're providing\" in the form of another  \u00a3170m in the winter grant scheme, \u00a3220m for holiday activities and food programme, as well as the rollout of the national voucher scheme. \nHe expressed his gratitude to the footballer Marcus Rashford - a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals who shared images of some parcels online - for highlighting the issue.\nSpeaking to MPs on the Commons Liaison committee on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Johnson said the free school meals pictured online do not reflect government guidance, adding it was a \"scandal and a disgrace that some companies are trying to get away with the provision that they're offering\".\nThe PM added that it was the decision of the schools on whether or not to have vouchers or food parcels, saying that about 75% opt for vouchers but that some schools wish to continue to support caterers.\nMr Rashford, who has met with Chartwells and spoke to Mr Johnson earlier, called for a \"full major review\" of the free school meal system.\nIn a Twitter thread on Wednesday, Mr Rashford said many vulnerable children had been helped during the pandemic \"thanks to the efforts of individuals, businesses, charities, educators, and government\".\nBut he added: \"It's 2021. Our eyes are open. Now is the time for a full major review of the Free School Meal system.\" \nFood parcels have been sent to pupils in England who would normally be eligible for free school meals while schools are closed during the coronavirus lockdown. \nThe national voucher scheme provides supermarket vouchers through an online portal. The government had previously used this scheme during the first lockdown.\nA row broke out after the mother, using the online name Roadside Mum, posted a photo on Twitter of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items, which she calculated to have cost about \u00a35. The post prompted others to complain about the quality and quantity of the food they had received in similar parcels.\nThe mother, who is disabled, had thought it was supposed to last 10 school days and should have been worth \u00a330.\nShe told BBC Breakfast: \"As I unpacked that food parcel in my living room and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and very depressing. \n\"One of my children came in and saw me laying this out on the floor, and I said I was going to picture it because it didn't look like a lot.\n\"I could see the child's realisation that this is what I've been given to eat for a week and the sense of sadness.\n\"Where has the rest of the food gone? This is meant to be a week's food. Why is it so mean?\"\nChartwells, the company that provided the parcel, said it was actually only intended to last one school week and had cost \u00a310.50 for food, packing and distribution.\nIn a further statement posted on Wednesday, the firm, which is owned by Compass group, said it had \"fully investigated\" its food parcels provision in the last few hours. It apologised for those parcels that did not meet the firm's high standards, and committed to refunding the costs.\nIt added that from Monday, the lunches would be enhanced to reflect the Department for Education's additional allowance of \u00a33.50 per week per child.\nThe company has since said that it will add breakfast free of charge into the food parcels from 25 January, and will continue to do so while schools are closed. It will include bread, butter, yoghurts, juice, milk, oats and fruit, it said. \nMeanwhile, some parents in London said they received a pot of flour and instructions on how to bake eight bread rolls in a food parcel from Pimlico Academy.\n\"It's very humiliating,\" one parent told Politics Home. \"Why would you decide for us? Why not give us the money?\"\nFuture Academies, which runs the school, told the BBC it had asked its caterers to improve the quality of its food parcels.\nImpact Food Group, the suppliers, said the pot contained \"bread mix\" and the only extra ingredient needed was water.\nThe intention was to help parents create \"an interactive cooking experience\" with their children and to help with some food education at home, he said.\nThe academy chain has said its own voucher scheme would start on 18 January.\nRachel Rodgers, a mother of three children aged 14, eight, and five, said she was not \"impressed\" with the amount of food provided in a parcel for her youngest child.\nRachel, from Essex, says: \"I got so much more with the vouchers. I always looked for meat and vegetables on offer at the supermarket, so I made the vouchers stretch even more.\n\"What am I supposed to do with one potato?\"\nRachel, who receives food parcels for her two youngest children and a voucher for her eldest, says it would have been \"nice to get a little more\" food, adding that \"even sandwich meat would have been good\".\nOne mother of three says she was \"disappointed\" by the contents of food parcels.\nThe mum, who does not want to be identified, says the food box she received for two of her children at secondary school contained sliced frozen bread \"[which] did not stay fresh\"; two slices of cheese that [were] \"hard and taste disgusting\", as well as beans, tinned tomatoes, apples, pasta and potatoes.\nShe says her youngest child, who is in primary school, received a parcel of five rolls \"that were going stale\", grated cheese, three packs of crackers, five yoghurts and packs of biscuits.\nThe mother adds: \"It is a good job I already had some cheese and bacon in the fridge, because this is disheartening.\n\"We have never had support feeding our children through the holidays even when I was young. We need help now.\"\nThe initial social media images of food parcels drew widespread criticism. \nBecca Lyon, head of child poverty campaigns at Save the Children, said the charity welcomed the return of the voucher scheme - adding that the problems some families had with the vouchers last year should not be repeated.\nAnne Longfield, the children's commissioner, called on companies to provide \"real food and real amounts that will really help families\".\nMeanwhile, Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the contents of the food parcels were \"not nutritionally sufficient for children and young people\".\nSource: Department for Education\nIn Wales, the provision of free school meals during the holidays has been extended by a year, and the Northern Ireland Executive made a pledge in November to provide free school meals in holidays until Easter 2022.\nIn Scotland - where holiday provision is currently promised up to Easter 2021 - both the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives have pledged to fund free school meals for all primary school pupils during term-time and holidays if they win the 2021 Scottish election."

      "text": "A man who threw away a laptop hard drive containing bitcoin he believes is now worth about \u00a3210m wants his council to let him search for it in landfill.\nJames Howells had 7,500 bitcoins, a virtual currency, on the hard drive, which he mistakenly threw away in 2013. \nHe said he was willing to donate 25% of the value of the bitcoins to his home city of Newport in south Wales - about \u00a352.5m - if he found the hard drive.\nNewport council said excavation was not possible under its licensing permit.\nMr Howells said if he was to recover the hard drive, he would want the money to be put into a \"Covid relief fund\" for people in Newport to use \"no questions asked\". \n\"Imagine how great it would be to say 'I've given everyone in the city a few hundred pounds',\" he told the BBC.\nMr Howells bought the bitcoins for almost nothing in 2009, but the hard drive ended up in a drawer after he spilled a drink on his laptop. \nHe kept the hard drive in his office drawer and \"totally forgot about bitcoin all together\" - so when he had a clear out, he believed everything had been taken off it.\nWhen he threw the hard drive away in 2013, the value of the bitcoins was about $7.5m (\u00a34.6m).\nBut now they are worth almost 50 times more, with the cost of a single bitcoin currently just over \u00a328,000 after a surge in value. \nHe said he has asked Newport council if he could search the landfill several times, but had not been granted permission. \n\"I offered the local authority 10% of the recovered funds in order to give me permission to search on their property and unfortunately they said no at the time,\" Mr Howells told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"What actually happened after that was the value of bitcoin skyrocketed even further. In 2017 the value of my hard drive was approximately \u00a3125m, at which point I made them another offer of 10% and unfortunately that offer was refused as well. \n\"I haven't actually made an offer to them today, but I'm willing to increase my offer to them to 25%. On today's valuation that would be \u00a352.5m and I'd like to put that into a Covid relief fund for the citizens of Newport.\"\nMr Howells said searching for the discarded hard drive would \"not be as hard as you might think\" as he would employ a professional team - and knows when he threw it away so could use that to find a grid reference of where the hard drive is buried. \nHe added investors had offered to cover the cost of excavating the landfill, in exchange for a large proportion of the recovered bitcoin.\nMr Howells said he wants to meet with the council to discuss what he said would be a \"win-win-win\" situation for him, the council and the city. \nBut a spokeswoman for the council said: \"Newport City Council has been contacted a number of times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins.\n\"The first time was several months after Mr Howells first realised the hardware was missing.\n\"The council has told Mr Howells on a number of occasions that excavation is not possible under our licencing permit and excavation itself would have a huge environmental impact on the surrounding area.\n\"The cost of digging up the landfill, storing and treating the waste could run into millions of pounds - without any guarantee of either finding it or it still being in working order.\""

Mr Sharp said he was \"not in favour of decriminalisation\".\nHe said other possible options for funding the BBC in the future could include a household tax like the one used in Germany, \"which amounts to the same amount of money\".\nHe added: \"So when we next get the chance to review the structure of this then it may be worth reassessing.\"\nAsked whether he believed the BBC's coverage of Brexit had been unbalanced, he replied: \"No, actually I don't.\n\"I believe there were some occasions when the Brexit representation was unbalanced.\n\"So if you ask me if I think Question Time seemed to have more Remainers than Brexiteers, the answer is yes, but the breadth of the coverage I thought was incredibly balanced, in a highly toxic environment that was extremely polarised.\"\nQuestion Time has said it has robust processes in place to ensure balance on its panels.\nMr Sharp said he was \"considered to be a Brexiteer\" and had donated around \u00a3400,000 to the Conservative Party over the past 20 years.\nHe said the biggest issue now facing the BBC is impartiality, and that \"trust in leadership and trust in processes\" must be rebuilt after high-profile equal pay cases with journalists such as Carrie Gracie and Samira Ahmed. \n\"Clearly some of the problems it's had recently are really rather terrible and reflect a culture that needs to be rebuilt, so everybody who cherishes the BBC and works at the BBC feels proud and happy to work there,\" he said. \"Then in my view that would produce a better output inevitably.\"\nMr Sharp also told the committee he would give his \u00a3160,000 salary as BBC chairman to charity. \nWhen asked \"what's in it for you?\" Mr Sharp, whose heritage is Jewish, said: \"We're all a product of our upbringing and I was very fortunate with the parents I have, my great grandparents came to this country escaping tyranny.\n\"I think I won the lottery in life to be British and if I can make a contribution, I couldn't be happier to.\n\"The BBC is part of the fabric of all our national identities, it offers education and enrichment and is also important for our position in the world...

It is a very difficult circumstance,\" he said.\n\"We are trying to do the best and what is right for as many pupils as possible in looking at various permutations and combinations of criteria\". \nEducation Minister Peter Weir said it was \"a very disappointing day\" for many families.\n\"The transfer test, while it has never been about being compulsory for either a school or indeed an individual parent, does enable a level of parental choice and that has been dramatically reduced as a result of that,\" he told Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"But sadly what we have seen is for this year, the pandemic has prevented those transfer tests taking place, and I am very disappointed and entirely understand the disappointment and frustration of many families today.\"\nMr Weir said there had been \"a lack of consistency\" from AQE.\n\"I don't think the way things have worked out from AQE's point of view, particularly over the last couple of weeks, have been particularly helpful,\" he said.\nThe minister also apologised for \"clumsy language\" in a statement he issued on Wednesday night.\nWriting on Twitter about the cancellation of the transfer test, Mr Weir said: \"This severely limits parental choice and children's opportunities.\"\n\"There was no adverse intention towards non-selective schools,\" he said in relation to his tweet.\n\"I think both selective and non-selective schools have got excellent records in Northern Ireland.\"\n\"But once the opportunities for entry to any school is reduced then that is a reduction in opportunities for all.\"\nUUP MLA Robbie Butler has proposed that pupils' results in tests in primary schools could be given to parents and then used by grammar schools to decide which children get a place.\nMr Butler said that he had some favourable responses from some grammars and some primary schools to that proposal.\n\"Whilst I don't think my solution is absolutely perfect I do believe it to be absolutely fair and absolutely compassionate,\" he told MLAs on the committee.\n\"We have the genesis of a solution for these P7 pupils.\"\nBut, speaking on Wednesday, Mr Weir replied that there were issues with that approach.\n\"There are very major problems, I'm being honest with you, in terms of the models that have been put forward for academic selection without the test,\" he said.\nThe minister said it would be difficult to get comparable information for pupils across all primaries.\n\"While it's not entirely ruling out those and there is the option for schools to do it, it does leave them in a very difficult position making comparability between pupils on a fair basis,\" he said"

      "text": "Nearly 46% of over-80s in England's North East and Yorkshire region have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine - more than any other area, official figures show.\nThis compares with about 30% of over-80s in both London and the East of England who have received a first jab.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan claims the capital is not getting its fair share of vaccine doses.\nIn total, more than 2.2 million people in England have had one vaccine dose.\nAbout 400,000 second doses have also been administered, despite guidance from the UK's chief medical officers and vaccine advisers, the JCVI, that giving a first dose to as many people as possible was a public health priority.\nThe NHS England figures cover Covid-19 vaccinations given to people at hospital hubs and GP practices between 8 December 2020 and 10 January 2021.\nAmong the over-80s alone, most first doses - 204,140 - were administered in north-east England and Yorkshire, while the lowest number (92,398) were given to this age group in London.\nOverall, more than one-third of people aged 80 and over in England have received at least one dose.\nThe figures show that in the Midlands more vaccine doses had been administered to all people in the top priority groups - 387,647 - than in any other area of England. In London, a total of 199,986 first doses were given and in the East the figure was 186,291. \nThese include care home residents, frontline heath and care staff, the over-80s and people who are clinically extremely vulnerable, who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill and dying from the Covid-19.\nThe percentage of the whole population to have received a first dose so far ranged from 4.3% in the north-east and Yorkshire to 2.2% in London. \nMr Khan said he was \"hugely concerned\" that Londoners had received only one-tenth of the vaccines that had been given across the country.\n\"The situation in London is critical with rates of the virus extremely high, which is why it's so important that vulnerable Londoners are given access to the vaccine as soon as possible,\" he said.\nHe said he would hold talks with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi to ensure more vaccines were delivered to reflect the level of need in the city.\nLondon has a younger average population than other parts of England and the smallest number of people aged over 80 compared with other regions.\nDr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said vaccinating over a third of all over-80s was \"a great achievement\".\nBut she said people must continue to follow the guidance that is in place to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n\"These data will help us to evaluate the protection from the vaccine and to effectively target the roll-out of the programme to help control the virus and save lives,\" she added."

      "text": "US Republicans in Congress are deeply divided after 10 members split with their party to impeach President Donald Trump on Wednesday. \nCongresswoman Liz Cheney, the third ranking House Republican, is facing calls to resign her party leadership role after her vote to impeach.\nThe lawmakers who voted against Mr Trump face threats of violence, and have increased security, they say.\nIt comes as Mr Trump prepares to leave office and faces a trial in the Senate.\nThe House of Representatives voted by 232 votes to 197 on Wednesday to impeach him for allegedly inciting rioters who stormed the Capitol last week. \nThe FBI has warned of possible armed protests planned for Washington DC and all 50 US state capitals in the run-up to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday.\nMs Cheney, a Wyoming congresswoman whose father was vice-president to Republican George W Bush, faced immediate calls to resign after voting to impeach Mr Trump for inciting insurrection against the US government.\n\"I'm not going anywhere. This is a vote of conscience,\" said Ms Cheney, after Mr Trump's conservative defenders in Congress called for her to quit. \n\"It's one where there are different views in our conference. But our nation is facing an unprecedented, since the Civil War, constitutional crisis,\" she told reporters on Wednesday, as Trump was impeached for a historic second time.\nAnother Republican has said he and several colleagues have purchased body armour and have been forced to change their normal routines after receiving threats of violence.\n\"It's sad that we have to get to that point, but you know our expectation is that someone may try to kill us,\" Michigan Republican Peter Meijer told MSNBC on Thursday.\n\"We don't know what's going to happen next. We weren't expecting for the Capitol to get overrun for the first time in 200 years,\" he said. \n\"And so in this unprecedented environment with an unprecedented degree of fear, of divisiveness and hatred, we have to account for every scenario.\" \nFor two hours, members of the Democratic-controlled House made statements for and against the vote on impeachment while National Guard troops kept watch inside and outside the Capitol. \nMost Republicans did not seek to defend Mr Trump, but instead argued that the impeachment had bypassed the customary hearings and called on Democrats to drop it for the sake of national unity.\n\"Impeaching the president in such a short time frame would be a mistake,\" said Kevin McCarthy, the House's top Republican. \"That doesn't mean the president's free from fault. The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters.\"\nImpeachment charges are political, not criminal. The president was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House.\nHe urged them to \"peacefully and patriotically\" make their voices heard, but also to \"fight like hell\" against an election that he falsely told them had been stolen.\nFollowing Mr Trump's remarks, his supporters broke into the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to suspend certification of election results and take shelter while the building was placed on lockdown.\nThe article of impeachment states that Mr Trump \"repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were fraudulent and should not be accepted\".\nIt says he then repeated these claims and \"wilfully made statements to the crowd that encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol\", leading to violence and loss of life.\nThe Senate - the upper house of the US Congress - will hold a trial to determine the president's guilt but this will not happen during Mr Trump's remaining week in office. \nRepublican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said there was \"simply no chance that a fair or serious trial\" could conclude in time given \"the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents\" that govern trials involving presidents.\nA two-thirds majority will be needed to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote with Democrats in the evenly split, 100-seat chamber.\nAs many as 20 Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. In a note to colleagues, Mr McConnell said he had not made a final decision on how he would vote.\nIf Mr Trump is convicted, senators could then hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again, which he had indicated he planned to do in 2024.\nThe first impeachment of Mr Trump was in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. He was acquitted by the Senate."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "text": "Donald Trump has become the first president in US history to be impeached twice, after being charged with \"incitement of insurrection\" over last week's deadly storming of Congress.\nThe House of Representatives accused Mr Trump of encouraging violence with his false claims of election fraud.\nHe now faces trial in the upper chamber, the Senate, but not before he leaves office next Wednesday.\nSenators can vote to bar him from ever holding public office again.\nIn a video released after the vote in the House on Wednesday, Mr Trump called on his followers to remain peaceful, without mentioning his impeachment.\n\"Violence and vandalism have no place in our country... No true supporter of mine would ever endorse political violence,\" he said, striking a sombre and conciliatory tone.\nThe FBI has warned of possible armed protests planned for Washington DC and all 50 US state capitals in the days before Joe Biden, a Democrat, is inaugurated as the new US president.\nImpeachment charges are political, not criminal. The president was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House.\nHe urged them to \"peacefully and patriotically\" make their voices heard, but also to \"fight like hell\" against an election that he falsely told them had been stolen.\nFollowing Mr Trump's remarks, his supporters broke into the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to suspend certification of election results and take shelter. The building was placed on lockdown and five people died in the melee.\nThe article of impeachment stated that Mr Trump \"repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were fraudulent and should not be accepted\".\nIt says he then repeated these claims and \"wilfully made statements to the crowd that encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol\", leading to the violence and loss of life.\n\"President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government, threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperilled a coequal branch of government.\"\nLast week, 139 Republicans voted against accepting the result of the 2020 election and Mr Trump's defeat.\nFor two hours on Wednesday, members of the Democratic-controlled House made statements for and against the vote in the same chamber where they hid under chairs and donned gas masks as rioters tried to force their way inside last week.\nNational Guard troops kept watch inside and outside the Capitol. Ten of Mr Trump's Republican party joined Democrats to impeach him by 232-197.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said on the House floor: \"The president of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country. He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\"\nDemocratic congressman Julian Castro called Mr Trump \"the most dangerous man to ever occupy the Oval Office\".\nMost Republicans did not seek to defend Mr Trump's rhetoric, instead arguing that the impeachment had bypassed the customary hearings and calling on Democrats to drop it for the sake of national unity.\n\"Impeaching the president in such a short time frame would be a mistake,\" said Kevin McCarthy, the House's top Republican. \"That doesn't mean the president's free from fault. The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters.\"\nJim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, accused Democrats of recklessly dividing the country to pursue a political vendetta. \"This is about getting the president of the United States. It's always been about getting the president, no matter what. It's an obsession.\"\nAmong members of the president's party who voted to impeach him was the third-ranking House Republican, Liz Cheney. The Wyoming representative, the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, said of the riot that \"there has never been a greater betrayal by a president\".\nDonald Trump has made history once again, this time as the first president to be impeached twice.\nA year ago, the move was opposed in lockstep by the Republican Party. This time, a handful of conservatives backed the move. It is a reflection not only of the gravity of the moment, but also the president's declining influence in the final days of his administration.\nImpeachment sets up a Senate trial for Mr Trump that now appears destined to stretch into the early days of Joe Biden's presidency, creating yet another challenge for the incoming president. It also will stoke an ongoing debate among Republicans over the direction their party takes in the days ahead.\nThe party is on a path that splits in two very different directions. On one side is continued allegiance to the president's brand of politics - one that created a new coalition of voters that delivered the White House and Congress in 2016, but lost both in 2020.\nOn the other is an uncertain future - but one free from the president's unique style of heat and rhetoric - unfiltered invective that even many Republicans now believe contributed to last week's Capitol riot\nRead more from Anthony\nThe impeachment article will head to the Senate, which will hold a trial to determine the president's guilt. A two-thirds majority is needed to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote with Democrats in the evenly split, 100-seat chamber. \nAs many as 20 Senate Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.\nIf Mr Trump is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers could hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he has indicated he planned to do in 2024.\nBut the trial will not come during Mr Trump's remaining week in office.\nRepublican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement: \"Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week.\"\nHe said it would best serve the interests of the nation if Congress focused on a safe and orderly transition of power for the incoming Biden administration. In a note to colleagues, Mr McConnell also said he had not made a final decision on how he would vote.\nMindful that his first days in office could become mired in the impeachment drama, Mr Biden said he hoped senators would not neglect the \"other urgent business of this nation\", such as approving his cabinet nominees, coronavirus relief and the nationwide vaccination programme. \nHowever, a Republican congresswoman, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced she would file articles of impeachment against Mr Biden, accusing him of abuse of power, the day after his inauguration.\nNo US president has ever been removed from office through impeachment. Mr Trump was impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings in Ukraine, but acquitted by the Senate. So was Bill Clinton in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The coronavirus growth rate is slowing in the UK and the number of infections is starting to level off in some areas, a top scientist has said.\nProf Neil Ferguson told the BBC that in some NHS regions there is a \"sign of plateauing\" in cases and hospital admissions.\nBut he warned the overall death toll would exceed 100,000.\nOn Wednesday, the UK saw its biggest daily death figure since the start of the pandemic, with 1,564 deaths.\nIt has taken the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. There were also 47,525 new cases.\nIt comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the national lockdown measures were \"starting to show signs of some effect\", but it was early days and urged people to abide by the rules.\nPeople in England are required to stay at home and only go out for limited reasons, such as for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home.\nSimilar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nProf Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London whose modelling led to the first lockdown in March, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was \"much too early\" to say when the number of cases would come down.\nBut he said: \"It looks like in London in particular and a couple of other regions in the South East and East of England, hospital admissions may even have plateaued.\n\"It has to be said this is not seen everywhere - both case numbers and hospital admissions are going up in many other areas, but overall at a national level we are seeing the rate of growth slow.\"\nProf Ferguson added: \"I would hope the hospital admissions might plateau\u2026 sometime in the next week, but hospital bed occupancy may continue to rise slowly for up to two weeks.\"\nHe warned the overall death toll would be \"well over 100,000\", adding \"there's nothing we can do about that now\".\nProf Ferguson added Covid restrictions could be in place for many months to come, adding the new variant's increased transmissibility would mean relaxation of the rules will be a \"gradual process to the autumn\".\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said on Thursday that the government will not be introducing tougher social distancing rules \"today or tomorrow\" and insisted that ministers are focusing on increasing enforcement of the current restrictions.\nAsked about speculation further measures could include a three-metre social distancing rule or a requirement to wear masks outside, she told ITV's This Morning: \"This isn't about new rules coming in - we're going to stick with enforcing the current measures.\"\nMeanwhile, a major study led by Public Health England has shown most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months.\nPast infection was linked to an 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found.\nProf Susan Hopkins, who led the study, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the finding \"doesn't eliminate\" the risk of people catching Covid-19 again, and infecting others.\nShe said: \"We found people with very high amounts of virus in their nose and throat swabs, that would easily be in the range which would cause levels of transmission to other individuals.\"\nProf Hopkins said she hoped that after Easter, \"we will start to see reduced infection rates, as we did at that time last year\" and the number of people who have been vaccinated at a \"very high level\".\nThe UK is continuing efforts to ramp up the rollout of the Covid vaccine, with the prime minister saying that Covid vaccinations will be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week as soon as supply allows.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted on Thursday to say that \"three million vaccines have now been administered\" in the UK.\nOn Thursday, NHS England published a breakdown of vaccinations by age and region for the first time. \nMr Johnson told the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday that he was \"concerned\" about a new Covid variant that is believed to have emerged in Brazil and said that the UK was taking steps to ensure it is not brought into the UK.\nA Downing Street spokesman said ministers met this morning to discuss \"urgent measures to reduce the potential spread to the UK of the Brazilian variant\". \nThey could include a ban on flights from Brazil. Arrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days.\nMeanwhile, the Deputy Scottish First Minister John Swinney told BBC Breakfast \"the virus is not accelerating as fast as it was\" in Scotland.\nHe said \"there are some early signs of optimism\" but emphasised people should follow all guidance as the \"virus is still at a very strong level\".\nIn other developments:"

      "text": "Changes to Scotland's lockdown restrictions have been announced. The tightening of the rules follows concerns the \"stay at home\" message is not having the same impact it did during last year's lockdown. The changes will come into effect on Saturday.\nThe availability and operation of click and collect services will be limited to retailers selling essential items such as clothes, footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books. Also, outlets that sell electrical goods; do key cutting; undertake shoe repairs, plus garden centres and plant nurseries can continue the collect service. \nFor qualifying businesses, staggered appointments will need to be offered to avoid any potential for queuing, and access inside premises for collection will not be permitted.\nCustomers in Scotland will no longer be allowed to go inside to collect takeaway food or coffee. Businesses will have to operate from a serving hatch or doorway.\nThe aim is to reduce the risk of customers coming into contact indoors with each other, or with staff.\nIt will be against the law in all level four areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in public.\nThis will mean that buying a takeaway pint and consuming on the street will not be permitted. \nIt is intended to underline the message that people should only be leaving home for essential purposes. \nThe Scottish government is strengthening the obligation on employers to allow their staff to work from home whenever possible.\nThe law already says that people should only be leaving home to go to work if it is work that cannot be done from home. This is a legal obligation that falls on individuals.\nHowever, statutory guidance is being introduced to make clear that employers should support employees to work from home wherever possible.\nThe Scottish government is strengthening provisions in relation to work inside people's houses.\nCurrent guidance says that in level four areas work is only permitted within a private dwelling if it is essential for the upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household.  This guidance is now being put into law.\nThe final change is an amendment to the regulations requiring people to stay at home.\nThis is intended to close an apparent loophole rather than change the spirit of the law. It will also bring the wording of the stay at home regulations in Scotland into line with the other UK nations.\nCurrently the law states that people can only leave home for an essential purpose.\nThe amendment will make it clear that people \"must not leave or remain outside\" the home unless it is for an essential purpose.\nThe Scottish government's full lockdown guidance is available here."

      "text": "Marcus Rashford and a group of celebrity chefs and campaigners have called on Boris Johnson to review the government's free school meals policy.\nThe group, including Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Tom Kerridge, have written to the PM asking him to \"fix\" the system long-term.\nThey called for a strategy to help \"end child food poverty\" before the summer holidays.\nNo 10 said \"no child will ever go hungry\" because of the Covid pandemic. \nThe call for a wide review comes after another row over free school meals during February half-term.\nThe government has said food will be provided to children by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme while schools are closed for the holiday.\nCouncils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the Local Government Association's Councillor Richard Watts telling BBC Radio 4's PM programme the grant had already been allocated for other support. \nBut Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are down to semantics whether it is the school delivering the meal or whether it is the local authority - fortunately there is quite a lot of different support available.\"\nAs well as getting the backing of Rashford - who has led campaigns around child poverty over the course of the pandemic - the letter has been signed by chefs Oliver, Kerridge and Fearnley-Whittingstall, along with actor Dame Emma Thompson and over 40 charities and education leaders.\nOrganised by the Food Foundation charity, the letter said it was time to \"step back and review the policy in more depth\".\nThey called for an \"urgent comprehensive review into free school meal policy across the UK\" to feed into the government's next Spending Review, saying it should look at:\nThe signatories praised the Department for Education's \"swift response\" to reports earlier this week of inadequate food parcels sent to families, saying the \"robustness of the message from you and the secretary of state on this issue was very welcome\".\nBut, they added that \"following the series of problems which have arisen over school food vouchers, holiday provision and food parcels since the start of the pandemic\", now was the time for a review. \nAnna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation charity, said the last few months had seen \"crisis after crisis with the provision of free school meals\". \n\"The result of that is disadvantaged children have often paid the price,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \n\"Our view is that really unless we do a root and branch review these problems are going to still keep appearing.\"\nChef Fearnley-Whittingstall also called for a more consistent, long-term response to the issue of food poverty. \n\"We need to get out of this fire-fighting, highly reactive series of actions by the government,\" he told the same programme. \nThe signatories want a review to be published and debated in Parliament before the 2021 summer holidays. \n\"We are ready and willing to support your government in whatever way we can to make this review a reality and to help develop a set of recommendations that everyone can support,\" the letter said.\n\"School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of our most disadvantaged children. \n\"Now, at a time when children have missed months of in-school learning and the pandemic has reminded us of the importance of our health, this is a vital next step.\"\nAnti-poverty campaigner and food writer Jack Monroe welcomed the letter to the PM, but told the BBC: \"We need to be feeding children right now.\"\nShe added: \"While it is great to be looking longer term... having an underpinning strategy that means that children aren't put into poverty in the first place, we need to also immediately be putting resources in to ensure people aren't going hungry, today, tonight, next week and in the February half-term. \n\"This isn't a rhetorical thing. It isn't a dinner party discussion. We need to be doing this now.\"\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: \"It is great that celebrities and groups across society see the importance of school food. The PM thanks Marcus Rashford for his letter and will reply soon. \n\"School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of the most disadvantaged pupils. The prime minister has been clear that no child will ever go hungry as a result of the pandemic\"."

      "text": "Tesco says it has seen some disruption to food supplies in Northern Ireland since trading arrangements with the EU changed on 1 January. \n\"We see this as a challenge at the moment, but not a crisis,\" boss Ken Murphy said.\nBut he said the retailer was working closely with government on both sides of the Irish Sea to \"smooth the flow\". \nSince 31 December, Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that has stayed in the EU's single market for goods.\nMr Murphy said certain foodstuffs had faced supply chain disruption going into both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \n\"Ready meals have been the most affected as they have an eight-day shelf life so any wait is more likely to have an impact,\" he said.\n\"Some processed meat and some citrus fruit has also been impacted, but it is important to stress that our availability in the Republic and Northern Ireland is strong and is very strong in the mainland UK.\nLast week, all the major grocers wrote to Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove asking him to take urgent action. \nBut Tesco said its \"comprehensive preparations and... strong relationships with suppliers\" had allowed it to maintain strong levels of availability during the Brexit transition period.\nMr Murphy said he was confident Tesco would have the right measures in place to supply Northern Ireland after end of a three month grace period on certain rules and regulations with the EU on 31 March.\nHe also said there had also been \"teething problems\" with supply flows from continental Europe to Great Britain.\n\"Inevitably there are bedding-in issues, teething issues, that you would expect with any new process that's been set up at relatively short notice,\" he said.\n\"We're working our way through those and we would hope over the coming weeks and months that we will end up with a much smoother flow of product.\"\nUnder new trading arrangements, food products entering Northern Ireland from Britain need to be professionally certified and are subject to new checks and controls at ports.\nA three month \"grace period\" means that supermarkets currently don't need to comply with all the EU's usual certification requirements until 1 April - but there has still been disruption. \nM&S has temporarily reduced its range of food products and Sainsbury's has been sourcing Spar-branded products from an NI wholesaler.\nThis week the bosses of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Iceland, Co-Op and Marks & Spencer warned that trade into Northern Ireland would become \"unworkable\" if further new certification requirements were introduced in April .\nThe government said a new dedicated team has already been set up and will be working with supermarkets, the food industry and the Northern Ireland Executive to develop ways to streamline the movement of goods.\nTesco's comments came as the supermarket giant reported record sales for the Christmas period after customers looked to \"treat themselves\" amid tough Covid restrictions across most of the UK.\nUK like-for-like sales were up 8.1% in the six weeks to 9 January, as the supermarket saw a surge in demand for goods in its Tesco Finest range. \nBig grocers have benefited at a time when most non-essential shops and restaurants are closed, prompting consumers to spend more on their weekly shop. But they have faced criticism too. \nLast month, Tesco said it would repay \u00a3585m of business rates relief after it was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders during the crisis. Most big grocers followed suit. \nTesco was later criticised for keeping its shops open on Boxing Day despite union calls to give staff the day off.\nIn its results the grocer said it had given all frontline staff a 10% bonus over Christmas. It also said it had shielded vulnerable staff and taken on nearly 35,000 additional temporary staff for the season."

      "text": "Travel from Brazil to the UK could be banned in response to the discovery of a new coronavirus variant.\nMinisters have met to discuss possible measures and a block on flights could also be extended to other South American countries in a bid to stop its spread.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is \"concerned\" about the new variant and \"extra measures\" were being taken.\nArrivals from Brazil are currently required to self-isolate for 10 days.\nCabinet Office minister Michael Gove chaired a meeting earlier to discuss whether measures should be put in place.\nNew variants of Covid-19 have also been identified in the UK and South Africa.\nDuring a two-hour appearance in front of the Commons Home Affairs Committee on Wednesday Mr Johnson stopped short of promising a ban on travel from Brazil.\n\"We already have tough measures ... to protect this country from new infections coming in from abroad,\" he said.\n\"We are taking steps to do that in respect of the Brazilian variant.\"\nProf Susan Hopkins, who is Strategic Response Director for Covid-19 with Public Health England, told BBC Breakfast experts were looking at the Brazilian variant and needed to grow the virus in the UK in order to perform laboratory experiments.\n\"So we need to understand the biology of these [new strains], as well as understanding mutations,\" she said.\n\"We will be watching them all to make sure that they can't escape your immune response, which is the key thing that we're looking at the moment.\"\nA travel ban was put in place on arrivals from South Africa on 24 December, which was later extended to several other nearby countries, following the discovery of a new variant.\nLuiz Amorim, a graphic designer in London, said he had travelled to Brazil to spend Christmas with his family and was now worried he may not be able to get home.\n\"My wife was also supposed to come but didn't in the end,\" he said. \"Now I am worried I won't be able to get back to her in London.\"\nMr Amorim said his workplace had been supportive but he may have to take leave if he was unable to return, with his original flight back having been cancelled.\nHe has now booked another flight on 27 January and is \"watching the news closely to see what will happen\".\nThe discussion comes after it was announced a requirement for arrivals into England to test negative for coronavirus 72 hours before their journey will now come into force at 04:00 GMT on Monday.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the new rules had been delayed from Friday \"to give international arrivals time to prepare\".\nLabour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, described the delay in introducing the new rules as \"truly shocking\".\nScotland is taking the same approach to international travellers but will implement the policy on Friday, while Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own plans in the coming days.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the government for delaying pre-departure testing for arrivals to England, describing the situation as a \"complete mess\".\n\"Priti Patel has talked tough about the borders but other countries have been doing testing for months and months,\" he said.\nSir Keir said people were \"really worried\" about strains in other parts of the world, including Brazil, and people would be \"bewildered and they will feel that we're exposed\"."

      "title": "Covid immunity: Can you catch it twice?",
      "tags": "Medical research,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "Coronavirus is a completely new infection in people. \nNobody had immunity at the start of the pandemic - and knowing more about immunity is crucial for understanding what happens next.\nOur immune system is the body's defence against infection and it comes in two parts.\nThe first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. It is known as the innate immune response and includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells. \nBut this system is not specific to coronavirus. It will not learn and it will not give you immunity to the coronavirus. \nInstead you need the adaptive immune response. This includes cells that produce targeted antibodies that can stick to the virus in order to stop it - and T cells that can attack just the cells infected with the virus, called the cellular response. \nThis takes time - studies suggest it takes about 10 days to start making antibodies that can target the coronavirus and the sickest patients develop the strongest immune response. \nIf the adaptive immune response is powerful enough, it could leave a lasting memory of the infection that will give protection in the future. \nIt's not known if people who have only mild symptoms, or none at all, will develop a sufficient adaptive immune response.\nUnderstanding of the role of T-cells is still developing, but a recent study found people testing negative for coronavirus antibodies may still have some immunity.\nFor every person testing positive for antibodies, it was found two had T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells.\n\"They look rather durable and are being made in almost all exposed people,\" said Prof Danny Altmann from Imperial College London.\nThe immune system's memory is rather like our own - it remembers some infections clearly, but has a habit of forgetting others. \nMeasles is highly memorable - one bout should give lifelong immunity (as the weakened version in the MMR vaccine does). However, there are many others that are pretty forgettable. Children can get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter.\nThe new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts.\nBut a recent study led by Public Health England (PHE) shows most people who have had the virus are protected from catching it again for at least five months (the duration of the analysis so far). \nSome are reinfected, however, and, even if asymptomatic, can then harbour high levels of the virus in their noses and mouths, which can be passed on to others. \nPHE will continue to monitor the people in this study, who are all healthcare workers, to see how long immunity lasts. \nOther clues may come from studies involving other coronaviruses. \nFour produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. Studies showed some patients could be re-infected within a year.\nResearch at King's College London also suggested levels of antibodies that kill coronavirus waned over the three month study.\nBut even if antibodies disappear, then the cells that manufacture them, called B cells, may still be around. B cells for Spanish Flu have been found in people 90 years after that pandemic.\nIf the same is true with Covid, then a second infection would be milder than the first. \nIt is also not understood what happens to T cells in the long term. But T cells against the original Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) have been found 17 years later.\nMaybe.\nThe jury is still out on the field of \"cross-reactivity\" but there may be some infections that look similar enough to the virus that causes Covid that people may gain some protection.\nLaboratory tests show the T cells some people made to fight Sars or common cold coronaviruses can also react against the new coronavirus. \nHow common this is and how much protection it gives is still unknown.\nThere were early reports of people appearing to have multiple coronavirus infections in a short space of time. \nBut the scientific consensus is that testing was the issue, with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus. \nPHE's ongoing study on immunity in healthcare workers found 44 potential re-infections in a group of 6,614 people who had previously had the virus. \nResearchers conclude reinfection is uncommon but still possible and say people must continue to follow current guidance, whether they have had antibodies or not. \nScientists from Hong Kong recently reported on the case of a young, healthy man who recovered from a bout of Covid-19 only to be re-infected more than four months later. Using genome sequencing of the virus, they could prove he caught it twice because the virus strains were different.\nExperts say re-infection isn't surprising, but it's likely to be rare, and larger studies are needed to understand why this might happen.\nThis is not guaranteed and that is why the World Health Organization is nervous about countries using immunity passports as a way out of lockdown.\nThe idea is if you pass the antibody test then you are safe to go back to work. This would be particularly valuable for staff in care homes or hospitals who come into contact with those at risk of developing severe symptoms. \nBut while you will find some antibodies in nearly every patient, not all are equal. Neutralising antibodies are the ones that stick to the coronavirus and are able to stop it infecting other cells. A study of 175 recovered patients in China showed 30% had very low levels of these neutralising antibodies. \nThat is why the World Health Organization says \"that cellular immunity [the other part of the adaptive response] may also be critical for recovery\".\nAnother issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn't mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others. \nEveryone's immune system is unique - some may mount more successful defensive responses than others.\nAnd people must continue to follow the current guidance as some may become reinfected and pass the virus on to others, PHE says.\nPeople who have already had Covid-19 should still have a vaccine when offered one, officials say. \nDr Julian Tang, at the University of Leicester, says:\"Having the vaccine after recovering from Covid-19 is not an issue... and will likely boost the natural immunity.\n\"We also see this with the seasonal flu vaccine.\"\nPHE scientists will also monitor the immunity of the participants in its Siren study who go on to have vaccines. \nIt matters for obvious personal health reasons and whether you will get Covid-19 multiple times and how often.\nImmunity will also affect how deadly the virus is. If people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous.\nUnderstanding immunity better could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus.\nIf it is very difficult to produce long-term immunity, then it could make a vaccine harder to develop. Or it may change how the vaccine needs to be used - will it be a once a lifetime or once a year like the flu shot.\nAnd the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading. \nThese are all big questions we still lack answers to.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Care homes,NHS,Netley,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Despite the huge need to free up space in hospitals, some care homes say insurance issues make it impossible for them to accept Covid-19 patients.\nIn October, the government launched a scheme for designated care homes to take patients recovering from the virus but insurance is a stumbling block.\nSir David Behan, head of the UK's largest care home company, HC-One, says insurance has become a major concern.\nThe government says it is working to resolve the issue. \n\"We are aware the adult social care insurance market is changing in response to the pandemic, and recognise some care providers may encounter difficulties as their policies come up for renewal,\" said a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson. \nOne Hampshire care home says it will have to stop taking patients within days because its insurance will expire.  \nWaterside House in Netley, Hampshire usually provides holidays and respite care for people with disabilities. \nBut since the autumn it has been taking Covid-positive patients discharged from hospitals on the south coast. \nThey are looked after on a separate floor from other residents, and the home has had to meet high infection control standards. \nHome manager Sarah Knight said demand for the 31 beds is unparalleled and added: \"I've been in nursing a long, long time, and I have never known anything like this. \n\"People end up in an ambulance sat outside hospitals for hours and hours, or they end up on a trolley in A&E in a corridor for hours and hours. \n\"By offering the best that we've got here, we can reduce some of that burden.\"\nThe government originally hoped there would be 500 designated care homes taking in Covid-positive patients. \nBut Waterside House is one of only 129 which have been set up to take those who have not completed 14 days in isolation. \nHowever, its public indemnity insurance protection, which it needs in case someone contracts Covid there, runs out at the end of January. \nWaterside House is run by the charity Revitalise, whose chief executive, Jan Tregelles, said they have tried everything, but will soon have to start turning away people. \n\"It's shocking,\" she says. \"We are truly helpless. We have a fantastic team of nurses and colleagues already. \n\"The facilities are here, everything's arranged and we can't step up to support our communities at this time.\"\nOne resident, Alan Washbourne, who has been living at Waterside House since he was discharged from hospital during the first wave of the pandemic, said: \"I feel quite safe here.\" \nHe is not on the Covid floor of the home, and added: \"If I were to go to somewhere else, which is possible, I might not feel quite so safe.\"\nAfter so many deaths last spring, many care homes  will not consider taking patients who are Covid-positive, even with extra infection control measures. \nMeanwhile, growing numbers of staff are off sick or self-isolating, leaving care homes facing shortages. \nAnd many are also finding it difficult to get the public indemnity insurance. \nSince November, HC-One, which is the UK's largest care home provider, has had to cover its own Covid risks because it cannot get the insurance.  \nSir David said it is one of the reasons why they have not taken part in the designated places scheme.  \n\"You've got solicitors' firms advertising, taking cases up against care companies,\" he says. \n\"So, this isn't a theoretical risk that there may be proceedings, it's an actual risk, and therefore we need cover.\n\"The NHS wouldn't operate without similar liability cover and that's what we need to see, and I think governments have a role to play working with the insurance industry to work to find a solution.\" \nThe Department for Health and Social Care said it was making efforts to determine what actions it could take.\n\"Our priority is to ensure everyone receives the right care, in the right place, at the right time,\" said a spokesperson.

      "tags": "Companies",
      "text": "Primark says it has no plans to sell its clothes online despite warning that lockdown store closures could cost it more than \u00a31bn in lost sales. \nSome 305 of Primark's 389 global stores are shut - including all 190 UK outlets - but unlike rivals it has no online arm to fall back on.\nCustomers have said they would welcome the retailer setting up an online shop.\nBut Primark, which saw a 30% sales fall to \u00a32bn in the 16 weeks to 2 January, says the cost would mean price rises. \nIt contrasts with online only fashion retailers such as Asos and Boohoo, whose sales rose by around 40% in the last four months of 2020.\nOn Thursday, consumers called on Primark to embrace e-commerce with one tweeting: \"Online sales are thru the roof during the pandemic. You're missing out on a LOT of money.\"\nBut the retailer tweeted back: \"We prefer to sell our products in our physical stores but thanks for the suggestion.\"\nSince March last year, non-essential shops in the UK and overseas have faced strict curbs and prolonged closures and all are currently shut in England. \nIn a statement, Primark said that if all of its stores stayed closed until 27 February 2021, it expected to miss out on \u00a31.05bn of sales - up from a previous estimate of \u00a3650m. \nThe retailer said it would partially mitigate this by cutting its costs, but did not say if that would mean job losses. It added that it only expected to break even in the first half of the financial year, after seeing healthy operating profits of \u00a3441m last time around. \nIn the past Primark has said it won't sell online because the cost of manning the operation and processing high volumes of returns would mean it could no longer offer low prices.\n\"As a fast fashion retailer they are on a low margins anyway -  they have to be very competitive on price,\" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData told the BBC.\nHe said pure online players like Asos and Boohoo could make it work because they were \"geared up for it in terms of logistics\". \n\"But Primark would be starting from scratch, and would have to integrate any new online operation with its existing store structure which would be costly.\"\nDespite this Mr O'Brien said the retailer was still likely succeed, pointing to the surge in sales it saw when its shops reopened after the first lockdown. \nBut Retail Economics' Richard Lim said Primark was at risk of \"potentially alienating its customers\" who increasingly expect to be able to shop online. \n\"They have very loyal customers who love the brand, but they are crying out to be able to access it online. \n\"The longer they are not online, the more disruptive it is. The more their customers are discovering new brands and ways to shop.\" \nAssociated British Foods also owns food and agriculture businesses. Sales across the group were down 13% in the 16 weeks to 2 January at \u00a34.8bn. \nThere are always winners and losers in retail but this Christmas the picture is more polarised than ever thanks to the effects of the pandemic. Just contrast the fortunes of Primark, which doesn't sell online, with Boohoo and Asos which have both reported soaring growth in sales.\nAll our big supermarkets have now reported bumper Christmas trading, too, which is no real surprise given we can't go out to eat and so many of us are working from home. This growth has also been driven by an extraordinary rise in internet orders. \nWhile Primark is bracing itself to lose \u00a31bn in business as a result of store closures, Tesco says it added \u00a31bn of extra sales online this festive quarter. It's been very tough for many traditional non-food retailers, big and small, who've been unable to make up for all the lost sales from their High Street shops. Looking ahead, the big question is where the online dial will settle when our lives eventually return to normal. "

      "text": "Coach and tour operators have seen an unexpected growth in bookings in the last fortnight.\nIndustry figures call it growing \"vaccine confidence\" about 2021.\nWhilst there is no doubt that the pandemic continues to put huge pressure on lives and the NHS, this is a small amount of sunshine for the travel industry, which has had a tough year. \nTUI, the UK's largest tour operator, says 50% of bookings on their website are currently by over-50s.\nThis was previously a smaller market for them.\nNational Express's coach holiday businesses say bookings made by those 65 and over have increased by 185% in the last fortnight compared to last year. \n\"Since the announcement of the vaccine, it's given our customer base, predominantly those over 65, increased confidence to book and have that summer getaway in 2021\" says Jit Desai, head of holidays and travel at National Express.\n\"We launched the brochure for spring-summer 2021 just this weekend gone, and on Monday we took a week's worth of bookings in a day and that's continued so far,\" says Mr Desai. \"What the vaccine does is give certainty and confidence.\n\"That then allows the customer and ourselves the ability to plan ahead\".\nThe pandemic has been devastating for the travel sector. Tens of thousands of jobs have gone in the UK. Millions of Britons cancelled breaks because the health situation was in flux across the world. \nBut National Express now points to returning confidence to travel.\n\"Many we've spoken to have had the first jab. They know in 12 weeks they'll get a second jab. It gives them certainty that they can enjoy and look forward to their 2021 holiday. It is something to look forward to, to being with people, with friends, like minded and from the same generation.\"\nDawn and Ray - 75 and 78 years old - are from Hampshire and are due to have their first jab soon. They have just booked five UK holidays.\n\"We are raring to go once we've got that vaccine, we are really looking forward to it - both of us. We are going to Wales, Leicestershire, to York where there is a mystery tour - and to the Cotswolds'\", Dawn said. \nFor Dawn and Ray, it's the ease of coach travel that's appealing, as well as the safety. She adds \"they've looked after us so well in the past, the coaches are clean, we'll all wear masks, we all look after each other.\"\nAt the moment, 90% of the bookings with National Expresses coach businesses are UK based, so it looks like another good year for the staycation. \n\"European bookings are lower because of the uncertainty on the continent,\" says Mr Desai. \n\"The UK wins because of the lack of need to quarantine. And uncertainty about the moves other governments might make whilst away also creates fear.\" \nIt's not just UK breaks that are selling. The UK's largest tour operator TUI, famous for its sun-drenched European beach holidays, says there has also been a change in the last fortnight.  \n\"We're seeing a customer base or age group that wasn't booking before, that is starting to book,\" says Andrew Flintham the MD of TUI UK. \"The over 50s, we assume, is on the back to the vaccine news.\"\nWhilst TUI UK boss acknowledges that \"the market is still depressed and it's not where we want it - we are seeing glimmers of hope.\"\nThere are also interesting changes emerging in the types of breaks holidaymakers plan to take and the months they're planning to travel. \n\"People are booking later into the summer, hedging their bets\" said Mr Flintham. \"More July and August and a lot of demand for September and October. \n\"People are booking longer holidays, we're seeing more people booking ten or eleven or 14 nights rather than seven. People are maybe catching up on what they've missed.\"\nAs TUI analysed its recent booking data, one trend they spotted is the emergence of large, multigenerational group bookings. \n\"It is family time we've all missed. We can't get away from our own families, but our broader families we can't see, and that's feeding into our choices\" Mr Flintham explains.  \nAfter such a bad 10 months, and TUI cancelling all holidays until the middle of February at the earliest because of the new lockdown, how does the rest of the summer look?\n\"I think the summer holiday is on\" says Mr Flintham, \"I think we just need time for people to get that confidence, but yes, we think there will be a good summer this summer\".\nFor those who've watched the paralysis brought upon the travel industry since last winter, a morsel of good news about customers booking again is being celebrated.  \n\"This is fantastic news and to be hugely welcomed by an industry  that has been utterly devastated by the pandemic\", says Sophie Griffiths, editor of Travel Trade Gazette. \n\"Ten months into this crisis and the industry has still received zero dedicated support from the government despite being unique as a sector in terms of giving out thousands in refunds while getting next to nothing back in for 2020.\""

      "text": "Pre-departure Covid-19 testing will now be required for everyone travelling to England from 04:00 GMT on Monday.\nThe rules had been due to come into force on Friday, but the government said people needed time \"to prepare\". \nThose arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in. \nAnyone arriving from places not on the UK's travel corridor list must still self-isolate for 10 days.\nThe Scottish government is planning to impose the same rules and has had to defer them coming into effect as a result of changes in England.\n\"This meant Scotland was also obliged to delay implementation as we need sight of their final regulations in order to properly draft and approve the relevant Scottish regulations,\" a spokeswoman said.\nIt is expected the requirement will come into force in Scotland at 04:00 GMT on Monday as well. Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce plans for pre-arrival testing in the coming days.\nAnnouncing the deferral on Twitter, Transport Secretary Mr Shapps said: \"To give international arrivals time to prepare, passengers will be required to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test before departure to England from Monday 18 January at 4am.\"\nHe also reminded travellers to fill out the Passenger Locator Form - used in track and trace - and added that those without proof of a negative test faced a fine of \u00a3500.\nProblems with testing availability and capacity mean some countries will initially be exempt.\nFor instance, the requirement will not apply to travellers from St Lucia, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda until 04:00 GMT on 21 January.\nTravellers from Falkland Islands, Ascension Islands and St Helena are exempted permanently.\nHauliers are exempt to allow the free flow of freight, as are air, international rail and maritime crew.\nThe government has said all forms of PCR test will be accepted, as will other forms of test with \"97% specificity, 80% sensitivity\".\nThe move comes as a further 1,564 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began.\nWednesday's figure brings the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767.\nDr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said there had now been more deaths in the second wave than the first.\nMeanwhile on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"concerned\" about a new coronavirus variant that is believed to have emerged in Brazil. \nHe acknowledged it was not yet clear how effective existing vaccines would be against the latest new variant.\nMr Johnson said the UK was taking steps to make sure it was not brought into the country.\nA government Covid committee is meeting on Thursday to discuss the possibility of stopping flights from Brazil.\nArrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days.\nAre you due to travel back to the UK from Brazil?

      "text": "When a trove of 1,500 artworks hoarded by the son of a Nazi-era art dealer was discovered in 2012, an investigation began to find out how many were looted from Jewish owners.\nEventually only 14 were conclusively identified as looted, and now Germany has declared the last of those works has been returned to the owner's heirs.\nDas Klavierspiel (Playing the Piano) by Carl Spitzweg was owned by music publisher Henri Hinrichsen.\nHe was murdered at Auschwitz in 1942.\nGerman Culture Minister Monika Gr\u00fctters said the return of the work sent an \"important signal\", and that while it could not make up for the deep suffering, it could \"make a contribution to historical justice and fulfil our moral responsibility\". \nThe 19th-Century work by Spitzweg was confiscated by the Nazis in 1939, the same year that Hinrichsen had bought it.\nIt was bought in 1940 by Hildebrand Gurlitt, a Nazi-era dealer who had been given the task by Adolf Hitler of dealing in art seized from Jewish collectors and of buying up so-called \"degenerate art\" removed from museums for a planned F\u00fchrermuseum in the Austrian city of Linz. \nThe money for the Spitzweg work was paid into a blocked account, so Hinrichsen would never have received it.\nIn 2015, the piece was identified as looted, and it was handed over to the auctioneers Christie's on Tuesday, according to the wishes of Hinrichsen's heirs.\nAlthough his collection of 1,500 works, plundered from museums as well as individuals, was initially confiscated after the war by the Allies, Hildebrand Gurlitt eventually managed to get it back.\nGurlitt died in the 1950s and when German authorities approached his widow in 1961 in search of part of his collection, she claimed the works had been destroyed at the end of World War Two by Allied bombing.\nIt was only when tax investigators searched the Munich flat of his son Cornelius Gurlitt in 2012 that they found more than 1,400 of the works. Another 60 pieces were discovered at his Austrian home in Salzburg the following year.\nThe son died in 2014 with questions still hanging over the ownership of the collection - as he was protected by a statute of limitations.\nA court ruled that the works could be bequeathed to the Museum of Fine Arts in the Swiss capital Bern, as Cornelius Gurlitt had requested.\nWhile some of the works were deemed to belong to the family, the German Lost Art Foundation then tried to find out, with the Swiss museum, who were the rightful owners of the rest. \nFourteen pieces have now conclusively identified as belonging to Jewish owners and returned."

      "tags": "Samsung,CES,Mobile phones",
      "text": "Samsung's new flagship Galaxy S smartphone works with its stylus for the first time.\nThe S Pen is an optional add-on for the Galaxy S21 Ultra. But the move will fuel speculation the firm will phase out its separate Note handset range.\nSamsung told the BBC it had yet to make a decision about this.\nThe company's handset sales have declined more quickly than the wider market. One expert said a streamlined line-up might help address this.\n\"There's increasing logic for Samsung to converge the Galaxy S and Note platforms, because there's so little differentiation between the two kinds of devices now,\" said Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy.\n\"That would align them with Apple, which also has one big phone launch event a year. \n\"My concern is that every time Samsung has announced its Note products in the past, it has planted a seed in consumers' minds that the Galaxy S products have become kind of the old ones.\"\nThe benefit of having a stylus is that it is easier to write, draw or annotate notes than using a finger. But to work it requires special hardware under the glass of the phone's display to pass power to the stylus and to track its tip.\nThe Android-based Galaxy S21 Ultra has a 6.8in (17.3cm) display, which is only slightly smaller than the top-end 6.9in Note. \nIn years past, the Note phones were known as \"phablets\", and their size was the other key distinguishing factor with the S range.\nProduct manager Mark Notton said \"we haven't decided\", when asked whether Samsung planned to continue the Note family.\n\"It does not mean that\u00a0Samsung\u00a0is not committed to the Note category, but is expanding the Note experience across device categories,\"  the firm said in a follow-up statement.\n\"We will actively listen to consumers' feedback and reflect it in our continued product innovation.\"\nThe S21 Ultra will start at \u00a31,149 when it goes on sale on 29 January. The S Pen costs an extra \u00a335 on its own, or \u00a385 when bundled with a case that stores it.\nThat puts it in the ballpark of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra's \u00a31,179 starting price, which comes with a stylus that slots into its body.\nThere are also two other lower-cost models in the new range, neither of which works with the S-Pen stylus: the 6.2in S21 and 6.7in S21+.\nAll three models feature a redesigned camera module on their back.\nBut while the two lower-end models have three lenses - ultra-wide, wide and 3x-zoom telephoto - the S21 Ultra adds a further 10x-zoom telephoto lens, letting owners shoot action from even further away.\nThe handsets also benefit from a new Director's View facility. It lets users film video while getting thumbnail previews superimposed on-screen of what it would look like if they switched to another lens.\nAll three phones can film in 8K - double the maximum resolution of the competing iPhone 12 range's native video app.\nOther benefits over Apple's latest phones include:\nHowever, the handsets may be more notable for following Apple in two regards.\nThey have abandoned a slot for a microSD memory card.\nAnd they will be sold without either a charger - a decision over which Samsung had mocked its rival. - or earphones.\n\"We discovered that more and more Galaxy users are reusing accessories they already have,\" the firm said.\nSamsung typically unveils its Galaxy range in late February, but has brought forward this year's launch to coincide with the CES tech show.\n\"Samsung\u00a0needs S21 to be a success given that S20 was launched in the middle of Covid first wave in Europe and didn't gain many fans,\" commented Marta Pinto, from research firm IDC.\nShe added the earlier launch date could help it compete in the \"premium market\" with Apple, whose iPhones were released later than normal last year.\nThe South Korean firm should also benefit from collapsing sales of Huawei's devices in the West, caused by US sanctions that prevent them offering the Google Play store and some of the search giant's other services.\nBut Mr Wood said Samsung was facing growing competition from other Chinese brands including Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo.\n\"Samsung's differentiator is going to be its ability to market its strong brand, and the fact it has a very wide product portfolio,\" he commented.\nSamsung also aims to widen its appeal with two further accessories.\nIt has a new pair of \u00a3219 wireless earbuds that monitor what the user is doing. \nIf they detect the wearer is talking, they automatically turn down the volume of music and amplify the sounds of the nearby environment picked up by their microphones, allowing the owner to have a brief conversation without needing to take them out or manually adjust their settings.\nSamsung also is launching the \u00a330 Galaxy SmartTag - a Bluetooth-enabled tracker that can be attached to belongings or pets. \nIt will allow an app to show their location, so long as the tag is in range of the owner or anyone else's compatible Samsung device.\nThe tracker will compete with similar products from the current market leader Tile. \nApple is widely rumoured to be working on similar devices of its own.

      "tags": "Social media,Xinjiang,YouTube,China,Uighurs",
      "text": "Comedian Nigel Ng has deleted a video and apologised to his fans after featuring a YouTuber who had criticised the Chinese government. \nNigel Ng has three million subscribers on YouTube where he plays the character Uncle Roger and gives a running commentary on Asian recipe videos. \nOn Tuesday, Mr Ng apologised on Chinese social media for including Mike Chen, a popular YouTuber, in one of his videos. \nMr Chen has previously spoken out about the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang.\nMr Ng's decision has led some to accuse him of pandering to China - while also leaving his fans on Chinese social media confused.\nUK viewers may be familiar with his humorous critique of a BBC Good Food recipe for egg-fried rice.\nMr Ng's video, titled \"Uncle Roger reviews ugliest dumpling ever\", was uploaded to YouTube on Monday. However, it was removed just a day later. \nMr Ng, a UK-based Malaysian, then apologised on Chinese social media site Weibo for causing a bad \"social impression\" with the video. \n\"Taking into account the seriousness of the situation and the possible negative effects of the video itself, after discussion, we decided to delete it,\" he wrote. \nHe added that he had not been aware of Mr Chen's \"political thoughts and incorrect comments about China in the past\". \nMr Chen, who is based in the US and posts about food on his YouTube channel Strictly Dumpling, has previously criticised the Chinese government's policies and human rights record.\nIn 2019, he criticised Beijing on Twitter, mentioning the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang and the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. \nHe has also been associated with Falun Gong, a spiritual movement banned by the Chinese government.\nFalun Gong followers say they are a peaceful law-abiding group, following a philosophy and regime of exercises which lead to spiritual enlightenment and improved health. The Chinese government, meanwhile, accuses Falun Gong of being an \"evil cult\". \nOn Tuesday, Mr Chen told the South China Morning Post: \"I hold no animosity towards Nigel for what he did, because it's hard to stand up to the [Chinese Communist Party]'s tactics. I do hope that he learns more about the human rights abuses that the CCP has committed because he lives in a free country where he can do that.\"\n\"I have always said that I love China, and I love the kind-hearted Chinese people. They are my people. The CCP, however, is not China and certainly should not be equated to the Chinese people,\" he added. \nThe apology and deletion of the video has caused some people to accuse Mr Ng of self-censoring for the sake of Chinese fans. One person on Twitter wrote: \"Taste of RMB is much better than MSG. Isn't that right Uncle Roger\", referring to the Chinese currency and a flavour enhancer commonly added to some Asian foods.\nMeanwhile, on Weibo, many people appeared unclear as to what exactly had happened. \nOne user commented: \"Uncle Roger's political sensitivity is so high, we still don't know what happened.\"\nMany Western companies have backtracked and issued apologies in the past, after their products or campaigns angered Chinese social media users and sparked a backlash.\nFor example, in 2019 Versace was forced to apologise after one of its T-shirts did not specify that Hong Kong and Macau were part of China, while Dolce & Gabbana faced calls for a boycott in 2018 after one of its campaigns was accused of \"trivialising China's centuries-old culture\".\nHowever, it appears Mr Ng's video was deleted very quickly - and before any significant backlash emerged on Chinese social media at all. \nObservers have long argued that artists and companies have begun self-censoring in order to attract Chinese audiences. \nLast year, a report by free speech charity PEN America claimed that Hollywood bosses had been censoring films to avoid losing access to China's lucrative box office market.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The coronavirus growth rate is slowing in the UK and the number of infections is starting to level off in some areas, a top scientist has said.\nProf Neil Ferguson told the BBC that in some NHS regions there is a \"sign of plateauing\" in cases and hospital admissions.\nBut he warned the overall death toll would exceed 100,000.\nOn Wednesday, the UK saw its biggest daily death figure since the start of the pandemic, with 1,564 deaths.\nIt has taken the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. There were also 47,525 new cases.\nIt comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the national lockdown measures were \"starting to show signs of some effect\", but it was early days and urged people to abide by the rules.\nPeople in England are required to stay at home and only go out for limited reasons, such as for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home.\nSimilar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nProf Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London whose modelling led to the first lockdown in March, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was \"much too early\" to say when the number of cases would come down.\nBut he said: \"It looks like in London in particular and a couple of other regions in the South East and East of England, hospital admissions may even have plateaued.\n\"It has to be said this is not seen everywhere - both case numbers and hospital admissions are going up in many other areas, but overall at a national level we are seeing the rate of growth slow.\"\nProf Ferguson added: \"I would hope the hospital admissions might plateau\u2026 sometime in the next week, but hospital bed occupancy may continue to rise slowly for up to two weeks.\"\nHe warned the overall death toll would be \"well over 100,000\", adding \"there's nothing we can do about that now\".\nProf Ferguson added Covid restrictions could be in place for many months to come, adding the new variant's increased transmissibility would mean relaxation of the rules will be a \"gradual process to the autumn\".\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said on Thursday that the government will not be introducing tougher social distancing rules \"today or tomorrow\" and insisted that ministers are focusing on increasing enforcement of the current restrictions.\nAsked about speculation further measures could include a three-metre social distancing rule or a requirement to wear masks outside, she told ITV's This Morning: \"This isn't about new rules coming in - we're going to stick with enforcing the current measures.\"\nMeanwhile, a major study led by Public Health England has shown most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months.\nPast infection was linked to an 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found.\nProf Susan Hopkins, who led the study, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the finding \"doesn't eliminate\" the risk of people catching Covid-19 again, and infecting others.\nShe said: \"We found people with very high amounts of virus in their nose and throat swabs, that would easily be in the range which would cause levels of transmission to other individuals.\"\nProf Hopkins said she hoped that after Easter, \"we will start to see reduced infection rates, as we did at that time last year\" and the number of people who have been vaccinated at a \"very high level\".\nThe UK is continuing efforts to ramp up the rollout of the Covid vaccine, with the prime minister saying that Covid vaccinations will be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week as soon as supply allows.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted on Thursday to say that \"three million vaccines have now been administered\" in the UK.\nOn Thursday, NHS England published a breakdown of vaccinations by age and region for the first time. \nMr Johnson told the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday that he was \"concerned\" about a new Covid variant that is believed to have emerged in Brazil and said that the UK was taking steps to ensure it is not brought into the UK.\nA Downing Street spokesman said ministers met this morning to discuss \"urgent measures to reduce the potential spread to the UK of the Brazilian variant\". \nThey could include a ban on flights from Brazil. Arrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days.\nMeanwhile, the Deputy Scottish First Minister John Swinney told BBC Breakfast \"the virus is not accelerating as fast as it was\" in Scotland.\nHe said \"there are some early signs of optimism\" but emphasised people should follow all guidance as the \"virus is still at a very strong level\".\nIn other developments:"

And uncertainty about the moves other governments might make whilst away also creates fear.\" \nIt's not just UK breaks that are selling. The UK's largest tour operator TUI, famous for its sun-drenched European beach holidays, says there has also been a change in the last fortnight.  \n\"We're seeing a customer base or age group that wasn't booking before, that is starting to book,\" says Andrew Flintham the MD of TUI UK. \"The over 50s, we assume, is on the back to the vaccine news.\"\nWhilst TUI UK boss acknowledges that \"the market is still depressed and it's not where we want it - we are seeing glimmers of hope.\"\nThere are also interesting changes emerging in the types of breaks holidaymakers plan to take and the months they're planning to travel. \n\"People are booking later into the summer, hedging their bets\" said Mr Flintham. \"More July and August and a lot of demand for September and October. \n\"People are booking longer holidays, we're seeing more people booking ten or eleven or 14 nights rather than seven. People are maybe catching up on what they've missed.\"\nAs TUI analysed its recent booking data, one trend they spotted is the emergence of large, multigenerational group bookings. \n\"It is family time we've all missed. We can't get away from our own families, but our broader families we can't see, and that's feeding into our choices\" Mr Flintham explains.  \nAfter such a bad 10 months, and TUI cancelling all holidays until the middle of February at the earliest because of the new lockdown, how does the rest of the summer look?\n\"I think the summer holiday is on\" says Mr Flintham, \"I think we just need time for people to get that confidence, but yes, we think there will be a good summer this summer\".\nFor those who've watched the paralysis brought upon the travel industry since last winter, a morsel of good news about customers booking again is being celebrated.  \n\"This is fantastic news and to be hugely welcomed by an industry  that has been utterly devastated by the pandemic\", says Sophie Griffiths, editor of Travel Trade Gazette. \n\"Ten months into this crisis and the industry has still received zero dedicated support from the government despite being unique as a sector in terms of giving out thousands in refunds while getting next to nothing back in for 2020.\""
