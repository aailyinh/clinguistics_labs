      "text": "Wales has given 84% of people eligible for Covid boosters a vaccination, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales.\nThe programme has slowed down since before Christmas, delivering 3,752 booster doses a day in the last week.\nAt its height, 50,524 doses were given out on 21 December.\nTwo-thirds of vaccines given out in the past weeks were boosters, while more than 13,000 second doses, mainly to 12 to 15-year-olds.\nPeople can receive a booster three months after receiving their second vaccine, so it means that 84% of those eligible for a booster vaccine have now been reached in Wales.\nThat figure on 27 January was also 84% in Scotland, 81% in England and 75% in Northern Ireland.\nTo reach the remaining eligible people, at the current rate, it would take just over three months.\nThe situation is complicated by those who catch Covid having to wait before they can receive a booster, with higher proportions of the 18 to 40 age group infected since Christmas.\nThe total is 1,875,473 boosters given out by 27 January.\nThese include more than 42% of 18 to 29-year-olds and more than half of those in their 30s.\nWe can see that by last Sunday, 68% of adults had received their booster jab.\nMonmouthshire (78.6%) had reached the most and Cardiff (61.7%) the fewest.\nWith the over-50s, Monmouthshire has reached more than 88% and Powys, Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend and Caerphilly more than 87%. Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot (about 82%) have reached the fewest.\nAround 77% of people in their early 50s had also been given the booster and 81% of those in their late 50s.\nFor care home residents, the range is from just over 82% in Pembrokeshire to 96.6% of those on Anglesey having a booster.\nWales is slightly behind Scotland with the proportions of their populations given a first jab - 79.1%.\nBy 27 January, 2.5m people in Wales had been given their first dose. \nA total of 2,361,042 people have received a second jab, or 74.5% of the total population. \nMore than 64% of 16 and 17-year-olds have now received a second dose.\nWales (74.9%) and Scotland (75.3%) are close together on the proportions of second vaccinations.\nBy 27 January, England was on 71.6% and Northern Ireland trailing a little on 69.1%.\nFor the proportion of its population with booster doses, Wales is ranked fifth in the world, compared with other nations with a population above 1 million.\nWhen we look at figures within Wales, we can see Powys reached nearly 81% of its total population with two doses and 67.9% with boosters. \nSwansea Bay has reached the fewest proportion for vaccines, for all three doses (54.2%).\nNearly 62% of the youngest age group offered vaccines have taken a first dose in Wales by Wednesday.\nBut there is a big variation between counties. This ranged up to last Sunday from 74.1% in Monmouthshire and 70% in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) to less than half of 12 to 15-year-olds in Neath Port Talbot taking up the offer.\nRCT and Merthyr Tydfil have so far reached nearly half of this age group with second doses too."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Investigations are taking place into whether cases of a rare type of blood clot are connected to both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Johnson and Johnson coronavirus vaccines.\nThe link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and these rare clots is not yet proven, but UK experts say the evidence is getting stronger.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises how vaccines should be used, is recommending healthy people under 40 be offered a different vaccine.\nThe Johnson and Johnson jab is not yet available in the UK - although 30 million doses are on pre-order.\nCVST stands for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Put simply, this is a clot found in a large vein in the brain.  \nBlood normally travels through veins from the brain back to the heart.  \nThe CVST clot can block the flow of blood in the brain, reducing oxygen supply and potentially causing damage - stopping the central nervous system from working properly.\nRare clots have also been found in other areas, such as the large veins in the abdomen, in people who have had the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, and, in a handful of cases, in some arteries (the vessels carrying blood from the heart to organs). \nNo-one is yet sure, but there are certain factors in common which may provide some clues.\nIn the CVST clot cases under investigation, the patients were all found to have low numbers of platelets -these are blood cells that normally help repair bleeding in the body. \nPatients were also found to have a particular antibody (an immune protein that often helps fight against infection) in their blood that activates platelets. \nThe antibody appears to cause the platelets to mistakenly clump together and form clots, and in turn activate other parts of the body's clotting system. \nThis unusual combination of clots and low platelets is one of the features doctors are now looking out for. \nBut there is a lot more that needs to be understood.\nAnyone who has any of the following symptoms four days or more after having the vaccine should seek prompt medical help: \nMost cases have been seen between four days and a few weeks of people having the jab. \nMedical experts in the UK now suggest doctors should consider this rare condition in anyone who has matching symptoms up to a month after they have had the vaccine. \nAccording to the UK medical regulator, 309 cases of major blood clots with low platelets have occurred in the period up to mid-May 2021. The total includes clots occurring in the brain and other parts of the body.\nMost were after the first AstraZeneca vaccine but 15 cases have been reported after a second dose. There were 56 deaths.\nThis is out of a total of more than 23 million first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and 9 million second doses which have been given in the UK. \nFrom the current information in the UK the general risk of these types of clots following a first jab is estimated to be around 12.3 per million doses.\nData continues to be analysed and there is likely to be more information as time goes on. \nThough still rare, this risk appears to increase in younger people. \nThere is also now some evidence that the reported rate is higher in females - although this is not seen across all age groups and the difference remains small.\nThe JCVI has decided that - given that healthy people under 40 are at lower risk of becoming seriously ill from Covid and while infection rates continue to come under control - the balance of risks and benefits means they should be offered a different jab, if one is available.\nExperts are clear that for the vast majority of people the benefits of the vaccine vastly outweighs the risks. \nMeanwhile a study looking at patients in the United States suggests 39 people in every million who are infected with coronavirus go on to have a CVST within two weeks of a Covid diagnosis. \nThe study suggests though clots are still rare in coronavirus patients, catching the infection puts people at a higher risk of getting a CVST than those who have a jab.\nGenerally, the quicker that cases are identified, the better for the patient. \nTreatment can involve a number of medicines and includes immunoglobulins - immune proteins - given through a drip. \nSome patients will be sent home with new generation blood thinners and have regular monitoring. \nAccording to blood specialist, Prof Adrian Newland, current evidence suggests 75% of people survive. \nAn expert panel of blood specialists in the UK have put together guidance for doctors, which is being constantly updated.\nThe Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines work in very similar ways.\nAccording to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2021 six cases of the rare clots in the brain were detected out of more than 6.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine administered.\nAfter calling for a pause in the roll-out of the jab and carrying out a review, the FDA concluded the vaccine was safe and effective in preventing Covid-19. \nThe agency said it would continue to remain vigilant but the overall chance of these clots occurring was very low."

      "text": "People in England can start thinking about booking foreign holidays again this summer, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. \nBut he said the cost of the Covid tests required needed to be driven down, amid criticism from the travel industry. \nMr Shapps has also given more detail on the traffic light system which will see countries graded on their risk.\nPassengers will have to take the tests before leaving and on returning - even from low-risk \"green\" countries.\nThere will also be a watch list for countries most at risk of going from green to amber to provide greater assurance for those looking to travel abroad.\nAnnouncing the findings of the Global Travel Taskforce set up by the government to examine how leisure travel could be reopened safely after lockdown, Mr Shapps said foreign holidays would resume on 17 May at the earliest. \nHe told the BBC: \"This is the first time I'm able to come on and say I'm not advising against booking foreign holidays. \n\"Yes, you'll want to check what the situation is in two or three weeks' time when that list - the green, amber, red, is produced - you'll want to know that you've got good holiday insurance and flexible flights and the rest of it. \n\"But for the first time I think there is light at the end of the tunnel and we'll be able to restart international travel, including cruises by the way, in a safe and secure way, knowing about the vaccinations, everything we know about the disease this year, and of course that abundance of caution - having the tests in place.\"\nMr Shapps said the use of PCR tests - those needing to be sent to a lab - enabled scientists to detect potential variants of concern.\nBut he said he was \"concerned\" about the cost of the tests, adding that the government was committed to driving down the price of these by working with the private sector. \nThe transport secretary also said the government was looking at the possibility of people bringing pre-departure tests with them that they can use before boarding their return flight, pointing out that people are now able to order free lateral flow tests. \nOn Friday, the UK confirmed another 3,150 virus cases, and another 60 deaths of people who had tested positive in the past 28 days.\nMr Shapps said countries would be categorised based on level of infections and vaccinations, variants of concern and the quality of their genetic sequencing. \nHe said this list would be kept under constant review and that he was hopeful European countries would be upgraded as their vaccination rates improve. \nMr Shapps also said he was concerned about people who were separated from family members living overseas, saying it was \"possibly even more pressing than the holiday issue\".\nHe said families in the UK were \"uniquely spread across the world\", and the government wanted to make sure people were able to reunite. \nThe government has not yet said which countries will be green, amber or red - but said it would do so by early May. \nNearly 40 countries are currently on the UK government's red list of countries from which travel is banned, except for British and Irish nationals and those with residence rights in the UK.\nThe rules will be reviewed on 28 June to see whether any measures can be rolled back, the government said.\nFurther formal reviews will take place at \"checkpoints\" no later than 31 July and 1 October.\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the government had not outlined the traffic light system in detail and criticised the release of the plans while MPs are not sitting. \nHe told the BBC: \"The government has spoken about factors like vaccination rates, infection rates, the position with variants and also about the level of genomic sequencing. But I've no idea what the levels of each of those are for the government to place countries into, whether it's the green category, amber or red.\" \nThe first ministers of Scotland and Wales have both already argued that 17 May will be too early for foreign holidays to resume.\nNorthern Ireland has not yet announced its plans, but its chief medical officer has said it would be \"premature\" to book a foreign summer trip.\nIn other developments:\nAt the moment, almost anyone seeking to travel to England must first take a coronavirus test before departure and then two tests when they arrive, bought through a private provider. Children under 11 are exempt.\nConsumer group Which? estimated that each PCR test - which is just one of the tests needed - could cost about \u00a3120 per person.\nHowever, the government said it would work with airlines, travel firms and the test providers to see whether prices can be reduced. That could involve cheaper tests, or the government providing the pre-departure tests.\nThe government's plans have been met with mixed reaction from the travel industry."

      "text": "Most curbs to people's daily lives have been lifted as Wales moves to the lowest level of Covid rules.\nRules limiting socialising in pubs, bars and restaurants have been removed, while nightclubs are able to reopen for the first time since measures brought in to tackle the spread of Omicron were introduced after Christmas.\nSocial distancing rules were also scrapped as Wales moved into alert level zero on 28 January.\nPeople who test positive for Covid must now isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nHowever masks are still required to be worn in most public places in Wales, including shops, hospitals and on public transport. \nBut they are no longer needed for bars and restaurants, and changes to rules due to be announced later, mean they will also no longer be needed when visiting someone in their own room at a care home.\nWhat do the changes mean for people and businesses in Wales, and what can you do and when?\nChanges to rules have been made over the last two weeks, after First Minister Mark Drakeford laid out his plan to ease restrictions by the end of January.\nThe changes saw:\nFrom Thursday, 10 February Wales returns to a three-week review cycle as the country is at alert level zero\nThe lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic, we were last in alert level zero at Christmas.\nUnder it most curbs to our daily life are removed, all businesses are allowed to reopen, but people still have to wear face masks in many public places, and self isolation rules still apply.\nSince 22 December, fully vaccinated adults, children aged between five and 18 and vaccine clinical trial participants identified as a close contact of a positive case of Covid-19 in Wales do not need to self-isolate. \nInstead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

      "title": "Prince Philip: The Duke of Edinburgh's Award 'saved me from jail'",
      "tags": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Darlington",
      "text": "What does the Duke of Edinburgh's Award mean to you? For many it will conjure memories of hauling a badly-packed rucksack across rainy British countryside in the hope of adding some sparkle to their CV. Yet for some of the millions of young people who have taken on the self-improvement challenge, it has brought truly life-changing opportunities.\nWithout the award, James says he'd \"probably be in jail\". At the age of 15, James and his friend Nathan, then 16, had had more run-ins with the police than they care to remember. As bored mates growing up in Darlington, north-east England, they felt they had \"nothing else to do\" but to cause mischief.  \nIllegally riding motorbikes for a bit of fun in their early teenage years turned into a succession of petty crimes - theft, anti-social behaviour, criminal damage. James describes his behaviour as \"causing mayhem\". Nathan adds: \"Wherever I was, I was causing trouble.\"\nAfter being caught for separate offences, in 2018 the friends were both ordered to do hours of community service, or \"reparations\". The stint the pair enjoyed the most was being taught how to fix bikes by youth offending officer Dave Kirton, for a community project.\nDave, who is also a Duke of Edinburgh leader, arranged with those on the reparations panel to strike a deal with the boys: if they did their Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Award, they'd get five hours taken off their community service orders. \n\"It was a little bit of a reward, a carrot incentive,\" Dave says. \"Both the lads were a bit reluctant at first, but they agreed and two or three weeks in they realised the opportunity they had - and they got stuck right into it.\"\nIt takes about six months for most participants to complete the four sections of the bronze award: volunteering, a physical challenge, developing a skill and taking part in an expedition, which usually consists of two days of walking and a night of camping. The silver and gold awards are more challenging and take longer to complete. \nJames says the commitment needed for his bronze award - the first of three achievement levels - forced a change in his behaviour: \"It just stopped me being naughty.\" Nathan says learning expedition skills such as navigation made him realise how quick he was at picking up new things.\n\"There's potential that you don't know you've got until you actually try it,\" he says.\nNathan's realisation is exactly the kind of boost Prince Philip wanted to give young people when he first established the Duke of Edinburgh's Award for Boys in 1956. The idea, as expressed by the duke himself, was simple: \"If you can get a young person to succeed in any one activity, then that feeling of success will spread over into many others.\"\nThe roots of this idea lay in the self-reliance that helped Philip through his sometimes troubled childhood, and the experience of his time at school. Gordonstoun, the school both Prince Philip and Prince Charles attended, had a tough physical regime with an emphasis on self-development - as depicted in the Netflix series The Crown.\nIn the beginning the duke's award was confined to boys, with 7,000 signing up in the first year. Girls were allowed to take part from 1958, but to begin with their programme had more emphasis on domestic skills and community service.\nThe programme was made the same for girls and boys in 1980 - a move towards equality that helped one girl to overcome part of her traumatic childhood.\nLauren (not her real name), was abused by her parents as a child. She says they used to dangle her from a balcony - an abusive pastime that left her terrified of heights. \nDuring Lauren's bronze award expedition in 2018, when she was 14, she was given the opportunity to take part in a high ropes course as an extra activity. \"I had a friend there that I'd met, and they were egging me on,\" she says. \"I finally did it and I felt so relieved.\" \nThat day on the high ropes, Lauren's fear of heights disappeared. \"I can do anything now,\" she says.\nLauren says the friends she made through the scheme have helped her gain the social skills needed to pursue a future career in social work. She says her aim is to help others who have had difficult childhoods.\nThose who complete the gold award get to experience a high of a different kind - being invited to a presentation ceremony at a royal residence. Several are held each year, either at St James's Palace or in Buckingham Palace gardens, in London, at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, in Edinburgh, or at Hillsborough Castle, in County Down.\nPrince Philip attended more than 500 of gold award presentations himself - and other Royal Family members stood in if he was absent. He remained a patron of the organisation until his death. \nMohammed Leily says he was \"thrilled\" to meet \"the man himself\" at one of Philip's final presentation events before he retired from royal duties in 2017. \n\"He went around and had a chat with each group,\" says Mohammed, who is still in touch with the friends he made through the programme. \"I remember he told us to make sure we are as active as we could possibly be, and to make sure we made use of our youth now while we have the energy.\" \nMohammed arrived to the UK from Syria as a refugee in 2013, aged 17, and decided to sign up for the bronze award as a way of meeting new people and improving his English. He revelled in the opportunity to volunteer for the Red Cross and help other refugees and asylum seekers settle into new homes. \nHe credits his gold award with helping him to get a place to study medicine at the University of Southampton - and says he still can't believe he got to meet Prince Philip. \"When I left Syria I would never have imagined I'd do that, or see him.\"\nAs of early 2021, more than 3.1 million Duke of Edinburgh's Awards had been achieved by people like Mohammed, Lauren, James and Nathan. The international arm of the scheme means more than a million people more are currently taking part in programmes in more than 130 countries.\nBut if the numbers have grown dramatically, the ideas remain simple. \"One of the perpetual problems about human life is that young people of every generation have to discover for themselves what life is all about,\" the duke said in 2010.\n\"These experiences teach more general lessons and serve as a practical demonstration of what can be achieved through determination and persistence.\"\nBack in Darlington, those lessons have certainly been learned by James and Nathan. Neither has reoffended since completing their bronze award. \"It makes you happy knowing you're pal's all right and doing well for himself,\" says Nathan. \"And it makes us happy knowing that we've both changed together.\" \nDid you take part in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme?

A woman, in her 60s and believed to be his partner, was also stabbed and remains in a critical condition.\nThe businessman and his family's wealth was valued at \u00a3301m in the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List.   \nA 34-year-old man, from Gillingham, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. \nHe was stopped in a vehicle in the Hammersmith area of London and taken to hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. \nDorset Police said the arrested man and the victims were known to each other.\nSir Richard, who was number 435 in last year's Sunday Times Rich List, owned a string of top hotels. \nThe baronet had an extensive property and farming portfolio, including owning the freehold of the Sheraton Grand London Park Lane and the Athenaeum Hotel in Mayfair.\nA statement from the businessman's company, Sir Richard Sutton Limited, said staff were \"deeply saddened and devastated by the sudden death\".\n\"Sir Richard was a caring, generous and warm family man, who genuinely regarded those who worked for him as part of his extended family,\" it said.\nIt added he was \"passionately devoted to both his company and its people, setting the highest standards for quality in the hotel, farming and property interests within the group\".\nDescribing him as an an \"incredible individual\", the firm said Sir Richard's loss \"will be felt by everyone within the company\".\nA cordon is in place at the property and police have appealed for information.\nNorth Dorset Conservative MP Simon Hoare, who was a friend of Sir Richard, said he had received a briefing from Dorset Police and described the death as \"deeply awful\". \n\"I knew him, strangely enough I knew him before I was an MP as my company did a lot of work for his estate many years ago,\" he said.\n\"He was a charming man, he had a very good sense of humour, he was politically astute and genial.\n\"If you wanted to conjure up a picture of a country gentleman then that was him.\n\"It is a huge loss for his family in what is clearly deeply awful circumstances.\"\nThe MP added the incident was rare for his constituency and there was \"no cause or reason for alarm\" based on the police briefing. \nDorset Police said it received a report at 19:30 on Wednesday raising concerns about the welfare of the occupants of an address in Higher Langham.\nDet Insp Simon Huxter, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), said the force is appealing for anyone to come forward who saw or heard anything suspicious. \n\"Our thoughts are with the family of the man who sadly died and the injured woman at this extremely difficult time and they are being supported by specially-trained officers,\" he said. \nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Our people will always treasure his memory.\"\nPhilip and Elizabeth spent two idyllic years on Malta, where he was stationed in the Navy, before King George VI died in 1952.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the duke had been \"the consummate public servant\" and would be much missed.\nThe duke's mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, who died in 1969, is buried at the Church of Mary Magdalene in Jerusalem.\nThe Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, sent his \"sincere condolences and sympathies\" to the Queen, the Royal Family and the British people.\nIn a personal tribute, Barack Obama, one of the 18 US presidents in the duke's lifetime, said Philip had immediately put him and Michelle at ease, and that he was \"kind and warm, with a sharp wit and unfailing good humour\".\nDonald Trump said Prince Philip had \"defined British dignity and grace. He personified the quiet reserve, stern fortitude and unbending integrity of the United Kingdom...\"\nIn a telegram to the Queen, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the duke had \"rightfully enjoyed respect\" both at home and internationally.\nAnd Chancellor Angela Merkel said the duke's \"friendship with Germany, his straightforward nature and his sense of duty\" would be remembered.\nFrance's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the duke a man of \"great style\", saying: \"France joins in the sorrow of its friends across the Channel and salutes the life of a man who was a witness to a century of trials and hopes for our continent.\"\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella said he would \"cherish\" the memories of Prince Philip's \"deep admiration for Italy's artistic and cultural heritage\". He said the duke had accompanied the\" evolution of his country with an open and innovative spirit\".\nIrish President Michael D Higgins praised Prince Philip's ability to bring \"an air of informality to otherwise formal occasions\".\n\"His distinctive presence and unique sense of humour put participants at ease and always engaged those who encountered him,\" he said.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed her sympathy to the royal family and \"the people of the United Kingdom on this very sad day\"."

      "tags": "Travel,Department of Health & Social Care,Coronavirus testing,Reality Check,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People who test positive for Covid at home no longer need to take a PCR test to confirm the result.\nMany people are still struggling to get hold of tests due to high demand.\nIf you have no symptoms:\nAcross the UK, if you test positive for Covid with a lateral flow test (LFT), there is no longer any need to book a PCR test to confirm that result. \nYou should report your result online or by calling 119, and self-isolate immediately. You will be contacted by the relevant tracing service so your contacts can be notified.\nYou can leave self-isolation seven days after the date of your first positive test (five full days in England), as long as you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart. \nThe guidance that positive LFTs don't need a confirmatory PCR will remain in place while Covid case levels are high. Under these conditions, the vast majority of people with positive LFT results are extremely likely to have coronavirus. \nPeople who are eligible for the \u00a3500 test and trace payment in England will be asked to take a PCR so they can access financial support.\nClinically vulnerable people in Wales and Northern Ireland are also still advised to take a PCR test after a positive LFT.\nIf you have symptoms:\nIf you have Covid symptoms - a cough, a fever or a loss of taste or smell - you should take a PCR test as soon as possible, and self-isolate while you wait for the result. \nYou must then continue to self-isolate if the PCR test is positive, even if you previously had negative LFT results.\nHowever, if you have already tested positive on a LFT, you should self-isolate and do not need to take a follow up PCR.\nAnyone without Covid symptoms can order LFTs online using their NHS login. \nYou can also collect LFTs from pharmacies, vaccination hubs and test centres. \nYou should report your LFT result online or by calling 119. \nYou can order a PCR test kit to be sent to your home or book an appointment at a walk-in or drive-through test site.\nThe main government website still regularly says no LFTs are available for home delivery, and many pharmacies have limited stock. \nPCR test appointments are also sometimes in short supply across much of the UK, although home PCR kits are generally available. \nAnyone who needs a PCR test is advised to keep checking the website, as slots are released throughout the day.\nAnnouncing the reduction in the self-isolation period for England, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs that LFT supplies had risen sharply from pre-Omicron levels, with 400 million available in January, compared to 120 million in November. \nThe testing rules are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or for 10 days after your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to people under-18s (18 and four months in Scotland; 18 and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test, but don't need to take a confirmatory PCR test. \nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. In Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nAcross the UK, NHS and education staff are asked to test twice a week. Secondary pupils should test twice a week during term time (three times a week in Wales). \nThere is separate testing guidance for prisons and hospital patients, as well as care home staff in Scotland. \nThe government has said it will provide 100,000 critical workers in England with free daily LFTs, initially for five weeks.\nCritical workers deliver essential services such as transport and food distribution, and cannot work from home so are at risk of infection.\nIn addition, everyone is asked to test before socialising with those who are at most risk from Covid, or spending time in crowded settings or places with poor ventilation. \nPeople can also provide a recent negative LFT or PCR result instead of proof of vaccination to enter venues that are covered by Covid passport schemes in place in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nYou may also need to test before or after travelling abroad. You must buy private tests for this - you cannot use free NHS tests. \nLFTs and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests do different things:\nBoth tests involve swabbing your nose and/or throat. LFTs can be done at home, and show results in 20-30 minutes. \nPCR test swabs must be sent to a lab for analysis, with results provided in 24-48 hours, although it can take longer to confirm a particular Covid variant.\nBeing vaccinated against Covid cannot cause you to test positive on either an LFT or PCR test.\nWhen LFTs were first introduced, they were criticised for being much less accurate than PCRs.\nHowever, in October UCL researchers found LFTs were more than 80% effective at detecting any level of Covid-19 infection, which was much higher than previously thought.\nLFT results are also more reliable during a period of high Covid cases, because the small number of false positives is much less significant.

      "text": "Weekly deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales have dropped 92% since the peak of the second wave in January, according to official figures.\nMeanwhile, the total number of deaths registered in the UK over one week is 5% below the five-year average.\nIt comes amid continued efforts to reassure the public over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's possible link to rare blood clots.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the jab remained safe.\nHe urged those who had received one dose to take up their second and said the UK was on track to vaccinate all adults by 31 July.\nFigures from the Office of National Statistics showed there were 712 deaths involving Covid in the week ending 19 March, down from 8,945 in late January.\nThe largest falls were seen among the oldest age groups, with deaths falling 92.9% among those aged 80 and over and 93.4% for the 75 to 79 age group, compared to 83.7% for those aged 60 to 64.\nSeparate figures showed the number of deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 26 March was 11,439, which was 5% below the five-year average. Last week, deaths were 8% below the 5-year average.\nSome 799 of these deaths involved coronavirus.\nAdults aged over 80 were the second priority group for vaccination, followed by over-75s and over 70s. The government says everyone in these groups was offered a jab by mid-February.\nFigures on Thursday showed the UK's vaccination programme had recovered after a lull over Easter, with an extra 408,396 second doses administered and 99,530 first doses. The number of people fully vaccinated is now over six million, while 31.8 million have received just one dose.\nAnother 3,030 confirmed cases were reported, along with 53 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nSeeking to reassure people who have received a first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, Mr Hancock said there was \"no evidence\" of the rare blood clots after the second dose of the vaccine.\nThe UK changed policy on Wednesday to offer under-30s an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine, after weighing the benefits of vaccination compared to a potential very rare risk of blood clots.\nThere had been 79 incidents of the clots and 19 deaths among the 20 million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses administered, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said. That equates to a one-in-a-million risk of a fatal side effect.\nIt said there was no proof the vaccine had caused the clots but the link was getting firmer. Both the MHRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks, however.\nMr Hancock said people should have confidence in the safety system for vaccines because it was \"able to spot this extremely rare event\".\nThe risk was about the same as taking a long-haul flight, he said.\nAnd he said there was \"more than enough\" doses of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna due to arrive to offer an alternative to the 8.5 million UK adults under 30 yet to be vaccinated.\nThe UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 17 million of the Moderna jab and also has agreements with several other companies for jabs that are still waiting for approval, including 100 million doses from Valneva and 30 million from Janssen.\nA government scientific adviser said communication of the benefits and side-effects was \"critical\" to avoiding a loss of confidence in the vaccines.\nProf Stephen Reicher told BBC Radio 4's World at One that having a Covid jab is \"actually one of the safer things you do in the day\".\n\"Something like 30 or 40 people drown in the bath every year, something like 1,000 people die falling down the stairs, something like 200 die from choking on their breakfast, and that's many, many more deaths than we get from these vaccines,\" he said."

      "tags": "Television,UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Monarchy,Acting,The Crown",
      "text": "\"Don't. Be. Ridiculous.\"\nThat, according to actor Matt Smith, was apparently the Duke of Edinburgh's terse response when asked whether he had ever watched The Crown.\nSmith relayed the anecdote during a 2017 interview with the Guardian, as he reflected on his time playing the duke in the hugely successful Netflix drama.  \nThe series portrays the inner life of Britain's modern-day Royal Family, from the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936 to the break-up of Prince Charles's marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales, in the early 1990s. The drama is set to continue in a new season in 2022.\nIt has been showered with praise for its lavish sets, immense budget, compelling script and accomplished cast, and the awards have followed. More controversial though has been its relationship with the truth. \nThe royals are notoriously guarded about their private lives.  \nEven the duke's supposed stinging rebuke when asked whether he had watched the series is a matter of debate. \n\"Whether it's true or not, I don't know, but I just think he's a bit of a cool cat,\" said Smith, after relating the second-hand anecdote.\n\"And that's what I love about him: he's done what he wants, when he wants, how he wants, with whom he wants. He hasn't asked permission. And his wife's the Queen.\"\nThe former Doctor Who star played the dashing, young Philip Mountbatten, who wooed Princess Elizabeth and became her royal consort. \nYet there were, in reality, limits to how much the duke really did what he wanted. Smith's portrayal of Philip takes in many of the compromises the prince was forced to make - giving up his title as Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, resigning his career in the navy and, ultimately, swearing allegiance to the Queen.\nWhen Elizabeth was crowned in 1953, Philip is depicted in the show asking her if he can be excused from kneeling to pay homage to her during the ceremony. \nSo what did his role teach Smith about the man himself? \n\"In this day and age, with all the conversations we're having about being a man and maleness, and what it is to be empowered and respected as a woman - I just found that thrilling,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.\n\"And also, I kind of sided with him, which is controversial. I felt, 'Yeah, I wouldn't really want to kneel to my wife'.\" \nHis enthusiasm for the character continued into season two when Smith said he saw the duke as a \"roguish, brilliant man\", adding: \"I just found a lot to celebrate in Philip.\"\nThe actor, who was Emmy-nominated in 2018 for playing the role, told Variety that year: \"I sort of loved Philip, and there was a lot that I could identify with: the competitiveness, the sporting nature, the battle, the defiance and the maleness. \n\"One of the interesting challenges for me was that I felt there was a sort of a misconception and a preconception about him, which reduced him a bit. \n\"And actually all the research I did found him to be brilliantly funny, very clever, very popular. In the royal house he's the most popular of all of them. If you've talked to any of the staff, Philip's the one they all love really. I think more than a lot of them, he's a bit more of a man of the people.\"\nSmith was no less complimentary when reacting to news of the duke's death. \"Prince Philip was the man. And he knew it. 99 and out, but what an innings. And what style,\" he said. \"Thank you for your service old chap - it won't be the same without you.\"\nThe role of Philip was passed to Tobias Menzies in season three, when the middle-aged duke played opposite Olivia Colman. Speaking in the immediate aftermath of the duke's death on Friday, Menzies was the essence of modesty.\n\"If I know anything about the Duke of Edinburgh I'm fairly sure he wouldn't want some actor who has portrayed him on television giving their opinion on his life,\" he said, going on to quote the character of Orlando in Shakespeare's As You Like It.\n\"O good old man! how well in thee appears\n\"The constant service of the antique world...\"\nBefore adding: \"Rest in Peace.\"\nBut some time before that, Menzies, who bleached his eyebrows for the role of the duke, was asked by the LA Times if he knew whether Prince Philip had watched his portrayal.\n\"'The crown doesn't comment.' I think that's the motto,\" he replied.\nHe played the prince in seasons three and four, covering 1964 to 1990, and said that by this stage in his life, he \"has acclimatised\" and \"seems to be chafing at the bit less... and seems to have found his feet\".\nThe Outlander actor told the New York Times that for Philip, season three was \"a continuation of themes in the first seasons: being second to his wife, sacrificing his own life and career to some extent\".\nMenzies told the LA Times it was a challenge playing the duke.\n\"They're quite guarded, both him and the Queen. Having watched a lot of footage of Philip and having read about him a lot, I find him quite a hard man to pin down. That makes him interesting to play.\"\nThe actor, who was nominated for a Golden Globe last year for his role in the show, told Screen Daily playing the royal was \"primarily a technical challenge... But it's a subtle thing to pitch - you don't want it to be pastiche or caricature\".\nSeason four's storylines featuring Prince Philip include a depiction of the early relationship between Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. \nThe show suggests Prince Philip and Diana shared an affinity with each other. \nSpeaking to Vanity Fair, Menzies said: \"Someone in production managed to get hold of copies of some letters between him and Diana. \n\"I was really struck by the kind of balanced, calm, quite tender kind of atmosphere to those letters. He clearly, behind the scenes, worked quite hard to mend that relationship. And if those letters are anything to go by, he does seem to have been a keen supporter of hers.\"\nThe final actor to play Prince Philip in the series will be Oscar, Bafta and Golden Globe-nominated Jonathan Pryce, who starred in The Two Popes with Sir Anthony Hopkins in 2019. \nHe said playing the duke was a \"daunting prospect\" but added doing it with the Crown's creator Peter Morgan, along with Imelda Staunton playing the Queen, and Lesley Manville as Princess Margaret, would be \"a joy\". \nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband, has died aged 99, Buckingham Palace has announced.\nA statement issued by the palace just after midday spoke of the Queen's \"deep sorrow\" following his death at Windsor Castle on Friday morning.\nThe Duke of Edinburgh, the longest-serving royal consort in British history, was at the Queen's side for more than her six decades of reign.\nBoris Johnson said he \"inspired the lives of countless young people\".  \n\"It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband,\" the Palace said.\n\"The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.\"\nIt is understood that the Prince of Wales travelled from his home in Gloucestershire to visit his mother at Windsor Castle on Friday afternoon.\nSpeaking at Downing Street, the prime minister said that the duke had \"earned the affection of generations here in the United Kingdom, across the Commonwealth, and around the world\".\nMeanwhile, Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said he \"consistently put the interests of others ahead of his own and, in so doing, provided an outstanding example of Christian service\".\nIn tribute to the duke, Westminster Abbey began tolling its tenor bell once every 60 seconds at 18:00 BST. It rang out 99 times to honour each year of his life.\nEarlier, the flag at Buckingham Palace was lowered to half-mast and a notice was posted on the gates to mark the duke's death.\nPeople placed floral tributes outside the palace, while hundreds visited Windsor Castle to pay their respects.\nHowever, the government urged the public not to gather or leave tributes at royal residences amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Royal Family has asked people to consider making a donation to a charity instead of leaving flowers in memory of the duke, and an online book of condolence has been launched on the official royal website for those who wish to send messages.\nA message on the website of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's non-profit organisation Archewell paid tribute to the \"loving memory\" of the Duke of Edinburgh, saying: \"Thank you for your service... you will be greatly missed.\"\nFrom midday on Saturday, a 41-gun salute will take place for Prince Philip in cities including London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, as well as in Gibraltar and at sea from Royal Navy warships, the Ministry of Defence said. They will be broadcast online and on television for the public to watch from home.\nThe BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said it was \"a moment of sadness\" for the country and \"most particularly, for the Queen losing her husband of 73 years - a bigger span of years than most of us can imagine\".\nHe said Prince Philip had made \"a huge contribution to the success of the Queen's reign\", describing the duke as \"utterly loyal in his belief in the importance of the role that the Queen was fulfilling - and in his duty to support her\".\n\"It was the importance of the solidity of that relationship, of their marriage, that was so crucial to the success of her reign,\" he added.\nA bank of photographers and cameramen were lined up around the growing number of tributes at Buckingham Palace on Friday afternoon, said BBC News reporter Marie Jackson.\nRhea Varma, from Pimlico, pulled up to the gates on her bike to lay flowers and a note saying Rest in Peace Duke. \nShe said the news was \"super sad\". To her, the duke was \"the kind of stability that's so old-fashioned it's difficult to comprehend. He was a rock who brought integrity.\"\nAdam Wharton-Ward, 36, also arrived to leave lilies by the palace gates. He is visiting London from his home in France but was so moved by the news, he wanted to \"rally round\" for the Queen's sake. \n\"It's so sad. He's been with her for 73 years. If it wasn't for him who knows if she would have got through it,\" he said.\nThe duke's appeal, he added, was that he was \"almost normal with his gaffes\". \n\"Now that normality has gone,\" he said.\nThe prince married Princess Elizabeth in 1947, five years before she became Queen.\nIn March, the duke left King Edward VII's hospital in central London after a month-long stay for treatment. \nHe was admitted on 16 February after feeling unwell, and later underwent a procedure for a pre-existing heart condition at another London hospital - St Bartholomew's.\nBy Helena Wilkinson, BBC News correspondent at Windsor Castle\nThis is a town that's seen many royal events over the years, both happy and sad.\nToday, it is one of quiet reflection. \nThe sun has been shining down on Windsor Castle this afternoon, but the mood outside is understandably sombre. \nAs locals heard of the duke's death they turned up to leave flowers outside the entrance. \nOne young boy, Oscar, came with his mother to lay flowers. He left a card which read: \"Your Majesty, so sorry about hearing about your amazing husband.\"\n\"It's really sad,\" another woman told us. \"I just wanted him to get to 100,\" she said. \nThe flag here hasn't been lowered to half-mast. That's because it's the Royal Standard which means the Queen is in residence. It's the one flag which remains at full mast. \nIt was here that the duke spent his last weeks after being discharged from hospital. \nInside the castle the Queen, now a widow, is in mourning for her husband who has always been by her side. \nPrince Philip's funeral will take place at St George's Chapel, Windsor - but the arrangements have been amended in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the College of Arms said in a statement.\nIt added that the funeral will not be a state funeral, and the duke will not lie in state.\nThe duke will, however, lie at rest in Windsor Castle ahead of a funeral, the College of Arms said, \"in line with custom and with His Royal Highness's wishes\".\nThe statement said: \"The funeral arrangements have been revised in view of the prevailing circumstances arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and it is regretfully requested that members of the public do not attempt to attend or participate in any of the events that make up the funeral.\"\nBuckingham Palace will confirm the detailed arrangements for the funeral on the Royal website, it added.\nAll UK government buildings have been told to fly an official flags at half-mast in tribute to the duke until 08:00 BST on the day after the funeral.\nPrince Philip and the Queen had four children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.\nTheir first son, the Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, was born in 1948, followed by his sister, the Princess Royal, Princess Anne, in 1950, the Duke of York, Prince Andrew, in 1960 and the Earl of Wessex, Prince Edward, in 1964.\nPrince Philip was born on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921. \nHis father was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, a younger son of King George I of the Hellenes. \nHis mother, Princess Alice, was a daughter of Prince Louis of Battenberg and a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria.\nPoliticians across the UK were united in mourning following the announcement of the duke's death.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the UK had \"lost an extraordinary public servant\", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said his \"long contribution to public life in Scotland will leave a profound mark on its people\".\nWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the duke \"served the crown with selfless devotion and generosity of spirit\". \nParliament will honour the duke on Monday, with the House of Commons sitting at 14:30 BST for tributes following his death. \nParties have also suspended their campaigning elections on 6 May, which will see voters head to the polls for council and mayoral positions in England, the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Parliament.\nMeanwhile, Commonwealth leaders led international reaction to the duke's death. \nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison tweeted that the duke \"embodied a generation that we will never see again\", while Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described Philip as a \"man of great purpose and conviction\".\nAnd Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled the duke for his \"distinguished career in the military\" and work \"at the forefront of many community service initiatives\".\nUS President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden joined other world leaders in sending their \"deepest condolences\" to the Queen, the Royal Family and the people of the UK. \nIn a statement, they said the duke \"gladly dedicated himself to the people of the UK, the Commonwealth, and to his family\".\n\"His legacy will live on, not only through his family, but in all the charitable endeavours he shipped,\" it said.\nThe palace said further announcements would be made \"in due course\"."

      "text": "Frontline health workers from overseas will be given a free one-year UK visa extension, the Home Office says.\nThe move applies to eligible workers whose visas are due to run out before 1 October 2021 and their dependants.\nThe list of professions covered includes doctors, nurses, paramedics and midwives, with 14,000 people expected to benefit. \nBut Unison said the move should be extended to care workers who had \"been overlooked again\". \nThe Home Office first granted free automatic visa extensions to health workers in March 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic hit the UK.\nThe offer was initially limited to NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics whose visas ran out between 31 March 2020 and 1 October 2020, but it was later extended to include more professions. \nThe department said more than 10,000 had received the extension last year, but this latest announcement would affect a further 14,000 workers. \nA health and care worker visa normally costs \u00a3232 per person for up to three years or \u00a3464 per person for three to five years. It must be extended after five years, or if the worker changes jobs.\nThe visa is \u00a355 cheaper if the applicant is from one of the eligible European countries.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said: \"The dedication and skill of overseas health and care workers who are leading the UK's fight against coronavirus is truly extraordinary.\"\nShe said they were now helping with the vaccine roll-out, and the visa extension \"shows how our country values the contributions of these heroes\".\nWorkers need to fill out an online form to verify their identity, but there will be no fees to pay.\nThe visa extensions will also apply to their partners and any children aged under 18. \nBut while the announcement has been welcomed, some have questioned why care workers are not included on the list of professions. \nUnison general secretary Christina McAnea said thousands of NHS workers would be \"relieved\" by the news.\n\"Many have faced huge stresses and pushed themselves to the limit to treat and look after us all,\" she added. \"It's only right the government looks after them and makes their lives a little easier by granting free visas.\"\nBut she criticised care workers being \"overlooked\", saying the scheme \"should extend to all employees in health and care, particularly the lowest paid who need this help the most\".

      "text": "Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. \nWhat are the current rules?\nYou can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unless you have to self-isolate because you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. \nAll holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. \nIf you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. \nAnyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before.\nPeople travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law.\nSome UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding. Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

      "text": "The discovery of a 3,000-year-old city that was lost to the sands of Egypt has been hailed as one of the most important archaeological finds since Tutankhamun's tomb.\nFamed Egyptologist Zahi Hawass announced the discovery of the \"lost golden city\" near Luxor on Thursday.\nHe said the find was the largest ancient city, known as Aten, ever uncovered in Egypt.\nIt was unearthed within weeks of the excavation starting in September 2020.\nThe city dates to the reign of Amenhotep III, one of Egypt's most powerful pharaohs, who ruled from 1391 to 1353 BC.\nThe city continued to be used by pharaohs Ay and Tutankhamun, whose nearly intact tomb was discovered in the Valley of the Kings by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922.\n\"The discovery of this lost city is the second most important archaeological discovery since the tomb of Tutankhamun,\" Betsy Brian, professor of Egyptology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, US, said.\nShe said the city would \"give us a rare glimpse into the life of the ancient Egyptians\" at the time when the empire was at its wealthiest.\nThe dig revealed a large number of valuable archaeological finds, such as jewellery, coloured pottery, scarab beetle amulets and mud bricks bearing seals of Amenhotep III.\nThe team began excavations on the west bank of Luxor near the Valley of the Kings, some 500 km (300 miles) south of the capital Cairo.\n\"Within weeks, to the team's great surprise, formations of mud bricks began to appear in all directions,\" Dr Hawass said in his statement.\n\"What they unearthed was the site of a large city in a good condition of preservation, with almost complete walls, and with rooms filled with tools of daily life.\" \nNow, seven months after the dig started, several areas or neighbourhoods have been uncovered, including a bakery, an administrative district and a residential area.\n\"Many foreign missions searched for this city and never found it,\" said Dr Hawass, a former antiquities minister.\nHe said further archaeological work was under way at the site and his team \"expects to uncover untouched tombs filled with treasures\".\nEgypt is seeking to promote its ancient heritage to revive its tourism sector, which has been flagging after years of political turbulence and disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\nLast week, Egypt carried the remains of their country's ancient rulers through Cairo in a historic procession.\nThe lavish spectacle saw 22 mummies - 18 kings and four queens - transported from the neo-classical Egyptian Museum to the new National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation about 5 km away.\nAmenhotep III and his wife Queen Tiye were among the mummies transferred to the new resting place."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Glasgow,Greta Thunberg",
      "text": "Greta Thunberg has told the BBC she does not plan to attend the UN climate conference due to be held in Glasgow this November.\nThe 18-year-old Swedish climate campaigner is concerned about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on attendance at COP26.\nShe believes the summit should be postponed.\nShe says the UK government, which is hosting the summit, should wait until global vaccination rates have risen.\nThe summit will bring together world leaders with the aim of agreeing a plan to tackle climate change.\nMs Thunberg's decision is likely to be a significant blow for the UK government.\nThe activist has attended every major climate conference since her first protest outside the Swedish parliament two and a half years ago. \nShe said: \"This needs to happen in the right way. Of course, the the best thing to do would be to get everyone vaccinated as soon as possible so that everyone could take part on the same terms.\"\nThe UN meeting has already been delayed once, from November 2020, and there have been rumours that it may be postponed again. \nThe last two Conference of the Parties (COP) summits have had more than 20,000 attendees and the UK is understood to have been working on the basis that as many as 30,000 people could attend in Glasgow.\nAt the end of last month, sources in Downing Street and Holyrood were adamant that no decision had been made on a further delay to the conference.\nHowever, the BBC was told a final decision on whether to delay or move ahead with the summit was likely to be taken shortly after Easter.\nCOP stands for Conference of the Parties, and it is attended by countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - a treaty agreed in 1994. The 2021 meeting will be the 26th meeting, so it has been named COP26.\nCOP25 was held in Madrid, Spain, in November 2019 and featured a headline speech from Greta Thunberg. It ended with many unresolved issues, but an agreement was made about cutting carbon dioxide - a gas that causes global warming.\nEach nation agreed to devise a plan to cut their carbon emissions by the next conference in Glasgow.\nCOP26 will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nIt will be the biggest summit the UK has ever hosted. It is being described as the most significant climate event since the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nPresidents and prime ministers from around the world will be reporting back on progress since the Paris Agreement and, potentially make new decisions on how to cut carbon emissions.\nGreta Thunberg would not play a formal role at the conference but her decision not to attend is a significant symbolic moment for the conference.\nSince she began her first school strike alone outside the Swedish parliament two and a half years ago she has come to symbolise the demands of many young people that world leaders take climate change more seriously.  \n\"How dare you\", she told world leaders at a UN climate summit in New York in September 2019, as she accused them of failing to act on climate change. \n\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words\", she told them.\nSpeaking to BBC News ahead of a new documentary series \"Greta Thunberg: A Year to Change the World\", she was clear what she thought the COP26 team should do, saying she thought the summit should be postponed again.  \nShe said the summit was not the only way to go about affecting change.\n\"To be frank, the changes need to come from people demanding climate action,\" she said.\n\"Yes, these COP meetings are crucial and they are incredibly important. But we can have as many of these meetings and conferences as we want but as long as we are not really treating the climate crisis as a crisis, we won't see any real changes coming from them.\"\nShe also criticised the UK for holding a climate conference when the opening of a new coal mine is being considered.\n\"It really shows the true face of the so-called net zero emissions by 2050,\" she added.\n\"If you can commit yourself to something like that while at the same time that includes the possibility of opening new coal mines, and so on, it really doesn't mean that much.\"\nShe said she was \"surprised\" people had been listening to her for so long, but added that as long as people were listening she would use that opportunity to communicate her message as much as she could.\nMark Carney, the former Bank of England governor who is now finance advisor for COP26, would not be drawn on whether he thought the conference would happen in person when asked in an interview for the BBC podcast, Newscast.\n\"I think if we've learned anything in the last 13 months, it's that's it's not wise to make bold predictions about what's going to happen three, six months ahead in terms of logistics, so the honest answer is I don't know\", Mr Carney told presenter Adam Fleming.  \nAny decision on the future of the summit would be made in conjunction with the United Nations, as well as the Scottish government.\nAt the end of last month it was reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was battling to ensure the flagship conference was held face-to-face by ensuring participants were vaccinated and subjected to a robust testing regime.\nBut the global rollout of vaccinations has been disappointing.\nLast year, the decision to delay the meeting - because of Covid - was taken in May.\nGreta Thunberg: A Year to Change the World begins on BBC One at 21:00 on 12 April and will be available on the BBC iPlayer"

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,The Troubles,Arlene Foster,Brexit",
      "text": "The renewed tension in Northern Ireland could have far-reaching implications for the future of the United Kingdom - and post-Brexit relations with the EU.\nThe violence that has erupted this week on the streets of Belfast and other towns and cities in Northern Ireland has many causes.\nBut anger about post-Brexit trading rules that came into force in February is a factor.\nThe section of the Brexit deal known as the \"protocol\" was designed to protect the peace process by avoiding the need for checks on the border with Ireland.\nBut it also means that some European laws continue to apply in Northern Ireland.\nAnd that has reinforced long-held feelings among Unionists that they are being cut off from the rest of the UK - and that they've been misled by the UK government and that the EU is not listening.\nMuch of the focus in talks with Brussels on the UK's departure from the EU was on ensuring that trade from Northern Ireland to Great Britain could continue freely - to be \"unfettered\".\nThat's what Prime Minister Boris Johnson meant when, in the run up to the 2019 general election, he famously told traders they would have his permission to throw away any new paperwork.\nIt also gave many the impression that trade in the other direction - from Great Britain to Northern Ireland - would be just as smooth. This was despite warnings from the EU, and UK civil servants, that the new rules would inevitably lead to more friction. \nThe past few months have provided real-world examples as the Protocol kicked in:\nSome of the problems were temporary and have gone away. Others are on the way to being solved with workarounds, or with money or support schemes.\nSome have been booted into the long grass, with \"grace periods\" before the rules are fully applied.\nOne European diplomat, who helped to write the Brexit deal, told me it was unlikely that any of these issues had inspired teenagers to throw missiles at the police this week.\nBut each one is a reminder that Northern Ireland is being treated differently from the rest of the UK because of a treaty agreed by the UK government.\nAnd the rhetoric of Unionist politicians suggests it is unlikely that the differences can ever be minimised in a way that satisfies them. \nThey would prefer the Protocol was suspended - which would be allowed if there was a serious threat to security or the economy - or permanently junked.\nThat will be the DUP's pitch at the elections for the Northern Ireland assembly next May.\nAnd again when Stormont votes on the continuation of the Protocol in 2024.\nWhich means the instability around the Brexit deal in Northern Ireland is likely to continue for years.\nAnd it could get even worse. I recently spoke to one of the UK's Brexit negotiators, who asked: How will Northern Irish Leave voters feel if the European Court of Justice is ever asked to rule on how the Protocol is being applied?\nBritish observers also fear that DUP leader Arlene Foster is being forced into increasingly extreme positions - by her own party and by voters demanding an even stronger brand of unionism.\nOne government advisor also suggested to me that Unionist leaders were whipping up their supporters, risking a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" where politicians use inflammatory language, which winds up the public, which then demands an ever-tougher response. \nThat makes it more difficult for the DUP to share power with Sinn Fein, which threatens devolved government and the peace process.\nIt also makes it harder for the Northern Irish government to build inspection posts at ports and other things it is meant to implement under the terms of the protocol, potentially undermining the Brexit deal itself.\nBoris Johnson is also under pressure from some of his own Conservative MPs, who are still pressing for alternative solutions to the Irish border issue, even though these solutions were rejected by the EU many times during the Brexit negotiations.\nAnd what about the EU? \nThe British government accuses them of being deaf to the needs of Unionists and of putting the interests of those who care more about Northern Ireland's relationship with Ireland ahead of those who care about its relationship with Great Britain.\nUK ministers say the EU gave Unionists another reason to be upset by almost accidentally suspending the Protocol in January when it was designing a mechanism to screen exports of Coronavirus vaccines.\nThe EU quickly corrected its mistake and apologised. Officials in Brussels say privately that the problems in Northern Ireland are because the UK was not honest about the changes that were coming and acted too late to minimise their impact.\nThe biggest question of all is the degree to which the implementation of the Brexit deal affects the number of Northern Irish citizens saying they would like to be part of Ireland. \nBritish law compels the Northern Ireland Secretary to hold a referendum - a border poll - if there is evidence that a majority of the population wants reunification. \nOpinion polls suggest a small but growing minority in favour but the law is silent about what evidence should be considered or how a vote would work. \nThis potential break-up of the UK is why the technical details of the Brexit deal matter to politicians in London, Belfast, Dublin and Brussels. \nAnd to people on the streets in Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus, Ballymena and Londonderry."

led by the prime minister and Sir Keir. \nPeers - who were due to return to the House of Lords on Monday - will also start their proceedings with a humble address of condolence to the Queen.\nThe Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Welsh Senedd will also be recalled on Monday for tributes. \nThe Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, told the BBC Prince Philip was a \"magnificent man\" and an \"institution\".\nIn a statement, he added: \"Today we must pause to honour him and to offer our sincerest thanks for the prince's devout faithfulness to our country - and all the nations shall miss him greatly.\"\nThe death of Prince Philip, who was married to the Queen for more than 70 years, was announced by Buckingham Palace on Friday. \nThe statement said he had \"passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle\".\nThe government has issued guidance for all official flags on all UK government buildings, including the union jack, to be flown at half-mast in tribute to the duke until 08:00 BST on the day following his funeral.\nGiving a speech outside No 10, Mr Johnson said the duke had \"earned the affection of generations here in the United Kingdom, across the Commonwealth and around the world\".\nThe prime minister praised Prince Philip's service and \"bravery\" in World War Two, as well as his contributions after - from being a \"champion of the natural world\" through to having \"shaped and inspired the lives of countless young people\" through the Duke of Edinburgh award. \n\"We remember the duke for all of this and above all for his steadfast support for Her Majesty the Queen,\" he added. \n\"We offer our condolences to her and to all her family and we give thanks, as a nation and a kingdom, for the extraordinary life and work of Prince Philip.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Duke of Edinburgh had \"dedicated his life to our country\", but he would be \"remembered most of all for his extraordinary commitment and devotion to the Queen\". \nIn a statement, Sir Keir said it had been \"a partnership that inspired millions in Britain and beyond\".\nHe added: \"Their marriage has been a symbol of strength, stability and hope, even as the world around them changed - most recently during the pandemic. \n\"My thoughts are with the Queen, the Royal Family and the British people as our nation comes together to mourn and remember the life of Prince Philip.\"\nOther political leaders also paid their respects to the duke - including the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, who said she was \"saddened by the news\".\nShe added: \"I send my personal and deepest condolences - and those of [the Scottish government] and the people of Scotland - to Her Majesty the Queen and her family.\"\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster offered her \"deepest sympathies\" to the Royal Family, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill extended her \"sincere condolences\".\nWelsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said Prince Philip had \"served the crown with selfless devotion and will be sorely missed by the people of Wales and the many organisations he supported\".\nThe leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, said the duke was \"a much-loved husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather\", adding: \"We will always be grateful for his amazing service.\"\nFormer leaders also expressed their sadness at the death of the Duke of Edinburgh.\nTheresa May, who stood down as prime minister in 2019, said her \"thoughts and prayers\" were with the Queen and her family.\nShe told the BBC that Prince Philip had \"a dry sense of humour\" and was \"a man of so many different interests\", adding: \"I will remember him... as somebody who put those talents to the committed and selfless service of the Queen and her country.\"\nHer predecessor and fellow Conservative, David Cameron, called it \"desperately sad news\", adding: \"It was an honour and a privilege as prime minister to see up close what a powerful advocate the duke was for the causes he believed in.\"\nFormer Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was \"personally fortunate to benefit from the duke's wisdom on many occasions\", adding that his \"commitment to the United Kingdom and to the Commonwealth will never be forgotten\".\nAnd his predecessor in No 10, former Labour PM Tony Blair, said Prince Philip was \"a man of foresight, determination and courage\" who was \"often way ahead of his time\", on issues such as the environment and \"reconciliation between religious faiths\".\nFormer Conservative PM Sir John Major also released a statement, saying: \"Modest to the core, and hating any kind of fuss or bother, [Prince Philip] epitomised the British spirit and remained true to himself right up to the very end.\""

      "text": "Leading travel industry figures have reacted with dismay to Boris Johnson's latest comments on the lockdown roadmap, saying they need more clarity.\nThe prime minister said he was \"hopeful\" that foreign travel could begin again on 17 May.\nBut he said more data was needed before a firm decision could be taken.\nThe Business Travel Association said the announcement was \"beyond disappointing\" and called for \"a clear pathway to international travel and trade\".\nIts chief executive, Clive Wratten, said moves to open borders had \"once again been kicked down the road\".\n\"The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement,\" he added.\nIn a Downing Street briefing on Monday, Mr Johnson said he did not want to see coronavirus re-imported from abroad and urged people to await a report from the Global Travel Taskforce on 12 April.\nMr Wratten called on the government to be \"confident in its roadmap\", adding: \"This is our last resort.\"\nOther travel industry bodies expressed similar discontent as they await further details of a risk-based \"traffic light\" system for foreign travel, due to be published later this week.\nUnder the system, no isolation would be necessary on return to the UK from \"green\" countries - although pre-departure and post-arrival tests would be required.\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: \"Whilst we support the establishment of a framework for restarting international travel and welcome the removal of self-isolation for arrivals from 'green countries', today's announcement does not provide the clarity we were seeking on the roadmap back towards normality. \n\"We await further details, but the measures indicated, including the potential for multiple tests for travellers even from 'green countries', will prevent meaningful travel even to low-risk destinations.\"\nMark Tanzer, chief executive of the Abta travel association, welcomed the traffic light system, but said: \"We need to see the details in the Global Travel Taskforce report before this can be assessed fully.\"\nHe added: \"It is vital that the government clarifies how the transition between green, amber and red levels will work, both to help travel businesses plan ahead and to provide reassurance for travellers. \n\"Destinations should not be suddenly closed off unless variants of concern dictate that this must happen.\"\nThe chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, Karen Dee, said she was \"disappointed\" that the prime minister \"continues to suggest significant barriers to international travel and may push back the date of restart beyond 17 May\".\nShe said a \"risk-based, proportionate system\" could \"open up aviation without quarantine and with affordable, rapid testing\"."

      "text": "People in England can start thinking about booking foreign holidays again this summer, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. \nBut he said the cost of the Covid tests required needed to be driven down, amid criticism from the travel industry. \nMr Shapps has also given more detail on the traffic light system which will see countries graded on their risk.\nPassengers will have to take the tests before leaving and on returning - even from low-risk \"green\" countries.\nThere will also be a watch list for countries most at risk of going from green to amber to provide greater assurance for those looking to travel abroad.\nAnnouncing the findings of the Global Travel Taskforce set up by the government to examine how leisure travel could be reopened safely after lockdown, Mr Shapps said foreign holidays would resume on 17 May at the earliest. \nHe told the BBC: \"This is the first time I'm able to come on and say I'm not advising against booking foreign holidays. \n\"Yes, you'll want to check what the situation is in two or three weeks' time when that list - the green, amber, red, is produced - you'll want to know that you've got good holiday insurance and flexible flights and the rest of it. \n\"But for the first time I think there is light at the end of the tunnel and we'll be able to restart international travel, including cruises by the way, in a safe and secure way, knowing about the vaccinations, everything we know about the disease this year, and of course that abundance of caution - having the tests in place.\"\nMr Shapps said the use of PCR tests - those needing to be sent to a lab - enabled scientists to detect potential variants of concern.\nBut he said he was \"concerned\" about the cost of the tests, adding that the government was committed to driving down the price of these by working with the private sector. \nThe transport secretary also said the government was looking at the possibility of people bringing pre-departure tests with them that they can use before boarding their return flight, pointing out that people are now able to order free lateral flow tests. \nOn Friday, the UK confirmed another 3,150 virus cases, and another 60 deaths of people who had tested positive in the past 28 days.\nMr Shapps said countries would be categorised based on level of infections and vaccinations, variants of concern and the quality of their genetic sequencing. \nHe said this list would be kept under constant review and that he was hopeful European countries would be upgraded as their vaccination rates improve. \nMr Shapps also said he was concerned about people who were separated from family members living overseas, saying it was \"possibly even more pressing than the holiday issue\".\nHe said families in the UK were \"uniquely spread across the world\", and the government wanted to make sure people were able to reunite. \nThe government has not yet said which countries will be green, amber or red - but said it would do so by early May. \nNearly 40 countries are currently on the UK government's red list of countries from which travel is banned, except for British and Irish nationals and those with residence rights in the UK.\nThe rules will be reviewed on 28 June to see whether any measures can be rolled back, the government said.\nFurther formal reviews will take place at \"checkpoints\" no later than 31 July and 1 October.\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the government had not outlined the traffic light system in detail and criticised the release of the plans while MPs are not sitting. \nHe told the BBC: \"The government has spoken about factors like vaccination rates, infection rates, the position with variants and also about the level of genomic sequencing. But I've no idea what the levels of each of those are for the government to place countries into, whether it's the green category, amber or red.\" \nThe first ministers of Scotland and Wales have both already argued that 17 May will be too early for foreign holidays to resume.\nNorthern Ireland has not yet announced its plans, but its chief medical officer has said it would be \"premature\" to book a foreign summer trip.\nIn other developments:\nAt the moment, almost anyone seeking to travel to England must first take a coronavirus test before departure and then two tests when they arrive, bought through a private provider. Children under 11 are exempt.\nConsumer group Which? estimated that each PCR test - which is just one of the tests needed - could cost about \u00a3120 per person.\nHowever, the government said it would work with airlines, travel firms and the test providers to see whether prices can be reduced. That could involve cheaper tests, or the government providing the pre-departure tests.\nThe government's plans have been met with mixed reaction from the travel industry."

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Windsor",
      "text": "Funeral preparations are under way for Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband, who died on Friday 9 April aged 99. \nThis is what we know about the event.\nThe ceremonial royal funeral will be held at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on Saturday 17 April. \nPrince Philip's body is now resting in the inner hall at Windsor Castle after being moved from its private chapel.\nThe duke is reported to have requested a funeral of minimal fuss and has not lain in state - where members of the public would have been able to view his coffin. \nThe procession and service will be televised - details below.\nCoronavirus restrictions in England mean only 30 people, socially distanced, are allowed to attend funerals. \nThe guest list includes members of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh's families, including three of his German relatives.\nPrince Harry will attend but his wife Meghan, who is pregnant, will not make the trip from the US, on medical advice. It is the first time the Duke of Sussex has returned to the UK since stepping down as a senior royal last year.\nAttendees are expected to wear masks in line with government advice. The pallbearers and clergy are not included in the number of attendees.\nThe duke will have a ceremonial funeral, rather than a state funeral. There is a subtle difference - state funerals are usually reserved for monarchs, although wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill was given a state funeral. The Queen Mother had a ceremonial funeral in 2002, as did Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. \nOn the day of the funeral, the coffin will be moved from the private chapel to the State Entrance of Windsor Castle. It will be placed on a modified Land Rover, that the duke himself helped design, to be carried the short distance to St George's Chapel.\nCoronavirus restrictions on crowds and numbers attending funerals mean the duke's ceremonial funeral will be much lower key than if it had happened in other times - although the Palace says this very much \"reflects the duke's wishes\" and it will still \"celebrate and reflect\" a life of service.\nLive online coverage of the procession and funeral begins on the BBC News website and app at 07:00 BST and the service will be streamed in the UK and internationally. \nTelevision coverage in the UK starts at 12:30 BST on Saturday on BBC One, the BBC News Channel and on BBC iPlayer.\nOn the radio, you can follow the day's events between 14:00 BST and 16:10 BST on Radio 4 and Radio 5 Live, and simulcast on BBC World Service English, BBC Radio Scotland, and BBC Radio Ulster. \nBBC Radio Wales and BBC local radio will also cover the event, with start times to be confirmed.\nBy 14:15 BST, the Quadrangle in Windsor Castle will be lined by the Household Cavalry and the Foot Guards, along with military detachments from units that had special connections with Prince Philip on the grass.\nFrom 14:20 BST, those members of the Royal Family and The Duke of Edinburgh's family not taking part in the procession leave Windsor Castle by car for St George's Chapel.\nAt 14:40 BST, the bands in the Quadrangle stop playing and the coffin will be carried out and placed onto the Land Rover.\nMembers of the Royal Family walking in the procession will leave the State Entrance after the coffin and take up their positions.\nBehind the Land Rover will be Princes Charles, Andrew, Edward and Princess Anne, as well as grandsons Princes William and Harry. They are joined by Princess Anne's son Peter Phillips, her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon. Members of the duke's staff will follow behind them, including his private secretary Brigadier Archie Miller Bakewell, a personal protection officer, two pages and two valets.\nAt 14:45 BST, the procession begins. Led by the band of the Grenadier Guards, the procession will move from the Quadrangle to Horseshoe Cloister. The band is followed by the Major General's party and military chiefs of staff. The Land Rover follows, flanked by pallbearers from the Royal Marines and other regiments and corps associated with the duke. The Royal Family members and staff follow behind.\nThe Queen will travel at the rear of the procession in the State Bentley and will enter St George's chapel through the Galilee porch.\nThe procession route will be lined by personnel from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, The Highlanders, 4th Battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Royal Air Force.\nGuns will be fired by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery from the East Lawn throughout, as a bell tolls in the Curfew Tower, at the west end of the castle. \nAt 14:53 BST, the Land Rover will arrive at West Steps of St George's Chapel, and be met by a guard of honour and band from the Rifles Regiment, who will play the national anthem.\nMembers of the Household Cavalry will line the West Steps and a Royal Navy \"piping party\" will pipe a nautical call known as \"the Still\" as the coffin is carried up the steps to the chapel.\nThe coffin, draped with the duke's standard, with a wreath and the duke's naval cap and sword on top, will be met by the dean of Windsor, together with the Archbishop of Canterbury, for the service.\nOnly the members of the Royal Family will enter the chapel - the rest of the procession will remain outside. \nAt 15:00 BST, a minute's silence will be held nationwide, in memory of the duke. \nThe start and end of the Silence will be signalled by a gun fired by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.\nInside the chapel, the funeral service will begin as the coffin is carried to the Quire, and placed on a platform called a catafalque. \nA small choir of four singers, who will be in the nave of the chapel, will sing pieces of music chosen by the duke.\nAfter the service, the duke will be interred in the royal vault.\nThe duke's coffin is draped in his personal flag, his standard. The flag represents elements of his life, from his Greek heritage to his British titles. \nWhen the duke got engaged to the then Princess Elizabeth in 1946, he renounced his Greek title and became a British citizen, taking his mother's anglicised name, Mountbatten.\nThe Mountbatten family is therefore also represented on the standard, alongside the castle from the arms of the City of Edinburgh - he became Duke of Edinburgh when he married.\nA number of objects personally selected by the duke will be displayed on cushions on the altar in St George's Chapel.\nThese include the duke's insignia - medals and decorations awarded to him by the UK and Commonwealth countries - his field marshal's baton, Royal Air Force wings and insignia from Denmark and Greece \nMembers of the public have been asked not to attend any of the funeral events, in line with public health advice.\nOn the Royal Family website, members of the public are asked to consider making a donation to a charity instead of leaving floral tributes in memory of the duke. An online book of condolence is also available for the public to post their personal tributes.\nThe period of national mourning ends on the day of the funeral.\nThe Royal Family will continue to observe mourning for another week - but members will attend engagements wearing black mourning bands where appropriate."

      "tags": "Copyright,Trainers,Lil Nas X,United States,Fashion,Nike, Inc.",
      "text": "Nike says the art collective which made \"Satan Shoes\" that purportedly contain a drop of human blood in the soles has agreed to issue a voluntary recall as part of a legal settlement.\nThe $1,018 (\u00a3740) trainers are modified Nike Air Max 97s. Only 666 pairs were made and all but one have been shipped.\nThe collective MSCHF will offer full refunds to customers in order to remove the shoes from circulation, Nike said.\nThe settlement resolves a trademark infringement lawsuit filed by Nike.\nThe controversial shoes were produced by the Brooklyn collective in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X, who held the last pair so he could choose the recipient. MSCHF said it would keep the final pair of shoes.\nNo further details were made public about the settlement, which includes the Jesus Shoes produced by MSCHF in 2019 also using the Air Max 97 as a base.\n\"MSCHF altered these shoes without Nike's authorisation. Nike had nothing to do with the Satan Shoes or the Jesus Shoes,\" Nike said in a statement.\nLimited edition shoes can fetch higher prices among collectors so it is not clear how many - if any - customers will return the products. \nNike sued MSCHF last week claiming the \"Satan Shoes [were] likely to cause confusion and dilution and create an erroneous association\" between MSCHF's products and the company. But MSCHF said the shoes were \"individually-numbered works of art\" and did not sow confusion.\nSiding with Nike, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order last Thursday.\nDavid Bernstein, from the intellectual property litigation group at Debevoise & Plimpton and a representative for MSCHF, said the artistic messages the collective hoped to convey were \"dramatically amplified\" by the lawsuit.\n\"MSCHF intended to comment on the absurdity of the collaboration culture practiced by some brands, and about the perniciousness of intolerance,\" he said in a statement as news of the settlement emerged, adding that MSCHF was \"pleased to have resolved the lawsuit\".\nMSCHF sold the black and red shoes in less than a minute last week. It coincided with the launch of Lil Nas X's latest song Montero (Call Me By Your Name), which had debuted on YouTube days earlier.\nThe song features the rapper, who came out as gay in 2019, celebrating his sexuality and rejecting attempts to shame him. In a heavily stylised music video, he slides down a pole from heaven to hell before dancing provocatively with Satan, then snaps his neck and steals his horns.\nThe imagery and the shoes both reference the Bible verse Luke 10:18 - \"So He told them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven'.\""

      "tags": "Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "George Floyd died from a lack of oxygen during his arrest, a doctor at the trial of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis has said.\nContradicting the defence, Dr Martin Tobin said fentanyl did not cause Mr Floyd's death. He said even a \"healthy person...would have died\".\nMr Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May.\nThe ex-officer is on trial for murder and has denied the charges against him.\nThe footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on African-American Mr Floyd's neck sparked global protests against racism.\nProsecutors are trying to prove Mr Chauvin's use of force resulted in Mr Floyd's death, while Mr Chauvin's defence are seeking to show he was following his training and that drugs may have caused Mr Floyd's death.\nThe trial is in its second week and is expected to last for at least one month. The defence is due to begin arguing its case in court next week.\nA toxicology report released last June said that Mr Floyd had the painkiller fentanyl and the drug methamphetamine in his system. \nSince then, the defence has argued that the fentanyl caused Mr Floyd's loss of oxygen.\nHowever Dr Tobin, an intensive care doctor, said that Mr Floyd's breathing did not slow down enough for the painkiller to have been a factor in his total loss of oxygen.\nForensic toxicologist Daniel Isenschmid, whose laboratory tested Mr Floyd's blood and urine samples following his death, said there was evidence that some of the fentanyl had metabolised, meaning that an overdose was less likely.\nThe defence also questioned Kentucky police surgeon Dr Bill Smock, an expert in forensic emergency medicine.\nDr Smock said Mr Floyd displayed \"air hunger\", a term for when the body becomes desperate for oxygen. While a fentanyl overdose can slow down breathing, he said people who are overdosing are not aware that they are lacking oxygen and often appear sleepy. In contrast, he said Mr Floyd appeared to be alert.\nOn cross-examination, he agreed with the defence that there was \"no safe\" amount of methamphetamine to be in someone's system, and that an overdose of methamphetamine and fentanyl combined may look different from fentanyl alone.\nDr Smock also told the court that while viewing the footage, he heard Mr Floyd complain about being unable to breathe before he was restrained on the ground.\nAsked about the positioning of the handcuffs behind Mr Floyd's back, coupled with the downward pressure of Mr Chauvin's weight against him, Dr Tobin - an expert in pulmonary medicine - said that Mr Floyd's ability to expand his chest to breathe was severely impaired.\nIt was, Dr Tobin said, like the left side of his chest was \"in a vice\".\nDr Tobin said the positioning of the handcuffs was also significant.\n\"It's how they're being pushed, where they are being pushed, that totally interfere with central features of how we breathe.\"\n\"[Mr Floyd] has used up his resources and is literally trying to breathe with his fingers and knuckles against the street to try to crank up his chest, to try to get air into his right lung,\" he added.\n\"You can see he's conscious, you can see slight flickering and then it disappears. One second he's alive, one second he's no longer.\"\nDr Tobin said that Mr Floyd had already shown signs of brain injury about four minutes before Mr Chauvin took his knee off his neck, and that a healthy person who was put through this \"would have died\" too.\nAbout three minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee, Dr Tobin said, there was \"not an ounce of oxygen left in his body\".\n\"The knee remains on the neck for another three minutes and 27 seconds after he takes his last breath,\" Dr Tobin said. \"After the officers have found themselves that there's no pulse, the knee remains on the neck for another two minutes and 44 seconds.\"\nDr Tobin used footage captured during Mr Floyd's arrest to provide his medical opinion on the ninth day of Mr Chauvin's trial.\nDuring his cross-examination, defence attorney Eric Nelson suggested that Dr Tobin's assessment was \"conditioned upon [Mr Floyd] being a healthy individual\".\n\"We understand that Mr Floyd had some heart disease,\" Mr Nelson said. \"That's going to affect blood flow in a person?\"\nDr Tobin said that if Mr Floyd had been suffering from a coronary condition at the time he would have been \"complaining of chest pain and demonstrating a very rapid respiratory rate,\" adding: \"We don't see either.\"\nThe court has heard from witnesses, medical experts and police officers. The moments leading to Mr Floyd's encounter with police, as well as the footage that sparked nationwide protests, have been closely scrutinised.\nThe early stages of the trial saw often tearful testimony from onlookers. The teenager whose video of the arrest went viral said \"it's been nights I stay up apologising and apologising to George Floyd for not doing more\".\nThis week the Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo said Mr Chauvin had violated the agency's policy on using force. An expert witness also said that the use of force was \"excessive\". \nThe defence has sought to show Mr Chauvin acted lawfully in a volatile situation. His lawyer said the evidence \"is clearly more than about nine minutes and 29 seconds,\" referring to the videos of Mr Floyd's death. \nThe jury's verdict must be unanimous and US police officers are rarely convicted or charged at all for deaths that occur in custody."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "tags": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh",
      "text": "Prince Philip's close association with Scotland started in his school days and lasted more than 80 years.\nAccording to his headmaster's report, the prince was universally trusted and liked at Gordonstoun school in the north east of Scotland.\nThe future Duke of Edinburgh attended the boarding school in Moray until 1939.\nIn the early 1930s, Prince Philip of Greece, as he then was, had attended Salem School in Germany.\nIt was founded by Dr Kurt Hahn, a German Jew who was a famous educational innovator. The school focused on military discipline and physical education, as well as academia.\nHowever, Dr Hahn fled Germany after he was arrested for speaking out against Hitler. He established Gordonstoun as the British version of Salem - and Prince Philip followed him there two terms later.\n\"The school played an enormous part in both his early life, and also his way of life,\" said James Thomas, from Gordonstoun.\n\"His enthusiasm for the school came through. When he came through Gordonstoun's gates, people generally said he had a spring in his step and he was delighted to get back and visit old haunts.\n\"He was always entirely relaxed whenever he came.\"\nPrince Philip loved his time at Gordonstoun. He excelled at sport, captaining the hockey and cricket teams, and also served as head of school.\nIn fact, he found the regime so invigorating that he later sent his three sons - although Prince Charles did not share his father's enthusiasm for the austere establishment, describing it as \"absolute hell\".\nPrince Philip became the Duke of Edinburgh on the eve of his wedding to Princess Elizabeth, on 20 November 1947. It is a title which had been conferred upon members of the British royal family only four times since its creation in 1726.\nThe future Queen Elizabeth was known as the Duchess of Edinburgh until she became queen in 1952.\nThe Balmoral estate in Royal Deeside provided a haven for the Queen and her consort through the decades, and the family holidayed there every summer.\nThe Queen is said to have described it as \"my dear paradise in the Highlands\".\nIn 1956, not long after the royal couple married, Prince Philip launched the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, inspired by the Moray Badge which he had worked for while a pupil at Gordonstoun.\nDr Hahn had started the scheme, aimed at giving post-war youngsters in Britain a sense of achievement, and he approached one of his first and most famous Gordonstoun pupils for help in rolling it out across the country.\nTogether he and Prince Philip drew up an outline of what would become the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which more than four million people from some 60 countries have taken part in since its inception.\nJanet Shepherd, the former head of the award scheme in Scotland, said the Prince's presentations to thousands of Scottish youngsters were an annual ritual at the Palace of Holyrood in Edinburgh.\n\"I would often spend the whole day with him,\" she said.\n\"You always were a bit nervous on the day, no matter how many times you did it. But he soon put you at ease. I never found him difficult or awkward.\n\"He was always very interested in what the young people were doing. There was always laughter and a tremendous warmth.\"\nPrince Philip had a close involvement with the city whose title he bears. He spent 57 years as Chancellor of Edinburgh University, a role he only retired from in 2010.\nThe university's former principal, Prof Timothy O'Shea, said the prince was an unforgettable character who made a tremendous contribution.\n\"He was very actively involved in the university,\" he said.\n\"He presided at special graduation ceremonies, he would help me induct the new professors, he came along for senior staff getting long service awards. He even came to the installation of the rector by the students.\"\nProf O'Shea said Prince Philip liked \"a certain amount of student wildness\". \n\"He was reminiscing with me about riotous installations of the rector, with students throwing flour and doing all sorts of things,\" he recalled.\n\"He asked me when the next one was and I said I would let him know. The administration and other colleagues said you mustn't tell him, but I felt honour-bound to.\n\"He immediately, despite attempts from the Special Branch, insisted he came along for some uproar.\n\"In the event it was quite mild. And he remonstrated with me afterwards, that I'd made it too orderly.\"\nProf O'Shea said the prince was very straight-talking, humorous and would often tease him.\nIt was a trait for which he was well known, having famously asked a driving instructor in Oban how he \"managed to keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test\".\nThe principal said he would be greatly missed by the university community and by the city as a whole.\n\"When I started he explained to me that he'd been the chancellor for more than 50 years and if I had any problems I should tell him.\n\"He was a part of the city's life in the way the Lord Provost is part of the city's life.\n\"He was very jolly - meals with the chancellor were always great fun. He was a visible, positive presence.\"\n."

      "text": "As news of Prince Philip's death spread, people made their way to Buckingham Palace to pay tribute and reflect on the duke's life - and the Queen's loss.\nSome teenagers on hired bikes pull up next to a police officer asking for directions to Oxford Circus. \nBefore cycling off, one calls out: \"Is there any way you can say 'hello' to the Queen for us?\"\nNo matter young or old, there doesn't seem to be a soul outside the palace on the day of Prince Philip's death who doesn't feel deep sympathy and sorrow for the Queen.\n\"I don't think you have to be a rampant royalist to just feel really sad for the Queen,\" says 56-year-old Louise Simester, from Bedfordshire.\nShe took her teenage daughters on a diversion from a trip to the Covid memorial wall to Buckingham Palace, via an unsuccessful hunt to buy  flowers, to round off what's been a day of reflection for her family.\nDaisy, her 17-year-old daughter, who says she's \"no royalist\", has been surprised by just how shocked she was by the news.\n\"All my friends were quite shocked,\" she says. \"I've never experienced a royal death.\" \nFor mum Louise, being outside the palace brought memories of Princess Diana's death in 1997 flooding back. \n\"I brought flowers for Diana. I remember it like it was yesterday. I remember people sobbing - I was crying myself,\" she recalls, clutching her hand to her chest.\nAs we talk, a steady flow of families, friends, children, even a woman on roller blades, line up in the spring sunshine to lay white roses, yellow tulips and unopened lilies beside the gleaming black and gold palace fence.\nFor every bouquet laid, the moment is captured by a vast bank of photographers, camera crews and bystanders with their own mobile phones straining against a thick cordon erected by police officers.\nAttached to the flowers are messages of gratitude for the duke's decades of service: \"You'll be missed by an entire nation. You were one of a kind,\" says one. Another acknowledges the sacrifices the duke made. \"Farewell Prince Philip - I have a huge amount of respect for a man that can swallow his pride to dedicate his life to supporting the Queen.\"\nThe Royal Family did ask people to consider making a charity donation instead of leaving flowers and the government has urged people not to gather at the palace in breach of coronavirus regulations. However, that message had not reached everyone on Friday afternoon.\nRhea Varma, from Pimlico, pulls up on her bike to lay a bouquet alongside a note saying \"Rest in Peace Duke, love the Varma family\". \n\"It's just super sad,\" she says. To her, the duke represented \"the kind of stability that's so old-fashioned, it's difficult to comprehend. \n\"He was a rock who brought integrity,\" she adds.\nKalenza Jennings, 43, from Belsize Park, has brought white roses and carnations on behalf of her family after her husband texted her with the news. \nShe's here with her best friend, who's also from Thailand. Prince Philip is their hero, they say. \"He's a good man and a faithful man,\" says Kalenza, a personal shopper at Heathrow. \"We love the Queen, and we want to say we're sorry she's lost the man she loves.\"\nPeter Chan, a student from Hong Kong, was exercising around Buckingham Palace when he heard the news. \n\"I really feel Prince Philip was a nice man and he saved the country,\" he says, after laying a bunch of white flowers bearing a note in his mother tongue together with an English translation: \"To commemorate Prince Philip's life on behalf of Hong Kong people in the UK.\"\nHe reflects the last few months will have been especially hard for the Queen, with Prince Philip going into hospital and living through the pandemic. \nWith a hand on his heart, the 26-year-old says from behind his face mask: \"I'm very sympathetic to the Queen. It's really hard to say how I feel, it's really from the heart.\"\nAdam Wharton-Ward, 36, was similarly affected and felt moved to \"rally round\" for the Queen's sake.\n\"He's been with her for 73 years. If it wasn't for him, who knows if she would have got through it,\" he says, moments after propping a bunch of lilies by the palace gates. \nThe duke's appeal, he says, is he was \"almost normal... with his gaffes\".  \"Now that normality has gone.\"\nDoes he think the duke's death might signal change for the Royal Family's place in British life? \"I think it could be almost the other way. They don't need change,\" says Adam.\nRhea Varma thinks otherwise: \"I think it might be the beginning of big change in our country. Without him, the Queen might not reign much longer.\"\nBut an older woman, who's rushing past after paying her respects, says the duke's death is \"the beginning of the changing of the guard\" - but a change she's not happy to see any time soon.\nAnd, as the Sun begins to duck behind the cloud and crowds make their way to the Tube stations, they'll be more moments to reflect. \nWhere adverts for shoes and banks stood only yesterday in London Underground stations, there are now poster-sized portraits of a younger duke in military uniform beside the dates 1921-2021."

      "tags": "Belfast,Belfast City Council,Brandon Lewis",
      "text": "Nineteen officers were injured on Thursday night, bringing the number hurt in a week of violence across Northern Ireland to 74.\nPolice deployed water cannon for the first time in six years after coming under attack again in Belfast.\nCrowds rioted on both sides of gates that separate a loyalist area and a nationalist area in west Belfast.\nPetrol bombs, fireworks and stones were again used to attack police, who have faced rising disorder since 29 March. \nAssistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said that on Thursday night there was \"sustained violence directed towards police officers on both sides of the interface over a period of hours\".\nHe said the majority of injuries to officers were to hearing due to fireworks being detonated close to them, one female officer suffered a broken bone in her foot.\nTwo men, aged 24 and 32, have been charged with riot, in connection with disorder in Lanark Way in west Belfast on Thursday.\nThey are due to appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Saturday.\nThe 32-year-old man was also charged with possession of a petrol bomb in suspicious circumstances. \nNI Secretary Brandon Lewis has met political leaders at Stormont to discuss the latest night of disorder and violence in Belfast.\nThe five main party leaders were on the call, along with Simon Byrne, the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\nBBC News NI understands all politicians reiterated their support for the police and agreed to hold further discussions about bringing the trouble to an end.\nSome of the parties are also holding separate meetings with the Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on Friday. \nKerbs and bollards were ripped up, their remnants turned into weapons. \nPolice responded by regularly firing their water cannon, but the soaking didn't seem to stop many of the rioters.\nOn the nationalist Springfield Road side, police Land Rovers moved up towards the rioters, weaving their way through traffic which was basically stuck in the road for a couple of hours. \nPolice came under attack too in the Shankill Road area from petrol bombs and stone throwers.\nWe asked a few people from the community to speak, but they were reluctant.\nAfter midnight the streets were largely clear, but many people are feeling a fresh and familiar sense of worry that there could be renewed potential for more disorder, more disruption and more destruction.\nThe recent disorder began with petrol bombs and sporadic attacks in a number of mainly loyalist areas, but the unrest spread to a Belfast interface. \nOn Wednesday night, the fighting escalated into sectarian clashes over a so-called peace wall in west Belfast.\nCrowds attacked police and each other at the junctions of Lanark Way, off the mainly loyalist Shankill Road, and the mainly nationalist Springfield Road.\nThe peace wall divides predominantly Protestant loyalists - who are in favour of keeping Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom - from predominantly Catholic nationalists who want to see a united Ireland.\nA gate that divides the two communities was smashed open and, during several hours of disorder, police officers and a press photographer were attacked and a bus was hijacked and burned.\nThe group which represents loyalist paramilitary groups has said none of them has been involved \"directly or indirectly\" in any of the recent street disorder in parts of Northern Ireland. \nThe Loyalist Communities Council, whose membership includes the UDA and UVF, says people have a right to protest against the Brexit Irish Sea border, but it should be \"entirely peaceful\".\nIt also urged people not to get drawn into violent confrontations.\nIn a statement, it said it is seeking an end to all violence and to solve concerns about the Brexit deal.\nOn Thursday night, SDLP councillor Paul Doherty joined a number of political, community and youth representatives on the Springfield Road after crowds of youths gathered in the area. \n\"We stood at the main interface area creating a barrier almost between these youths and the gate at Lanark Way,\" he told Good Morning Ulster.\n\"They attempted to breach the gate several times, but when it was clear that they weren't going to gain access to this area they proceeded to attack police further up the Springfield Road.\"\nHe added: \"From being on the ground last night and trying to engage with these young people, I'm also noticing that they're coming from all over Belfast, really, to be involved in these acts of violence.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in councillor Claire Canavan said it was \"the actions of the previous night that brought the young people out onto the street on the Springfield Road\".\n\"I would appeal for calm going forward into the weekend.\"\nBilly Hutchison, a Progressive Unionist Party councillor for the Greater Shankill area, said fewer people were involved in the disturbances on Thursday night, compared to Wednesday.\n\"I think a lot of things that have been said over the last five or six days have been around for a long time,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"We need to start thinking about the language we use, we need to start thinking about the information we give out in our communities and we need to support the communities.\n\"I'm hoping that we're over it and I'm hoping that people will see sense. It [violence] doesn't further the unionist cause, it doesn't further our neighbourhoods.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson and Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin have spoken over the phone and called for a calming of tensions.\nThe US has also appealed for calm, with the White House saying it was concerned by the violence.\nWhen the disorder began last week in loyalist areas of the Northern Ireland it was linked to a decision not to prosecute Sinn F\u00e9in leaders for breaching Covid regulations at a funeral last June and tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal.\nThe violence in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey over the Easter weekend was linked to police operations targeting the South East Antrim UDA, a paramilitary group involved in organised crime.\nSpeaking on Friday following two nights of violence at the west Belfast interface, ACC Roberts said of the hundreds who took part some were \"operating independently\", while some would be close to or involved in paramilitary organisations.\n\"It is not our overall assessment that those organisations as a group are directing young people to get involved or orchestrating the disorder,\" he added.\nMr Lewis, who travelled to Belfast on Thursday, has denied that the UK government has abandoned unionists through the new Brexit arrangements.\nIreland's Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Coveney, said Dublin and Westminster will support Stormont parties in stabilising the unrest.\nIn a tweet on Thursday night, Justice Minister Naomi Long said it was \"utterly reckless and depressing to see more violence at interface areas tonight\".\n\"My heart goes out to those living in the area who are living with this fear and disturbance.\"\nWriting on social media, Labour's shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Louise Haigh called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to \"urgently rebuild trust that he has squandered in Northern Ireland\"."

      "tags": "Volodymyr Zelensky,Russia,Nato,Ukraine conflict,Vladimir Putin,Ukraine",
      "text": "A top Russian official has warned that Moscow could intervene to help Russian-speaking residents in eastern Ukraine if Ukraine launches an all-out assault on separatists there. \nRussian-backed separatist rebels and Ukrainian troops have been clashing in the east of the country.\nRussia has also been building up troops on the border with Ukraine. \nThe official, Dmitry Kozak, said that Russian forces could intervene to \"defend Russian citizens\".  \n\"Everything depends on the scale of the conflagration,\" he said. He is deputy head of Russia's presidential administration. \nHe also warned that an escalation could mark the \"beginning of the end\" for Ukraine - \"not a shot in the leg, but in the face\".\nThe Ukrainian military says one of its soldiers was killed on Thursday by shooting from the separatists. The rebels used machine-guns, grenades and mortars several times and Ukrainian forces fired back, the military was quoted as saying.\nThe Ukrainian army commander, Gen Ruslan Khomchak, said \"we see the build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine's state border. \n\"However, this does not mean that our country is being encircled. The situation is under control.\" \nEarlier the rebels said one of their fighters was killed when Ukrainian troops fired mortars at a village on the outskirts of the city of Donetsk. \nThe United States and Germany have both expressed concern at the increase in tensions. \nRussia has been increasing the number of troops at the Ukrainian border, but at the same time maintains that they should not be seen as a threat. \nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Russian troop numbers there were the highest since 2014, when the conflict in eastern Ukraine began. She described the situation as \"deeply concerning\". \nRussia has not detailed troop numbers, but the Ukrainian military asserted at the end of March that some 20,000 Russian troops had been moved towards Ukraine's border. Video has emerged on social media of Russian trains moving heavy weaponry, apparently towards the region. \nFor months there have been sporadic clashes between Ukrainian troops and the Moscow-backed rebels in the Donbas region, violating a fragile ceasefire daily. \nUkraine says 25 of its troops have been killed in the conflict zone so far this year, and 50 died in the whole of last year. \nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the region on Thursday to see \"the locations of the escalation\" and \"be with our soldiers in the tough times in Donbas\". \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the conflict in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.\nShe urged Russia to \"de-escalate tensions\" by pulling troops back, while Mr Putin accused Ukraine of inflaming the situation in the east. \nIn Moscow, Mr Kozak likened the current situation of the separatists to Srebrenica, the town in Bosnia-Herzegovina where 8,000 Muslim men were killed by Bosnian Serb forces in 1995. \n\"If, as our president says, there is a Srebrenica there, we shall probably have to come to their defence,\" Mr Kozak said. \nPresident Putin first suggested in 2019 that Russian-speaking residents might suffer a Srebrenica-like massacre if Ukraine regained full control of Donbas without guarantees. He has always made it clear the Russian state reserves the right to defend ethnic Russians abroad, and in 2019 signed a law making it easier for people in separatist areas to obtain Russian passports.\nThere is no sign that Ukraine is preparing any such Bosnian Serb-style \"ethnic cleansing\" campaign. \nMr Kozak suggested the rebels could hold their own for now against Ukrainian forces, as they consisted of \"battle-hardened units\". \nThe roots of the conflict go back to March 2014, when Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych had fled the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in February, after massive street demonstrations and clashes. \nRussia's military intervention sparked a major rift with Western nations, prompting the European Union and the US to impose sanctions on Russia. \nA month later, Russian-backed rebels in the mainly Russian-speaking Donbas seized much of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. \nWestern governments and Nato accused Russia of sending regular troops over the border into Ukraine, but Russia maintains any Russian fighters there are \"volunteers\".  \nUkraine's President Zelensky came to power promising to bring about peace, and a ceasefire was signed last July. Both sides have since accused each other of violating it. \nThe conflict is estimated to have killed 14,000 people. "

      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh's children have shared their reflections on their father's life, his \"astonishing achievement\" and his legacy.\nThe Prince of Wales told the BBC \"his energy was astonishing in supporting my mama, and doing it for such a long time\".\n\"He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life,\" said the Earl of Wessex.\nThe Princess Royal praised the \"double act\" he created with the monarch.\nAnd the Duke of York fondly recalled Prince Philip as a father spending time with his family.\n\"Like any other family at the time, your parents went out to work during the day but in the evening - just the same as any other family - we would get together, we would sit on the sofa as a group and he would read to us,\" Prince Andrew said.\nThe royals were speaking in interviews to mark the Duke of Edinburgh's death as part of a BBC special programme billed as a tribute \"from those who knew him best\".\nPrince Charles told the programme: \"I think he'll probably want to be remembered as an individual in his own right.\"\nReflecting on his father's difficult upbringing after his family was exiled, he said: \"It can't have been easy and life was uncertain and everyone had to rely on other people to help - and presumably he had to fall back on himself.\"\nThis uncertain upbringing left him with the \"extraordinary ability\" to be positive and move on from adversity, said Princess Anne.\nPrince Charles spoke of the \"huge value\" his father found in his education at Gordonstoun under its founder Kurt Hahn, an unconventional figure who emphasised self-reliance and risking - and who partly inspired the creation of the Duke of Edinburgh's award.\nMoving from a career in the Royal Navy to become royal consort was \"an incredible challenge\", Princess Anne said. \"In the Royal Navy he was in charge of ships, he was making all the decisions. In his next life, he was making very few.\"\nBut Prince Andrew, who served in the navy during the Falklands War, said he had never had any discussions with his father about whether he would have stayed on in the service. \"He saw his role as supporting the Queen,\" the prince said.\nPrincess Anne spoke of how his appreciation of how he could help the Queen \"always seemed to be present\" and was vital because she succeeded to the throne so young. \n\"They needed to be a double act for a lot of that time to allow her to take on that role,\" she said.\nPrince Edward recalled a \"lovely moment\" when his mother was able to pay tribute to his father at the 50th anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, by giving the organisation a Royal Charter.\n\"It probably meant more to my mother anyway. My father is far too modest to be remotely interested in all that sort of thing, he would brush it off,\" the prince said.\nHe said the award was a result of Prince Philip's belief \"that if you could tap into what a young person's passion was, that would drive them forward in terms of their life and their success\".\nPrince Edward said he was \"a great source of support and encouragement and guidance all the way through\" while Princess Anne added: \"I think I will best remember him as always being there and a person you could bounce off ideas, but if you were having problems you could always go to him.\"\nPrince Philip's legendary \"directness\" was inherited from his mother, Prince Charles explained with an anecdote.\nHis mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was buried in Jerusalem, where she is also honoured at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial as \"Righteous Among the Nations\" for protecting Jews at her house in Athens during World War Two.\n\"My father said, but hang on, how are we ever going to visit your grave?\" the Prince of Wales recalled. \"She said, don't be so silly, there's a very good bus service from Athens.\"\nThe Duke of Edinburgh \"did not suffer fools gladly\", Prince Charles said, which \"made one choose your words carefully\".\nPrince Edward said had taken on a challenging role \"with the most extraordinary flair, and the most extraordinary tact and diplomacy - he's never, ever tried to overshadow the Queen in any way, shape or form. \n\"He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life. Certainly within his family that was exactly the same.\"\n\"His energy was astonishing, in supporting my mama, and doing it for such a long time,\" said Prince Charles. \"What he's done has amounted to an astonishing achievement, I think.\""

      "text": "Victoria Spence says she fell into a \"deep, dark hole\" about her own body image as a teenager, leading to her developing an eating disorder. \nFrom staring at pictures of \"girls with thigh gaps\" on social media to having her weight shared during a science class, she eventually hit rock bottom, telling her mum that she had begun to hate herself. \nBut when Victoria's parents tried to seek help, her doctor told her that her Body Mass Index (BMI) wasn't low enough for treatment. \n\"I came away and just got worse and worse and worse, because I saw what the doctor said to me as 'you are not thin enough yet, there is still more to go, you should still lose weight',\" the 26-year-old from Manchester told the BBC.\nAfter seeking private treatment and her parents being warned she could die, Victoria is on the road to recovery and shares her story on Instagram with over 100,000 followers, offering support to others. \nShe is now backing the findings of an inquiry by MPs calling for BMI to be scrapped.\nThe report from the Women and Equalities Committee has also branded the government's obesity strategy \"dangerous\", saying some of the measures - such as calorie labels on menus - could affect those with, or at risk of developing, eating disorders.\nThe government says NHS England does not support the use of \"BMI thresholds\" and that its approach is \"guided by the latest research and emerging evidence\".\nBMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight by the square of their height. \nIt gives a number that then fits on a scale, concluding whether someone is underweight, a healthy weight, overweight or obese. \nBut while it is a simple tool, a number of scientists have questioned its validity as a measure of a person's health, saying other factors are not included and it is based on the physique of a European man.\nDuring its inquiry into body image, the committee looked into BMI and concluded it \"inspires weight stigma\".\nIts report said for those with higher BMIs, serious medical issues were being disregarded as simply the patient being \"overweight\" and patients were being made to feel \"shamed\" into losing weight.\nIt also pointed to stories like Victoria's, saying some GPs had \"an over-reliance on BMI, particularly when diagnosing eating disorders\". \nCommittee chair Caroline Nokes said the measure needed to be scrapped and replaced with a \"health at every size\" approach instead.\nThe Tory MP added: \"We know BMI is an absolutely lousy measure of good health in an individual. It works as an average across populations, but for individuals, it really doesn't help at all.\n\"We have seen instances of people who have been refused treatments because their BMI is too high or they have been refused access to eating disorder services because their BMI isn't low enough - and what a dreadful target that is to set anyone with an eating disorder. \n\"We want young people to be enjoying their childhood, we want them to be healthy and active, not obsessing over numbers like BMI.\" \nThe call was backed by eating disorder charity Beat, which said BMI \"should never be used as the sole factor in diagnosing eating disorders, or for determining who is 'unwell enough' to access treatment\".\nIts director of external affairs, Tom Quinn, said: \"This can lead to potentially dangerous delays, and can drive people deeper into eating disorders in order to be taken seriously.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said that NHS England \"had been clear it does not support the use of BMI thresholds\".\nHealth Minister Nadine Dorries also acknowledged to the committee that there was \"good and bad\" in the use of BMI - although she said doctors needed to gauge whether a person is a healthy weight or not.\nThe report also criticised the government's obesity strategy, saying it was \"at best ineffective and at worst perpetuating unhealthy behaviours\".\nBoris Johnson unveiled his plan in July 2020 amid the pandemic, saying it would \"reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus\".\nIt included banning \"buy one get one free\" deals on unhealthy food, as well as restrictions on where those foods can be promoted in-store, and new rules for displaying calories on menus.\nBut the committee said there had been no reviews of the effectiveness of the current or previous obesity strategies before the plan was published, and called for an urgent review to examine the evidence behind the measures.\nOther conclusions of the report included:\nMs Nokes said: \"The government must ensure its policies are not contributing to body image pressures.\"\nResponding to the committee's report, a Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the government's approach was \"guided by the latest research and emerging evidence\".\nShe added: \"We know poor body image can be a factor in disordered eating for both men and women and we are committed to improving outcomes for those with eating disorders and related mental health issues - with record funding to expand dedicated services in the community.\"\nBut, she added: \"With over six in 10 adults overweight or living with obesity, it is important that we take action to help people live healthier lives.\"\nIf you need support with an eating disorder, visit the BBC Action Line website for details of organisations that can help.

      "text": "Amazon appears likely to be headed to victory over activists hoping to establish the company's first unionised warehouse in the US.\nVotes against the effort held a more than 2 to 1 lead, in an early tally of almost half the ballots on Thursday. \nThe National Labor Relations Board will continue the count on Friday. \nThe contest is seen as a key test for the e-commerce giant, which has faced global criticism for its treatment of workers during the pandemic.\nLast month, US President Joe Biden called the vote by workers at the warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama a \"vitally important choice\". \nCelebrities and national Democratic politicians have travelled to the state to support the union campaign, which even drew some Republican backing.\nA total of 3,125 ballots were cast in the election, according to the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which was behind the unionisation effort.\nThat was a higher turnout than organisers had anticipated, representing just over half of the nearly 6,000 people employed at the warehouse. \nHundreds of the votes were challenged by Amazon and union representatives, but an incomplete count of uncontested ballots conducted by labour officials on Thursday showed that at least 1,100 workers voted against the union effort, compared to less than 500 votes in favour of unionising. \nRWDSU leaders had hoped that a victory would set a new standard for the firm's hundreds of thousands of workers across the country. \nIf successful, the union drive would mean Amazon, the second largest employer in the US, would have to negotiate a contract with union officials on issues such as work rules and pay.\nBut analysts had warned that the union faced an uphill battle in the election.\nUnion membership has steadily dwindled in America in recent decades - just 6% of private sector workers belonged to a trade union in 2020.\nSuspicion of organised labour runs especially deep in conservative states like Alabama.\nIn Bessemer, a city with a population of 27,000 outside Birmingham, the opening of the Amazon plant last year was hailed as a welcome jobs creator, for a town hit hard by the closure of manufacturing plants in the 1980s.\nAmazon had also fiercely opposed the unionisation drive. At mandatory staff meetings, in text messages and online, the e-commerce giant argued that it offered competitive pay and benefits.\nIt said the union would charge members hundreds of dollars in dues, without being able to make meaningful change.\nIn a statement on Thursday, RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said the union would call on the labour board \"to hold Amazon accountable for its illegal and egregious behaviour during the campaign\".\n\"Our system is broken, Amazon took full advantage of that,\" he said. \"But make no mistake about it - this still represents an important moment for working people and their voices will be heard.\"\nIn media interviews prior to the vote, pro-union workers had said the company frequently denied staff breaks, changed schedules unexpectedly and intrusively monitored their activities.\nUnion organisers had also tied the fight at the warehouse - where the majority of workers are black - to broader issues of civil rights and racial justice."

      "tags": "Swansea Bay University Health Board,Merthyr Tydfil,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of deaths involving Covid-19 has fallen for the 10th week in a row in Wales - and  is at its lowest weekly total since the start of October.\nThere were 32 deaths involving the virus, accounting for 4.9% of all deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThis is 17 fewer deaths than registered in the previous week.\nIt takes the total number of deaths since the pandemic began more than a year ago to 7,804.\nDuring the latest week, up to 26 March, there were 12 deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area and six in Cardiff and Vale.\nWhen broken down by local authority area, there were no deaths involving Covid registered in six counties: Blaenau Gwent, Ceredigion, Denbighshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Swansea and Torfaen.\nThere were six deaths involving care home residents with Covid, which is the lowest weekly total since mid-October.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are now below the five-year average for the fourth successive week.\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in a typical year is seen as a reliable measure of the  pandemic.\nThe number of deaths in Wales rose to 651 in the week ending 26 March. This was still 26 deaths (3.8%) fewer than the five-year average.\nWhen looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 40,726 deaths from all causes, 7,796 mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate. This was 5,991 deaths above the five-year average.\nWhen deaths occurring up to 26 March but counting later registrations are included, the total number of deaths involving Covid rises to 7,804.\nWe can see the peak of the second wave came on 11 January, when there were 83 deaths involving Covid.\nThis was higher than the peak in the first wave, when there were 73 deaths on 12 April.\nONS found across England and Wales, the biggest decrease in the latest week was in deaths of those in their early 80s. While more than 61% of deaths involving Covid were in people aged 75 years and over, the proportion has been decreasing.\nONS takes longer to report deaths than Public Health Wales (PHW), because it waits for deaths to be registered. \nBut this is regarded as giving a fuller picture.\nThese count Covid when it is mentioned on death certificates by doctors, who either suspect or confirm it as a contributory factor in a death. But it is estimated that in Wales, around 85% of deaths where Covid is mentioned, it is the underlying cause of death - so these deaths are due to Covid.\nUnlike the PHW \"snapshot\" daily report, the ONS figures involve deaths in not only hospitals and care homes, but in hospices and people's own homes."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Taylor Swift,Music",
      "text": "Most pop stars, if pressed, will tell you they don't listen to their old records.\nYears later, they can still hear all the imperfections, the missed opportunities, the things they'd have done differently.\nSo when Taylor Swift announced plans to re-record all of her first six albums, starting with 2008's Fearless, it seemed likely that she'd take the opportunity to rewrite history. \nAfter all, one of the best tracks on Fearless, the lilting Fifteen, is about going back in time to \"tell yourself what you know now.\"\nBut somehow she's resisted that temptation. Fearless (Taylor's Version) is an almost perfect replica of the original, right down to the giggle Swift lets slip in the middle of Hey Stephen.\nThe new recordings are cleaner, perhaps. It's easier to pick out little details like Swift dampening the strings of her guitar on White Horse, or the rattle of the hi-hats on Forever And Always. \nMost impressively, Swift seems to have regressed her voice to its teenage state. The maturity she discovered on last year's folk-pop masterpieces Folklore and Evermore is gone. In its place is a wide-eyed innocence that the album's giddy recollections of prom dates and first kisses requires. \nWith everything the star has been through in the last 13 years - from failed relationships to public vilification and a career resurrection - it's an impressive feat. It would be fascinating to know how she pulled it off: Was it simply a technical process of studying the original tapes, or did she delve deep into her psyche to find a former version of herself? Either way, it's hard to overstate the complexity of pulling it off.\nOne song that does seem to have been tweaked is, appropriately enough, called Change. \nLeading into the final chorus, Swift corrects her pronunciation of the word \"revolution\" and adds additional harmonies on the closing \"hallelujahs\". It's a subtle tweak, but it gives the song's climax a little more oomph.\nOverall, the experience is a bit like hearing Fearless on a brand new pair of headphones. Minor details stand out because your brain is attuned to the novelty of having \"a new thing\". A week from now, the new versions will seem indistinguishable from the originals.\nAnd that is the point. Swift's decision to re-make her old music isn't an exercise in vanity, it's about taking back control.\nThe backstory is complicated - but here's a brief overview: Swift's recording career started in 2005, when she signed a 12-year deal with Nashville's Big Machine Recordings. Her first album went seven-times platinum in the US and after switching lanes to pop music on 2012's Red, she became a global superstar in the process.\nIn 2018, she signed a new deal with Universal Records, and Big Machine sold the rights to Swift's first six albums to Scooter Braun - Kanye West's former manager, whom Swift claimed had \"bullied\" her for years. \nBraun later sold the rights to an investment fund for an estimated $300m, although he reportedly retains a financial interest in the music.\nSwift was incensed that he would profit from her records, characterising the sale as an act of aggression that \"stripped me of my life's work\".\nShe immediately began blocking requests for her old songs to be used in films and TV shows - thwarting one potential source of revenue - and vowed to re-record her back catalogue entirely.\nIn doing so, she regains control of her songs - with the hope that the new versions will \"replace\" the originals on streaming services and download stores. \nSo far, the plan seems to be working. Dedicated Swifties have flocked to the new version of Fearless, sending it to number one on iTunes within hours of its release. \nThey've been enticed by the inclusion of 14 bonus tracks, six of which are previously-unreleased songs from the era. (Among them is the casually-scathing Mr Perfectly Fine, supposedly written about her relationship with Joe Jonas, which the star's wife Sophie Turner has described as \"not NOT a bop\").\nBut once the excitement settles down, will fans stick with the new recordings, or go back to the beloved originals? Swift will undoubtedly be watching to see what happens next.\nNME: \"Swift never cringes away from her younger self. Instead, she revisits the songs with kindness and affection, celebrating the success of her teenage releases.\"\nVariety: \"The 18-year-old Taylor Swift is a great place to visit, but Folklore and Evermore are the places you'll want to return to and live, unless you have an especially strong sentimental attachment to Fearless.\"\nClash: \"Like a restored photograph brightening from black and white into colour, Fearless (Taylor's Version) is the same, but better.\"\nThe Guardian: \"Swift has resisted any temptation to alter the songs' pop-country arrangements or lyrics, even when the latter could have used a nip and tuck.\"\nLA Times: \"As for the lightweight bonus material... none of it argues that it deserved a place on Fearless, though Mr Perfectly Fine comes close.\"\nThe Telegraph: \"Fearless was always an exceptionally fine album of country-pop songs, detailing the romantic fixations of a wholesome teenage American girl on the verge of adulthood, and guess what? It still is.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "He outlived nearly everyone who knew him and might explain him.\nAnd so we have been left with a two-dimensional portrait of the duke; salt-tongued and short-tempered, a man who told off-colour jokes and made politically incorrect remarks, an eccentric great-uncle who'd been around forever and towards whom most people felt affection - but who rather too often embarrassed himself and others in company.\nWith his death will come reassessment. Because Prince Philip was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life; a life intimately connected with the sweeping changes of our turbulent 20th Century, a life of fascinating contrast and contradiction, of service and some degree of solitude. A complex, clever, eternally restless man.\nHis mother and father met at the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. At a time when all but four of Europe's nations were monarchies, his relatives were scattered through European royalty. Some royal houses were swept away by World War One; but the world into which Philip was born was still one where monarchies were the norm. His grandfather was the King of Greece; his great-aunt Ella was murdered along with the Russian tsar, by the Bolsheviks, at Ekaterinberg; his mother was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. \nHis four older sisters would all marry Germans. While Philip fought for Britain in the Royal Navy, three of his sisters actively supported the Nazi cause; none would be invited to his wedding.  \nWhen peace came, and with it eventual economic recovery, Philip would throw himself into the construction of a better Britain, urging the country to adopt scientific methods, embracing the ideas of industrial design, planning, education and training. A decade before Harold Wilson talked of the \"white heat of the technological revolution\", Philip was urging modernity on the nation in speeches and interviews.  And as the country and the world became richer and consumed ever more, Philip warned of the impact on the environment, well before it was even vaguely fashionable.\nHe was forged by the turmoil of his first decade and then moulded by his schooling. His early years were spent wandering, as his place of birth ejected him, his family disintegrated and he moved from country to country, none of them ever his own. When he was just a year old, he and his family were scooped up by a British destroyer from his home on the Greek island of Corfu after his father had been condemned to death. They were deposited in Italy.  One of Philip's first international journeys was spent crawling around on the floor of the train from an Italian port city, \"the grubby child on the desolate train pulling out of the Brindisi night,\" as his sister Sophia later described it.\nIn Paris, he lived in a house borrowed from a relative; but it was not destined to become a home. In just one year, while he was at boarding school in Britain, the mental health of his mother, Princess Alice, deteriorated and she went into an asylum; his father, Prince Andrew, went off to Monte Carlo to live with his mistress; and his four sisters married and went to live in Germany.  In the space of 10 years he had gone from a prince of Greece to a wandering, homeless, and virtually penniless boy with no-one to care for him.\n\"I don't think anybody thinks I had a father,\" he once said. Andrew would die during the war. Philip went to Monte Carlo to pick up his father's possessions after the Germans had been driven from France; there was almost nothing left, just a couple of clothes brushes and some cuff-links.\nBy the time he went to Gordonstoun, a private school on the north coast of Scotland, Philip was tough, independent and able to fend for himself; he'd had to be. Gordonstoun would channel those traits into the school's distinct philosophy of community service, teamwork, responsibility and respect for the individual.  And it sparked one of the great passions of Philip's life - his love of the sea.\nPhilip adored the school as much as his son Charles would despise it.  Not just because the stress it put on physical as well as mental excellence - he was a great sportsman.  But because of its ethos, laid down by its founder Kurt Hahn, an exile from Nazi Germany. \nThat ethos became a significant, perhaps the significant, part of the way that Philip believed life should be lived. It shines through the speeches he gave later in his life. \"The essence of freedom,\" he would say in Ghana in 1958, \"is discipline and self-control.\" The comforts of the post-war era, he told the British Schools Exploring Society a year earlier, may be important \"but it is much more important that the human spirit should not be stifled by easy living\". And two years before that, he spoke to the boys of Ipswich School of the moral as well as material imperatives of life, with the \"importance of the individual\" as the \"guiding principle of our society\".\nAnd at Gordonstoun was born one of the great contradictions of Philip's fascinating life. The importance of the individual was what in Kurt Hahn's eyes differentiated Britain and liberal democracies from the kind of totalitarian dictatorship that he had fled. Philip put that centrality of the individual, and individual agency - the ability we have as humans to make our own moral and ethical decisions - at the heart of his philosophy. \nAnd yet he was throughout his life, first in the navy and then in the many decades of life in the Palace, tightly bound by rules of tradition, of precedent, of command and hierarchy. He had little, if anything, in the way of agency. Did he say one thing and do another, as members of the Royal Family are often accused of? Or was his first choice - to serve - by necessity his last?\nAt Dartmouth Naval College in 1939, the two great passions of his life would collide. He had learned to sail at Gordonstoun; he would learn to lead at Dartmouth. And his driving desire to achieve, and to win, would shine through. Despite entering the college far later than most other cadets, he would graduate top of his class in 1940. In further training at Portsmouth, he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the exam. He became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy.\nThe navy ran deep in his family. His maternal grandfather had been the First Sea Lord, the commander of the Royal Navy; his uncle, \"Dickie\" Mountbatten, had command of a destroyer while Philip was in training. In war, he showed not only bravery but guile. It was his natural milieu. \"Prince Philip\", wrote Gordonstoun headmaster Kurt Hahn admiringly, \"will make his mark in any profession where he will have to prove himself in a trial of strength\".   \nOthers had their reservations about the brilliant and ambitious young officer. In peace, once he had his own command, he drove his men hard, much too hard for some.  \"If he had a fault, it was a tendency to intolerance,\" wrote one biographer.  That kind of comment would recur. Contemporaries were more blunt. \"One of his crew,\" writes another biographer, \"said he would rather die than serve under him again.\"\nIn Dartmouth in 1939, as war became ever more certain, the navy was his destiny.  He had fallen in love with the sea itself. \"It is an extraordinary master or mistress,\" he would say later, \"it has such extraordinary moods.\"  But a rival to the sea would come. \nWhen King George VI toured the Naval College, accompanied by Philip's uncle, he brought with him his daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Philip was asked to look after her. He showed off to her, vaulting the nets of the tennis court in the grounds of the college. He was confident, outgoing, strikingly handsome, of royal blood if without a throne.  She was beautiful, a little sheltered, a little serious, and very smitten by Philip.\nDid he know then that this was a collision of two great passions? That he could not have the sea and the beautiful young woman? For a time after their wedding in 1948, he did have both. As young newlyweds in Malta, he had what he so prized - command of a ship -  and they had two idyllic years together. But the illness and then early death of King George VI brought it all to an end.\nHe knew what it meant, the moment he was told.  Up in a lodge in Kenya, touring Africa, with Princess Elizabeth in place of the King, Philip was told first of the monarch's death. He looked, said his equerry Mike Parker, \"as if a tonne of bricks had fallen on him\". For some time he sat, slumped in a chair, a newspaper covering his head and chest. His princess had become the Queen.  His world had changed irrevocably.\nFor someone who almost never displayed anything close to self-pity, and rarely spoke of his own emotions, he was by his own standards candid about the loss of his naval calling. \"There's never been 'if only',\" he said once, \"except perhaps that I regret not having been able to continue a career in the navy\". Those who knew the man and his passions are blunter.  The former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord West, says Philip did his duty; but of the end of his time in the navy he says, \"I know it was a huge loss to him.  I know it.\"\nThat moment, when princess became Queen, revealed another great contradiction of Philip's life. He was born and brought up in a world almost entirely run by men.  He was a rugged, physical man who was brought up and then worked in an entirely male environment. He celebrated masculinity, telling Mike Parker on the birth of his first son Charles, \"It takes a man to have a boy.\" But literally overnight, and for 65 years to follow, it became his life to support his wife, the Queen.\nHe would walk behind her. He would give up his job for her. He would apologise if he came into a room after her. At her coronation he knelt before her, his hands enclosed by hers, and swore to be her \"liege man of life and limb\". His children would not bear his name, Mountbatten. \"I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba,\" he exclaimed at that. But there was nothing to be done. She was the Queen. He was her husband.\nPrince Philip talked of the upending of circumstance little. \"Within the house,\" he said of the time before the Queen's accession, \"I suppose I naturally filled the principal position. People used to come and ask me what to do.  In 1952 the whole thing changed very, very considerably.\" \nThe transition to life in the Palace was brutal. \"Philip,\" said his equerry, \"was constantly being squashed, snubbed, ticked off, rapped over the knuckles... I felt Philip did not have any friends or helpers.\" Philip may not have helped himself; one biographer writes that in the early years Palace staff felt he was \"difficult to deal with... prickly... arrogant... defensive\". He was looked upon with suspicion by some in the court, as something of an adventurer, as perhaps a fortune hunter.  He had German blood, and this was just after the herculean effort of defeating Nazi Germany.\nIn response, Philip began what would become a lifetime of near-ceaseless activity; abroad he was at the side of the Queen on the long tours they undertook, sometimes breaking off to pursue interests particular to him - sporting, industrial or research. She nearly always travelled with him as her companion; but he also travelled alone.  It was he, not she, that made the farewells to colonial possessions in the 1950s and 1960s.\nAt home there were patronages and projects, hundreds upon hundreds of them, with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport. He played cricket, squash, polo; he swam, sailed, rowed and rode horses and carriage drove. He learnt to fly, and developed his own photographs. \nWithin the Palace he was a moderniser, striding the corridors, rootling around the cellars, trying to find out what everyone did. He took over the management of the estate at Sandringham and over the years significantly redeveloped it. \n\"He believes he has a creative mission,\" wrote an early biographer, \"to present the monarchy as a dynamic, involved and responsive institution that will address itself to some of the problems of contemporary British society.\"\nHe was young and very good looking; he smiled and joked and was at ease in front of the cameras. When he visited a boys' club in London in the late 1950s, a photo shows him with a broad smile on his face, looking crisp in a double-breasted pinstripe suit, his hair slicked back with brilliantine, surrounded by the upturned faces of boys and their mothers all shoving and trying to get close to him. There is more than a whiff of Beatlemania to the moment.\nIn his study on the first floor of Buckingham Palace, overlooking the gardens and Green Park, surrounded by thousands of books, with a model of his first command HMS Magpie to one side, he would research and write and type out his speeches. (In 1986 he would buy, always the moderniser, what he called a \"splendid gadget\" that he called \"a miniature word processor\".) He gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests. \nOut of the speeches comes a picture of the man.  For someone who sat through so much of it, he was clearly impatient with ceremony. \"A lot of time and energy,\" he told students and staff at the Chesterfield College of Technology, \"has been spent on arranging for you to listen to me to take a long time to declare open a building which everyone knows is open already.\"\nReflecting his dizzying range of interests, there was sometimes a touch of the gentleman-farmer to his thoughts - well-organised arguments that don't really go anywhere, a lot of anecdotal evidence (\"it seems to me...\") garnered from his extensive travels.\nDespite modernising instincts, he was a conservative, somewhat suspicious of the machinations of the big city. He spoke of \"urban dwellers\" and of the \"average citizen\" dumping rubbish from their car. He preferred practical solutions to highfalutin theory - \"The enterprise is doomed,\" he told the Commonwealth Conference on Industrial Relations, \"if it is allowed to enter the rarefied atmosphere of theory.\"\nHe was an environmentalist before anyone really knew what that was. He warned of the \"greedy and senseless exploitation of nature.\" And in 1982 he brought up a topic that now grips us, but back then was almost never spoken of, \"a hotly-debated issue directly attributable to the development of industry... the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\" which he referred to as the \"greenhouse effect\".\nAnd he constantly did himself down, shrugging as to why anyone should want to hear him speak: \"I have very little experience of self-government,\" he told one audience, \"I am one of the most governed people you could meet....\" His example of irrational behaviour? - \"making and listening to speeches on important occasions\". Or speaking before the Brussels Expo in 1958 - \"I feel I can claim to be an expert at going round exhibitions.\" He knew most speeches were a dull formality that had to be got through - and he was happy to let his audience have a laugh at his expense. \nIt is another contradiction in a life of them; that someone who cared so much about how we live our lives, about how to pursue a good and moral life, about how government and society might try to channel our instincts, should end up being popularly portrayed as a saloon-bar bore, his retirement from public life in 2017 accompanied by lists of his \"gaffes\", off-colour comments and salty jokes.\nThat he could be rude, startlingly so at times, there is no doubt. Part of it was impatience, that dynamo whirring away, the desire to get things done double-quick. Part of it may have been deafness, inherited from his almost wholly deaf mother. But part of it was just plain bad manners, a disregard for what others felt and a thoughtlessness that came from position and temperament. \nThere was for a long time a fair amount of barking and shouting at those who failed to please him, and not a lot of thanking those that did.\nLooking back down the decades, two great contrasts stand out. The first, that between a life led in the public eye, and a really quite private man. The boy shuttling between guardians and schools and countries quickly learnt to seal off his private side from public view. Inside the Palace it became his world view. Most of his biographers' personal queries were met with a shrug, as if to say \"I don't know why you are bothering\". He once said of his son Charles: \"He is a romantic, I am a pragmatist. And because I don't see things as a romantic would, I'm [perceived as] unfeeling.\" There can be little doubt that he was stung by the accusation. But his inner thoughts were not for public consumption. \nAnd the second great, related, contrast is that between the near unceasing whirl of his public life, and a degree of solitude in his private. Of course there was family, though all his sisters pre-deceased him. But few, if any, great friendships are recorded, a corollary of his private nature and the pattern of his many decades. \"Life,\" wrote one biographer, \"hasn't enabled him to build up friendships. He is going round the world at such a lick.\" And royalty is its own curious cage, repelling outsiders. \"What the royal family offers you is friendliness,\" said the late James Callaghan, prime minister in the 1970s, \"not friendship.\"  \nMajor General Charles Stickland of the Royal Marines, of which for 64 years Philip was Captain General, tells of when the duke flew into an exercise in Norway. He was supposed to say a quick hello to the enlisted men and then have lunch with the commanding officer. Instead he \"asked two of the corporals to spoon food into his mess tin, sat on a Bergan [rucksack], told stories and chatted away with my troops when he was supposed to be having a posh lunch and then got back on the helicopter, having inspired a group of young men as to why it was great to be a Royal Marine\".  \nIt was vintage Philip; no ceremony, hierarchy pushed to one side, the big group over the more intimate gathering. \nBecause of his desire for privacy, because of his position, and because nearly all who knew him best have gone, our understanding of him will always be incomplete. But that's also because of what kind of person he was, because of the contradictions and contrasts that emerged over the decades. \"A mercurial man like His Royal Highness,\" said the artist and architect Sir Hugh Casson, \"needs a loose fit portrait.\"\nHe was asked once what his life had been about (the sort of question that normally received an incredulous snort). Had it been about supporting the Queen? \"Absolutely, absolutely,\" he replied. He didn't see himself as a leader, though lead he could. And his own achievements he consistently played down. Accepting the Freedom of the City of London in 1948, he spoke for himself and for what he called other \"followers\", with trademark modesty. \"Our only distinction,\" he said, \"was that we did what we were told to do, to the very best of our ability, and kept on doing it.\""

      "text": "Buckingham Palace has asked the public to refrain from leaving floral tributes to the Duke of Edinburgh at royal residences. \nDozens of bouquets were laid outside Buckingham Palace after Prince Philip's death was announced at midday.\nRoyal household staff placed a framed notice announcing the duke's death on the front gates of the Palace.\nBut it was removed after an hour to avoid gatherings amid ongoing Covid pandemic restrictions.\nThe Royal Family asked members of the public to consider making a donation to charity instead of leaving floral tributes in memory of Prince Philip.\nThe government has urged people not to gather at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle in breach of coronavirus regulations.\nThe Palace launched an online book of condolence on its official website where it encouraged people to leave messages, a selection of which will be passed to members of the Royal Family.\nMore than 100 floral tributes - ranging from bunches of daffodils to fuller bouquets, many with notes attached - and two union jacks were placed at the gates by mourners.\nStewards attempted to form an orderly queuing system but encouraged people not to form a large crowd.\nMounted police reminded those gathered to adhere to social-distancing guidelines and remain two-metres apart from other groups.\nRhea Varma, from nearby Pimlico, pulled up on her bike to lay flowers and a note saying \"Rest in Peace Duke\".\nShe told BBC News the duke was \"the kind of stability that's so old-fashioned it's difficult to comprehend. He was a rock who brought integrity\".\nAdam Wharton-Ward, 36, left a bunch of lilies by the Palace gates. Visiting London from his home in France, he said he was so moved by the news he wanted to \"rally round\" for the Queen's sake. \n\"It's so sad. He's been with her for 73 years. If it wasn't for him who knows if she would have got through it,\" he said.\nThe official notice read: \"It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband.\"\nIt confirmed Prince Philip \"passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle\".\n\"Further announcements will be made in due course,\" it added. \"The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.\"\nA similar announcement was also displayed outside the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of Queen Elizabeth II in Scotland, in Edinburgh.\nThe Palace's flag was flown at half-mast. \nTraditionally, Royal Family announcements are made by displaying a framed notice at Buckingham Palace.\nIn recent years, birth announcements have been made in this way, with these notices mounted on a golden easel. \nBut the coronavirus pandemic has prompted changes to many of the traditions across the Royal households.\nThe Changing of the Guard ceremonies at Buckingham Palace, St James' Palace and Windsor Castle - seen by millions each year before the pandemic - were postponed in March 2020 to avoid mass gatherings."

      "text": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, won widespread respect for his steadfast and constant support of the Queen.\nIt was a desperately difficult role for anyone, let alone a man who had been used to naval command and who held strong views on a wide range of subjects.\nYet it was that very strength of character that enabled him to discharge his responsibilities so effectively, and provide such wholehearted support to his wife in her role as Queen.\nAs male consort to a female sovereign, Prince Philip had no constitutional position. But no-one was closer to the monarchy, or of greater importance to the monarch, than he was.\nPrince Philip of Greece was born on 10 June 1921 on the island of Corfu. His birth certificate shows the date as 28 May 1921, as Greece had not then adopted the Gregorian calendar.\nHis father was Prince Andrew of Greece, a younger son of King George I of the Hellenes. His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was the eldest child of Prince Louis of Battenberg and sister of Earl Mountbatten of Burma.\nAfter a coup d'etat in 1922, his father was banished from Greece by a revolutionary court.\nA British warship sent by his second cousin, King George V, took the family to Italy. Baby Philip spent much of the voyage in a crib made from an orange box.\nHe was the youngest child, the only boy in a family of sisters - and his early childhood was spent in a loving atmosphere. \nThe prince began his education in France but, at the age of seven, came to live with his Mountbatten relatives in England, where he attended a prep school in Surrey.\nBy this time his mother had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and been placed in an asylum. The young prince would have little contact with her.\nIn 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in southern Germany, which was run by educational pioneer Kurt Hahn. But within months, Hahn, who was Jewish, was forced to flee Nazi persecution.\nHahn moved to Scotland where he founded Gordonstoun school, to which the prince transferred after only two terms in Germany.\nGordonstoun's Spartan regime, with its emphasis on self-reliance, was the ideal environment for a teenage boy who, separated from his parents, felt very much on his own.\nWith war looming, Prince Philip decided on a military career. He wanted to join the Royal Air Force but his mother's family had a seafaring tradition and he became a cadet at the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.\nWhile there he was delegated to escort the two young princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret, while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the college.\nAccording to witnesses, Prince Philip showed off a great deal. But the meeting made a deep impression on the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth.\nPhilip quickly proved himself an outstanding prospect, passing out at the top of his class in January 1940 and seeing military action for the first time in the Indian Ocean.\nHe transferred to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet, where he was mentioned in dispatches for his part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941. \nAs the officer in charge of the ship's searchlights, he played a crucial role in this decisive night action.\n\"I found another ship and it lit up the middle part of it, whereupon it practically disappeared instantly under a salvo of 15in shells at point-blank range,\" he told BBC Radio 4 in 2014.\nBy October 1942, he was one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy, serving on board the destroyer HMS Wallace.\nThroughout this period, he and the young Princess Elizabeth had been exchanging letters, and he was invited to stay with the Royal Family on a number of occasions.\nIt was after one of these visits, over Christmas 1943, that Elizabeth placed a photograph of Philip, in naval uniform, on her dressing table.\nTheir relationship developed in peacetime, although there was opposition to it from some courtiers - one of whom described Prince Philip as \"rough and ill-mannered\".\nBut the young princess was very much in love and, in the summer of 1946, her suitor asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage.\nHowever, before an engagement could be announced, the prince needed a new nationality and a family name. He renounced his Greek title, became a British citizen and took his mother's anglicised name, Mountbatten.\nThe day before the marriage ceremony, King George VI bestowed the title of His Royal Highness on Philip and on the morning of the wedding day he was created Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich.\nThe wedding took place in Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947. It was, as Winston Churchill put it, a \"flash of colour\" in a grey post-war Britain.\nThe duke returned to his naval career and was posted to Malta where, for a while at least, the couple could live the life of any other service family.\nTheir son, Prince Charles, was born at Buckingham Palace in 1948, and a daughter, Princess Anne, arrived in 1950. They were later joined by Prince Andrew (1960) and Prince Edward (1964). \nOn 2 September 1950, he achieved the ambition of every naval officer when he was appointed to his own command, the sloop HMS Magpie.\nBut his naval career was about to be curtailed. The worsening health of George VI meant his daughter had to take on more royal duties and needed her husband by her side.\nPhilip took leave from the Royal Navy in July 1951. He never returned in an active role.\nThe duke was not a man to carry regrets, but he did say in later life that he was sorry he had been unable to continue his career in the navy.\nContemporaries have said that he could, on his own merit, have risen to become first sea lord. \nIn 1952, the royal couple set off on a tour of the Commonwealth originally planned to be undertaken by the King and Queen.\nIt was while they were staying at a game lodge in Kenya in February that word came through the King had died. He had suffered a coronary thrombosis - a fatal heart blood clot.\nIt fell to the prince to break the news to his wife that she was now Queen.\nA friend later described Prince Philip as looking as if \"half the world\" had dropped on him.\nDeprived of his naval career, he had to create a new role for himself, and Elizabeth's accession to the throne raised the whole question of what that was to be.\nAs the coronation approached, a Royal Warrant proclaimed that Prince Philip would have precedence after the Queen on all occasions, yet he was never to have any constitutional position.\nThe duke was full of ideas about how best to modernise and streamline the monarchy but became increasingly disillusioned by the entrenched opposition from a number of the palace old guard.\nHe channelled some of his energies into an active social life. He and a group of male friends met every week in rooms above a restaurant in Soho, central London. \nThere were long, convivial lunches and visits to nightclubs and he was often photographed with glamorous companions.\nOne area in which the duke was given free rein to exercise his authority was in the family, although he lost the battle over the name his children would carry.\nThe Queen's decision that the family would carry the name of Windsor, rather than his own family name of Mountbatten, was a bitter blow.\n\"I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children,\" he complained to friends. \"I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba.\" \nAs a parent, Prince Philip could appear brusque and insensitive. \nAccording to Prince Charles's biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, Charles was reduced to tears in his youth by public reprimands from his father and the relationship between father and eldest son was never easy.\nPhilip insisted that Prince Charles go to his old school, Gordonstoun, in the well-intentioned belief that its regime would help counter his son's somewhat retiring nature.\nIn the event the young prince hated the school, where he suffered homesickness and was often the target of bullies.\nThe duke's attitudes reflected the difficult nature of his own, sometimes lonely, childhood.\nHe was forced from an early age to develop self-reliance and found it difficult to understand that not everyone shared his strength of character.\nOne of Prince Philip's main concerns was for the welfare of young people, and in 1956 that interest sparked the launch of his phenomenally successful Duke of Edinburgh's Award.\nOver the years it enabled some six million 15-to-25-year-olds - many with disabilities - the world over to challenge themselves physically, mentally and emotionally in a range of outdoor activities designed to promote teamwork, resourcefulness and a respect for nature.\n\"If you can get young people to succeed in any area of activity,\" he told the BBC, \"that sensation of success will spread over into a lot of others.\"\nThroughout his life the duke continued to devote much time to the scheme, attending various functions and involving himself in its day-to-day running.\nHe was also a passionate advocate for wildlife and the environment, although his decision to shoot a tiger while on a trip to India in 1961 caused a furore. \nThe publication of a photograph, in which the tiger was displayed as a trophy, only made matters worse.\nHowever, he threw his considerable influence and energy behind the World Wildlife Fund, later to become the World Wide Fund for Nature, and seemed a natural choice as its first president.\n\"I think it's marvellous we have such a fantastic variety of life on this planet, all interdependent,\" he told a BBC interviewer.\n\"I think also that if we humans have the power of life or death - or extinction or survival - we ought to exercise it with some sort of moral sense. Why make something extinct if you don't have to?\"\nHe upset some conservationists when he defended grouse shooting.\n\"If you have a game species, you want it to survive because you want to have some next year - exactly like a farmer. You want to crop it, you don't want to exterminate it.\"\nBut he was widely praised for his commitment to preserving the world's forests and campaigning against overfishing in the oceans.\nPrince Philip also took a keen interest in industry, visiting factories and becoming patron of the Industrial Society, now known as the Work Foundation.\nIt was to a group of industrialists in 1961 that the duke displayed characteristic bluntness when he told them: \"Gentlemen, it's time we pulled our fingers out.\"\nThis tendency to be forthright was interpreted by some as boorishness and sometimes got him into trouble. He certainly gained a reputation for misjudging situations, particularly when he was abroad.\nHe made one of his most controversial comments while accompanying the Queen on a state visit to China in 1986. He made what he thought was a private remark about \"slitty eyes\".\nThe tabloids went into a frenzy, although it seemed to cause little concern in China.\nOn a visit to Australia in 2002, he asked an Aboriginal businessman whether \"you still throw spears at each other\".\nWhile he was heavily criticised in some quarters for such remarks, others saw them as reflecting someone who was his own man and who had refused to become bound by political correctness.\nIndeed, many saw his so-called \"gaffes\" as nothing more than an attempt to lighten the atmosphere and put people at their ease.\nThroughout his life, Prince Philip maintained an enthusiasm for sport. He sailed, played cricket and polo, excelled at carriage driving and was president of the International Equestrian Federation for many years.\nThe tensions with his eldest son resurfaced with the publication of Jonathan Dimbleby's biography of Prince Charles. \nThe Duke of Edinburgh, it was said, had pushed Charles into his marriage to Lady Diana Spencer.\nYet the duke was more solicitous than many critics would allow during the difficult years when his children's marriages were disintegrating.\nHe took the lead in attempting to understand the problems, prompted perhaps by his own memories of the difficulties of marrying into the Royal Family.\nPrince Philip was greatly saddened by the ending of the marriages of three of his four children - Princess Anne and Prince Andrew, as well as Prince Charles.\nBut he always refused to talk about personal matters, telling a newspaper in 1994 that he had not done so before and was not going to start then.\nAdvancing years barely slowed the pace of his life. He continued to travel extensively, both for the World Wide Fund for Nature and with the Queen on state visits abroad.\nAnd he made a personal pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1994 to visit the tomb of his mother. Her wish to be buried there had been fulfilled.\nThere was another poignant moment for him during the 50th anniversary of VJ Day in 1995.\nPrince Philip had been on a British destroyer in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese surrendered and, on the anniversary, he joined other veterans of the Far East campaign in marching past the Queen on The Mall.\nHe also expressed sympathy for those former prisoners of the Japanese who had found it hard, or indeed impossible, to forgive what had been done to them.\nHis brusqueness mellowed a little in later years, prompted by the public's sometimes hostile attitude to the Royal Family after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.\nIn 2007, letters between the duke and the princess were published in an attempt to refute claims that he had been hostile to his daughter-in-law.\nDubbed the Dearest Pa letters, they showed he had been a source of great support to Diana, a fact underlined by the warm tones in which she wrote to him.\nMohamed Al Fayed, the father of Diana's last companion, Dodi, even suggested at the inquest into her death that she had been murdered on Prince Philip's orders - an allegation the coroner strongly rejected.\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a strong-willed and independent man who found himself at the centre of British society.\nHe was a natural leader whose role forced him always to take second place; a man with a combative temperament that frequently sat uneasily with the sensitivities of his position.\n\"I've just done what I think was my best,\" he once told the BBC. \"I can't suddenly change my whole way of doing things, I can't change my interests or the way I react to things. That's just my style.\"\nThe duke retired from public life in August 2017 after decades supporting the Queen and attending events for his own charities and organisations.\nBuckingham Palace calculated he had completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952, and Theresa May, the then prime minister, thanked him for a \"remarkable life of public service\".\nPhilip celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary later that year. \nA hip replacement operation did not stop him driving his carriages around the grounds of Windsor Castle, and he survived a serious car accident while driving near Sandringham in January 2019. \nTwo women in the other car were injured, and the duke voluntarily surrendered his driver's licence. \nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, Philip and the Queen moved to Windsor Castle, and were given a vaccine in January 2021. \nPhilip was successful in using his position to make a huge contribution to British life and played his part in helping the monarchy come to terms with changing social attitudes over the years.\nBut his greatest achievement was undoubtedly the constancy and strength of his support for the Queen in the long years of her reign.\nHe believed his job was, as he told his biographer, \"to ensure the Queen can reign\".\nAt a speech given at a celebration to mark the couple's golden wedding anniversary, the Queen paid tribute to her husband, the longest-serving royal consort in British history.\n\"He is someone who doesn't take easily to compliments, but he has quite simply been my strength and stay all these years. And I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know.\" \n All images subject to copyright"

      "tags": "Kim Jong-un,North Korea weapons programme,North Korea,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has told citizens to prepare for hard times ahead, following warnings from rights groups that the country faces dire food shortages and economic instability.\nSpeaking at a party conference, Mr Kim appeared to compare the situation to the devastating 1990s famine, estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands.\nNorth Korea has shut its borders due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTrade with China, its economic lifeline, has come to a standstill. \nThis is on top of existing international economic sanctions over Pyongyang's nuclear programme.  \nIn a rare admission of looming hardship, the authoritarian leader of the single-party state on Thursday called on officials to \"wage another, more difficult 'Arduous March' in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little\".\nThe Arduous March is a term used by North Korea officials to refer to the country's struggle during the 1990s famine, when the fall of the Soviet Union left North Korea without crucial aid. The total number of North Koreans who starved to death is not known, but estimates range up to 3 million.\n\"It is not unusual for Kim Jong-un to talk about difficulties and hardship but this time the language is quite stark and that's different,\" Colin Zwirko, North Korea analyst at NK News, told the BBC. \n\"Last October for instance, he gave a speech where he said that he himself failed to bring about enough changes. But mentioning explicitly that he's decided to carry out a new Arduous March is not something he has said before.\"\nEarlier this week, Mr Kim had warned the country faced the \"worst-ever situation\" and \"unprecedentedly numerous challenges\".\nThere have been warnings for months that the people of North Korea are struggling.\nReports of hardship appear to be coming especially from towns near the Chinese border, where smuggling would have been a huge earner for many.\nThe price of corn, the staple diet for most of rural North Korea, has reportedly fluctuated enormously and at times a kilogram of corn has cost more than a month's wages.\nLina Yoon, a researcher from Human Rights Watch (HRW), said in a recent report citing unnamed contacts in the country that \"there is barely any food going into the country from China\".\n\"There are so many more beggars, some people died from hunger in the border area, and there's no soap, toothpaste, or batteries,\" she wrote. \nThe UN Special Rapporteur on North Korean Human Rights, Tom\u00e1s Ojea Quintana, warned last month in a report of a \"serious food crisis\" already leading to malnourishment and starvation.\n\"Deaths by starvation have been reported, as has an increase in the number of children and elderly people who have resorted to begging as families are unable to support them.\" \nIt is unclear whether any aid at all is currently coming into the country. North Korea has rejected offers of external aid and almost all diplomats and aid workers, including staff of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), have left.\nMeanwhile North Korea's border closures means trade with China dropped by 80% last year from levels that had already fallen significantly in 2018 when the UN expanded sanctions over North Korea's nuclear programme. \nReports suggest North Korea restricted imports of staple foods from China last August and then cut almost all trade, including food and medicines, in October.\nThe country has also ramped up punishments for smuggling, describing it as \"anti-socialist\" and \"enemy\" behaviour, according to HRW.\nNorth Korea was also hit by two major storms last summer, which caused flooding that is believed to have damaged crops, exacerbating the shortages.\nKim Jong-un is shoring up support within his party as times get tough. He's making sure that the warnings are coming from him - perhaps so that when things get worse, he can point the finger at his officials for not acting on his orders.\nHe can also pin blame for the dire economy on the Covid-19 pandemic and the strict economic sanctions designed to curb his nuclear weapons programme.\nAnd yet his regime continues to design and test new missiles.\nThe weapons tests are something we can all see on satellite images and state media photos, and use them to question world leaders about how they are going to act.\nThe North Korean people cannot get images of their suffering to us without the risk of being imprisoned or shot.\nUnseen, and according to warnings by their own leader, they now face going hungry amid a looming humanitarian crisis.\nTightly controlled by the government, North Korea's economy is one of the least free in the world and is said to be highly inefficient. \nThe enormous cost of maintaining the military and security structures has left very little for the ordinary North Korean. \nThe almost complete border closure aims to prevent the coronavirus from spreading in a country that does not have the public health infrastructure to handle an outbreak.\nHowever there are indications that Pyongyang is feeling pressure to reopen borders at least a bit, Mr Zwirko said. \n\"North Korea has shown signs of wanting to increase trade with China again. They have passed a law a few months ago to help facilitate border trade,\" he said.\n\"But fundamentally, North Korea remains extremely paranoid about the virus. They'd really have to change and trust in the ability to disinfect goods that would come through.\"\nNorth Korea claims that so far the border shutdown has kept it Covid-free, though analysts doubt this claim.

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Obituaries",
      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh, arguably the world's most famous husband, has died at the age of 99.\nHe spent seven decades in the shadow of his wife, the UK's Queen Elizabeth II - but his force of personality meant he would never be simply a professional spouse.\nSo who was the man beside the monarch, and how did he come to marry the Queen?\nFirst things first: The Duke, also known as Prince Philip, was never in line for the throne - which his eldest son stands to inherit - and never held the title of king. \nThat's because in the UK, a woman who marries the monarch can use the ceremonial title of queen - but men who marry the monarch can't use the title king, which can only be used by male sovereigns. \nThe Queen and Prince Philip had four children together: Prince Charles, 72, Princess Anne, 70, Prince Andrew, 61, and 57-year-old Prince Edward. \nAs they tell it, Philip often exerted his will when they were young. \nRoyal biographer Ingrid Seward quotes Prince Andrew as saying of his childhood: \"Compassion comes from the Queen. And the duty and discipline comes from him.\" \nBut Andrew also remembered how his father made time to invent bedtime tales, or listen to his children read Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories. \nPrince Philip lived long enough to see his eight grandchildren grow up, and to welcome 10 great-grandchildren. \nCuriously, Philip's journey to Buckingham Palace began back in 1922, in a crib made from an orange box.\nHe was born on 10 June 1921 on the Greek island of Corfu, the youngest child and only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg. \nThat heritage made him a prince of Greece and Denmark, but the following year the family was banished from Greece after a coup. \nA British warship carried them to safety in Italy, with baby Philip dozing in a makeshift fruit crate cot.\nPhilip's childhood was fragmented, and darkened by a series of losses. \nIn 1930, when he was eight years old, his mother was committed to a secure psychiatric centre after suffering a nervous breakdown. \nPhilip saw little of either parent in the years that followed. His father retreated to the French Riviera with a mistress, and his mother's relatives in the UK helped raise him. He would later adopt their surname, Mountbatten - an anglicised form of the family name Battenberg.\nA Scottish boarding school, Gordonstoun, passed for home during his teens. Its founder and headmaster was Jewish educational pioneer Kurt Hahn, who had been forced out of Germany for condemning the Nazis. \nThe school gave Philip structure, and nurtured his self-reliance. Its somewhat Spartan regime saw pupils rise early for a freezing shower and cross-country running, which Hahn believed would combat the \"poisonous passions\" of adolescence.\nIn 1937, one of Philip's four sisters, Cecilie, died in an air crash along with her German husband, mother-in-law, and two young sons. She was heavily pregnant at the time. \nCecilie had recently joined the Nazi party, which had near-totalitarian control of Germany. Grieving Philip, aged 16, walked through the streets of Darmstadt behind his sister's coffin, past crowds giving \"Heil Hitler\" salutes. \n\"It's simply what happened,\" Prince Philip later said of that time. \"The family broke up. My mother was ill, my sisters were married, my father was in the south of France. I just had to get on with it. You do. One does.\"\nWhen Philip left school, Britain was on the verge of war with Germany. He joined the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth (the UK's naval academy), where he proved a brilliant cadet and graduated top of his class.\nWhen King George VI paid an official visit in July 1939, Philip was charged with entertaining his young daughters, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. \nTheir governess, Marion Crawford (employed as a guardian for the princesses), recalled later that Philip had \"showed off a great deal\". He made quite an impression on the 13-year-old Elizabeth, as would soon become clear.\nPrince Philip served with distinction in World War Two, seeing military action for the first time in the Indian Ocean. By October 1942, he was 21 years old - and one of the Royal Navy's youngest first lieutenants.\nThe teenaged princess and the officer kept in touch by letter. Over Christmas 1943, after Philip had been to stay with the Royal Family, a photograph of him in naval uniform appeared on her dressing room table. It was a decisive gesture from a reserved but determined young woman.\nSome aides were sceptical. A famous sneer (since attributed to more than one official) claimed the prince was \"rough, ill-mannered, uneducated and would probably not be faithful\". \nBut naysayers could do nothing to deter the future Queen.\nAccording to biographer Philip Eade, Philip's letters from 1946 reveal an ardent young man with a new sense of purpose. \nHe wrote to his soon-to-be mother-in-law: \"I am sure I do not deserve all the good things that have happened to me. To have been spared in the war and seen victory, to have been given the chance to rest and to re-adjust myself, to have fallen in love completely and unreservedly, makes all one's personal and even the world's troubles seem small and petty.\" \nKing George gave Philip permission to marry his daughter. But first there were some tweaks to make.\nThe erstwhile Prince of Greece and Denmark became a naturalised British subject, formally joined the Church of England and abandoned his foreign titles. \nOn his wedding day, 20 November 1947, he was made Duke of Edinburgh, a name he was widely known by for the rest of his life. He was 26, and his new wife 21.\nThe royal couple would have just over four years (and two children) together before duty came knocking. \nThe fateful news reached them at a game lodge in Kenya, during their 1952 tour of the Commonwealth. King George VI, Elizabeth's father, was dead at 56. \nCommander Michael Parker, the Duke of Edinburgh's friend and private secretary, described the moment he realised his wife was now Queen. \n\"He looked as if you'd dropped half the world on him. I have never felt so sorry for anyone in all my life. He just breathed heavily, in and out, as though he were in shock. He saw immediately that the idyll of their life together had come to an end.\"\nPhilip's naval ambitions were curbed. The new Queen Elizabeth would need her husband by her side.\nThe Duke of Edinburgh was named as the Queen's consort. His primary function was to support his wife. \nA long-running row broke out in the early 1950s when Philip wanted the Royal Family to take his surname, Mountbatten. \n\"I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children!\" he fumed when the Queen was persuaded to keep Windsor. \"I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba!\"\nPhilip struggled to find purpose in the limited role set out for him. But as a natural pragmatist, he was determined to blow fresh air through the stuffier corridors of Buckingham Palace.\nThe Duke never forgot his family's forced exodus from Greece, and believed monarchies must adapt to survive.\nHe set up informal lunches where the Queen could meet people from a broader range of backgrounds. The footmen - palace servants with a traditional uniform - stopped powdering their hair. And when he learned the palace was running a second kitchen exclusively to feed the royals, he had one shut down. \nSome changes were more personal, and reflected his childlike love of gadgets. Before the Coronation, when Philip and the future Queen moved into Clarence House in 1949, he happily installed an array of labour-saving devices, including one in his wardrobe that would eject a suit at the push of a button.\nThe Duke also championed a 90-minute fly-on-the-wall BBC documentary entitled Royal Family, which aired in 1969 and was considered landmark television. \nIt featured the Queen feeding carrots to her Trooping the Colour horse, watching TV and discussing salad at a Balmoral barbecue while Princess Anne cooked sausages.\nAt Buckingham Palace, Philip had intercoms put in so that servants no longer had to ferry written messages to his wife. He carried his own luggage, and cooked his own breakfast in his rooms with an electric frying pan - until the Queen objected to the smell. \nAs the longest-serving consort in British history, the prince took on some 22,191 solo engagements. When he retired from royal duties in 2017, he was said to be patron, president or a member of more than 780 organisations.\nAccompanying the globetrotting Queen on Commonwealth tours and state visits, he visited 143 countries in an official capacity, making use of his fluent French and German. \nThe countries included Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation, where he is revered by one rainforest community as the reincarnation of an ancient warrior.\nBut one of his most enduring legacies is the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, founded in 1956 at the urging of his former headmaster, Kurt Hahn. \nParticipants aged 14-25 can gain awards by doing volunteer work, learning physical activities and skills, and undertaking an expedition like a mountain trek or a sailing trip. In 2016, almost 1.3 million young people were taking part in the scheme in more than 130 countries and territories worldwide.\n\"If you can get young people to succeed in any area of activity,\" its founder told the BBC, \"that sensation of success will spread over into a lot of others.\"\nIn his spare time, Philip was a talented sportsman. He learned to sail at Gordonstoun, and became a regular competitor in the regatta at Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, where sailing races are held each summer. \nHe loved equine sports, including carriage driving, and was among the UK's top four polo players in the mid-1960s. \nHe was also a committed environmental campaigner and wildlife advocate, becoming president of the World Wildlife Fund (UK) in 1961 - though he faced criticism when a picture emerged of him on a tiger shoot with the Queen in India the same year.\nAsked to sum up his contribution to British life, Prince Philip responded with typical frankness: \"I've just done what I think is my best. Some people think it's all right. Some don't. What can you do? I can't change my way of doing things. It's part of my style. It's just too bad, they'll have to lump it.\"\nThe prince drew repeated controversy by making outspoken or racially insensitive comments, including in 1986 when he told a group of British students in China: \"If you stay here much longer you'll all be slitty-eyed.\"\nCritics deemed him gaffe-prone and out of touch. His defenders saw the prince as a product of his times who was trying to share a joke. \nInsiders said laughter was the glue that kept the forthright Prince Philip and the Queen together. He himself suggested it was her tolerance.\nThe Queen's once-favoured speech-opener, \"my husband and I...\", was mocked in the 1960s and afterwards by satirists who called it archaic and stilted. She retired the phrasing, but the sentiment remained. \nHer Majesty, now simply \"I\", summed up Prince Philip in a heartfelt speech for their Golden Wedding anniversary.\n\"All too often, I fear, Prince Philip has had to listen to me speaking. Frequently we have discussed my intended speech beforehand and, as you will imagine, his views have been expressed in a forthright manner.\n\"He is someone who doesn't take easily to compliments but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know.\"\nAll photographs subject to copyright"

      "title": "US gun violence: Biden takes action on 'international embarrassment'",
      "tags": "US gun violence,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has issued an order targeting homemade guns, known as \"ghost guns\" because they are unregistered and untraceable. \n\"Gun violence in this country is an epidemic, and it's an international embarrassment,\" he said on Thursday. \nThe president is enacting new measures through an executive order, meaning he does not need approval from Congress. \nIt includes efforts to set rules for certain guns, bolster background checks and support local violence prevention.\nHowever, the president will have an uphill task. The right to bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment to the US Constitution and many people see gun control laws as infringing on this constitutional right. \nHours after the president's address, a gunman killed one person and injured five others at a cabinet-making shop in Bryan, Texas. A state trooper was also shot and injured while taking the suspect into custody.\nOn Wednesday, five people, including two young children, killed in South Carolina. The suspect has been named as former NFL player Phillip Adams.\nThis followed two mass shootings in March, which left a total of 18 people dead - one in Boulder, Colorado and the other in Atlanta, Georgia.\nSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday, Mr Biden said 106 people are killed every day by guns in the country.\n\"This is an epidemic for God's sake. And it has to stop,\" he continued.\nHe also offered condolences to the family killed in South Carolina.\nMr Biden's executive order gives the Justice Department 30 days to propose a rule that will help reduce the number of so-called \"ghost guns\". \nThese guns are self-assembled, which means they do not contain a serial number and cannot be traced. Background checks are also not required to purchase the assembly kits.\n\"Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist can buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a weapon,\"  Mr Biden said.\nExperts say that these homemade guns are increasingly being used in crimes. Over 40% of guns being seized in Los Angeles are ghost guns, according to federal firearms officials.\nMr Biden is also giving the Justice Department two months to come up with a rule on stabilising braces for pistols. Under the rule, a pistol used with a stabilising brace would be classified as a short-barrelled rifle, which requires much more stringent background checks under the National Firearms Act.\nThe Justice Department has also been asked to draft a \"red flag law\" which states can then use to create their own legislation. These laws authorise the courts and law enforcement to remove guns from people thought to be a risk to the community. \nGetting further gun measures through Congress would be difficult. The US Senate is currently split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, with Vice-President Harris holding the deciding vote. \nHowever, current Senate rules mean that in practice, 60 votes are needed to pass legislation, meaning some Republican support is required. Republicans have blocked significant gun control laws in the past. \nAfter recent mass shootings, gun-control activists called on Joe Biden to impose new regulations on firearms. And like past presidents who have sought to address US gun violence, Biden confronts a hard reality.\nThere are not enough votes in Congress to enact even modest new gun laws. And the steps a president can take unilaterally are limited in scope.\nBiden promised that he would do something about gun control, however, so on Thursday he gathered a sympathetic audience in the Rose Garden and unveiled a grab-bag of new actions.\nHe nominated a head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - a vacancy Donald Trump never bothered to fill. He instructed his Justice Department to come up with new rules for homemade guns and more heavily regulate an attachment that makes handguns more accurate. He called for new gun-violence studies and draft legislation that states could pass.\nIn a tacit acknowledgement that the scope of these actions are limited, Biden assured his audience that \"this is just a start\".\nTo go much farther, however, the political dynamic in Congress will have to change - and Biden, currently more focused on passing his infrastructure package, will have to expend more political capital.\nMr Biden's proposed measures have been praised by gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety. \n\"Each of these executive actions will start to address the epidemic of gun violence that has raged throughout the pandemic and begin to make good on President Biden's promise to be the strongest gun safety president in history,\" group president John Feinblatt said. \nHe added that the Biden administration's decision to treat ghost guns \"like the deadly weapons they are will undoubtedly save countless lives\". \nThe National Rifle Association (NRA), the biggest gun rights lobby group in the US, described the measures as \"extreme\" and said it was ready to fight.\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott labelled Mr Biden's order as \"a new liberal power grab to take away our guns\", promising not to allow this in his state.\nLater on Thursday, Mr Abbott also tweeted that he had been working with public safety and law enforcement officials in the state over the shooting in Bryan. He promised any help needed to prosecute the suspect and offered prayers for the families of victims."

      "text": "Kate Garraway's husband has returned home after more than a year in hospital being treated for Covid-19.\nFormer political adviser Derek Draper, 53, was admitted in March last year with coronavirus symptoms, before having to be put into a coma.\nITV presenter Garraway said on Friday that he \"absolutely knew he was home\" but had not yet regained his speech and will require round-the-clock care.\nShe and her young family all \"burst into tears\" when he arrived home.\n\"As we pulled up, I could see two little faces, Darcey and Billy [their children] looking out the window, and I could literally see them go, 'He's here,'\" she told her Good Morning Britain colleagues.\n\"And they sort of ran out and ran forward, opened the door, and he immediately burst into tears.\n\"There was a lot of hugging and we got him inside. He absolutely knew he was home, he is responding all the time - what he's not able to do is to talk...\"\nMr Draper has been been taken off all support machines and breathing apparatus but will receive 24-hour care at their newly adapted north London home.\nHis recovery from his \"unique\" condition will involve working with physiotherapists and speech therapists. \"It does feel a little bit like the hospital has come home with me at the moment,\" Garraway said, referring to the new team of healthcare professionals now in her house.\n\"He can't really move,\" she said. \"We do need a lot of help. And it's not just help with looking after him, because it is 24-hour care, and I haven't really slept as you can probably tell.\n\"I will ease off, I'm just very aware at the moment and it's a whole new team. So he's probably got a little bit used to the people in hospital and so it's a new team now that are working with him and helping him to come through.\n\"It's going to take a lot of adjustment.\"\nShe added that even though the news was \"amazing\", she was also \"trying to balance the emotions of the next stage\".\nLast month ITV broadcast Finding Derek, a documentary exploring Draper's illness and its effect on their two children - daughter Darcey, 15, and 11-year-old son Billy.\nOne scene saw her recall being told by her husband's doctors that he was the most seriously ill person they had seen who remained alive.\nThe Telegraph's Michael Hogan called the hour-long film \"powerful, poignant and admirably candid\".\nThe broadcaster and journalist noted how \"there have been improvements\" in the former Labour Party political advisor's condition since the documentary was filmed.\nShe said the family had \"constructed a version\" of their dinner table, so he could re-join them.\n\"He's using more words, and there are more things that he can do now,\" she explained.\n\"He's got some more movement in his hands, he can show emotion. But it felt as though everything had stalled medically and if anything was going slightly back.\n\"Obviously within the very necessary Covid restrictions that are in place, I couldn't visit, family couldn't visit, even some of the therapeutic things we would want to do to help him move forward couldn't happen, so taking all that into account, they said, 'Right let's give this a go, let's get him home safely'.\"\nGarraway is also publishing a book, entitled The Power Of Hope, detailing \"the raw and emotional story\" of her husband's illness.\n\"I think anybody whose husband or loved one has been in hospital for a long time, what you want is for them to be home - that's what you're absolutely campaigning [for] and wanting to happen,\" she added. \n\"But it's been a lot discussions, even before Christmas, about what is the best way to go because it's kind of balancing\u2026 it's a very unique situation, Derek's situation.\n\"While the doctors made it very clear they wouldn't have allowed him home if there was any risk to his health, I said: \"I'm not pushing you to something that's not right [am I]?' And [the doctor] said, 'Kate, you can't push me'.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Minnesota,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "George Floyd died because of how police restrained him, a medical expert at the trial of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis has said.\nForensic pathologist Dr Lindsey Thomas said \"the activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr Floyd's death\" from lack of oxygen.\nMr Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May.\nThe ex-officer is on trial for murder and has denied the charges against him.\nThe footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on African-American Mr Floyd's neck sparked global protests against racism.\nProsecutors are trying to prove Mr Chauvin's use of force resulted in Mr Floyd's death, while Mr Chauvin's defence are seeking to show he was following his training and that drugs and heart disease may have caused Mr Floyd's death.\nOn Friday, the prosecution also called medical examiner Dr Andrew Michael Baker, who performed the post-mortem examination of Mr Floyd. \nHe said Mr Floyd's death was due to his interaction with law enforcement, but said his drug use and underlying heart disease also played a role.\nThe official autopsy of George Floyd makes no mention of asphyxia, but Dr Thomas - a veteran forensic pathologist who has performed well over 5,000 autopsies in multiple US states - said she believed it was the primary manner by which he died.\nDr Thomas reviewed Mr Floyd's autopsy, medical reports and other materials on behalf of the prosecution. She also trained Dr Andrew Baker, the chief medical examiner who issued Mr Floyd's official death certificate.\n\"This is not a sudden cardiac death,\" she said. \"It's a death where both the heart and lungs stopped working.\"\nShe said Mr Floyd was unable to get oxygen into his lungs with three police officers on top of him because he was handcuffed, in a prone position and had a knee on his neck.\n\"What that means is the activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr Floyd's death.\"\nShe said she could confidently rule out other possible causes of death, including a drug overdose, a fatal heart attack and lung disease.\nWhen asked if Mr Floyd's underlying health issues and ingestion of drugs might lead to a reasonable conclusion that he died of heart disease, Dr Thomas asserted it made no sense to ignore the reality of his \"subdual, restraint and compression\" by police.\nAfter Dr Thomas, the prosecution called chief medical examiner of Hennepin County Dr Andrew Baker - the examiner who performed the official post-mortem examination on Mr Floyd. \nDr Baker echoed many of Dr Thomas' findings, saying he died as a result of his encounter with police, not because of drug use or heart disease.\n\"Mr Floyd's use of fentanyl did not cause the subdual or neck restraint, his heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint.\"\nDr Baker repeated his initial finding that Mr Floyd's death was a \"homicide\", adding that this was a medical classification - not a legal one. \nWhen questioned by the defence, Dr Baker admitted the drugs found in Mr Floyd's system and his underlying heart disease \"played a role\" in his death - though not the cause. \nDefence attorney Eric Nelson asked several questions about Mr Floyd's drug use, and the fentanyl levels in Mr Floyd's blood at the time of his death. \n\"In other circumstances, it would be a fatal level\", but he clarified that it was \"very context-dependent\". \nThe trial is in its second week and is expected to last for at least one month. \nThe defence is due to begin arguing its case in court next week."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Social care,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's health secretary has said the government failed to properly understand the needs of social care during the pandemic. \nJeane Freeman said the right precautions had not been taken when elderly people were being discharged from hospital to care homes. \nMs Freeman told the BBC podcast, Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, that it had been a \"mistake\". \nThere have been more than 10,000 Covid-related deaths in Scotland.\nOf that number, a third occurred in care homes. \nIn the first wave of the pandemic, more than 1,300 elderly people were discharged from hospitals to care homes in Scotland before a testing regime was in place. \nThe Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the Scottish government's mistakes had \"cost lives\". \nDr Donald MacAskill, of the care home industry body Scottish Care, said there had been so much emphasis on protecting the NHS in the early stages of the pandemic that not enough was done to protect those in social care. \nMs Freeman, who is retiring from Holyrood at next month's election, said: \"I think our failures were not understanding the social care sector well enough.\n\"So we didn't respond quickly enough to what was needed in our care homes, but also in social care in the community.\"\nMr Robinson put it to her that the UK's highest death rate in care homes was in Scotland after many people were sent into care homes from hospital with the virus.\nHe added: \"Thousands of words have been written about this but if there's one thing you think 'that's what we got wrong' - how would summarise it?\"\nMs Freeman replied: \"We wanted people who didn't need to stay in hospital any longer, because they'd been treated and they were clinically well, to be discharged as quickly as possible so we freed up those beds for Covid patients. \n\"Remember, the early predictions about the number of people going into hospital were terrifying actually. \n\"But we didn't take the right precautions to make sure that older people leaving hospital going into care homes were as safe as they could be and that was a mistake. \n\"Now, I might argue we couldn't do anything other than we did and all the rest of it. But it still created a real problem for those older people and for the others who lived in care homes and for the staff who worked in care homes.\" \nIn January, BBC Scotland revealed a special Crown Office unit set up to probe Covid-linked deaths is investigating cases at 474 care homes in Scotland.\nThe unit was set up in May last year to gather information on the circumstances of all deaths in care homes.\nProsecutors will eventually decide if the deaths should be the subject of a fatal accident inquiry or prosecution.\nBut care homes say the investigation is \"disproportionate\" and is placing a huge burden on overstretched staff.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said grieving families have been left without answers about what happened to their loved ones for almost a year. \nHe said: \"It's a disgrace that the SNP covered up their mistake for so long. \n\"Their report on care home deaths was delayed and when it was finally published, they tried to spin it.\"\nHe also accused the health secretary of trying to hide the \"grave error\" from the public.\nMr Ross added: \"People will be left wondering - why is Jeane Freeman only willing to admit such a huge mistake was made now?\"\nScottish Labour's deputy leader and health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: \"These admissions will offer no comfort to the families of those who needlessly lost loved ones due to the Scottish government's errors.\"\nShe claimed the crisis could have been averted had the SNP backed Labour's calls for a national care service more than a decade ago after Scotland's worst Clostridium difficile (C. diff) outbreak in West Dunbartonshire.\nMs Baillie added: \"Lessons that could have been learned were ignored. The time for reflection was when it could have saved lives, not now on podcasts.\"\nA spokesperson for the Scottish Greens said it was \"an absolute tragedy that so many people were fatally let down\".\nShe added: \"That so many families have lost a loved one due to systematic policy failures is an appalling reflection on the handling of this crisis.\n\"It's good that the Scottish government now seems to recognise that the way it handled this issue exacerbated the problem. But it has still failed to satisfactorily explain why it allowed so many potentially infectious people to be discharged to care homes.\"\nLiberal Democrats health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said Ms Freeman's comments were the closest that Scottish government ministers have come to \"admitting their decisions had tragic consequences\".\n\"The situation in care homes was an unimaginably sad one. My sympathies are with all the families who lost loved ones and those who could not be by their relative's side at the very end,\" he said.\nMr Cole-Hamilton added that he hoped the ongoing inquiry into care home deaths would provide some answers for families.\nAn SNP spokesperson said the government had already acknowledged that mistakes were made.\nThey added: \"The Scottish government commissioned extensive work to review the links between hospital discharges and the impact of Covid in our care homes.  \n\"The first minister has committed to establishing a public inquiry into the handling of Covid, in which the voices of families would be heard, by the end of the year.\n\"We hope other governments across the UK will come together to support such an inquiry on a four-nations basis\""

      "text": "Leonie Baigan was excited to have a new baby sister or brother on the way, but two days before she was due to find out the baby's gender by popping a balloon she took her own life.\nThe 20-year-old, from Edinburgh, who died last month, had tried to get help but did not tell anyone she had thoughts of suicide.\nHer parents Stacey Baigan and Mark Halliday believe the issue of mental health needs to be spoken about more openly and are urging people who are struggling to get help.\nStacey, who is six months pregnant, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that Leonie, who had an eight-year-old brother Marco-Lee, was really excited about the impending birth of another sibling.\n\"Leonie was so looking forward to being a big sister again,\" she said. \"My pregnancy is bittersweet - I've lost one child and I'm going to bring another one into the world. I wish the two of them could have met each other.\n\"Some people have said 'do you think her nose was a little bit out of joint because there was a new baby coming?' but absolutely not, I know 110%. Leonie was more excited than me and my partner were, which I never thought was possible.\n\"All her colleagues said she was so excited about the baby coming. Two days after she did what she did, we were going to do a gender reveal and Leonie was going to pop the balloon that was going to say if it was a little brother or sister. Leonie was making plans.\"\nLeonie worked as a customer adviser at the Bank of Scotland. Stacey had spoken to the bank about her mental health problems and got her signed off for a month.\n\"Her manager said if I hadn't mentioned it, he would never have known because Leonie, and others who suffer with mental health, are really good at hiding it,\" she said.\nLeonie had spoken to her GP about her mental health but none of her records had shown she had ever thought about suicide.\n\"Just because someone doesn't say that they're suicidal doesn't mean that they're not,\" Stacey said. \"In fact, if someone is suicidal and is serious about it, they're not going to tell anyone because they don't want anyone to intervene.\n\"So just because someone says 'I'm not suicidal, I've not had these thoughts'  really doesn't mean that they genuinely haven't had these thoughts.\"\nStacey recognises that the pandemic has had an impact on lots of people's mental health.\n\"People have reached out to me - people I know and don't know - and a common theme is that the sufferer still doesn't want to burden people with their issues. The more we speak about it, the more people will realise you are absolutely not a burden. \n\"We now have to carry this burden for the rest of our lives. Leonie wouldn't have been a burden to us and nobody is. The world is not better off without people suffering mental health. We really need to start speaking about it.\"\nShe added: \"There are so many people we've not been heard about in the pandemic alone. Sixteen-year-olds, 15-year-olds, 17-year-olds all taking their lives. Something has to change. The more people speak about it the more they'll realise they're not alone. They're not as isolated as they think.\n\"This is happening far too often. To be honest, I think it's a bigger pandemic than the pandemic we're in.\"\nLeonie's father Mark spoke about the\"massive\" impact her death has had on her extended family.\n\"I think about her when I wake up and before I go to my bed. I think about her all day,\" he said. \"Her little brother is only eight I can't understand how an eight-year-old can take that in. It's taken its toll on everybody.\n\"I can only imagine what she was going through.\"\nLeonie's parents are hoping to set up a charity called Leonie's Legacy to help young people in crisis and have set up a gofundme page.\nIf you've been affected by issues raised in this story, sources of support are available via the BBC Action Line here.\nYou can call Samaritans free on 116 123, email them at jo@samaritans.org, or visit www.samaritans.org to find your nearest branch."

      "title": "The Queen and Prince Philip: An enduring royal romance",
      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Queen Elizabeth II",
      "text": "In a marriage that lasted more than seven decades, Prince Philip was the Queen's support in public at significant national moments - and in private the person who knew her best.\nAs one private secretary once put it: \"Prince Philip is the only man in the world who treats the Queen simply as another human being. He's the only man who can.\"\nIt was a marriage based on love. They chose one another.\nAlthough it wasn't the first time their paths had crossed, the photographs from their meeting at Dartmouth Naval College in 1939 reveal the beginning of their life together. \nHe was the dashing 18-year-old cadet who caught 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth's eye, larking about playing croquet and tennis. \nWhat started as a teenage crush developed over the years into friendship with letters exchanged and occasional visits during the war years. While he was away serving with the Royal Navy, the young princess kept a picture of him in her room.\nHis childhood had been nomadic - born a prince of Greece but then exiled,\u00a0he found himself bounced around Europe, the royal equivalent of sofa-surfing. \nHe had to be fiercely independent, a self-starter and emotionally strong. She had grown up largely behind palace walls, sheltered from the real world. Her character was reserved, shy and thoughtful. They complemented each other.\nTheir grandson Prince William would later sum up their connection, saying: \"He makes her laugh because some of the things he says and does and the way he looks at life is obviously slightly different than her, so together they're a great couple.\"\nAlthough he had made his intentions known a year earlier, it wasn't until 1947, after Elizabeth's 21st\u00a0birthday, that the public announcement of their engagement was made. \nPrince Philip helped to design the platinum and diamond engagement ring using stones from a tiara belonging to his mother, Princess Alice of Greece.\nShortly before their wedding, Prince Philip wrote to the Queen Mother saying he had \"fallen in love completely and unreservedly\". \nThe couple were married in front of 2,000 guests in Westminster Abbey. Just two years after the end of World War Two and with the country still reeling from the conflict, their wedding was a rare moment of celebration, Winston Churchill calling it \"a flash of colour on the hard road we travel\".\nThe following year, their eldest son Charles was born, and then their daughter Anne. Prince Philip was progressing rapidly through the ranks of the navy and the young family spent time living in Malta while he served on HMS Chequers. \nThey were able to live a relatively normal life and film footage from the time shows a young couple, relaxed in each other's company, enjoying life in a warm climate away from palaces and duty.\nAll that was to change on 6 February\u00a01952, with the premature death of King George VI. Queen Elizabeth was just 25 years old and Prince Philip aged 30. They always knew the princess was destined to become Queen but had expected a few more years to live their own lives.\nFor the duke, her accession meant giving up any ambitions he might have had within the Royal Navy. For a man used to commanding ships, to suddenly be relegated to a supporting role cannot have been easy. \nAnd let's not forget this was the 1950s when it was extremely rare for a husband to be outranked by his wife.\u00a0For the Queen, also a young mother, the role she was born to fulfil had to come first.\nIf their relationship suffered due to the shifting of their positions, it did so behind closed doors.\nPrince Philip took some time to define his role as his wife's consort - often battling courtiers in the process.\nIn 1956, he spent four months travelling around distant Commonwealth nations which led some to question his commitment to his wife. But once the pair had settled into a rhythm, the pattern was set for the decades to come.\nThe duke enabled the Queen to perform her role as head of state while he took on the role of head of the family. To the outside world she was the boss - in private the roles were reversed. Prince Philip was in charge of the barbecue while she did the washing up - as seen in the 1960s documentary about the Royal Family.\nHe would accompany her at big national moments - state visits, the state opening of Parliament, Remembrance events, anniversaries and thanksgiving services. Watch the footage - you will often a see a little glance between them, a small smile. Private moments in the most public of forums. \nThe duke would often be the one at engagements chatting animatedly to crowds or guests, paving the way or breaking the ice for the Queen's arrival. It was a double act which worked.\nBut the relationship also worked because they spent time apart. As the duke himself once said: \"It's the secret of a happy marriage to have different interests.\" \nThe Queen famously loves dogs and horses and spends a considerable amount of her free time keeping up with her race trainers and breeders. Prince Philip was a prolific sportsman throughout his life, took a keen interest in the running of the family estates and, in his later years, could often be seen carriage riding around Windsor Great Park or Sandringham.\u00a0\nIn 2012, Prince Harry said: \"Regardless of whether my grandfather seems to be doing his own thing, sort of wandering off like a fish down the river - the fact that he's there, personally, I don't think she could do it without him.\"\nFinally deciding he had \"done his bit\" after years of service, Prince Philip retired from public life in 2017. It meant we became used to seeing the Queen either on her own, or supported by another member of the family when carrying out her official duties. Up until March 2020, the duke could most usually be found in Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. \nHe was a man who famously did not like a fuss, and after years of having to get dressed up, make small talk and shake hands, there's little doubt he enjoyed the time simply reading, writing and painting. The downside being that the Queen's role necessitated she stay largely in London and Windsor. No doubt they were in touch regularly, but physically, they were separated.\nHowever, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, it was decided the two of them should shield together at Windsor Castle looked after by a small, dedicated staff which became known as HMS Bubble. \nFrom March 2020, in the final months of their marriage, because of the pandemic they spent more time together than they otherwise might have done. Within the confines of the castle, they would have had endless hours to reflect on the extraordinary things they had seen and experienced together.\nFor more than 70 years they have been the one constant in each other's lives and the Queen will feel Prince Philip's loss deeply and profoundly. \nNever showy or openly demonstrative - theirs will be remembered as an enduring royal love story."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe UK government has given more detail on the resumption of international travel. A traffic light system to categorise countries based on risk will include a watch list for those countries that could move from \"green\" to \"amber\". But a requirement for travellers to pay for Covid tests when departing and returning to the UK has left the travel industry frustrated. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC he was \"concerned\" about the cost of the tests, and the government was committed to driving down the price by working with the private sector. But ministers say they can't yet confirm whether overseas trips will  resume on 17 May - the earliest possible date set out previously. \nWales is relaxing its restrictions earlier than anticipated, thanks to a drop in the number of Covid cases. Gyms will be allowed to reopen from 3 May, with two households able to form a bubble to meet indoors from the same date, rather than 10 May. Outdoor wedding receptions for up to 30 people will move forward a week to 26 April. However, the dates for reopening hospitality remain unchanged, with pubs, cafes and restaurants able to serve outdoors from 26 April.\nThe UK's leading sports bodies are backing \"vaccine passports\" and Covid testing as \"credible\" means of allowing full capacities at venues. In a letter to the leaders of the major political parties, they say a certification process could be beneficial \"in getting more fans safely back as quickly as possible\". Signatories include the Football Association, the Premier League, the England and Wales Cricket Board, the Rugby Football Union, the All England Tennis Club at Wimbledon and Silverstone motor-racing circuit.\nIslamic scholars and NHS leaders are urging Muslims not to let fasting over Ramadan stop them getting a Covid jab. During Ramadan many Muslims abstain from food and drink in daylight hours and Islamic teaching says Muslims should prevent \"anything entering the body\" between sunrise and sunset. But Qari Asim, an imam in Leeds, says that because the vaccine goes into the muscle rather than the bloodstream and is not nutritious, it does not amount to breaking the fast.\nWith shops in England able to swing open their doors to customers from Monday, we gauge the mood in Bilston, a market town on the outskirts of Wolverhampton. Some traders are getting to grips with new rules, while others have adapted the way they promote their wares. But all are eager to get back to business.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWorried about rare blood clots after vaccination?

      "text": "Artist Tracey Emin has said her cancer has \"gone\" after a series of major surgeries.\nThe 57-year-old told BBC Newsnight she reached a \"big, big milestone\" last week when her three-monthly scans were \"all clear\".\nEmin was diagnosed with a \"really rapid, really aggressive\" bladder cancer last year.\n\"I'm not painting because I'm using my willpower to stay alive. That's what I'm doing,\" she told the programme.\nBut she said that over the coming years she hoped to put her energy back into painting, as well as \"being happy, smiling more, just enjoying life\". \n\"I never realised how much I wanted to live until I thought I was going to die,\" she said.\nEmin, who is known for her frank, confessional art, said she had her bladder removed, a full hysterectomy, her urethra removed, her lymph nodes removed, \"half of my vagina removed\", and part of her intestine removed to stop the spread of the cancer.\nShe now has a urostomy bag, which replaces the bladder and urinary system. It is a \"major disability\" because it needs to be emptied as frequently as every 20 minutes, she said.\n\"You never know when it's going to happen,\" she said.\nWhat is bladder cancer?\nThe extensive surgery meant her bladder cancer \"couldn't actually latch on to anything else\". Following the clear three-monthly scan, she will now move to annual scans, she said.\nBest known for such installations as her unmade bed and the tent Everyone I Have Ever Slept With, Emin was speaking ahead of the re-opening of a joint exhibition of her work with paintings by Edvard Munch on 18 May, which had been closed by England's lockdown this winter.\nThe Margate-based artist said when she began working on the Royal Academy of Arts exhibition four years ago she had \"no idea that there was a possibility that I was never going to see this show\".\nEmin said she resisted suggestions to cancel the show before the lockdown because \"if something happens to me, what else have I got? I've just got to do this\".\nThe government made a \"big mistake\" in categorising museums and galleries alongside nightclubs when it comes to reopening, she said, describing the decision as \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\"I think it's because the majority of the government at the moment have never probably been to museums or art galleries,\" she said. \n\"If they had and if they knew and if they knew the soulful benefits of looking at art, they would have kept them open or found some system to make it work.\"\nThe full interview with Tracey Emin will be shown on Newsnight on Friday 9 April from 22:45 GMT and afterwards on BBC iPlayer."

I promise you, they are not waiting,\" Mr Biden said in a speech on Wednesday.\nMr Biden said China and the rest of the world \"are racing ahead of us in the investments they have in the future\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Weekly deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales have dropped 92% since the peak of the second wave in January, according to official figures.\nMeanwhile, the total number of deaths registered in the UK over one week is 5% below the five-year average.\nIt comes amid continued efforts to reassure the public over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's possible link to rare blood clots.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the jab remained safe.\nHe urged those who had received one dose to take up their second and said the UK was on track to vaccinate all adults by 31 July.\nFigures from the Office of National Statistics showed there were 712 deaths involving Covid in the week ending 19 March, down from 8,945 in late January.\nThe largest falls were seen among the oldest age groups, with deaths falling 92.9% among those aged 80 and over and 93.4% for the 75 to 79 age group, compared to 83.7% for those aged 60 to 64.\nSeparate figures showed the number of deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 26 March was 11,439, which was 5% below the five-year average. Last week, deaths were 8% below the 5-year average.\nSome 799 of these deaths involved coronavirus.\nAdults aged over 80 were the second priority group for vaccination, followed by over-75s and over 70s. The government says everyone in these groups was offered a jab by mid-February.\nFigures on Thursday showed the UK's vaccination programme had recovered after a lull over Easter, with an extra 408,396 second doses administered and 99,530 first doses. The number of people fully vaccinated is now over six million, while 31.8 million have received just one dose.\nAnother 3,030 confirmed cases were reported, along with 53 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nSeeking to reassure people who have received a first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, Mr Hancock said there was \"no evidence\" of the rare blood clots after the second dose of the vaccine.\nThe UK changed policy on Wednesday to offer under-30s an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine, after weighing the benefits of vaccination compared to a potential very rare risk of blood clots.\nThere had been 79 incidents of the clots and 19 deaths among the 20 million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses administered, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said. That equates to a one-in-a-million risk of a fatal side effect.\nIt said there was no proof the vaccine had caused the clots but the link was getting firmer. Both the MHRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks, however.\nMr Hancock said people should have confidence in the safety system for vaccines because it was \"able to spot this extremely rare event\".\nThe risk was about the same as taking a long-haul flight, he said.\nAnd he said there was \"more than enough\" doses of vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna due to arrive to offer an alternative to the 8.5 million UK adults under 30 yet to be vaccinated.\nThe UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 17 million of the Moderna jab and also has agreements with several other companies for jabs that are still waiting for approval, including 100 million doses from Valneva and 30 million from Janssen.\nA government scientific adviser said communication of the benefits and side-effects was \"critical\" to avoiding a loss of confidence in the vaccines.\nProf Stephen Reicher told BBC Radio 4's World at One that having a Covid jab is \"actually one of the safer things you do in the day\".\n\"Something like 30 or 40 people drown in the bath every year, something like 1,000 people die falling down the stairs, something like 200 die from choking on their breakfast, and that's many, many more deaths than we get from these vaccines,\" he said."

      "text": "Nearly 90 officers have been hurt in Northern Ireland's worst street violence for years, after sporadic rioting in several towns and cities since the end of March.\nThe governments in Belfast, London and Dublin have condemned the unrest, with the US calling for calm as police used water cannons for the first time in six years.\nEighteen people have been arrested and 15 charged after crowds of predominantly loyalist youths attacked lines of riot police officers and vehicles with bricks, fireworks and petrol bombs.\nSaturday night was the first without major incident since Good Friday on 2 April, with the lack of trouble being linked to the death of the Duke of Edinburgh.\nWhile all Northern Ireland's main parties have condemned the violence, they are divided about its causes. \nViolence involving gangs of youths started on 29 March in an area of Londonderry that is loyalist - in favour of keeping Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.\nUntil the death of Prince Philip on 9 April, there were protests and rioting on a near-nightly basis in a number of towns and cities, including Belfast, Carrickfergus, Ballymena and Newtownabbey.\nThe areas affected are among the most deprived in the country, with the lowest level of educational attainment in Europe. \nOn the night of 7 April, the fighting spilled over a so-called peace wall in west Belfast that divides predominantly Protestant loyalist communities from predominantly Catholic nationalist communities who want to see a united Ireland.\nA gate that divides the two was smashed open and, during several hours of disorder, police officers and a press photographer were attacked and a bus was hijacked and burned.\nThe clashes raised concerns of escalating sectarian tensions. \nParts of Northern Ireland are still split along sectarian lines, 23 years after a peace deal largely ended Northern Ireland's Troubles - which lasted almost 30 years and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people.\nWhile there are no clear indications the unrest is being orchestrated by an organised group, the violence has been concentrated in areas where criminal gangs linked to loyalist paramilitaries have significant influence.\nThere is increasing evidence that senior figures in organisations such as the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force are allowing the trouble to proceed.\nAnalysts suggest loyalist paramilitaries of the South East Antrim UDA may have exploited an opportunity to kick back at the Police Service of Northern Ireland after a recent clampdown on criminality in the area around Carrickfergus.\nThe paramilitary group is involved in many forms of organised crime, doing \"untold damage to the community and exerting fear in neighbourhoods\", say police. \nNorthern Ireland's children's commissioner said adults engaged in \"criminal exploitation\" of fighting youths \"had to be held accountable\".\nKoulla Yiasouma said the violence involved \"coercion by adults of vulnerable and at-risk children\".\nRead more: 'A criminal cartel wrapped in a flag'\nUnionist leaders have linked the violence to simmering loyalist tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal.\nThe new trading border is the result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, introduced to avoid the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nThe protocol means Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market for goods, so products being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland undergo EU import procedures.\nIt avoids the need for checks on the Irish border, as EU customs rules are enforced at Northern Ireland's ports instead. \nUnionists say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK.\nIn January, graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border was daubed on walls in some loyalist areas, including parts of Bangor, Belfast, Glengormley, and the home of one of Northern Ireland's main ports, Larne. \nThese Brexit checks were temporarily suspended amid reported threats against port workers in Larne and Belfast - although the police later said there was no evidence of \"credible threats\".\nIn March, a group which includes representatives of loyalist paramilitaries wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to withdraw its support for the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 deal that effectively ended the Troubles.\nThe Loyalist Communities Council said it was temporarily withdrawing its backing because of concerns about the protocol.\nLord Frost, the UK Brexit minister, is to meet EU Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic in Brussels on Thursday to discuss plans about implementing the protocol.\nRead more: What is Brexit doing to Northern Ireland?\nSome unionist leaders have attributed the violence to the decision not to prosecute leaders of the republican Sinn F\u00e9in party for breaching Covid regulations at the funeral of a former IRA intelligence chief last June.\nBobby Storey's funeral drew 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when strict Covid restrictions were still in place, limiting the number of people who could gather in public.\nMany people expressed anger at Ms O'Neill for failing to follow the guidance she insisted the public should follow - guidance which had led to loyalist band parades being cancelled last summer. \nSome have accused police of double standards after the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said there would be no prosecutions - against the police's recommendations.\nWhile DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster said she did not share that view, she called on PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign.\nMr Byrne said he recognised people were angry, but has refused to step down. \nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has said the PSNI and the Policing Board need to reconnect with communities to restore trust, adding that the decision not to bring charges over Bobby Storey's funeral had \"a very substantial impact\" on the street violence.\nRead more: Why was Bobby Storey's funeral so controversial?\nContact: @hirstmike"

      "text": "Boris Johnson says any testing regime for international travel should be easy and cheap, after the boss of EasyJet criticised new government plans.\nThe prime minister also said vaccine passports would be a \"fact of life\" for people travelling internationally in future.\nThe government hopes to reopen international travel on 17 May, but is yet to make a final decision. \nHowever, the prime minister said he had \"not given up\" on the idea.\nUnder plans outlined on Sunday, destinations would be classed as green, amber or red based on their Covid infection rates and vaccination coverage. \nNo isolation would be necessary on return to the UK from green countries, but pre-departure and post-arrival tests would be required, potentially costing up to \u00a3200 each.\nBut earlier on Tuesday, EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren told the BBC this would make travel too expensive, with the tests costing as much or more than a flight in some cases.\nAsked about the comments, and whether cheaper lateral flow tests could replace PCR tests in the plans, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"I do think we want to make things as easy as we possibly can.\n\"The boss of EasyJet is right to focus on this issue, we're going to see what we can do to make things as flexible and as affordable as possible.\"\nMr Lundgren told the BBC that if costs were not reduced, the government \"wouldn't open up international travel for everyone, but only those who can afford it.\n\"If you are ticking all of those boxes to become a green destination\u2026 [multiple tests] don't make sense to me and it would add to cost and complexities.\"\nScientists and ministers recently warned that holidays to destinations such as France, where Covid cases are rising, are \"unlikely\". But Mr Johnson said he \"had not given up\" on the idea that non-essential foreign travel could begin again on 17 May.\nHowever, other travel industry figures called for clarity following the prime minister's latest announcement on lockdown restrictions easing.\nThe Business Travel Association said the announcement was \"beyond disappointing\" and called for \"a clear pathway to international travel and trade\".\nIts chief executive, Clive Wratten, said moves to open borders had \"once again been kicked down the road\".\n\"The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement,\" he added.\nThe boss of travel firm Thomas Cook, Alan French, also told the BBC's Wake Up to Money that a lack of clarity around what type of tests might be required for passengers and when they would need to be taken was a let-down.\nHe said that overall, there were \"glimmers of good news\", in that the earliest date for travel resuming on 17 May was not pushed back. \"But actually, the details were missing and that was disappointing,\" he said.\nOn Monday, Mr Johnson said he did not want to see coronavirus re-imported from abroad and urged people to wait for a report from the Global Travel Taskforce on 12 April.\nBut Gemma Antrobus, owner of independent travel company Haslemere Travel, warned that business owners like herself faced a difficult path.\n\"Disappointed is putting it mildly. Where we hoped confidence would start to pick up, and more people would be interested in booking holidays\u2026 that just won't come this week.\"\nShe added that some customers had now moved bookings for holidays five times amid changing restrictions.\n\"Every week we don't have that confidence from consumers, business owners like myself just wonder what lies ahead.\""

The place in general is in a frenzy.\"\nInhabitants of the red zone constitute more than 10% of the country's population.\nLater on Friday another explosion was recorded, the UWI Seismic Research Centre tweeted.\nSome evacuation procedures were hindered by the heavy ash fall, which had made visibility \"extremely poor\", Nemo said.\n\"Now that the La Soufri\u00e8re volcano has begun erupting explosively, ash falls will soon overwhelm us,\" the organisation wrote on Facebook, adding: \"Be sure to get rid of or clean up the ash, soon after it falls. If rain falls, the ash could harden and pose a danger to you.\"\nMost of the Lesser Antilles islands are part of a long volcanic arc in the Eastern Caribbean.\nThe last eruption, in 1979, caused more than $100m (\u00a373m) of damage on the island. \nThe worst eruption on record, in 1902, killed more than 1,000 people.\nLocal media have also reported increased activity from Mount Pelee on the island of Martinique, north of St Vincent."

I see shops reopening and close contact services reopening in tiny shops... it's frustrating. \n\"I've been closed [for] four months now. It's annoying that Welsh government are making changes all the time.\"\nMichaela Breeze, a Commonwealth Games weightlifting champion who owns her own gym in Swansea, said the news was \"fantastic\" but she was \"pulling my hair out in despair\" because she had already spent money planning to open on the previous date.\n\"That decision has cost me several thousands of pounds,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"We are trying to run businesses here - it requires time, it requires practice and it requires planning to notify members.\"\nDylan Allsopp, a personal trainer in Treforest, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said: \"It's great we have been given the opportunity to open early, but realistically we are still back of the queue with no data to back it up.\n\"When you look at the data and you see gyms contribute to two cases in 100,000 visits, you wonder why you aren't being allowed to open.\"\nAlthough she admitted to not being an avid user of gyms, molecular epidemiologist Dr Helen Wimalarathna said there was a risk to reopening them, but this needed to be balanced against the benefit to people's health.\n\"It's a question of ventilation and how much people exhale in a gym environment,\" she said.\n\"Getting hot and sweaty and breathing out over the equipment, then there's a high degree of sanitisation that needs to take place afterwards before it is safe for someone else to use that space.\n\"But obviously exercise is really important for people, physically and mentally, and we know that physical health and underlying factors like obesity have really contributed to the worst of this pandemic, so it is good to give people the opportunity to keep in shape.\"\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmed that lockdown changes which had been planned for 12 April would go ahead. \nThis means, from Monday, all remaining children will return to school for face-to-face learning, non-essential shops will reopen, and close-contact services, such as beauticians, will be allowed to reopen. \nNon-essential retailers have been closed since Wales went into lockdown on 20 December. \nTravel across the border between Wales and England will also be permitted from Monday. \nWales' \"stay local\" rule was removed on 27 March, allowing people to travel anywhere within its borders, but the changes will allow travel across the whole of the UK. \nThe decision follows a rapid drop in the number of new coronavirus cases in Wales. \nDates for the reopening of the hospitality industry in Wales have not changed, despite the other alterations to lockdown easing dates. \nPubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to open outdoors from 26 April and indoor service could be allowed from the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. \nPubs in England can reopen outdoors from Monday. \nWales' case rate, which measures the number of infections per 100,000 people over a seven-day period, stands at 21, compared to 37 last week.\nConfirmed cases in hospital beds are 26% lower than last Thursday, the lowest number since 22 September.\nMr Drakeford said: \"Last week, we set out our programme to further reopen the economy and relax the restrictions we have lived with for so long, as part of our careful, step-by-step approach to keeping everyone safe. \n\"This week, because of the improvements we continue to see, we can bring forward some of our plans. This is only possible because of the efforts everyone is making to protect themselves and their loved ones.\"\nAny of the changes proposed after 6 May could depend on the outcome of the Senedd elections and which party is in power.\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: \"Plaid Cymru has been pressing the case for gyms to reopen as quickly and as safely as is possible because they are crucial for people's mental health and well-being. This new date, whilst welcome, is still not early enough. \n\"The scenes of unregulated drinking over recent days has been a serious cause of concern and many will question the Labour government's decision not to move the reopening of outdoor hospitality forward. A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option.\"\nAndrew RT Davies, the Senedd leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: \"The great British vaccination programme protects more and more lives every day and gives us the ability to restore freedoms in a safe but accelerated manner.\n\"Pressure from the public and Welsh Conservatives have forced Labour ministers to act, but there is still more they can do in accelerating the roadmap with the safe resumption of activities such as outdoor hospitality and gyms.\"\nJane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: \"This is welcome news. Gyms and fitness centres play an important part in both the physical and mental health of so many people across Wales. Everyone who has abided by the rules has played a part in bringing this announcement forward.\n\"The public must remember however that the virus has not gone away and they need to stick to the rules including with regard to social distancing.\""

      "text": "Political leaders, members of the public and well-wishers around the world have paid tribute to Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband, after his death at the age of 99. \nA statement issued by Buckingham Palace just after midday spoke of the Queen's \"deep sorrow\" following his death at Windsor Castle on Friday morning.\nHe was the longest-serving royal consort in British history.\nPrince Charles said his father's life was an \"astonishing achievement\".\nReflecting on Prince Philip's life for a BBC programme, Prince Charles said: \"His energy was astonishing in supporting my mama [the Queen] - and doing it for such a long time, and, in some extraordinary way, being able to go on doing it for so long. \n\"What he has done has amounted to an astonishing achievement, I think.\"\nPrincess Anne said the duke \"treated everyone as an individual, and gave them the respect he felt they were due as individuals\".\nAnnouncing the duke's death, the Palace said: \"It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband.\n\"The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.\"\nIt is understood that the Prince of Wales travelled to Windsor Castle to visit his mother on Friday afternoon.\nSpeaking at Downing Street, prime minister Boris Johnson added that the duke had \"earned the affection of generations here in the United Kingdom, across the Commonwealth, and around the world\".\nMeanwhile, Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said he \"consistently put the interests of others ahead of his own and, in so doing, provided an outstanding example of Christian service\".\nIn tribute to the duke, Westminster Abbey tolled its tenor bell once every 60 seconds for 99 times from 18:00 BST - to honour each year of his life.\nEarlier, the flag at Buckingham Palace was lowered to half-mast and a notice was posted on the gates to mark the duke's death.\nPeople placed floral tributes outside the central London landmark, while hundreds visited Windsor Castle to pay their respects.\nHowever, the government urged the public not to gather or leave tributes at royal residences amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Royal Family has asked people to consider making a donation to a charity instead of leaving flowers in memory of the duke, and an online book of condolence has been launched on the official royal website for those who wish to send messages.\nA message on the website of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's non-profit organisation Archewell paid tribute to the \"loving memory\" of the Duke of Edinburgh, saying: \"Thank you for your service... you will be greatly missed.\"\nFrom midday on Saturday, a 41-gun salute will take place for Prince Philip in cities including London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, as well as in Gibraltar and at sea from Royal Navy warships, the Ministry of Defence said. They will be broadcast online and on television for the public to watch from home.\nAll UK government buildings have been told to fly official flags at half-mast in tribute to the duke until 08:00 BST on the day after the duke's funeral.\nPrince Philip's funeral will take place at St George's Chapel, Windsor - but the arrangements have been amended in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the College of Arms said in a statement.\nThe duke will not have a state funeral and there will be no lying-in-state, in line with his wishes, it added. \nThe college said the duke will, however, lie at rest in Windsor Castle before a royal ceremonial funeral, which means his death will be marked in the same way as the Queen Mother.\nThe public are \"regretfully\" requested not to attend due to the pandemic, and it is understood the Queen is considering modified funeral and ceremonial arrangements.\nPoliticians across the UK were united in mourning following the announcement of the duke's death.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the UK had \"lost an extraordinary public servant\", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said his \"long contribution to public life in Scotland will leave a profound mark on its people\".\nWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the duke \"served the crown with selfless devotion and generosity of spirit\", and Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said he was \"widely respected for his active and dedicated service to the country\".\nParliament will honour the duke on Monday, with the House of Commons sitting at 14:30 BST for tributes following his death. \nParties have also suspended their campaigning for elections on 6 May, which will see voters head to the polls for council and mayoral positions in England, the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Parliament.\nMeanwhile, Commonwealth leaders led international reaction to the duke's death. \nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison tweeted that the duke \"embodied a generation that we will never see again\", while Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described Philip as a \"man of great purpose and conviction\".\nAnd Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled the duke for his \"distinguished career in the military\" and work \"at the forefront of many community service initiatives\".\nUS President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden joined other world leaders in sending their \"deepest condolences\" to the Queen, the Royal Family and the people of the UK. \nIn a statement, they said the duke \"gladly dedicated himself to the people of the UK, the Commonwealth, and to his family\".\n\"His legacy will live on, not only through his family, but in all the charitable endeavours he shaped,\" it said.\nPrince Philip and the Queen had four children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.\nTheir first son, the Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, was born in 1948, followed by his sister, the Princess Royal, Princess Anne, in 1950, the Duke of York, Prince Andrew, in 1960 and the Earl of Wessex, Prince Edward, in 1964.\nPrince Philip was born on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921. \nHis father was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, a younger son of King George I of the Hellenes. \nHis mother, Princess Alice, was a daughter of Prince Louis of Battenberg and a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria."

This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "The brother of the Manchester Arena bomber has said in court he regards a prison officer he is accused of assaulting as a \"filthy pig\".\nHashem Abedi appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court accused of assaulting Paul Edwards last May.\nMr Edwards received cuts to his head and bruising during the attack at HMP Belmarsh on 11 May 2020.\nMuhammed Saeed, 23, and failed Parsons Green bomber Ahmed Hassan are also both accused of the same attack.\nProsecutor Nicholas Alexander said Abedi, 24, Hassan, 21, and Saeed, who appeared in court on Wednesday, attacked Mr Edwards in an office in the prison.\nThe court heard that Mr Edwards suffered a laceration to the top of the scalp and that a blow to his ear had caused permanent sensory loss.\nWhen asked to give his name at the hearing on Thursday, addressing the Chief Magistrate, Hassan said: \"I want you to know that I hate you very much because you are a judge, judging by other than the law of Allah.\n\"You will be destined for hellfire unless you repent and submit yourself to the law of Allah.\"\nHe also complained he had not had the case papers and evidence disclosed to him.\nHe then pleaded not guilty to assaulting Mr Edwards causing him actual bodily harm.\nWhen Abedi, appearing via videolink from HMP Frankland in County Durham, where he is serving life in prison for his involvement in the Manchester attack, was asked to enter a plea to the same charge, he described Mr Edwards as a \"filthy pig\". \nChief magistrate Paul Goldspring said a plea of not guilty should be entered.\nDuring the 15-minute hearing, Abedi also refused to enter a plea to a charge of assaulting a second member of staff, Nick Barnett. Again the chief magistrate said a plea of not guilty should be entered.\nAbedi, Hassan and Saeed are next due to appear at Woolwich Crown Court on 5 May."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Ramadan,Islam,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Islamic scholars and NHS leaders are urging Muslims not to let fasting over Ramadan stop them getting a Covid jab.\nDuring Ramadan many Muslims abstain from food and drink in daylight hours. \nIslamic teaching says Muslims should refrain \"from anything entering the body\" between sunrise and sunset.\nBut Qari Asim, an imam in Leeds, said that because the vaccine goes into the muscle rather than the bloodstream and is not nutritious, it does not amount to breaking the fast. \n\"The majority of the Islamic scholars are of the view that taking the vaccine during Ramadan will not invalidate the fast,\" Mr Asim, who chairs the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, told the BBC. \nHe said his message to the Muslim community was: \"If you are eligible for the vaccine and have received your invite, you need to ask yourself: do you take the vaccine which has proven to be effective or do you risk catching Covid, which can make you quite ill, and you may potentially miss the whole of Ramadan and possibly end up in hospital?\"\nSome NHS vaccine sites in Nottingham and Brighton are extending their opening hours so Muslims can come after they have broken their fast. \nBut Dr Farzana Hussain, a senior GP from The Surgery Project in east London, said there was no need to avoid daylight hours. \n\"We know that a lot of Muslims are a bit concerned about having their Covid vaccination during Ramadan. Many people believe that having an injection actually breaks the fast,\" she said. \"But it doesn't at all because it's not considered nutrition.\"\nShe added: \"The Quran says saving your life is the most important thing: 'To save one life is to save the whole of humanity.' It's a responsibility of a practising Muslim to take their vaccine.\"\nSome mosques are being used as vaccination centres in an effort to boost take up among minority communities. \nPolling from Ipsos Mori suggests a dramatic increase in ethnic minority Britons who say they have had, or are likely to have, the vaccine - from 77% in January to 92% in March.\nRamadan, which is expected to begin on Monday evening after the sighting of the Moon over Mecca, is traditionally marked by regular communal prayers in mosques and shared meals - or Iftars - to break the fast after sunset. \nAlthough communal worship is allowed across the UK, social distancing must be enforced and different households cannot mix indoors.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association (BIMA) has issued guidance for mosques during Ramadan. They recommend keeping Taraweeh - the main evening prayers - short, increasing ventilation, and say imams should wear \"properly fitted double masks to protect congregants\".\nDr Shehla Imtiaz-Umer, a GP in Derby and representative of the BIMA, told the BBC: \"We've seen a lot of devastation in our communities because of the Covid pandemic and we want to try and make sure that our future Ramadans are not affected to this extent.\n\"Unfortunately it's been affected last year and this year. But if we carry on taking our vaccines and making sure that we're all protected, we can ensure that next Ramadan we do return to some normality.\""
