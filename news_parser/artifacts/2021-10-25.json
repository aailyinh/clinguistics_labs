      "title": "Covid in Scotland: Hundreds refused entry in vaccine passport 'chaos'",
      "tags": "Nightclubs,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "The first weekend of enforcement of Scotland's vaccine passport scheme was an \"unmitigated disaster\", according to a body representing night-time venues. \nVenue staff refused entry to revellers without vaccine passports more than 550 times, and some staff were abused, the Scottish Hospitality Group said. \nIt said some venues decided to close early and footfall was down by up to 40%. \nThe Scottish government said the scheme was a \"proportionate\" health measure. \nMinisters say it will encourage more people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and ensure late-night venues can remain open during a \"potentially very difficult\" winter. \nThe vaccine certification scheme was introduced on 1 October but there was no enforcement during a 17-day \"grace period\" as venues adjusted to the new requirements.  \nThe Scottish Hospitality Group, which opposes the scheme, said the first real test this weekend had been \"one of unmitigated disaster\".\n\"The Scottish Hospitality Group has been warning the government for weeks that their vaccine passports scheme is not ready - but the government's attitude has been to tell us to 'get on with it' whilst offering no safety net of support for businesses or our hard working staff,\" spokesperson Stephen Montgomery said. \n\"The experience of this weekend shows that the result has been intolerable levels of abuse of our staff, and the creation of an atmosphere that will totally undermine anyone's enjoyment of our night-time venues.\"\nThe group said there was a \"concerning number\" of reports of staff being abused over rejections and queues which led to a \"charged atmosphere\". \nSome venues had decided to close at midnight, taking them outside the scope of the scheme, because of problems with staff recruitment and welfare, it said.\nMr Montgomery rejected a suggestion that the numbers being turned away was a sign the scheme was working properly in keeping unvaccinated people away from higher risk settings. \n\"Turning people away at the door - yes, I get the point to a degree - but all it's doing is sending them somewhere else, a dancefloor that has tables and chairs on it that does away with dancing,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme.\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the scheme was \"unworkable and unreasonable\" with no financial support for businesses or their staff. \nThe party's Covid recovery spokesperson Murdo Fraser said: \"What is most concerning is the levels of abuse hospitality workers have been subjected to, caused by a lack of public engagement, and a frustrating and unreliable app.\"\nThe Scottish government insisted it was continuing to engage with the sector to discuss implementation of the scheme. \nA spokesperson said: \"Covid-19 certification is a proportionate way of encouraging people to get vaccinated, and also of helping large events and night-time hospitality to keep operating during what will potentially be a very difficult winter.\n\"This means many businesses will not have to close and can continue to trade whilst making necessary adjustments to ensure their premises are as safe as possible for staff and customers.\"\nPeople who have had two vaccines in Scotland can download or get a paper copy of a certificate with a QR code.\nEveryone over the age of 18 must now show - if asked - that they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to certain venues and events. These include:\nThe scheme requires venues to put in place a \"reasonable system\" to check the status of customers, with certain exemptions on medical grounds.\nFor large events such as football matches spot checks can be used, but for smaller gatherings more rigorous checking is required.

      "tags": "Alec Baldwin,Firearms,Film",
      "text": "Actor Alec Baldwin was drawing a revolver across his body and pointing it at a camera during a rehearsal on a US film set when it fired with tragic results, legal documents have revealed.\nCinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was injured while filming Rust on Thursday.\nAffidavits containing statements from Souza and camera operator Reid Russell have shed more light on what happened.\nBaldwin was handed a prop gun and told it was unloaded, court documents said.\nSouza was standing behind Hutchins when they were both hit, according to the affidavit.\n\"Joel stated that they had Alec sitting in a pew in a church building setting, and he was practicing a cross draw,\" it said.\n\"Joel said he was looking over the shoulder of [Hutchins], when he heard what sounded like a whip and then loud pop.\"\nThe document said 42-year-old Hutchins was shot in the chest area.\n\"Joel then vaguely remembers [Hutchins] complaining about her stomach and grabbing her mid-section. Joel also said [Hutchins] began to stumble backwards and she was assisted to the ground.\"\nRussell, who was standing next to Hutchins at the time of the shooting, told officials she said she could not feel her legs.\nWhen asked how Baldwin treated firearms on the set, Russell said the actor was very careful, citing an instance when the star made sure a child actor was not near him when a gun was being discharged.\nOn Friday, authorities said assistant director Dave Halls had handed the weapon to Baldwin and announced \"cold gun\", indicating it was safe to use.\nMeanwhile, Serge Svetnoy, chief electrician for Rust, said in a Facebook post on Sunday he held Hutchins in his arms while she was dying and blamed \"negligence and unprofessionalism\" for her death.\nOn Sunday, a crew member who worked with Halls on another project said she had raised safety concerns about him in 2019.\nMaggie Goll, a prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician, told the Associated Press (AP) he disregarded safety protocols for weapons and pyrotechnics on the set of a TV show and tried to continue filming after the supervising pyrotechnician lost consciousness.\nHalls has not returned AP's requests for comment. Goll added: \"This situation is not about Dave Halls... It's in no way one person's fault. It's a bigger conversation about safety on set and what we are trying to achieve with that culture.\"\nBoth Souza and Russell also described a walkout by a camera crew shortly before last week's accident in New Mexico.\n\"Reid stated that the camera crew was having issues with production involving payment and housing,\" the affidavit said, explaining that six of the crew had left.\nThe Santa Fe Sheriff's Office is conducting an investigation into the incident, while the producers are also carrying out an internal investigation. \nThe producers have halted work on the set \"at least until investigations are complete\".\nIn a statement read at a candlelight vigil on Saturday, Hutchins's husband Matthew called his wife's death \"an enormous loss\".\nHe also posted photos of the pair with their nine-year-old son.\nIn an Instagram post, Baldwin's wife Hilaria said \"my heart is with Halyna\".\n\"It's impossible to express the shock and heartache of such a tragic incident,\" she wrote.\nBaldwin's co-star Jensen Ackles also paid tribute to Hutchins.\n\"I'm not even sure where to start,\" he wrote. \"This has been a tragedy of epic proportions that we are all still processing.\n\"There just aren't enough words to express what an immense loss this is. She will be incredibly missed by all of us who knew and admired her.\""

      "tags": "Plastic,Plastic pollution,Recycling,Boris Johnson,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "Recycling plastic materials \"doesn't work\" and \"is not the answer\" to threats to global oceans and marine wildlife, Boris Johnson has said.\nAnswering children's questions ahead of the COP26 climate change summit, the prime minister said reusing plastics \"doesn't begin to address the problem\".\nInstead, he said, \"we've all got to cut down our use of plastic\".\nThe Recycling Association said the PM had \"completely lost the plastic plot\".\nThe association's Simon Ellin told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme Mr Johnson's comments were \"very disappointing\" and seemed to conflict with government policy.\nBut some anti-plastic campaigners praised the prime minister's stance and urged him to follow it up with measures to dramatically reduce plastic at source.\nSian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet, said: \"Less than 10% [of plastic] is actually recycled in the UK. Despite being touted by industry as a solution to the problem, all it has done is justify overproduction and created an industrial addiction to this indestructible, toxic material.\"\nDuring the special event organised by Downing Street, Mr Johnson told an audience of eight to 12-year-olds that rather than relying on recycling, people should reduce their consumption of plastic products.\nTanya Steele, chief executive of the World Wide Fund for Nature, told the event: \"We have to reduce, we have to reuse - I do think we need to do a little bit of recycling, PM, and have some system to do so.\"\nBut the PM said it was a \"mistake\" to think society can recycle its way out of the problem, and added: \"It doesn't work.\"\nAsked later about Mr Johnson's comments, his official spokesman said the PM continued to encourage recycling - though he said relying on it alone would be a \"red herring\".\nThe prime minister's words might have been careless, but they have an element of truth.\nPolls consistently show many people feel they're doing their bit to protect the climate if they gather up plastic bottles and take the car up to the recycling point on a Saturday.\nBut in truth, recycling is a bit of a soft option. It's far less important than many other actions to curb emissions, such as stopping flying, or buying an electric car, or giving up meat. But these actions are harder to do.\nAnd as the PM said, there's a limit to how many times plastic can be recycled.\nBut having said that, it's far better to recycle a plastic bottle than to throw it away.\nBecause recycling plastic isn't just helping a little to rein in climate change, it's also keeping waste out of the oceans, conserving energy and saving some of the earth's precious resources.\nThere are plans to increase recycling in England, which the government has said \"typically results in lower carbon emissions in comparison to manufacturing products from virgin materials\".\n\"Priority goes to preventing the creation of waste in the first place, followed by preparing waste for reuse; to recycling, and then recovery,\" the waste management plan for England said.\nThe most recent figures for England showed a recycling rate of 45.5% for household waste. Waste policy is largely set by the devolved administrations in the UK.\nEach UK council collects its plastic recycling differently. A BBC analysis in 2018 showed there were 39 different sets of rules for what can be put in plastic recycling collections.\nMeanwhile, with just days to go before COP26 begins in Glasgow next week, the PM said it was \"touch and go\" whether the summit would deliver progress.\nMillions of lives could be affected by any changes agreed at the conference - and we have devised a quiz for you to discover which policies would have the most impact.\nBy Esme Stallard, BBC Reality Check\nThe prime minister criticised drinks giant Coca-Cola for being among 12 big corporations \"that are producing the overwhelming bulk of the world's plastics\".\nThe company sells more than 100 billion throwaway plastic bottles each year, causing problems in countries too small to effectively recycle them, BBC Panorama has found.\nCoca-Cola said it was making \"steady progress\" in efforts to cut waste and all its smaller bottles in Great Britain were made from 100% recycled plastic.\nDuring the event, Mr Johnson also signalled the government does not want to support new coal mines, as ministers face pressure to prevent a site opening in Cumbria.\nAnd he jokingly suggested feeding human beings to animals to \"bring nature back\".\nMs Steele told the audience: \"97% of the mass of mammals on this planet is humans and our animals, our domestic animals. Just 3% is left for the wild.\"\nIn response, Mr Johnson said it was \"so sad\", and quipped: \"We could feed some of the human beings to the animals.\"\nMs Steele replied: \"We could have a vote later and ask if there's any candidates.\"\nHow many tonnes of CO2 per year each action would save for an average person, according to research by the University of Leeds:\nSource: Environmental Research Letters\nViewers in the UK can watch the full story on Panorama: Coca-Cola's 100 Billion Bottle Problem on BBC One at 19:35 BST. It will also be available on BBC iPlayer."

      "tags": "Oil,Fuel,Motoring",
      "text": "Petrol prices have hit 142.94p a litre, their highest level to date, according to the RAC motoring organisation.\nFuel prices were last around this level in April 2012. \nIt is now \u00a315 more expensive to fill up an average family car than a year earlier, said the RAC, which called the new high a \"dark day for drivers\".\nThe RAC said the increase was partly due to a doubling of the oil price since last year. Some analysts believe the oil price could rise further.\nThe price of unleaded petrol has jumped by 28p a litre since last October, the RAC said, meaning it now costs \u00a378.61 to fill a family car.\n\"This will hurt many household budgets and no doubt have knock-on implications for the wider economy,\" a spokesman for the RAC said.\nThe organisation said that other costs, aside from oil, had also pushed up fuel prices. \nRetailers had increased their profit margins by 2p a litre from around 5.5p in April last year to 7.5p a litre. \nThe RAC said retailers, particularly the smaller, independent ones, were trying to rebuild their profits after the steep fall in sales prompted by the first UK lockdown in spring last year. \nIn addition to this, the ethanol component of unleaded petrol was doubled to 10% last month in the more eco-friendly E10 fuel, but as ethanol is more expensive than petrol, that added about 1p a litre.\nDuty paid on fuel is currently 57.95p a litre, more than the cost of the combined bio and petrol components, which amount to around 50p. \nVAT, currently around 24p a litre, is applied on top of all other elements of the petrol price, including duty and the retailer's profit margin. \nPetrol and diesel cars are slowly being phased out as part of pledges to tackle climate change.\nThe government says it will ban the sale of these from 2030. \nThe introduction of the E10 fuel as standard this summer is also part of that drive.\nThe Department for Transport says bringing in this new fuel could cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year, the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road."

      "text": "\"Mina. Mina, we found a knife. Mina, I'm going to need you to sit down. I found them. I found them but they've gone.\"\nWith those words, Adam Stone extinguished Mina Smallman's last spark of hope that this story could have a happy ending.\nOver the previous two days she had become increasingly concerned about the oldest and youngest of her three daughters, unable to reach either Bibaa Henry or Nicole Smallman - the partner of Mr Stone.\nThe police had seemed uninterested; Mrs Smallman felt there was a frustrating lack of urgency in searching for the sisters, who had been celebrating Ms Henry's 46th birthday at a country park.\n\"I said to the police: 'We don't know if there's been foul play here - we have no idea. We are now 36 hours on and they haven't turned up.'\n\"I knew instantly why they didn't care. They didn't care because they looked at my daughter's address and they thought they knew who she was.\n\"A black woman who lives on a council estate.\"\nThe news of the murders of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman hit the headlines on Monday 8 June 2020.\nThe two sisters had been repeatedly stabbed. Their bodies had been lying behind a line of trees at Fryent Country Park in Wembley, north-west London, since the very early hours of Saturday. \nMr Stone and friends who had been with the women at the birthday gathering had already tried to raise the alarm. \nHe knew something was wrong when neither woman could be contacted on Saturday. He knew it when Ms Smallman's flatmate said she had not come home, and when he couldn't trace his girlfriend with a phone-finding app, and when he saw that her bank account had not been accessed. He knew it when there was no answer to his frantic knocks at Ms Henry's front door. \nHe had telephoned anyone he thought could shed light on the disappearance, including the police. Nothing. The two women had seemingly just vanished.\nNina Esmat, a nurse who had been friends with Ms Henry since they were 16, was equally as convinced that something terrible had happened. And so, on Sunday 7 June Ms Esmat and Mr Stone made their separate ways to Fryent Country Park, where Ms Esmat found a pair of Ms Henry's sunglasses.\n\"I saw them glinting in the sun and my heart sank. I just knew she would not have left them behind.\" She called the police who told her to take them to a local police station.\nMr Stone and his parents continued to search.\nHe found another pair of sunglasses, these belonging to Ms Smallman. He left them where they lay, in case the park became acknowledged as the crime scene it was. \nMr Stone's father found a knife. \nMr Stone saw shoes in the undergrowth.\nHe had found his girlfriend. The woman he had been with for six years, who had lived with him at his parents' house. The co-owner of their pet bearded dragon. \nThe last text message he received from her said: \"I'm dancing in a field.\"\nNow, lifeless, she had been left intertwined with her equally motionless older sister. Their eyes were open, blank and dull. Stab wounds were visible on their bodies.\nMr Stone dropped to his knees and screamed. \n\"It was like the whole world stopped at that point,\" his mother said.\nMr Stone had to break the news to the others. He telephoned Mrs Smallman. He texted Ms Esmat. He used the same phrase: \"I found them. They're gone.\"\nThe events leading up to the attack were pieced together. Detectives soon determined the perpetrator was a stranger. There was no logic to the killing of Ms Henry and Ms Smallman. They were chosen because they were there. \nThe evening had started so well. The picnic area had been decked out with blankets and cushions. Ms Esmat was the first to arrive and joined the sisters at the top of the hill. \n\"It was a beautiful evening, amazing view, amazing sunset. We were all taking pictures remarking on the sky at night.\"\nThey were only there because they had been following the rules. Social distancing meant Ms Henry could not celebrate her birthday indoors. She arranged a small gathering in the open air. \nThere was food and drink, music and laughter, fairy lights and friends; and selfies that should have preserved memories of people doing their best to enjoy life during a strange summer of lockdown.\nThe sisters, thanks to the senseless actions of an insignificant teenager who thought he could do a deal with a demon, are at risk of being remembered as murder victims, forever associated with something that was done to them rather than by them, something out of their control.\nBut Bibaa Henry was a strong woman. She was a mother, a daughter, a sister, a friend and a colleague. \nShe fought for what was right; she was a fierce exponent for the more vulnerable members of society. \nShe was \"a force of nature\" who lived in Brent in north-west London, an \"exceptional\" senior social worker at Buckinghamshire Council, \"just fantastic to be around\", had \"the biggest personality in the room\" and was a fervent advocate in safeguarding at-risk children and families.\nA \"lovely woman who was both serious and fun\", her luminous love for life drew people to her \"like a beacon in the darkness\".\nBefore qualifying in social work Ms Henry had a job driving disabled children to their activities. Baby daughter beside her, she would get her young passengers singing and enjoying the journey.\nShe was proud of her father, Herman Henry, the ABA featherweight champion of 1982 who set up his own building contracting company. \nShe was proud of her mother Mina, who gave up office work to train as a teacher and later joined the priesthood, becoming the Church of England's first black female archdeacon.\nShe was barely 5ft tall yet \"had the heart of a lion\" and \"a smile that would put the Blackpool Illuminations to shame\".\nNicole Smallman, 19 years younger than her elder sister, shared many of the same interests, especially in the arts. \nLaid-back and approachable, Ms Smallman was a photographer, a University of Westminster graduate and \"a joy to be around\".\nIn comparison to Ms Henry's blinding incandescence Ms Smallman's personality was more diffuse; mellow and all-encompassing. \nLong-time family friend Ieuan Ledger said: \"You hear about people 'lighting up a room' when they walk in. But that description is almost too harsh for Nikki. \n\"When she walked into a room she was like a nightlight. It was subtle, protective, warm.\" \nA talented artist, she was passionate about her work in documentary-making and theatre. She was also a singer and an actor with a speaking voice so \"silky smooth\" her teacher said she should do radio or TV presenting.\nShe \"saw beauty in everything\", was friendly, enthusiastic and much-loved. Calm and positive, she was a strong supporter of humanitarian and environmental causes.\nHer parents, Mina and Christopher, would laughingly agree the baby of the family \"was a child of the '60s\", and beautiful both inside and out.\nMr Ledger's godmother is Mina Smallman. His mother, who went to university with Mrs Smallman, is Nicole's godmother. Mr Ledger and Ms Smallman called themselves \"godsiblings\".  \n\"We were very close as children - as we became adults it was harder and harder to be as involved but she was still very much in my heart. I had a stuffed tiger she gave me, it was on my shelf well into my 20s.\n\"It really didn't sink in until a couple of months later when something snapped inside me and I realised that I was never going to see Bibaa or Nikki again. That was the hardest part.\n\"I have moments of blinding realisation. It felt like every bit of news got progressively more traumatic. Police taking selfies.\" (Two officers have been charged with misconduct in public office).\nHe added: \"Every single moment there was something new that made it even worse than it was.\"\nWhen Mr Ledger heard of the killer's efforts to secure a big lottery win, \"there was a moment of sheer disbelief. To find out it was to do with just trying to win the lottery... it was beyond tragic. \n\"It's insulting. If it wasn't bad enough already, such a banal reason - it was insulting and offensive.\"\nMrs Smallman, who said the greatest fear of any parent is that they will outlive their children, described herself as \"broken beyond words\".\n\"The grief we feel is palpable, our beautiful and talented daughters gone.\" \nShe later said: \"I think the notion of 'all people matter' is absolutely right, but it's not true. Other people have more kudos in this world than people of colour.\n\"That's what gives me purpose - if their lives make a change in the way women are viewed, and black women in particular. \n\"In the pecking order of things we are the lowest on the ladder.\"\nThe final images Mrs Smallman's daughters captured on their phones are both haunting and poignant.\nWhirling lights and grinning, spinning sisters laughing at each other; stars wheeling overhead as they dance, and the soft apricot glow of London's night sky throwing the trees into gentle silhouette. \nBut a teenager lurking just out of shot had also planned his evening - one of spilled blood, horrific violence and pointless sacrifice.\nThe very last photograph was taken by the sisters at 01:13. It shows the two women looking distracted and glancing to their left. \nThen their world ended."

      "text": "On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget.\nHe'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on.\nEach year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. \nIt outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services.\nThe Budget speech will be delivered on Wednesday 27 October.\nIt usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. \nThis year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: \nAfter the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing.\nThe Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid.\nA number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise in the minimum wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50 and an end to the public sector pay freeze.\nThe chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions:\nBudget 2021: What has already been announced?\nMeasures such as the furlough scheme - which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic.\nTo close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. \nIn the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed \u00a3320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. \nEconomists expect it to borrow around \u00a3180bn more this year, another enormous sum. \nDuring his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead.\nThe government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises.\nOne major tax rise was announced in September - the \u00a312bn Health and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT.\nThere has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier.\nAt the same time, the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills.\nHe is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. \nOverall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England.\nThe government has already said that the NHS in England will receive an extra \u00a35.9bn to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans.\nBut other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport, are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgets next year. \nThey have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful.\nSome parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. \nOthers, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions.\nScotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government will publish its Budget on 9 December.\nIf the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rule called the Barnett formula. \nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "Our Planet Now,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "A key pledge ahead of an upcoming climate change conference has still not been met and the money is not sure to be available before 2023.\nThe UK government has set out a new financing plan ahead of next week's climate change conference - COP26.\nIt talks of how developed countries hope to deliver $100bn a year in climate finance to developing countries. \nThe original aim was for that target to be reached by 2020.\nBut the financing plan said the target looked \"unlikely\" to be met but that it was \"confident\" the target would be hit by 2023.\nSome environmentalists say the new plan is too little, too late. \nCOP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma said: \"This plan recognises progress, based on strong new climate finance commitments. There is still further to go, but this delivery plan, alongside the robust methodological report from the OECD, provides clarity, transparency and accountability. \n\"It is a step towards rebuilding trust and gives developing countries more assurance of predictable support.\"\nClimate finance plays a critical role in helping developing countries tackle climate change and adapt to its impacts. \nIn 2009, developed countries agreed to mobilise $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020, and in 2015 agreed to extend this goal through to 2025.\nHowever, the UK COP26 Presidency now says the $100bn goal is likely to fall short in 2021 and 2022 - though is confident it will be met in 2023.\nMohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives, said: \"To provide confidence and momentum going into COP26, the $100bn climate finance goal must be met immediately, not in 2023. \n\"The financing announcement is extremely disappointing in that it asks us as developing countries to wait even longer for the delivery of a promise that was first made more than a decade ago. I know the UK presidency has worked very hard for this, and I appreciate their efforts, but this is not sufficient to lay the groundwork for a successful outcome at COP26. \n\"Unless more progress is made in the next fortnight, we will all be in trouble. \"\nThe finance delivery plan was produced by Jonathan Wilkinson and Jochen Flasbarth, environment ministers from Canada and Germany, respectively, at the request of Mr Sharma.\nCanadian finance minister Jonathan Wilkinson was keen to stress that in his view the plan would achieve the $100bn goal per year over the 2020-2025 period.\n\"We have much greater confidence that the goal that was agreed upon will in fact, be achieved, and in fact, it will be overachieved beyond 2023 so I think that's very good news. \n\"And I think that, perhaps through this process, we've moved the bar in terms of how we can provide greater confidence and transparency going forward.\"\nOn Monday, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said it was \"touch and go\" whether the upcoming COP26 global climate conference will secure the agreements needed to help tackle climate change.\n\"It is going to be very, very tough this summit. I am very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it is touch and go, it is very, very difficult, but I think it can be done,\" he said.\nIn the meantime, the climate crisis continues to deepen: the World Meteorological Organization has said the build-up of warming gases in the atmosphere rose to record levels in 2020 despite the pandemic.\nThe amounts - or concentrations - of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide rose by more than the annual average in the past 10 years.\n\"Developing countries have been rightfully disappointed that so far developed countries have not delivered on the $100bn pledge that was already given in 2009,\" said the one of the plan's authors, Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's secretary of state for the environment.\n\"Hence, I am glad that the process I was honoured to lead jointly with minister Jonathan Wilkinson has created momentum to help complying with the finance commitment overall in the period up to 2025. We are very aware that also after today's release of the Delivery Plan, a lot of work remains.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said he believes people will be able to celebrate Christmas as normal this year, after 2020's festivities were cancelled for millions due to Covid restrictions. While he said the virus is \"unpredictable\" and there is always a risk of a more dangerous variant emerging, he said he thinks \"we'll have a normal Christmas\". With the latest figures showing one in 55 people in England is infected, Javid urged people to keep playing their part but said it was not necessary yet to implement the Plan B rules. Those would include face masks being made mandatory again in certain places, the introduction of Covid passports and advice being issued to work from home. The health secretary also said he was \"minded\" to make vaccination compulsory for NHS staff.\nStaff at nightclubs and other venues refused entry to people without proof of vaccination status 550 times on the launch weekend of Scotland's vaccine passports. Some staff were abused said the Scottish Hospitality Group, as it branded the weekend an \"unmitigated disaster\". Some venues closed early and footfall was down by 40%. But the Scottish government has said it is a proportionate health measure that will encourage vaccination and prevent venues having to close during a \"potentially very difficult winter\".\nA UK study based on records of 32 million patients has shown that people are more likely to get a rare neurological condition known as Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) if they are infected with coronavirus rather than being vaccinated. GBS, which is associated with some other infections and linked to some vaccines, causes inflammation of the nerves and can lead to numbness, weakness and pain - starting in the limbs and potentially spreading to the chest and face. It's treatable and most people recover, but it can be life-threatening. There were 38 additional GBS cases for every 10 million adults taking the AstraZeneca vaccine, but 145 per 10 million among those infected. \nAs Wales' infection rate reached a record high of 717 cases per 100,000 people - the highest rate in the UK - the nation's chief medical officer warned that some people are ignoring face mask laws and not observing social distancing. Dr Frank Atherton said most people were behaving cautiously but \"there is a sense in other places that it is all over\". He said he had seen people crowding into taxis on nights out without face masks and leisure centres overcrowded, offering opportunities for the virus to spread. \"More draconian measures\" may be needed if people did not work to reduce infection rates, he said.\nThe deadline to apply for a free \u00a3100 prepaid card to spend in Northern Ireland's high streets expires at midnight - with 1.4 million people having already already requested one. The \u00a3145m Spend Local scheme was launched last month to try and boost businesses hit hard by the pandemic. It offers residents a prepaid debit card which can be used it any shop that takes card payments in Northern Ireland. With 500,000 already sent out, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said he expects the remaining 900,000 will be issued this week, giving shoppers four weeks to make their purchases before the expiry date.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nChildren aged 12 to 15 can now book vaccinations if they have not received the jab in school.

      "tags": "Drugs trade,United States,Colombia",
      "text": "Colombia has announced that the country's most wanted drug trafficker will be extradited to the US after he was captured in a raid.\nDairo Antonio \u00dasuga, known as Otoniel, was seized after a joint army, air force and police operation on Saturday.\nHe led the country's largest criminal gang and has been on the US Drug Enforcement Agency's most wanted list for years.\nUS officials had placed a $5m (\u00a33.6m) bounty on his head.\nThey accused him of importing at least 73 metric tonnes of cocaine into the country between 2003 and 2014. \nColombia's Defence Minister Diego Molano told El Tiempo newspaper that the next step for officials was to comply with the US extradition order. \nAuthorities have now taken Otoniel to a military base in the capital Bogot\u00e1 ahead of his extradition, according to newspaper El Nuevo Siglo.\nBeing locked up in a jail thousands of miles from their home country, in a place where they have few connections and no means to intimidate guards or prison directors is a fate many Colombian drug traffickers fear. \nThe late drug lord Pablo Escobar said that he would prefer \"lying in a grave in Colombia than being locked up in a cell in the US\".\nExcept for a six-year period between 1991 and 1997, when Colombia's constitution banned extraditions of Colombian citizens, a number of top level traffickers facing indictments in the US have been sent to stand trial there. \nAmong them are the co-founder of the Medell\u00edn cartel, Carlos Lehder, drug lord Daniel \"The Madman\" Barrera and paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso.\nOtoniel, who was indicted in the the US in 2009, will faces a number of charges, including sending shipments of cocaine to the US, killing police officers and recruiting children.\nOtoniel was captured in his rural hideout in Antioquia province in north-western Colombia, close to the border with Panama. \nThe operation involved 500 soldiers supported by 22 helicopters. One police officer was killed. \nOtoniel had used a network of rural safe houses to move around and evade the authorities, and did not use a phone, instead relying on couriers for communication.\nIn the past, police have found special orthopaedic mattresses for Otoniel in these sparse homes, as he suffered back pain from a herniated disc.\nPolice chief Jorge Vargas has said the drug lord was fearful of capture, \"never approaching inhabited areas\". \nBut El Tiempo reported that authorities managed to pinpoint the location where he was eventually captured two weeks ago.\nChief Vargas said his movements were traced by more than 50 signal intelligence experts using satellite imagery. US and UK agencies were involved in the search.\nMr Duque described the operation as \"the biggest penetration of the jungle ever seen in the military history of our country\".\nColombia's armed forces later released a photo showing its soldiers guarding Otoniel, who was in handcuffs and wearing rubber boots.\nThere have been several huge operations involving thousands of officers to capture the 50-year-old in recent years.\nThere's no doubt this is seen as a coup by Colombian authorities - they've been trying to capture Otoniel for several years now. The Gulf Cartel is a formidable and violent organisation with a great deal of power. \nAnd the comparisons with Pablo Escobar are understandable. Otoniel is a household name and has been hugely powerful, especially in the north west of the country. \n\"In South America, there is no larger cocaine trafficker,\" says Toby Muse, author of Kilo: Inside the Cocaine Cartels. \"We are living in the golden age of cocaine, we are producing more cocaine than ever - that's a fact.\"\nBut the parallels perhaps stop there - Otoniel is not as well-known outside of Colombia. And speak to people who lived in the country at the peak of Pablo Escobar's power, many feel they were more frightening times. \nThe question is, will Otoniel's capture impact the trade of the illicit drug? It's hard to know now. We'll have to see what happens in the coming months but most experts seem to think that while demand for cocaine remains strong, it's likely there will be new \"capos\" rising to the top to replace him.\nBorn in Antioquia in the early 1970s, Otoniel jumped between several guerrilla and paramilitary groups - including the Farc (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), the major Marxist-Leninist rebel group, and the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), a far-right paramilitary and drug trafficking gang.\nWhen the AUC dissolved in 2005, he began working for the drug lord Daniel Rend\u00f3n Herrera, known as Don Mario - head of the Urabe\u00f1os, which later became known as the Gulf Clan.\nOtoniel then took charge of the group after its previous leader - his brother - was killed by police in a raid on a New Year's Eve party almost 10 years ago.\nColombia's security forces labelled the gang as the country's most powerful criminal organisation, while authorities in the US describe it as \"heavily armed [and] extremely violent\".\nThe gang, which operates in many provinces and has extensive international connections, is engaged in drug and people smuggling, illegal gold mining and extortion.\nIt is believed to have about 1,800 armed members, who are mainly recruited from far-right paramilitary groups. Members have been arrested in Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Peru and Spain.\nThe gang controls many of the routes used to smuggle drugs from Colombia to the US, and as far away as Russia.\nThe Colombian government, however, believes it has decimated its numbers in recent years, forcing many leading members to hide in remote regions in the jungle."

      "tags": "Tax,NHS",
      "text": "Boris Johnson chose to visit a hospital he knows only too well to highlight the new funding package for the NHS in England.\nHe spent anxious days in intensive care at St Thomas' Hospital in central London in April 2020, seriously ill with Covid.\nThe pandemic continues to cast a long shadow over the NHS and that's because of uncertainty over how case numbers and hospital admissions will develop next year. \nHospitals have to maintain infection control measures and contingency plans to deal with any further surge in patient numbers. \nAnd that has a bearing on how much non-urgent work they can do.  \nSo that makes it hard to tell how much money will be needed to make inroads on the backlog of operations cancelled at the height of the pandemic.\nBreaking down the figures shows that NHS England is getting an extra \u00a36.6bn in the next financial year for day-to-day services, which falls to \u00a33.6bn the following year and then is set at \u00a35.6bn in the next 12 months. This is on top of the five-year settlement announced in 2018 which increased NHS funding by \u00a320.5bn a year in real terms. \nThe new funding is intended to cover not only costs of reducing waiting lists but also additional spending linked to Covid. \nThere seems to be an underlying assumption that the overall burden on the NHS will be lighter after next year with less virus-related pressure. \nMr Johnson was visiting a training centre at St Thomas' and there were no patients being cared for so masks were not required when we sat down for an interview.  \nHe talked of the nine million extra treatments which, in his view, the NHS could do as a result of the higher funding.  \nBut there was no attempt to sugar the pill as he added that scale of the challenge could not be underestimated. \nI pressed him on whether the number waiting more than a year for a routine operation, at more than 300,000, would come down significantly following the new investment. \nHe would not be drawn on a target either on that measure or the waiting list number. \nHe acknowledged that \"things may well get more difficult before they get better\".\nJudging by the prime minister's responses there is no clear view in Downing Street what will happen to waiting lists. \nHe was anxious not to give a hostage to fortune by making predictions on numbers of the direction of travel.  \nWhitehall officials will have drawn up a range of scenarios with widely varying outcomes. \nThe documents accompanying the health and care announcement refer to a 30% increase in hospital activity from pre-pandemic levels, but note that this is an aim rather than a pledge.  \nMr Johnson seems to be putting his faith in social care investment taking the pressure off hospitals by getting older and frail patients discharged more swiftly. \nBut a rapid improvement in outcomes seems highly unlikely with the new social care funding taking time to kick in.\nRepresentatives of health service organisations are clear that what has now been promised to the NHS frontline is not sufficient to meet the demands on the service. \nThey had called for \u00a310bn more in the next financial year for day-to-day running costs in England. \nMatthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: \"The NHS is grateful for this extra investment and it will help reduce the backlog - the problem is that its only enough to address that backlog and if the costs of Covid continue it won't be enough.\"\nWorkforce is another longer term issue which isn't fully addressed in the new policy statement. \nMany staff are exhausted and, while willing to work extra hours to get through more operations and procedures, may struggle to keep up the increased workload for a sustained period. \nVacancies and rota gaps can't be resolved overnight as training new staff takes several years. \nAs the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted the NHS has historically needed more money than original plans and allocations with patient demand growing more rapidly than expected. \nIt is unlikely this time that there will be a departure from precedent."

      "text": "\"Genuine courage\" is needed to tackle climate change in Wales, which produces a fifth of the UK's industrial emissions, an economist has said.\nThousands of Welsh jobs rely on Tata's steelworks in Port Talbot and RWE's gas power station in Pembrokeshire, the UK's top two emitters.\nProf Calvin Jones said it was \"good news\" that a big difference can be made from a small number of industries.\nBut he said people should accept not every industry will survive.\nThe Cardiff University academic said: \"As a teenager in the valleys, we were absolutely clear that it was unconscionable that pits should close.\n\"The inability to have a plan B is writ large across the shuttered shops of Maerdy, and what I don't want is for the same thing to happen in Neyland, or Port Talbot, or Broughton.\"\nThe Welsh government said net-zero targets may be different for each organisation, and it is working with each to help them reach their goals.\nWales is among several nations who have pledged net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nThe UK will host the UN climate change conference, COP26, in Glasgow at the end of this month.\nRWE has committed to making its Pembrokeshire operation carbon neutral by 2040, replacing natural gas burning with offshore wind and schemes to store energy when there is no wind.\nBut environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth Cymru said the climate emergency meant the plan for Welsh industry was \"decades too late\" to prevent catastrophic warming. \nBBC Wales analysis of official emissions data from 2019 shows major Welsh industries pumped out the equivalent of more than 23.5 million tonnes of climate-warming gases, 93% of which came from just 25 sites. \nThe Welsh economy is more reliant on carbon-intensive industries than the other home nations. With just 4.73% of the UK population, companies in Wales produced 18.8% of all UK carbon emissions from major industries. \nRWE's gas-fired power station in Pembroke Dock, Valero's nearby oil refinery and the South Hook LNG terminal in Milford Haven produce a combined total of 7.9 million tonnes of climate-warming gases annually - a third of all carbon emissions from major industries in Wales. \nThe UK's highest-emitting power station at Pembroke Dock pumped out more than 4.7 million tonnes of climate-warming gases in 2019.\nOperator RWE said it is also one of the most efficient gas-powered machines in Europe and is the \"best option\" if the UK is forced to burn fossil fuels to keep the lights on.\nBut the plant manager, Richard Little, said every year the plant shut down for longer periods as more wind power came online.\nHe said the same trend happened right up to the closure of RWE's coal-fired power station at Aberthaw in 2019.\nRWE said it had \"huge ambitions\" to be a part of the UK's push to build 40 gigawatts of floating offshore wind capacity, but said it was also looking into alternative measures such as battery storage, for periods of low wind.\nMr Little said: \"RWE now directs more than 90% of its capital investment into renewables, hydrogen and battery storage.\n\"Our strategy is to build as fast as we can while we maintain plants such as Pembroke here in support of that bridge to renewable future.\"\nBleddyn Lake, of Friends of the Earth Cymru, has called on industry to match the public sector's goal to be net-zero by 2030 and said \"they need to up their game\".\n\"Science tells us that we absolutely need to act decisively by 2030, so the time frames they are looking at are way too far into the future.\"\nMr Little said shortening the timescale was technically feasible, \"but the sheer scale of what we need to build, 40 gigawatts, is like building the entire energy infrastructure of the UK again in floating wind in the next nine years\".\nHe said stumbling blocks remained, including over planning permissions for offshore wind and a deal with the UK government on how it can get a return on the billions of pounds of investment needed.\n\"We are working closely with the UK government to try and generate a framework that can allow businesses such as ours to invest at the fastest possible rate,\" Mr Little added.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said carbon capture and storage technology, currently under development, may be more applicable to the small number of large, high-emitting sites in Wales.\n\"Due to economies of scale, large firms may generally be able to adopt new low-carbon technologies and new low-carbon processes quicker and at lower cost,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"There may also be challenges if low-carbon technologies take longer to be developed and rolled out in these key, high-emitting industries.\"\nProf Jones said Welsh ministers had limited influence on \"the big players in the carbon economy\" because they all had headquarters outside Wales.\n\"We could decide to twist our industrial policy to a certain direction to make it supportive of a transformation in these high-carbon industries,\" he added.\n\"And they may still close because global conditions might mean that investment in Wales is just simply irrational.\""

      "tags": "Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud,Mohammed bin Salman,Saudi Arabia,Canada,Killing of Jamal Khashoggi",
      "text": "Saudi Arabia's crown prince suggested using a \"poison ring\" to kill the late King Abdullah, a former top Saudi intelligence official has alleged.\nIn an interview with CBS, Saad al-Jabri said Mohammed bin Salman told his cousin in 2014 that he wanted to do so to clear the throne for his father.\nThere were tensions within the ruling family at the time over the succession.\nThe Saudi government has called Mr Jabri a discredited former official with a long history of fabrication.\nIn his interview with CBS's 60 Minutes programme Mr Jabri warned that Crown Prince Mohammed - Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler and the son of King Salman - was a \"psychopath, killer, in the Middle East with infinite resources, who poses threat to his people, to the Americans and to the planet\".\nHe alleged that at a 2014 meeting the prince suggested to his cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the then interior minister, that he could arrange the killing of King Abdullah.\n\"He told him: 'I want to assassinate King Abdullah. I get a poison ring from Russia. It's enough for me just to shake hand with him and he will be done,'\" Mr Jabri said. \n\"Whether he's just bragging... he said that and we took it seriously.\"\nHe said the matter was settled privately within the royal court. But he added that the meeting was secretly filmed and that he knew where two copies of the video recording were. \nAbdullah died at the age of 90 in 2015 and was succeeded by his half-brother Salman, Mohammed bin Salman's father, who named Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince. \nIn 2017, Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced as heir to the throne by Mohammed bin Salman. He also lost his role as interior minister and was reportedly placed under house arrest before being detained last year on unspecified charges. \nMr Jabri fled to Canada after Mohammed bin Nayef was ousted.\nHe said in the interview that he was warned by a friend in a Middle Eastern intelligence service that Mohammed bin Salman was sending a hit team to kill him in October 2018, just days after Saudi agents murdered the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey.\nHe alleged that a six-person team landed at an airport in Ottawa but were deported after customs found they were carrying \"suspicious equipment for DNA analysis\".\nLast year, Mr Jabri accused the crown prince of attempted murder in a civil suit filed in a US federal court. \nThe prince rejected the allegations. He has also denied any involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, although US intelligence agencies assessed that he approved the operation.\nThe BBC has contacted the Saudi government for comment on the allegations.\nIn a statement sent to CBS, the Saudi embassy in Washington labelled Mr Jabri as \"a discredited former government official with a long history of fabricating and creating distractions to hide the financial crimes he committed, which amount to billions of dollars, to furnish a lavish life-style for himself and his family\".\nMr Jabri is being sued for corruption by various Saudi entities and a Canadian judge has frozen his assets saying there is \"overwhelming evidence of fraud\". \nHe denies stealing any government money, saying his former employers rewarded him generously.\nIn March 2020, Saudi authorities detained Mr Jabri's son Omar and daughter Sarah in what human rights groups said was an apparent effort to coerce him to return to Saudi Arabia. \nLast November, two months after their father sued the crown prince, the siblings were sentenced to nine and six-and-a-half years in prison respectively by a Saudi court after being convicted of money laundering and \"attempting to escape\" the country. They denied the charges.\nAn appeals court upheld their sentences in a secret hearing at which they were not present."

      "tags": "Department of Health & Social Care,Social care,Home care",
      "text": "Many councils are not paying homecare companies a high enough hourly rate to cover basic costs like travel time between clients, says a report. \nIt means, despite losing staff faster than they can be replaced, companies are unable to raise wages, says the Homecare Association.  \nLow wages and feeling undervalued are key factors leading care staff to quit, says the report.  \nCouncils say they do not have enough money to pay companies more. \nThe Homecare Association, which represents some 2,340 care providers, calculates the true minimum cost of providing an hour of homecare in the UK is \u00a321.43. \nThis covers the minimum wage, travel time, pensions, holidays, training, PPE, office staff and 60p for profit or reinvestment in services. \nPrivate clients who hire care direct from providers pay an average \u00a324.94 for an hour of homecare, according to separate analysis by software company The Access Group.\nBut private clients are a minority, with the bulk of homecare (about 70%) funded by the state, says the Homecare Association. \nFreedom of Information data collected for the Association shows the average paid by councils in Great Britain and health boards in Northern Ireland is \u00a318.45.\nThe report found that areas with some of the highest levels of deprivation also had the lowest average fee rates for homecare.\nThe Homecare Association says with some local authorities still buying homecare by the minute, and little or no funding for better pay, it makes it very difficult to compete with other sectors for staff. \nRichard Walker, chief executive of Optimo Care Group in South Yorkshire, has tried to improve pay and conditions for staff, but says his efforts are limited by local authority funding levels. \n\"We're simply not competing... so I think people go elsewhere...\n\"It feels like we're in a harder position now than we've ever been before.\" \nRichard estimates that, overall, Optimo's costs outstrip council funding by about 25%, although this varies according to local authority.\n\"We're miles away at the moment in terms of the rates that have been paid.\" \nThe staff shortage means the company is having to turn away referrals - and he finds not being able to give people the help they require when they need it \"really tough... quite demotivating\".\nAmong his staff is Denise Wickson, a home carer for 16 years. \nFor Denise, the work brings \"great reward, great satisfaction\".\n\"I love the job,\" she says. \nBut sometimes she can be up at 05:00 and not finish until 23:00. \n\"You never get to switch off, you're always worried, 'Is it covered?'. You get called and they say you're needed to go out. I never say no.\" \nDenise says the money is not \"level with the job you do out there\", and some people \"just go elsewhere where it's more money and it's not unsociable hours\". \nThe Homecare Association says lack of support in the community can lead to: \n\"It makes little sense to neglect people at home in the community, wait until they reach crisis point, then admit them to the most expensive setting of care in an acute hospital,\" says the report. \nThe Association wants central government to \"invest properly\" in homecare, raising pay to \u00a311.20 per hour, at a cost of \u00a31.6bn a year across the UK, plus:  \nThe Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) said: \"Councils may want to pay more for care, but their hands are tied, because they simply do not have the money to do so.\"\nAn ADASS spokesperson urged ministers to use Wednesday's Spending Review to invest in care and support at home to \"lift the pressure on family carers, ensure the viability of high quality home care providers, and properly reward the committed, courageous and compassionate people working in social care\".\nThe Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England, said: \"Councils work closely with care providers, and understand their concerns about paying a fair price for the cost of care. \n\"Such is the scale of funding pressures, this is proving harder to achieve and we urgently need new national funding to meet immediate pressures in the social care system.\"    \nThe government says a new \u00a3162.5m fund will help \"bolster\" the homecare workforce, while the social care levy, announced last month, includes \u00a35.4bn earmarked for social care over the next three years, with \u00a3500m to be spent on the workforce.\nBut the LGA questions whether the levy will raise enough money to fund crucial reforms, and wants to see a greater share of it go to front-line social care.

      "tags": "Online Safety Bill,Fake News,Instagram,Facebook",
      "text": "Whistleblower Frances Haugen has told MPs Facebook is \"unquestionably making hate worse\", as they consider what new rules to impose on big social networks.\nMs Haugen was talking to the Online Safety Bill committee in London.\nShe said Facebook safety teams were under-resourced, and \"Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety\".\nAnd she warned that Instagram was \"more dangerous than other forms of social media\".\nWhile other social networks were about performance, play, or an exchange of ideas, \"Instagram is about social comparison and about bodies... about people's lifestyles, and that's what ends up being worse for kids\", she told a joint committee of MPs and Lords.\nShe said Facebook's own research described one problem as \"an addict's narrative\" - where children are unhappy, can't control their use of the app, but feel like they cannot stop using it.\n\"I am deeply worried that it may not be possible to make Instagram safe for a 14-year-old, and I sincerely doubt that it is possible to make it safe for a 10-year-old,\" she said.\nThe committee is fine-tuning a proposed law that will place new duties on large social networks and subject them to checks by the media regulator Ofcom.\nAsked if the law was \"keeping Mark Zuckerberg awake at night\", Ms Haugen said she was \"incredibly proud of the UK for taking such a world-leading stance\".\n\"The UK has a tradition of leading policy in ways that are followed around the world.\n\"I can't imagine Mark isn't paying attention to what you're doing.\" \nMs Haugen also warned that Facebook was unable to police content in multiple languages around the world - something which should worry UK officials, she said.\n\"UK English is sufficiently different that I would be unsurprised if the safety systems that they developed primarily for American English were actually under-enforcing in the UK,\" she said.\nAnd she said that dangerous misinformation in other languages affects people in Britain.\n\"Those people are also living in the UK, and being fed misinformation that is dangerous, that radicalises people,\" she warned.\nMs Haugen also urged the committee to include paid-for advertising in its new rules, saying the current system was \"literally subsidising hate on these platforms\" because of their algorithmic ranking.\n\"It is substantially cheaper to run an angry hateful divisive ad than it is to run a compassionate, empathetic ad,\" she said.\nAnd she also urged MPs to require a breakdown of who is harmed by content, rather than an average figure - suggesting Facebook is \"very good at dancing with data\", but pushes people towards \"extreme content\".\n\"The median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience,\" she said.\n\"The real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,\" she said.\nShe warned that employees were unable to report internal concerns at Facebook - something she called a \"huge weak spot\".\n\"When I worked on counter-espionage, I saw things where I was concerned about national security, and I had no idea how to escalate those because I didn't have faith in my chain of command at that point,\" she told the committee.\nAnd she warned: \"We were told to accept under-resourcing.\"\nSimilar problems plague Facebook's Oversight Board, which can overturn the company's decisions on content, she said. She repeated her claim that Facebook has repeatedly lied to its own watchdog, and said this is a \"defining moment\" for the Oversight Board to \"step up\".\n\"I don't know what the purpose of the Oversight Board is,\" she said.\nIt comes as several news outlets published fresh stories based on the thousands of leaked documents Ms Haugen took with her when she left Facebook.\nFacebook has characterised previous reporting as misleading, and at one point referred to the leaked documents as \"stolen\".\n\"Contrary to what was discussed at the hearing, we've always had the commercial incentive to remove harmful content from our sites,\" a spokesperson said, after Ms Haugen finished giving evidence.\n\"People don't want to see it when they use our apps, and advertisers don't want their ads next to it. That's why we've invested $13bn (\u00a39.4bn) and hired 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on our apps. \"\nThe company said that over the last three quarters it has halved the amount of hate speech seen on Facebook, which it claims now accounts for only 0.05% of all content viewed.\n\"While we have rules against harmful content and publish regular transparency reports, we agree we need regulation for the whole industry so that businesses like ours aren't making these decisions on our own,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"The UK is one of the countries leading the way and we're pleased the Online Safety Bill is moving forward.\"\nAn avalanche of information emerged on Monday from leaked Facebook documents - and it was hard to keep up. \nAllegations include that the social media giant is aware of its role in inciting violence all around the world, or causing harm to its users from US and UK to India and Ethiopia. \nA common theme runs through each of the stories. They all suggest a tension between employees raising the alarm about their concerns and a corporate machine that does not appear to be using this to inform its policies. \nReporters and journalists have been highlighting many of these same concerns, especially for the past 18 months. I've investigated the human cost of online disinformation and abuse again and again and exposed the damage being done to real people offline using these sites. \nBut until these documents were released by Ms Haugen, it was very difficult to know how aware Facebook was of that damage.\nThese latest leaks reinforce the idea that it is conscious of it - although it refutes a number of the claims. \nAnd it means pressure is mounting on policymakers around the world to do something about it.

      "text": "Tata Steel says it needs a route map from the UK government before it decides how it will make steel in the future.  \nThere are fears the steel industry, as the biggest single emitter of CO2 in the UK, might not fit into a new greener economy and thousands of jobs could be lost. \nThat would damage communities in Port Talbot, Newport, Llanelli and Shotton.\nThe UK government said it was supporting the steel industry.\nTata Steel has already reduced its emissions and said it wants to go much further but has not yet worked out how.\nIt said the industry alone could not solve the emissions problem and there had to be a partnership with government.  \nA range of options are available to steelmakers, including using hydrogen, electric furnaces or carbon capture. \nTata Steel employs 6,600 people in Wales on wages that are, on average, 36% higher than the UK average.  \nThere has been concern about jobs and questions about the firm's future because of its impact on the environment. \nTata Steel's sustainability spokesman Martin Brunnock said: \"There's no point us saying we won't make steel in the UK because that doesn't solve your carbon problem.\n\"All we do then is import carbon through our borders in finished goods or coils of steel to be used in the UK.\"\nAt the Port Talbot steelworks, carbon dioxide emissions have already been reduced by recycling scrap steel back into the liquid steel.  \nTata said 20% of its scrap steel now goes back into the system and every 1% extra of scrap recycled reduces the plant's carbon emissions by 150,000 tonnes a year.  \nBut it needs to do more than that to reach its target.  \n\"We can't do this alone. How do you get an energy infrastructure, hydrogen infrastructure, how do you create that carbon capture technology, how does that all work?\" Mr Brunnock said. \nHe added \"revolutionary\" policies were needed and \"a route map would be really helpful\".  \nThere are concerns that changes to the way steel is made - to make it greener - could result in thousands of job losses . \nTata Steel employee Jaqueline Thomas said there had been a \"lack of empathy\" over the impact of changes to the economy on areas such as hers.\n\"I myself travel down from Tredegar in Blaenau Gwent and we lost Ebbw Vale steelworks in 2002 and we've seen how the economy has changed, how it's hit the area I live in,\" she said.\n\"Not just me but Redcar is the same and how the community has become deprived, lack of jobs - and what can we do? \n\"There's obviously a lack of empathy as well with the younger generation because they get very much disorientated about where their future lies and we've got to make sure that the steel industry survives for the young apprentices that also travel down here on a daily basis.\n\"I'd hate to see the steel industry shrink to a point where the community involvement is no longer there. There has always been a massive camaraderie amongst the communities... steel has always been at the heart of this community.\" \nIt is not about a future lack of demand. Tata Steel believes that the amount of steel used in the UK will increase by 10% by 2030 and many renewable energy projects and low carbon transport systems will rely on it.  \nAlready more than two-thirds of the steel it makes stays in the UK.  \nSteel made at the Port Talbot plant goes into car production, food packaging, construction and even used to make walls that can generate electricity.  \nMany of its customers want steel that is made in such a way that it has less impact on the environment.    \nIt is expected that will increase as companies will have to publish the impact of their supply chain on emission levels.  \nThe industry is already struggling with energy prices rising steeply and competition from overseas.  \nThe UK government's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said: \"We are already working closely with Britain's steel sector to support its transition to a low carbon future. \n\"We have previously announced a \u00a3250m clean steel fund to support the industry to reduce carbon emissions, and our industrial decarbonisation strategy sets out how it can be done in a way that prevents industrial activity from being outsourced overseas and supports competitiveness, jobs and clean growth.\""

      "text": "A man from North Carolina who vanished in the 1970s has been identified as one of dozens of victims murdered by serial killer John Wayne Gacy. \nFrancis Wayne Alexander's remains were among those found in the crawl space of Gacy's Chicago-area home in 1978. \nCook County Sheriff Tom Dart ordered eight unidentified victims' bodies to be exhumed in 2011 in an effort to identify them through DNA testing.\nAlexander is the third Gacy victim to be identified in the last decade. \nHe would have been 21 or 22 when Gacy killed him between 1976 and 1977, Mr Dart's office said.\nGacy was convicted of killing 33 young men between 1972 and 1978 and burying them on his property. He was executed in 1994. \nHe often lured young men to his home for sex by pretending to be a police officer or promising them construction work. \nIn reopening the investigation, Sheriff Dart asked families of youngsters who had vanished between 1970 and Gacy's 1978 arrest to submit saliva samples to compare DNA with the eight victims who were buried without being identified. \nMonths later, William George Bundy, a 19-year-old construction worker, was identified as a Gacy victim.\nIn 2017, James Byron Haakenson - a missing teenager from Minnesota - was named as another victim.\nInvestigators matched DNA samples from Mr Alexander's mother and half-brother to his remains. \nAlexander's sister, Carolyn Sanders, thanked the sheriff's office for giving the family \"closure\".\n\"It is hard, even 45 years later, to know the fate of our beloved Wayne. He was killed at the hands of a vile and evil man,\" Ms Sanders said. \n\"We can now lay to rest what happened and move forward by honouring Wayne.\"\nAuthorities say they are unsure how Mr Alexander crossed paths with Gacy, one of America's most infamous serial killers.\nHe had moved to Chicago, where he was married for around three months before divorcing in 1975.\nIn January 1976, he received a traffic ticket in Chicago. After this, officers found no record of him being alive.\nMr Alexander \"lived in an area that was frequented by Gacy and where other identified victims had previously lived\", the sheriff's office said.\nPolice say their efforts to identify the other remains are ongoing."

      "tags": "Our Planet Now,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "A key pledge ahead of an upcoming climate change conference has still not been met and the money is not sure to be available before 2023.\nThe UK government has set out a new financing plan ahead of next week's climate change conference - COP26.\nIt talks of how developed countries hope to deliver $100bn a year in climate finance to developing countries. \nThe original aim was for that target to be reached by 2020.\nBut the financing plan said the target looked \"unlikely\" to be met but that it was \"confident\" the target would be hit by 2023.\nSome environmentalists say the new plan is too little, too late. \nCOP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma said: \"This plan recognises progress, based on strong new climate finance commitments. There is still further to go, but this delivery plan, alongside the robust methodological report from the OECD, provides clarity, transparency and accountability. \n\"It is a step towards rebuilding trust and gives developing countries more assurance of predictable support.\"\nClimate finance plays a critical role in helping developing countries tackle climate change and adapt to its impacts. \nIn 2009, developed countries agreed to mobilise $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020, and in 2015 agreed to extend this goal through to 2025.\nHowever, the UK COP26 Presidency now says the $100bn goal is likely to fall short in 2021 and 2022 - though is confident it will be met in 2023.\nMohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives, said: \"To provide confidence and momentum going into COP26, the $100bn climate finance goal must be met immediately, not in 2023. \n\"The financing announcement is extremely disappointing in that it asks us as developing countries to wait even longer for the delivery of a promise that was first made more than a decade ago. I know the UK presidency has worked very hard for this, and I appreciate their efforts, but this is not sufficient to lay the groundwork for a successful outcome at COP26. \n\"Unless more progress is made in the next fortnight, we will all be in trouble. \"\nThe finance delivery plan was produced by Jonathan Wilkinson and Jochen Flasbarth, environment ministers from Canada and Germany, respectively, at the request of Mr Sharma.\nCanadian finance minister Jonathan Wilkinson was keen to stress that in his view the plan would achieve the $100bn goal per year over the 2020-2025 period.\n\"We have much greater confidence that the goal that was agreed upon will in fact, be achieved, and in fact, it will be overachieved beyond 2023 so I think that's very good news. \n\"And I think that, perhaps through this process, we've moved the bar in terms of how we can provide greater confidence and transparency going forward.\"\nOn Monday, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said it was \"touch and go\" whether the upcoming COP26 global climate conference will secure the agreements needed to help tackle climate change.\n\"It is going to be very, very tough this summit. I am very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it is touch and go, it is very, very difficult, but I think it can be done,\" he said.\nIn the meantime, the climate crisis continues to deepen: the World Meteorological Organization has said the build-up of warming gases in the atmosphere rose to record levels in 2020 despite the pandemic.\nThe amounts - or concentrations - of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide rose by more than the annual average in the past 10 years.\n\"Developing countries have been rightfully disappointed that so far developed countries have not delivered on the $100bn pledge that was already given in 2009,\" said the one of the plan's authors, Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's secretary of state for the environment.\n\"Hence, I am glad that the process I was honoured to lead jointly with minister Jonathan Wilkinson has created momentum to help complying with the finance commitment overall in the period up to 2025. We are very aware that also after today's release of the Delivery Plan, a lot of work remains.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

Any vaccines approved by US health regulators will be accepted. \nUnvaccinated travellers, including Americans, will have to show a negative Covid test taken within one day of departure. \nChildren under the age of 18 will be exempt from the vaccination requirement but must still provide a negative test taken within three days of travel. \nThe new restrictions take effect on 8 November."

It's just the start of my journey but I'm going to give it everything,\" she said.\nThe former Big Brother star missed both her radio shows this weekend.\nThe radio DJ, from Southport, Merseyside, revealed her diagnosis in an Instagram post, saying she had sought medical advice after struggling with her digestion \"for a while\".\nShe wrote: \"It's all happened so quickly and I'm so sorry to post something like this on here but I hope it helps anyone who might be worrying, or suffering in silence. \n\"As I've learned over the last few weeks, there's no 'normal' with cancer. Sadly it can affect anyone, at any age, anytime. It doesn't discriminate. Early detection can save your life.\"\nShe added: \"I'm going to have surgery [on Monday] to remove the tumour and then see if I need anymore treatment or if the cancer has spread. \nIn her post, she finished by saying: \"The hardest thing wasn't even finding out I had cancer, it was telling my family. It broke my heart.\n\"If you know any of them please look after them for me until I can see them again. Especially my Katie (her girlfriend). I worry about her being on her own while I'm away.\"\nHer girlfriend, Kate Holderness, also wrote an emotional post on Sunday evening, calling Roberts \"my hero, my world, my love\".\nShe explained that she couldn't go with Roberts to the hospital or be there when she wakes up after her operation. \"It's the most horrible feeling desperately wanting her to get in that hospital ASAP but desperately not wanting to be without her.\"\nShe said it had been hard to get her head around how \"unfair\" the diagnosis was as Roberts did \"all the things they say help you prevent cancer\" and didn't do the things that were supposed to put you at higher risk.\n\"But I now understand it can happen to anyone. Cancer's never fair is it?\"\nA Radio 1 statement said: \"Our love and support is with Adele, Kate and their families at this very difficult time.\n\"Everyone at Radio 1, along with millions of listeners, wishes her a speedy recovery and we look forward to welcoming Adele back on air soon.\"\nSinger Jessie Ware and actress Suranne Jones were among those to send their support to Roberts on Instagram, along with some of her BBC colleagues.\nRadio presenter Scott Mills wrote: \"We all love you Adele. It's amazing you posted this. You're awesome and you've got this.\"\nRadio 2 broadcaster Sara Cox said Roberts was \"brilliant and brave to share this to help people\", adding that she was sending her \"a thousand gentle hugs\".\nRoberts rose to fame after appearing on the third series of Channel 4's Big Brother series in 2002. Contestants that year included ITV's This Morning presenter Alison Hammond, and Jade Goody, who died in 2009 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer. \nShe joined the BBC in 2012 as part of the Radio 1Xtra team, before moving to Radio 1 in 2015 to host the Early Breakfast Show. She took over the Weekend Breakfast programme earlier this year. \nShe also appeared on ITV's I'm a Celebrity in 2019, and was the first person in that series to be eliminated from the jungle.\nMost people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer, but the NHS advice is to see your GP if you have one or more of the symptoms and they have persisted for more than four weeks.\nAnd if you, or someone you know, have been affected by cancer, information and support is available on the BBC's Action Line page.\nSource: NHS UK"

      "text": "The Met Police has apologised to the family of two murdered sisters for failings in the way it responded when they were reported missing.\nDanyal Hussein, 19, killed Bibaa Henry, 46, and Nicole Smallman, 27, at Fryent Country Park in Wembley, north-west London, on 6 June 2020.\nA missing persons log was incorrectly closed and inquiries were not progressed, an investigation has found.\nThe sisters' mother said the apology was 10 months too late.\nTheir bodies were found by Ms Smallman's boyfriend the day after they had been reported missing to police. \nAn investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found the Met's response following calls from worried friends and family of the missing sisters was \"below the standard that it should have been\".\nMina Smallman, the sisters' mother, said the Met had shown \"incompetent, reprehensible and blatant disregard of agreed procedures regarding missing persons\" during its investigation.\nCommissioner Dame Cressida Dick said a better response would have saved their family and friends \"immeasurable pain\".\n\"While we know that very sadly Nicola and Bibaa had been murdered in the early hours of Saturday 6 June 2020, before they were reported missing, if we had responded better we may have saved their friends and family immeasurable pain,\" she said.\n\"I am very sorry that the level of service we provided fell short.\"\nThe pair were reported missing on Saturday, 7 June after attending a birthday celebration the previous evening but an inspector closed the logs after receiving information that was not accurately recorded.\nThe IOPC said a search by the sisters' families and friends of their last known location led to the discovery of their bodies in Fryent Country Park, Wembley on Sunday - 36 hours after the party.\nSpeaking about the apology, the sister's mother said: \"We're not the only parties who suffered mental anguish at the hands of the Met's incompetent, reprehensible and blatant disregard of agreed procedures regarding missing persons.\"\nMs Smallman added that the on-duty call handler had made \"inappropriate and manipulating assertions, which led to cancellation of the missing persons report. \n\"We're also of the view that his unprofessional comments about the picnic suggests racial profiling, misogyny or classism.\"\nDame Cressida said she contacted the family to ask if they would allow her or another senior officer to visit to apologise in person.\nHowever, Ms Smallman said: \"Sorry is something you say when you comprehend the wrong you do and take full responsibility for it. Demonstrating that by taking appropriate proportionate action which to our minds is not going to happen.\n\"The investigation was not handled appropriately. The apology should have been done face-to-face and not nearly 10 months later.\"\nThe IOPC investigation found an inspector closed the police logs after receiving information about the sisters' possible whereabouts from a family member.\nHowever, that information was \"inaccurately\" recorded by a communications supervisor, so the inquiries were not progressed properly.\nThe inspector told the IOPC it had been one of \"the most challenging shifts of his career\" with 16 missing persons reports and an under-capacity unit due to the pandemic.\nThe force said it agreed its service the weekend the sisters went missing was \"below the standard it should have been\".\nIt said no misconduct was found by an officer and two members of police staff but there would be action taken over their performance, which was found to be inadequate.\nThere was no suggestion racial bias played any part in how the missing persons reports were dealt with, it said.\nResponding to the IOPC report, Barry Gardiner, MP for Brent North, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The Met really does need to have a root and branch reform in the way in which it operates, the way in which it treats people and it needs to ground itself much better in the community.\""

      "tags": "Alcohol,Tax,UK National Minimum Wage,Student debt,Budget 2021,Students,Pensions,Income tax,Student finance",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak will lay out the government's latest tax and spending plans on Wednesday 27 October.\nIt's the government's second Budget of the year, after one in March, and will coincide with the conclusions of the 2021 Spending Review, which will give details of how government will fund public services for the next three years.\nResponding to the most recent public sector finance data this week, the chancellor said: \"At the Budget and Spending Review next week, I will set out how we will continue to support public services, businesses and jobs while keeping our public finances fit for the future.\"\nWhat are his options? Here we look at six things to watch out for in the Budget that could affect your personal finances.\nThe chancellor is reportedly considering a cut to the 5% rate of value added tax on household energy bills.\nThe move would be popular and timely against the background of soaring energy bills this winter and is something the government is now able to do because of Brexit.\nBut the move could attract criticism as it would - in effect - mean subsidising fossil fuels ahead of the climate summit.\nAlso, a VAT cut on domestic energy bills would cost about \u00a31.5bn a year, which may just be too much for the chancellor.\nThere are rumours the chancellor is planning to simplify the way that alcohol is taxed in the UK.\nThe 2019 Conservative election manifesto promised to review it, so now could be the time.\nOne suggestion is to reduce the premium on sparkling wine to the same level as still wine, which could knock 83p off a bottle of Champagne or Prosecco.\n\"The government should stop trying to favour certain parts of the industry, instead focusing on removing distortions and creating a simpler system of alcohol taxes targeted at socially costly drinking,\" said Kate Smith, associate director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nThe drinks levies have been in place since the 1600s and raise \u00a312bn a year for the government.\nThere are rumours that the current Capital Gains Tax rates may be tinkered with.\nThe tax is paid when people sell assets such as shares or a second home.\nIt's been suggested that rates could be aligned more closely with income tax rates, which could mean scrapping the current tax rates of 10% and 20% (or 18% and 28% for property) and instead making everyone pay income tax rates on their gains.\nA report by the Office of Tax Simplification, published in November 2020, recommended that CGT rates should be increased to bring them into line with income tax.\nBut it would be unlikely to raise significant extra amounts of tax, as it is typically paid by only about 275,000 taxpayers and raises less than \u00a310bn a year. \nThere are reports that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier.\nThe chancellor could do that by lowering the threshold at which people start repaying their student loans, a move that could save the Treasury about \u00a32bn a year. \nCurrently, English and Welsh students who enrolled at university after 2012 pay 9% of everything they earn above \u00a327,295 per year. They repay the same 9% until the loan is fully repaid or until 30 years after graduating. \nIf the threshold were reduced to \u00a325,000, it would cost anyone earning more than the current limit an extra \u00a3206 a year, while if it were slashed to \u00a320,000, it would cost an extra \u00a3656 a year.\nMinisters are rumoured to have proposed cutting the threshold to as low as \u00a323,000 and giving graduates 40 years as opposed to 30 to repay their debt. \n In his March Budget, Mr Sunak announced that the National Living Wage (what the governments call the minimum wage) would increase for workers over the age of 23.\nSince then, the government has come under pressure to help employees further - especially as younger workers have been some of the worst hit by the economic downturn.\nOne solution the chancellor has been reportedly looking at is to increase the National Living Wage by 5.7% to \u00a39.42 per hour from its current rate of \u00a38.91.\nThat would bring it close to the Living Wage Foundation's current recommendation of \u00a39.50 an hour. \nThe government could raise cash by cutting tax relief on pension savings for those on high salaries. \nBut pension experts warn such a move would not be as simple as it sounds, Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said: \"A move to a flat rate of pensions tax relief, rather than the current system where relief is based on the rate of income tax paid, would be far from simple to implement.\"\nHe said it would be particularly difficult for defined-benefit schemes and could mean medium to high earners, including doctors in public sector schemes, facing big tax bills. \n\"Removing higher-rate relief would be a direct attack on middle Britain, leading to people who do the right thing and save for their future being hit with extra tax costs,\" said Tom Selby, head of retirement policy at AJ Bell."

      "tags": "Healthcare,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021,NHS England,NHS",
      "text": "The NHS in England is to receive an extra \u00a35.9bn in this week's Budget, the government has announced.\nThe money will be used to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans, which has been worsened by the pandemic, and also to buy equipment and improve IT.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak called the announcement \"game-changing\".\nHealth bodies welcomed the latest pledge but said it would not solve the problem of staff shortages.\nSajid Javid, the health secretary, said the funding was \"new money\" and that Mr Sunak would set out exactly where it was coming from during Wednesday's Budget and Spending Review.\nMore than five million people are waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England, with hundreds of thousands waiting more than a year.\nThe \u00a35.9bn is on top of the \u00a312bn a year that was announced in September..\nThat money will be raised through tax increases - the rise in National Insurance and, from 2022, the Health and Social Care Levy - and will be spent on resources such as staffing.\nThe \u00a35.9bn will be used to pay for physical infrastructure and equipment - not day-to-day spending.\nSome of the \u00a35.9bn - \u00a32.3bn - will be used to fund more diagnostic tests, like CT, MRI and ultrasound scans, the government said.\nMore clinics in shopping centres for scans and tests - which the government had already announced - will be opened.\nThese will help clear the backlog of tests by the end of this Parliament, the government said.\nAlso included in the \u00a35.9bn total is: \nA proportionate amount will also go to the health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nAccess to tests and scans is a real bottleneck in the system at the moment, slowing down the ability of the NHS to work its way through the backlog in routine care and, sometimes, delaying the diagnosis of cancer.\nIt has been known for years the NHS does not have enough equipment to carry out tests and scans. And the machines it has are ageing.\nThe problems mean as demand has increased, performance has deteriorated.\nThe aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case.\nBut currently around a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did.\nThe funding will help, in time, improve the situation.\nBut the big issue that it does not tackle is staffing - there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests.\nAround one in 10 posts are currently vacant. \nThere are various reasons for this, including more part-time working, the numbers retiring and problems recruiting internationally because of the pandemic.\nBuying new machines is much easier than training, recruiting and retaining staff. Until that is resolved, many are sceptical about what this announcement will actually achieve. \nWaiting lists have grown as routine operations were cancelled throughout the pandemic and people who put off seeking help for symptoms come forward.\nSome of those in the healthcare sector warned it was not enough to keep up with costs and demand.\nChristopher Rigby, an NHS radiographer from Yorkshire, said: \"We haven't got the workforce to staff the hospitals we have now let alone all these new centres.\"\nNHS Providers - which speaks for hospital and other NHS trusts - warned the health service needed more staff to deliver services.\nA body representing healthcare leaders, the NHS Confederation, said the funding \"falls short of what is needed to get services completely back on track\". \nThe NHS is sending out a further two million invites for Covid booster jabs this week.\nThe health secretary said \"we should actively be looking at\" making jabs mandatory for NHS staff, as they are for care workers.\nMr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would wear a face covering during Wednesday's Budget announcement in the Commons.\nBut he said now was not time to activate England's \"Plan B\", that would make face masks mandatory in many places.\nAre you an NHS professional or patient affected by the NHS backlog?

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,David Attenborough",
      "text": "\"If we don't act now, it'll be too late.\" That's the warning from Sir David Attenborough ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.  \nThe broadcaster says the richest nations have \"a moral responsibility\" to help the world's poorest. \nAnd it would be \"really catastrophic\" if we ignored their problems, he told me in a BBC News interview.  \n\"Every day that goes by in which we don't do something about it is a day wasted,\" he said.\nSir David and I were speaking at Kew Gardens in London during filming for a new landmark series, The Green Planet, to be aired on BBC1 next year.  \nOur conversation ranged from the latest climate science to the importance of COP26 to the pace of his working life. \nThe UN climate science panel recently concluded that it is \"unequivocal\" that human activity is driving up global temperatures.  \nAnd Sir David said that proved that he and others had not been making \"a fuss about nothing\", and that the risks of a hotter world are real.  \n\"What climate scientists have been saying for 20 years, and that we have been reporting upon, you and I both, is the case - we were not causing false alarms.  \n\"And every day that goes by in which we don't do something about it is a day wasted. And things are being made worse\". \nBut he said the report had not convinced everyone and that they are acting as a brake on efforts to tackle climate change.  \n\"There are still people in North America, there are still people in Australia who say 'no, no, no, no, of course it's very unfortunate that there was that forest fire that absolutely demolished, incinerated that village, but it's a one-off'. \n\"Particularly if it's going to cost money in the short term, the temptation is to deny the problem and pretend it's not there. \n\"But every month that passes, it becomes more and more incontrovertible, the changes to the planet that we are responsible for that are having these devastating effects.\" \nHis call for an urgent response reflects the latest scientific assessment that to avoid the worst impacts of rising temperatures, global carbon emissions need to be halved no later than 2030.  \nThat's why the coming years are described as \"the decisive decade\" and why the COP26 talks are so crucial for getting the world on a safer path now. \nAs things stand, emissions are projected to continue rising rather than starting to fall, and Sir David was sounding more exasperated than I've heard before. \n\"If we don't act now, it will be too late,\" he said. \"We have to do it now.\" \nWe turned to the question of responsibility, a highly contentious issue which will loom large at the conference. Developing countries have for years accused the richest nations, which were the first to start polluting the atmosphere, of failing to shoulder their share of the burden. \nThe argument is that they should be making the deepest cuts in carbon emissions and providing help to those who need it most.  A long-standing promise of $100bn a year for low carbon development and to build stronger defences against more violent weather has yet to be fulfilled - reaching that total will be a key test of whether COP26 succeeds or fails. \nFor Sir David, this is one of the most worrying challenges, and he says it would be \"really catastrophic\" if threats to the poorest nations were ignored.  \n\"Whole parts of Africa are likely to be unliveable - people will simply have to move away because of the advancing deserts and increasing heat, and where will they go? Well, a lot of them will try to get into Europe. \n\"Do we say, 'Oh, it's nothing to do with us' and cross our arms? \n\"We caused it - our kind of industrialisation is one of the major factors in producing this change in climate. So we have a moral responsibility.  \n\"Even if we didn't cause it, we would have a moral responsibility to do something about thousands of men, women and children who've lost everything, everything. Can we just say goodbye and say this is no business of ours?\" \nFinally I asked about his own hectic workload at the age of 95 - from filming documentaries to addressing the G7 summit, the UN Security Council and the Duke of Cambridge's Earthshot Prize.  \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\n\"I don't plan very far ahead - as you say, I'm 95. How long can you go on? It isn't within our gift to say those things or to know those things.  \n\"All I know is that if I get up tomorrow and I feel that I'm able to do a decent day's work, then I shall jolly well do it and be grateful.  \n\"And the day is going to come when I'm going to get out of bed and say, I don't think I can do that. When that's going to be, who knows? I don't.\" \nHaving watched him filming for five hours straight, and remaining not only focused but also good-humoured, I suggested that he still loved what he was doing.  \n\"At the moment, I feel it would be a waste of an opportunity just to back out and not do the things I think are very important to do in which I am well placed to do.\"  \nAnd the next major engagement in the Attenborough diary? Nothing less than speaking, virtually or in-person, to what's set to be the largest ever gathering of global leaders on British soil: COP26, in a few days' time.   "

      "text": "Defiant protesters remain on the streets of Sudan after the country's armed forces launched a military coup.\nChanting and waving flags, they have blocked roads in the capital Khartoum and around the country following the takeover.\nOn Monday coup leader Gen Abdel Fattah Burhan dissolved civilian rule, arrested political leaders and called a state of emergency.\nSoldiers opened fire on crowds and reportedly killed 10 people.\nAccording to Reuters, Gen Burhan has said Monday's coup was justified to avoid \"civil war\" and that the detained prime minister will be returned to his home on Tuesday.  Earlier, he sought to justify the takeover by blaming political infighting.\nThe coup has drawn global condemnation. Diplomats told AFP news agency the UN Security Council is due to meet on Tuesday to discuss the crisis. \nTroops are reported to have been going house to house in Khartoum arresting local protest organisers.\nThe city's airport is closed and international flights are suspended. The internet and most phone lines are also down. \nCentral Bank staff have reportedly gone on strike, and across the country doctors are said to be refusing to work in military run hospitals except in emergencies.\nCivilian leaders and their military counterparts have been at odds since long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in 2019.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the military's actions \"are a betrayal of Sudan's peaceful revolution\". The US has halted $700m (\u00a3508m) in aid. \nAfter a night of protests, demonstrators remained on the streets on Tuesday morning, demanding the return of civilian rule.\n\"Civilian rule is the people's choice,\" they chanted as they set up barricades of burning tyres. Many women are also taking part, shouting \"no to military rule\".\nThe protests continue despite troops opening fire on demonstrators on Monday. \nOne wounded protestor told reporters he was shot in the leg by the army outside the military headquarters, while another man described the military firing first stun grenades, then live ammunition.\n\"Two people died, I saw them with my own eyes,\" said Al-Tayeb Mohamed Ahmed. Sudan's doctors' union and the information ministry also wrote on Facebook that the fatal shootings had happened outside the military compound.\nPictures from a hospital in the city showed people with bloodied clothing and various injuries. \nWorld leaders have reacted with alarm to news of the military takeover.\nThe US has joined the UK, EU, UN and African Union, of which Sudan is a member, in demanding the release of political leaders who are now under house arrest.\nAmong them are Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and his wife, along with members of his cabinet and other civilian leaders.\nBBC Arabic's Mohamed Osman reported from the capital that a special security unit of the military went to the prime minister's home early on Monday morning, and tried to persuade Mr Hamdok to agree to the coup, but he refused.\nThe agreement between civilian and military leaders signed in 2019 was designed to steer Sudan towards democracy but has proven fragile with a number of previous coup attempts, the last just over a month ago.\nGen Burhan, who was head of the power-sharing council, said Sudan was still committed to the transition to civilian rule, with elections planned for July 2023. \nAre you in Sudan?

      "text": "The husband of the detained British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is beginning a hunger strike in Whitehall, demanding the government does more to secure her release.\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been held in Iran for five years on spying charges, recently lost her appeal against a second prison sentence.\nRichard Ratcliffe said his wife was \"increasingly distraught\".\nThe Foreign Office says it will \"continue to press Iran\" on the issue.\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a 43-year-old mother-of-one from London, has been detained in Iran since 2016 and has not seen her daughter for two years.\nShe has been serving the second of two prison sentences, this one on parole for a conviction of propaganda against the Iranian regime. She is staying with her mother in Iran - but is not allowed to leave the country. \nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has always denied any wrongdoing.\nBut now she faces a return to prison, after losing an appeal against the most recent sentence. Mr Ratcliffe said it was only a matter of time before she would be summoned back to jail.\nThe hunger strike began on Sunday near to the Foreign Office and Downing Street in London. It is the second time Mr Ratcliffe has used the tactic, after a 15-day hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London in 2019.\n\"Two years ago I went on hunger strike in front of the Iranian embassy, on the eve of Boris Johnson taking over as prime minister,\" said Mr Ratcliffe in a statement online.\n\"We are now giving the UK government the same treatment. In truth, I never expected to have to do a hunger strike twice. It is not a normal act. It seems extraordinary the need to adopt the same tactics to persuade government here, to cut through the accountability gap.\"\nHe said that although Iran remained the main country responsible, \"the UK is also letting us down\".\n\"It is increasingly clear that Nazanin's case could have been solved many months ago - but for other diplomatic agendas. The PM needs to take responsibility for that.\"\nHe added: \"It can be difficult to capture the feeling of a life wasting away, watching prison creep closer while we sit in the PM's in-tray.\"\nMr Ratcliffe said he was making four demands from Mr Johnson, including recognising Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe as a hostage, and for the UK to push for an end to hostage-taking when negotiating the Iran nuclear deal.\nHe also called for the government to pay the \u00a3400m debt that the UK owes Iran, dating back from a deal between the two sides over tanks in the 1970s. \nMr Ratcliffe believes his wife has been imprisoned as leverage for the debt.\nHe spoke to the new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss earlier this month, but said he was told the government's response was to do nothing yet until Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was returned to prison.\n\"For us, reimprisonment is too late, it would mean not seeing Nazanin until 2023,\" he said.\nThe MP Tulip Siddiq - who represents the constituency where the Zaghari-Ratcliffes live - called on the government to listen to Mr Ratcliffe.\n\"It breaks my heart that my constituent Richard Ratcliffe has once again been forced to go on hunger strike to protest against the government's failure to free Nazanin,\" she said.\n\"It should never have come to this. It's time for the government to listen to the demands of Nazanin's family, including paying the debt we owe to Iran, and finally bring her home.\"\nAnd the boss of charity Amnesty International called the situation \"incredibly upsetting\".\n\"Like Richard, we've grown tired of hearing ministers saying they're 'doing all they can' for Nazanin and other arbitrarily-detained Britons in Iran - it doesn't look like that to us, and it certainly hasn't produced results,\" said Sacha Deshmukh.\nHe demanded the government sets out a strategy for getting Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe home, and added: \"We call on Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and other ministers to take the time to come out of their offices to visit Richard at his tent. Ministers need to hear first-hand how desperate this situation is.\"\nOn Sunday, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"Iran's decision to proceed with these baseless charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is an appalling continuation of the cruel ordeal she is going through. \n\"Instead of threatening to return Nazanin to prison, Iran must release her permanently so she can return home. \n\"We are doing all we can to help Nazanin get home to her young daughter and family and we will continue to press Iran on this point.\""

      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\nEmissions\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "Tesco's website and app are now up and running again, following a service outage that began on Saturday. \nThe retail giant's services had crashed after what Tesco said were attempts \"to interfere with our systems\". \nThe possible hack at Britain's biggest supermarket began with shoppers unable to order goods and track deliveries.\nTesco initially said there was \"an issue\", but in a Sunday update said there had been deliberate disruption.\nThe supermarket later confirmed on Twitter that its groceries website and app were back up and running, but it was temporarily using a \"virtual waiting room\" to manage the high volume of traffic. \nTesco said the attempts to compromise its systems were made overnight from Friday to Saturday, but was not more specific. \nAccording to Downdetector, which monitors website outages, shoppers began reporting issues early on Saturday morning.\nThe scale of the problem, and whether the issue was nationwide or only in certain areas, remained unclear on Sunday night.\nShoppers complained over the weekend about a lack of information, with many wanting to know how to cancel orders and whether they can get money back.\nEarlier on Sunday, a Tesco spokesperson said: \"There is no reason to believe that this issue impacts customer data and we continue to take ongoing action to make sure all data stays safe.\n\"Since yesterday, we've been experiencing disruption to our online grocery website and app. \n\"An attempt was made to interfere with our systems which has caused problems with the search function on the site. We're working hard to fully restore all services and apologise for the inconvenience.\"\nMeanwhile, shoppers were trying to change or cancel deliveries, or switch to other supermarkets.\nTesco customer Chris Hodgson, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent, told the BBC the app had not been working properly for \"a couple of days\".\nHe picked up his click-and-collect order on Sunday, but had only managed to do half his weekly shopping before the website went down. \"The collection member of staff hadn't been informed of any issues,\" Mr Hodgson said. \"After I showed him the website, he said it was an unusually quiet day.\n\"I asked if I could reject the whole order and was informed I could only reject substituted items. I'll have to go out again this afternoon. If you're on a budget it's annoying, it's an inconvenience.\n\"Nothing from Tesco, no way of contacting them. Really poor by Tesco,\" he said.\nAnother customer, Rebecca, from North Wales, got a delivery of 120 Pepsi drinks on Sunday instead of her order.\n\"We were meant to get a week's shop this morning,\" she told the BBC. \"The website was down all yesterday so we couldn't amend or cancel. All we received was 120 cans of Pepsi Max.\"\nRebecca, who asked for her surname not to be used, added: \"I'd been going in to the order over and over yesterday, right up until the 11.45 deadline. I didn't try calling, there must be thousands in the same boat.\n\"Fortunately someone suggested that Asda had delivery slots for today so I managed to place an order last night (just before their deadline) for enough food for the next few days.\"\nTesco initially said on Saturday it was \"working hard to get things back up and running\", and apologised for the inconvenience.\nThe firm's online sales have soared recently, especially during lockdown, with the supermarket ramping up capacity. \nIts latest financial results say the scale and reach of its online operations are \"unmatched in the UK\", with total sales topping \u00a36bn. Tesco said it had 6.6 million app users.\nTesco has faced previous hacks. In 2014 about 2,000 customer accounts were deactivated amid fears login details were compromised, and there was also a cyber attack on the supermarket's bank arm.\nBut the problem is becoming more common globally. Earlier this year, international meat manufacturer JBS had to shut down about 25% of its operation. And large swathes of US fuel supply were closed after a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline.\nFew sectors have escaped the attention of cyber-criminals, with airlines, banks, universities, local authorities, utilities and tech giants such as Microsoft all having faced attacks on their computer systems."

      "tags": "Sewage,Ofwat,Environment Agency",
      "text": "Tory MPs have been defending themselves from accusations they have given the go-ahead to water companies to dump raw sewage in rivers. \nA proposal from the Lords to the Environment Bill that would have placed legal duties on the companies to reduce discharges was defeated by 265 MPs' votes to 202 last week. \nThe MPs say safeguards already exist and new measures would cost billions.\nCritics say the UK is \"lecturing\" the world while its rivers are polluted. \nWith just over a week to go until the UK hosts the COP26 climate summit, there is intense focus on ministers' green credentials. \nLast Wednesday, 265 MPs voted with the government to reject an attempt by the House of Lords to toughen up the approach to the discharge of sewage, while 22 Conservative MPs rebelled and voted against the government.\nThe move has sparked an uproar on social media.\nPeers had tabled an amendment to the Environment Bill that would have forced water companies and the government to demonstrate progressive reductions in discharges of untreated sewage and required them to \"take all reasonable steps\" to avoid using combined sewer overflows.\nBut ministers said the changes were unnecessary because safeguards are already contained in the bill. \nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, former singer Fergal Sharkey, who now campaigns to clean up the nation's waterways, said it was a \"disgrace\".\n\"We're lecturing the rest of the planet on climate change yet the reality is there is not a single river in England that makes good overall environmental health,\" he said. \nHe said \"every single river\" in England is polluted and \"a major cause is the water industry dumping sewage\". \nHe added: \"The truth is what we are looking at is the result of a massive under-investment in infrastructure for the last 30 years and a complete failure of oversight and regulation of the industry by Ofwat, the environment agency and the government itself.\"\nHe said ministers were \"unwilling and incapable\" of dealing with the situation. \nConservative Huw Merriman, who voted against the government and for the amendment, said \"what was being proposed by the government wasn't enough\" and he hoped ministers would \"be persuaded\" it was the right way to go. \nHe said: \"To have sewage being discharged down streets, when there is too much rain, into the sea\" is \"just absolutely shocking\".\n\"It does mean more investment. That may ultimately mean more expensive bills, but we're talking about decades of investment and it's got to happen,\" he said.\nBut fellow Conservative, Julie Marson, who voted against the amendment, said \"there is a lot of misinformation floating about\" on the issue and while the proposal itself was \"sound\", its \"fundamental flaw\" was that it \"had no plan as to how this can be delivered and no impact assessment whatsoever\".\nShe wrote: \"The preliminary cost of the required infrastructure change was estimated to be between \u00a3150bn and \u00a3650bn.\n\"Unless we asked taxpayers to contribute, most of the water companies who would be carrying out this work would go bankrupt, meaning the work could not be completed anyway. \n\"The cost works out at between about \u00a35,000 and \u00a320,000 per household.\n\"I felt it would be unfair to sting local people with a bill of this size.\"\nShe said the existing legislation already placed a new duty on water companies to continuously monitor the water quality upstream and downstream of a storm overflow and of sewage disposal works.\nAnother Conservative, Fay Jones, tweeted that the criticisms of MPs were \"deeply misleading\". \nShe wrote: \"It ignores the massive flaw in the amendment (i.e forcing taxpayers to pay up to \u00a3600bn to dig up Victorian sewerage system) and the work the government is already doing to reduce discharge from storm overflows.\"\nAnd Conservative, John Howell, said in a statement he voted against the amendment because \"it is necessary to be realistic\" given the age of the sewerage systems and the potential disruption to homes and businesses.\nThe accusation that he voted to allow water companies to pump raw sewage into rivers \"is far from the truth\", he said. \n\"It would be just as fair to say that Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs voted to pump raw sewage into your home given that resolving the problem by their half-baked proposal of sewage discharges would require rebuilding the sewage system and could cost up to \u00a3600bn and take many years,\" he added. \nWater companies discharged raw sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times last year, according to figures published by the Environment Agency.\nUntreated effluent, including human waste, wet wipes and condoms, was released into waterways for more than three million hours in 2020. \nThe Environment Agency allows water utilities to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather events such as prolonged heavy rain.\nThis protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes.\nThe agency says that overflows are \"not a sign that the system is faulty\", and that they are \"a necessary part of the existing sewerage system\".\nA government spokesperson said the amount of sewage discharge by water companies into rivers was \"not acceptable\". \nThe spokesman added: \"We have made it crystal clear to water companies that they must significantly reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows as a priority. \n\"If we do not start to see significant improvements, we will not hesitate to take action through the new measures directly on water companies in the Environment Bill. \n\"We have provided over \u00a33bn of investment to tackle pollution in rivers and we expect to see results.\"\nThe Environment Bill will return to the Lords on Tuesday, where peers are expected to re-insert the measures before it goes back to the House of Commons later this week.

      "text": "The first weekend of enforcement of Scotland's vaccine passport scheme was an \"unmitigated disaster\", according to a body representing night-time venues. \nVenue staff refused entry to revellers without vaccine passports more than 550 times, and some staff were abused, the Scottish Hospitality Group said. \nIt said some venues decided to close early and footfall was down by up to 40%. \nThe Scottish government said the scheme was a \"proportionate\" health measure. \nMinisters say it will encourage more people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and ensure late-night venues can remain open during a \"potentially very difficult\" winter. \nThe vaccine certification scheme was introduced on 1 October but there was no enforcement during a 17-day \"grace period\" as venues adjusted to the new requirements.  \nThe Scottish Hospitality Group, which opposes the scheme, said the first real test this weekend had been \"one of unmitigated disaster\".\n\"The Scottish Hospitality Group has been warning the government for weeks that their vaccine passports scheme is not ready - but the government's attitude has been to tell us to 'get on with it' whilst offering no safety net of support for businesses or our hard working staff,\" spokesperson Stephen Montgomery said. \n\"The experience of this weekend shows that the result has been intolerable levels of abuse of our staff, and the creation of an atmosphere that will totally undermine anyone's enjoyment of our night-time venues.\"\nThe group said there was a \"concerning number\" of reports of staff being abused over rejections and queues which led to a \"charged atmosphere\". \nSome venues had decided to close at midnight, taking them outside the scope of the scheme, because of problems with staff recruitment and welfare, it said.\nMr Montgomery rejected a suggestion that the numbers being turned away was a sign the scheme was working properly in keeping unvaccinated people away from higher risk settings. \n\"Turning people away at the door - yes, I get the point to a degree - but all it's doing is sending them somewhere else, a dancefloor that has tables and chairs on it that does away with dancing,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme.\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the scheme was \"unworkable and unreasonable\" with no financial support for businesses or their staff. \nThe party's Covid recovery spokesperson Murdo Fraser said: \"What is most concerning is the levels of abuse hospitality workers have been subjected to, caused by a lack of public engagement, and a frustrating and unreliable app.\"\nThe Scottish government insisted it was continuing to engage with the sector to discuss implementation of the scheme. \nA spokesperson said: \"Covid-19 certification is a proportionate way of encouraging people to get vaccinated, and also of helping large events and night-time hospitality to keep operating during what will potentially be a very difficult winter.\n\"This means many businesses will not have to close and can continue to trade whilst making necessary adjustments to ensure their premises are as safe as possible for staff and customers.\"\nPeople who have had two vaccines in Scotland can download or get a paper copy of a certificate with a QR code.\nEveryone over the age of 18 must now show - if asked - that they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to certain venues and events. These include:\nThe scheme requires venues to put in place a \"reasonable system\" to check the status of customers, with certain exemptions on medical grounds.\nFor large events such as football matches spot checks can be used, but for smaller gatherings more rigorous checking is required.

      "tags": "UK National Minimum Wage,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "Workers on the minimum wage are set to get a pay boost from April, with the rate for those aged over 23 rising to \u00a39.50 an hour from \u00a38.91.\nThe rise means a full-time worker will get \u00a31,074 extra a year before tax.\nThe move will be announced at this week's Budget and follows the recommendation of independent advisers, the Low Pay Commission. \nThe government has faced pressure to help low-paid, younger workers, who are among the worst hit by the pandemic.\nThe 6.6% increase in the minimum pay rate for those aged over 23 - known as the National Living Wage - is more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living.\nMinimum pay rates for younger workers are also set to go up. \nThe National Minimum Wage for people aged 21-22 will rise from \u00a38.36 to \u00a39.18 an hour and the Apprentice Rate will increase from \u00a34.30 to \u00a34.81 an hour.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the rise \"ensures we're making work pay and keeps us on track to meet our target to end low pay by the end of this Parliament\". \nBut Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, described it as an \"underwhelming offer\" that would be mostly swallowed up by tax rises, universal credit cuts and higher energy bills.\nHow much is the minimum wage?\nFinn Oldfield, 23, earns the National Living Wage for his communications job at the People's Powerhouse social enterprise.\nHe lives at home with his parents in Widnes, but said the increase would help him move to Liverpool city centre, which was unaffordable before the rise. \n\"It's hard if you're from a regional town. I have a politics and philosophy degree from Edinburgh University and thought I'd be able to find opportunities,\" Mr Oldfield told the BBC. \nAfter graduating last year in the middle of the pandemic, Mr Oldfield found his role through the government's Kickstart scheme, which encourages six-month jobs with businesses for people aged 16-24 who are currently claiming universal credit. \n\"With no rent control and higher energy prices, I think this will offset perhaps the harshest of the blows that have come,\" he said.\n\"But I think there's more that could be done by the government to help with rising everyday costs.\"\nCampaign group the Living Wage Foundation welcomed the increases, but said there was still \"a substantial gap\" between the government-mandated minimum wage and its own calculations of a real living wage based on living costs.\nThe foundation's director, Graham Griffiths, called on employers to \"commit to go beyond this new government minimum, do the right thing, and commit to pay a real living wage\".\nSalima Vellani, founder of restaurant chain Absurd Bird, says although higher wages will be \"tougher\" on the hospitality sector, increasing the minimum wage \"is the right move\".\n\"It is hard work, it's unsociable hours, so if people are leaving the industry in droves, then we have to attract them back,\" she said.\n\"That's not just about pay, it's about training.\"\nMs Vellani said agreeing with the minimum wage rise \"might be going against the grain, with all the labour issues we are facing\", but added her company had been pushing up wages generally to retain staff. \n\"You're going to have to pass some of this on to consumers, if your costs are going up,\" said the restaurant owner.\n\"It's going to be a challenge for a lot of operators who are facing extreme costs.\n\"If we what produce is good enough, people will keep buying from us.\"\nNye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the National Living Wage increase was \"very welcome\", but would \"not remotely compensate\" for the cut to universal credit.\nHe said the universal credit change affected 4.4 million families, whereas only 2.2 million workers were on the living wage.\nThe minimum wage that workers should get depends on their age and whether they are apprentices.\nEmployers often worry that a higher minimum wage will lead to more unemployment, and that they will be forced to lay off workers in order to afford the increases.\nBut independent experts maintain there has been little or no evidence of job losses as a result of rising minimum wage levels.\nGiving millions of workers a 6.6% pay rise sounds generous and will be a welcome boost to many pay packets.\nIt also follows the government's - and particularly the prime minister's - narrative of pushing towards a higher-wage economy.\nYet this would be no bumper pay day for low-income families.\nThey spend a higher proportion of income than others on heating and lighting their homes. Hefty gas and electricity bill rises, on top of recent increases this month, are inevitable in the spring. Prices in the shops are going up and many economists believe the increases could last longer than previously expected.\nFinally, a National Living Wage rise is not compensation for welfare cuts, such as a removal of the \u00a320-a-week universal credit uplift, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has consistently pointed out. \nNot all of those receiving benefits are in work, and for low-income employees who are, a rise in wages can mean a reduction in their benefits.\nMike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said wage increases needed to be matched by support for smaller firms.\nMeanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry called on the chancellor to use the Budget to help get more firms \"investing to lift UK productivity\".\n\"We all want to see a higher-wage economy, but the real challenge is how to do so sustainably,\" it said.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said that although a wage increase would be welcomed by staff, it was a \"further cost increase for pubs who are still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future\".\n\"It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,\" she added.\nTom Ironside, director of business and regulations at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers supported the objective of higher wages and had been working hard to secure productivity improvements, so that those pay increases would be sustainable.\n\"This is made more challenging when retailers are currently grappling with an assortment of other government-imposed costs - higher National Insurance contributions, rising business rates, higher corporation tax - at a time when sales are slowing and supply chains are experiencing significant disruption,\" he added.\nUK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said her industry was \"committed to good and fair pay for its highly-valued staff\" and called for further government support, including \"immediate root-and-branch reform of business rates\"."

      "tags": "Earth science,Greenhouse gas emissions,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "Scientists and politicians say we are facing a planetary crisis because of climate change. \nBut what's the evidence for global warming and how do we know it's being caused by humans? \nOur planet has been warming rapidly since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.  \nThe average temperature at the Earth's surface has risen about 1.1C since 1850. Furthermore, each of the last four decades has been warmer than any that preceded it, since the middle of the 19th Century. \nThese conclusions come from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. The temperature readings are collected by weather stations on land, on ships and by satellites. \nMultiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era. \nScientists can reconstruct temperature fluctuations even further back in time. \nTree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals all record a signature of the past climate.\nThis provides much-needed context to the current phase of warming. In fact, scientists estimate the Earth hasn't been this hot for about 125,000 years. \nGreenhouse gases - which trap the Sun's heat - are the crucial link between temperature rise and human activities. The most important is carbon dioxide (CO2), because of its abundance in the atmosphere.\nWe can also tell it's CO2 trapping the Sun's energy. Satellites show less heat from the Earth escaping into space at precisely the wavelengths at which CO2 absorbs radiated energy. \nBurning fossil fuels and chopping down trees lead to the release of this greenhouse gas. Both activities exploded after the 19th Century, so it's unsurprising that atmospheric CO2 increased over the same period. \nThere's a way we can show definitively where this extra CO2 came from. The carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a distinctive chemical signature. \nTree rings and polar ice both record changes in atmospheric chemistry. When examined they show that carbon - specifically from fossil sources - has risen significantly since 1850.  \nAnalysis shows that for 800,000 years, atmospheric CO2 did not rise above 300 parts per million (ppm). But since the Industrial Revolution, the CO2 concentration has soared to its current level of nearly 420 ppm.\nComputer simulations, known as climate models, have been used to show what would have happened to temperatures without the massive amounts of greenhouse gases released by humans.  \nThey reveal there would have been little global warming - and possibly some cooling - over the 20th and 21st Centuries, if only natural factors had been influencing the climate. \nOnly when human factors are introduced can the models explain increases in temperature.  \nThe level of heating Earth has experienced already is predicted to cause significant changes to the world around us. \nReal-world observations of these changes match patterns scientists expect to see with human-induced warming. They include:\nThere have been several hot periods during the Earth's past.\nAround 92 million years ago, for example, temperatures were so high that there were no polar ice caps and crocodile-like creatures lived as far north as the Canadian Arctic. \nThat should not comfort anyone, however, because humans were not around. At times in the past, sea level was 25m (80ft) higher than the present. A rise of 5-8m (16-26ft) is considered enough to submerge most of the world's coastal cities.\nThere is abundant evidence for mass extinctions of life during these periods. And climate models suggest that, at times, the tropics could have become \"dead zones\", too hot for most species to survive.\nThese fluctuations between hot and cold have been caused by a variety of phenomena, including the way the Earth wobbles as it orbits the Sun over long periods, volcanic eruptions and short-term climate cycles such as El Ni\u00f1o.\nFor many years, groups of so-called climate \"sceptics\" have cast doubt on the scientific basis of global warming. \nHowever, virtually all scientists who publish regularly in peer-reviewed journals now agree on the current causes of climate change.  \nA key UN report released in 2021 said it \"is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land\". \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nTop image credit: Getty Images.

      "tags": "Public sector,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Millions of public sector workers are set to see their wages rise next year, after the government confirmed a pay freeze is being lifted. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak will use his Budget on Wednesday to say nurses, teachers and members of the armed forces are among those set to benefit. \nA \"temporary pause\" in salary progression was introduced last November as a response to the pandemic.\nLabour says tax and price rises mean families face a cost of living crisis.\nThe public sector pay freeze was part of the government's response to what it described as the \"economic emergency\" caused by Covid, with only the lowest-paid excluded.\nIn his spending review in November 2020, Mr Sunak said he could not justify an across-the-board increase when many in the private sector had seen their pay and hours cut in the crisis.\nThe Treasury said exactly how much of a pay rise public sector workers receive depends on the recommendations from the independent pay review bodies, who set the pay for most frontline workforces - including nurses, police officers, prison officers and teachers.\nBut asked if public sector pay would rise above inflation, a Downing Street spokesperson said the independent pay review body would consider what the rise should be and that No 10 couldn't \"pre-judge that process\". \nSeparately, campaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the tax to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row at Wednesday's Budget.  \nThe BBC has also been told VAT on household energy would not be cut with the Treasury arguing it would be poorly targeted and that lower income households could be better helped through other schemes. \nIn an announcement on Monday, the Treasury said the chancellor would use his forthcoming Budget to say \"the solid economic recovery and encouraging signs in the labour market\" mean the \"pay pause\" can be lifted. \nIn a statement, Mr Sunak said: \"The economic impact and uncertainty of the virus meant we had to take the difficult decision to pause public sector pay.\n\"And now, with the economy firmly back on track, it's right that nurses, teachers and all the other public sector workers who played their part during the pandemic see their wages rise.\"\nBusiness Minister Paul Scully said it was \"important public sector workers are recognised for what they do and are rewarded fairly\".\nHe said it was part of a number of measures to help people on low incomes, which also included the rise in the national living wage announced on Monday.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: \"We know there are pressures. We know this is a difficult time for the economy, for people in the country in terms of the cost of living.\"\nThe Treasury said the \"temporary pause\" had helped ensure the gap between public and private sector pay did not widen further during the height of the pandemic. \nIt said public sector average weekly earnings rose by 4.5% in 2020/21 whilst private sector wage increases were a third lower than they were pre-crisis, at 1.8%.\nOn Tuesday figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that workers and occupations hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, with employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work seeing the sharpest dip and recovery.\nIt comes at a time of fierce debate about the pressure families are under amid soaring energy bills and price rises for goods in shops. \nOpposition MPs have accused the Conservatives of presiding over a cost of living crisis with cuts to universal credit and tax rises to fund the NHS and social care.\nThere is disquiet among some Conservative backbenchers too about whether ministers should be doing more to help struggling households. \nThere may be an element of relief for some public sector workers that their pay will at at least not be frozen for another year. \nBut it may not be enough to lift the bitterness many feel that in the year when many of them were key workers, often risking their health on the frontlines of the pandemic, they're coping with a real terms pay cut. \nEven nurses, who've received more than most, have seen their spending power shrink as inflation gets above 3%. And that renewed squeeze on living standards is getting worse with record petrol prices and energy bills driving up the cost of living. \nWhat shouldn't be taken at face value is the notion that the government \"can't afford\" to pay more. What a government that issues its own currency decides it can or cannot \"afford\" has no objective economic basis, but is a matter of political choice.  \nFor example, as the IFS points out, the cost of servicing debt is lower than it was pre-pandemic. In fact, it's the second lowest it's been since the 1950s. \nEven if official interest rates rise to 1.25%, they will still be historically low - and that is manageable as long as tax receipts are rising faster than the debt servicing cost. \nWith teachers' pay in real terms 8% lower than a decade ago, hospital consultants 9% lower, NHS dentists 32% down, a reality is coming home: you can't get the work done if you can't attract the staff to do it. \nThe cost of not allowing pay rises - in the harm it could to the government's other goals such as better public health and education - could have been higher than any pay rise. \nThe UK's largest union, Unison, said the pay freeze would continue \"in all but name\" unless government departments get extra money. \nIts general secretary Christina McAnea said while there was \"never a good time to freeze public sector pay\", to do so \"at the peak of a pandemic was the height of folly\" while \"staff were doing their all to keep under-pressure services running\".\nShe added: \"There can be no decent public services without the people to run them.\n\"Pay freezes don't help employers hold on to experienced staff, nor attract new recruits. \n\"But if the chancellor doesn't allocate extra money to government departments to fund the much-needed wage rises, the pay freeze will continue in all but name.\" \nTorsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation described the announcement as \"blindingly obvious\" adding that it was \"totally inevitable\" the pay freeze would be lifted. \n\"What we don't know, is what is going to happen to public sector pay - lifting the freeze is one thing, but a rise could be anything between 0 to a million per cent pay rise.\"\nLabour says many of those working on the frontline dealing with Covid are among those being hit by the government's choices. \nShadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson said: \"This Conservative government's choice last year to freeze pay for so many frontline workers, who have been among the real heroes of the pandemic, was damaging and unsustainable. \n\"The government must work to ensure a fair settlement and reflect the vital work of all key workers including many who have been burnt out over the course of the pandemic.\"\nMeanwhile, the Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has told MPs it was \"not acceptable\" to brief the media ahead of MPs about the Budget.\nSir Lindsay said that ministers used to \"walk\" if they briefed about a Budget."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,COP26,Climate change,Glasgow",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has called for \"credible action, not face-saving slogans\" to come from next week's COP26 summit in Glasgow.\nThe talks have been billed as the \"last best chance\" to limit the rise in the earth's temperature to 1.5C.\nIn a speech ahead of the conference, the first minister said concrete action is needed to \"keep 1.5 alive\". \nThe UK government said the first minister would play an \"important role\" at COP26. \nIt has insisted the summit must \"stick with the goal\" of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C.\nMs Sturgeon said the conference can lead the world into a \"green revolution\" and that Scotland can act as a bridge between large and small nations.\nAnd she said her government would set out details later this week about how it would \"catch up\" with its own emissions reduction targets, having \"fallen short\" of its last three annual milestones.\nShe said: \"Governments at all levels have a responsibility and Scotland is determined to play our full part. \n\"Our ability to do that depends on our own climate credibility - Scotland cannot urge other countries to set and meet ambitious targets if we fail to do that ourselves.\"\nMore than 120 world leaders will attend the summit, which takes place at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November.\nIn her speech to an audience of young people and students in Glasgow, the first minister called for a \"significant uplift in ambition\" from world leaders - particularly those of the \"biggest emitting countries\" - to act to limit global temperature increases and deliver a fair financial package for developing countries. \nShe said: \"We take seriously the responsibility of all governments - at all levels - to show ambition, and to galvanise action. If we do that, we can all contribute towards a successful summit.\n\"I have said that small countries can lead the way in this, and they can, but in the coming days, it is the countries which emit the most, who most need to step up. They need to make ambitious pledges to achieve net zero. And those pledges must be backed by credible actions.\"\n\"The idea of 'keeping 1.5 alive', cannot simply be a face-saving slogan. It must be real. And there must be progress in Glasgow which makes that outcome more likely.\"\nMs Sturgeon also encouraged national governments to match the ambition of cities, regions and state governments, and she said her government would \"help those around the negotiating table to hear from activists in the developed world and from the global South\". \nThe Scottish government has set what it describes as world leading targets to cut carbon emissions.\nIt has committed to achieving net zero by 2045 with an interim goal of reducing emissions by 75% by 2030.\nThese targets have been put into law in Scotland, with ministers describing it as the \"toughest, most ambitious legislative framework on climate change in the world\".\nThe snag is the annual progress required to hit these targets has not yet been achieved.\nThe latest emissions figures for 2019 suggested Scotland had reduced the amount of carbon it was releasing into the atmosphere by 51.5% compared to 1990 levels. The target for 2019 was 55%.\nThe Scottish government has more to do to live up to its ambitions on tackling climate change, and is promising a \"catch up\" plan later this week. \nLast week, COP26 President Alok Sharma told the BBC's No Hot Air podcast the aim was to get countries to \"stick with the goals\" of holding the rise in the earth's temperature to 1.5C, as agreed at a COP summit in Paris in 2015.\nHe said: \"World leaders came together and said that they would act to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C, aiming for 1.5C and that's what we want to try and achieve.\n\"I think Glasgow has to be the moment that the world acts. We've got some commitments but we need to go further.\"\nMr Sharma added: \"We need to make sure that we can say with credibility that we've kept 1.5C in reach.\n\"Now is the time for all of us to act, but particularly for the biggest emitters - the G20 nations and the developed countries who promised finance to support developing countries - they also need to step up.\"\nA spokesman for the UK government said: \"The prime minister has been clear [that] the first ministers will play an important role at COP26. \n\"We are working with the Scottish government, Welsh government and Northern Ireland executive to ensure an inclusive and ambitious summit for the whole of the UK.\"\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "Methane,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The build-up of warming gases in the atmosphere rose to record levels in 2020 despite the pandemic, according to the World Meteorological Organization. \nThe amounts of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide rose by more than the annual average in the past 10 years. \nThe WMO says this will drive up temperatures in excess of the goals of the Paris agreement.\nThey worry that our warmer world is, in turn, boosting emissions from natural sources.\nThe news comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was \"touch and go\" whether the upcoming COP26 global climate conference will secure the agreements needed to help tackle climate change.\n\"It is going to be very, very tough this summit. I am very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it is touch and go, it is very, very difficult, but I think it can be done,\" he said on Monday.\nThe restrictions imposed around the world during the Covid pandemic saw an overall decline in emissions of CO2 of 5.6%.\nSo why hasn't that fall been echoed in atmospheric concentrations - which are the subject of this latest data from the WMO?\nThere are a number of factors involved.\nAround half of emissions from human activity are taken up by trees, lands and oceans. But the absorbing ability of these sinks can vary hugely, depending on temperatures, rainfall and other factors. \nAnother issue is that over the past decade, emissions of CO2 have increased progressively.\nSo even though carbon output was down last year, the increase in the level in the atmosphere was still bigger than the average between 2011-2020. \nAccording to the WMO's annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, CO2 reached 413.2 parts per million in the atmosphere in 2020 and is now 149% of the pre-industrial level. \nThis is bad news for containing the rise in Earth's temperature.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\n\"At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, we will see a temperature increase by the end of this century far in excess of the Paris Agreement targets of 1.5 to 2C above pre-industrial levels,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof Petteri Taalas. \"We are way off track.\"\n\"This is more than just a chemical formula and figures on a graph. It has major negative repercussions for our daily lives and well-being, for the state of our planet and for the future of our children and grandchildren,\" said Prof Taalas.\nThe authors say the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when temperatures were 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than it is today.\nOne of the big concerns for researchers is that the ongoing rise in temperatures may actually cause a rise in warming gases from natural sources. \nScientists are concerned that this is already happening with methane. \nAlthough it has a shorter lifespan than CO2, methane is far more potent as a warming chemical.\nAround 60% of the CH4 that ends up in the atmosphere comes from human sources such as agriculture, fossil fuels, landfills and biomass burning. \nThe other 40% comes from the activities of microbes in natural sources such as wetlands.  \nLast year's rise was the biggest increase since global methane levels started rising again in 2007. \nThe majority of it was from natural sources. \n\"If you increase the amount of precipitation in the areas of the wetlands, and if you increase the temperature, then these methane producing bacteria, produce more methane,\" said Dr Oksana Tarasova from the WMO.\n\"So this will only increase in the future because the temperature is going to rise. It's a big concern,\" she told BBC News. \nScientists describe these vicious cycles as feedback loops. They are also being observed in the Amazon where researchers earlier this year reported that parts of the rainforest were now emitting more CO2 than they were absorbing. \n\"The higher the temperature, the less the precipitation, the more stress goes into the trees,\" said Dr Tarasova.\n\"So, trees have increased mortality, they stop taking up CO2. In addition to our own emissions, we will have emissions from our forests.\"\nThe WMO is also concerned about the rise in nitrous oxide, which comes from human activities such as the use of nitrogen fertiliser but also from natural sources.\nIt has also risen by more than the average over the last ten years. \nWith just days left before world leaders gather in Glasgow for COP26, the news on the level of warming gases in the atmosphere is stark. \n\"Greenhouse gas measurements are like skidding into a car crash. The disaster gets closer and closer but you can't stop it,\" said Prof Euan Nisbet from Royal Holloway, University of London. \n\"You can clearly see the crash ahead, and all you can do is howl.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "A Bridgend company is leading plans to build a \u00a31.7bn renewable energy project on Swansea's waterfront.\nThe Blue Eden scheme includes a tidal lagoon and floating solar panels.\nThis is the third proposal to develop a tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, and would include a battery factory and a data centre run on renewable energy. \nNo tax payers' money would be needed, according to the consortium, but consent will be required from the Welsh government for the energy projects.\nThe international consortium is led by DST Innovations, which makes industrial batteries in the United States.\nBlue Eden would be developed in three phases over twelve years, starting in 2023 with 1,000 jobs making high tech batteries for energy storage.\nThat would be followed by construction of a floating solar energy farm in the Queens Dock area and large data centre powered by an uninterruptable source of renewable energy, which would be a UK first.   \nThe heat generated by the computer servers in the centre would then heat 5,000 new eco-homes along the waterfront. \nThere would also be an oceanic and climate change research centre and 150 floating houses, as seen in the Netherlands.\nThe project hopes to support 16,000 jobs across the Swansea Bay city region in the long term.    \nSwansea council's leader Rob Stewart said: \"I'm delighted that an international consortium led by a Welsh company has developed our Dragon Energy Island vision into a ground-breaking project that delivers so many benefits and builds on the council's ambition to become a net zero city by 2050.\n\"Cooperation and support will be required, trying to make sure the permissions and the consents that are needed are in place.\"\nMr Stewart explained that Blue Eden had signed a memorandum of understanding with Associated British Ports and were in discussions with them about acquiring land.\nThe projected energy output of the tidal lagoon and floating solar panels are just under 320 megawatts each, which means Welsh government would be responsible for giving consent to these elements.\nSwansea council supports the project but Mr Stewart said no public money would be given to it: \"Blue Eden will put Swansea and Wales at the cutting-edge of global renewable energy innovation, helping create thousands of well-paid jobs, significantly cut our carbon footprint and further raise Swansea's profile across the world as a place to invest.\"\nDST's co-founder and chief executive Tony Miles said: \"Blue Eden is an opportunity to create a template for the world to follow - utilising renewable energy and maximising new technologies and thinking to develop not only a place to live and work, but also to thrive.\"\nThe company added it did not any need money from either the UK or Welsh government, or a guaranteed price for the electricity, since all the electricity produced will be used within the Blue Eden development.\nMr Miles said he hoped to start building work in two years' time: \"We'd like to break ground in a couple of years, once we've finalised all the studies, and some fairly major investors have injected a lot of capital into this already.\n\"We're hoping without too many bad statistics for future sea rises and weather forecasts, it has 120 years of life before somebody comes up with a new version.\"\nThe latest project for Swansea Bay differs widely from previous attempts to generate renewable energy there.\nIn contrast this is entirely privately funded, does not feed electricity into the National Grid and is different in the way it develops two industries - batteries for the renewable sector and a data centre, saving time and producing an income while the lengthy planning process for the lagoon takes place.\nHowever, it is still early days for the project. The battery production is still at the pilot stage and involves using, but not burning, anthracite coal - a sodium solution. DST said it would be less affected by extreme weather than batteries made from lithium.\nBlue Eden's plans also depend on customers for the data centre and the company says it has already been contacted by people who are interested. \nThe biggest hurdles to the project are permissions from four public sector organisations. \nIt needs a license from the Crown Estate to construct the lagoon wall on the sea bed, planning permission for the battery factory, data centre and housing from Swansea Council, permission to generate electricity from Welsh government and a license from Natural Resources Wales. \nThe first proposals for a tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay faced detailed criticism from groups that were concerned about its impact on ecology and fish migration from the sea into rivers to spawn.  \nThe lagoon would produce 320 megawatts of electricity which would power more than 5,000 homes on site, a data centre, an oceanographic and climate change research centre and battery manufacturing plant. \nThat size means that it is not big enough to need permission from the UK government.

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Greta Thunberg",
      "text": "Climate activist Greta Thunberg has told the BBC that summits will not lead to action on climate goals unless the public demand change too. \nIn a wide-ranging interview ahead of the COP26 climate summit, she said the public needed to \"uproot the system\".\n\"The change is going to come when people are demanding change. So we can't expect everything to happen at these conferences,\" she said. \nShe also accused politicians of coming up with excuses.\nThe COP26 climate summit is taking place in Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, from 31 October to 12 November. \nIt is the biggest climate change conference since landmark talks in Paris in 2015. Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming. \nMs Thunberg, who recently launched a global series of concerts highlighting climate change called Climate Live, confirmed she would be attending COP26. She said her message to world leaders was to \"be honest\".\n\"Be honest about where you are, how you have been failing, how you're still failing us... instead of trying to find solutions, real solutions that will actually lead somewhere, that would lead to a substantial change, fundamental change,\" she told the BBC's Rebecca Morelle.\n\"In my view, success would be that people finally start to realise the urgency of the situation and realise that we are facing an existential crisis, and that we are going to need big changes, that we're going to need to uproot the system, because that's where the change is going to come.\"\nRead more about the COP26 summit here.\nMs Thunberg did not believe that UK plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050 were sufficient, or that the UK was a climate leader. \n\"Unfortunately there are no climate leaders today, especially not in the so-called global north. But that doesn't mean that they can't suddenly decide that now we're going to take the process seriously,\" she said. \nSpeaking about the targets for reaching net zero - which means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - she said that it was a \"good start\", but cautioned that it \"doesn't really mean very much in practice\" if people continued to look for loopholes. \nCOP26 will be attended by climate activists from across the world. \nKevin Mtai, a climate justice campaigner from Kenya, told the BBC that inclusivity at the summit was important.\n\"I hope this climate conference is going to be an inclusive conference, to include all voices in the talks. They need to use indigenous people in the talks, marginalised people in the talks, people from the most affected areas,\" he said. \n\"It's very important for people from the global south to speak for themselves, not other parts of the globe to speak on their behalf. Because we are the ones who have been affected by climate change, so it's very important we can hear from our own people, with our own ideas, our own voice.\"\nFrom her home in Sweden, Ms Thunberg also spoke about her own role as a campaigner. \n\"I don't see myself as a climate celebrity, I see myself as a climate activist... I should be grateful because there are many, many people who don't have a platform and who are not being listened to, their voices are being oppressed and silenced.\n\"I'm a completely different person when I'm in private. I don't think people would recognise me in private. I'm not very serious in private. I appear very angry in the media, but I am silly in private.\" \nWhen asked about why she sang a Rick Astley hit at the launch of Climate Live, she said that it was a climate movement in-joke. She has previously taken part in the internet phenomenon \"rick-rolling\" by tweeting out what she said was a link to a new speech, but actually linked to the music video for the song.\n\"Why not? I mean we have internal jokes within the climate movement, where we always rickroll each other.\""

      "text": "Councils should be able to stop anti-vaccination protesters from demonstrating outside schools by using exclusion orders, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said.\nSir Keir said it was \"sickening\" that protesters were spreading \"dangerous misinformation\" to children.\nHe urged the government to \"urgently\" update the law so exclusion zones can be rapidly set up around school gates. \nMinisters have also expressed concern about such protests.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said freedom to protest was a fundamental part of democracy, but told the Daily Telegraph: \"It is completely unacceptable for children, teachers, or parents to be intimidated and harassed outside their school by protesters peddling misinformation and dangerous lies about the life-saving vaccine programme.\"\nAlmost eight in 10 schools said they had been targeted by anti-vaccine protesters in a recent survey by the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) union.\nMost of this had been through emails threatening legal action, but the ASCL said in some cases staff had been threatened with physical harm and  on other occasions protesters had gained access to school sites.\nEarlier this month, a head teacher at a school in Gateshead said anti-vaccine protesters had left students distressed after showing them pictures of what appeared to be dead children.\nSir Keir, who is a former director of public prosecutions, said local authorities should have the power to impose public spaces protection orders immediately, if agreed by the school, leader of the council, and local police chief constable.\nSuch orders have been used previously to move on protesters outside abortion clinics, but often are time-consuming to set up.\nLabour said the fast-track orders could be in place within five days and stay in place for six months.\nSir Keir said: \"The uptake of vaccines among children is far too low and the government's rollout is painfully slow. Everything must be done to get those eligible jabbed as quickly as possible in this public health emergency.\"\nBy Rachel Schraer, BBC Reality Check Health Disinformation Reporter\nAnti-Covid vaccine protests have been reported across Britain - from Glasgow, Cardiff, London and Manchester to Dorset, Telford and Leicester.\nThose gathering outside schools think it's wrong to vaccinate children, while some hold wilder unfounded beliefs - such as that the whole pandemic is a hoax. \nThe ASCL found at least 420 schools had experienced protests, showing it's not a fringe concern. \nBut a large number of protests appear to stem from just a couple of groups on the encrypted messaging app Telegram. \nOne organiser said she had visited every secondary school in Hartlepool, while another group can be seen coordinating multiple school visits a day from Kent to Cheshire.\nAs well as targeting teachers with sham legal documents, groups organise to hand leaflets out to children featuring QR codes which lead to extremist and conspiracy content.\nAs pressure mounts to protect pupils from being harassed outside schools, there is growing discussion on some of these platforms of strategies to intercept children further away from school, walking home or on their way to the bus stop. \nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the ASCL union, said schools were already \"under great pressure\" because of disruption from the pandemic and \"the last thing they need is the additional problem of protesters outside their gates\".\nCovid vaccines were key to keeping students at school, he said, adding: \"If protesters think otherwise, there are plenty of outlets for them to express their views without resorting to targeting schools.\"\nThe ASCL previously said that of the 526 responses from schools eligible for the Covid vaccine programme for 12 to 15-year-olds, 13% had reported seeing demonstrators immediately outside their school. One in five reported protesters in the local area.\nSome 18 schools said demonstrators had gained access to the school and protested inside the premises, and 20 said they had received communications threatening physical harm to staff."

      "tags": "Sewage,Ofwat,Environment Agency",
      "text": "Tory MPs have been defending themselves from accusations they have given the go-ahead to water companies to dump raw sewage in rivers. \nA proposal from the Lords to the Environment Bill that would have placed legal duties on the companies to reduce discharges was defeated by 265 MPs' votes to 202 last week. \nThe MPs say safeguards already exist and new measures would cost billions.\nCritics say the UK is \"lecturing\" the world while its rivers are polluted. \nWith just over a week to go until the UK hosts the COP26 climate summit, there is intense focus on ministers' green credentials. \nLast Wednesday, 265 MPs voted with the government to reject an attempt by the House of Lords to toughen up the approach to the discharge of sewage, while 22 Conservative MPs rebelled and voted against the government.\nThe move has sparked an uproar on social media.\nPeers had tabled an amendment to the Environment Bill that would have forced water companies and the government to demonstrate progressive reductions in discharges of untreated sewage and required them to \"take all reasonable steps\" to avoid using combined sewer overflows.\nBut ministers said the changes were unnecessary because safeguards are already contained in the bill. \nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, former singer Fergal Sharkey, who now campaigns to clean up the nation's waterways, said it was a \"disgrace\".\n\"We're lecturing the rest of the planet on climate change yet the reality is there is not a single river in England that makes good overall environmental health,\" he said. \nHe said \"every single river\" in England is polluted and \"a major cause is the water industry dumping sewage\". \nHe added: \"The truth is what we are looking at is the result of a massive under-investment in infrastructure for the last 30 years and a complete failure of oversight and regulation of the industry by Ofwat, the environment agency and the government itself.\"\nHe said ministers were \"unwilling and incapable\" of dealing with the situation. \nConservative Huw Merriman, who voted against the government and for the amendment, said \"what was being proposed by the government wasn't enough\" and he hoped ministers would \"be persuaded\" it was the right way to go. \nHe said: \"To have sewage being discharged down streets, when there is too much rain, into the sea\" is \"just absolutely shocking\".\n\"It does mean more investment. That may ultimately mean more expensive bills, but we're talking about decades of investment and it's got to happen,\" he said.\nBut fellow Conservative, Julie Marson, who voted against the amendment, said \"there is a lot of misinformation floating about\" on the issue and while the proposal itself was \"sound\", its \"fundamental flaw\" was that it \"had no plan as to how this can be delivered and no impact assessment whatsoever\".\nShe wrote: \"The preliminary cost of the required infrastructure change was estimated to be between \u00a3150bn and \u00a3650bn.\n\"Unless we asked taxpayers to contribute, most of the water companies who would be carrying out this work would go bankrupt, meaning the work could not be completed anyway. \n\"The cost works out at between about \u00a35,000 and \u00a320,000 per household.\n\"I felt it would be unfair to sting local people with a bill of this size.\"\nShe said the existing legislation already placed a new duty on water companies to continuously monitor the water quality upstream and downstream of a storm overflow and of sewage disposal works.\nAnother Conservative, Fay Jones, tweeted that the criticisms of MPs were \"deeply misleading\". \nShe wrote: \"It ignores the massive flaw in the amendment (i.e forcing taxpayers to pay up to \u00a3600bn to dig up Victorian sewerage system) and the work the government is already doing to reduce discharge from storm overflows.\"\nAnd Conservative, John Howell, said in a statement he voted against the amendment because \"it is necessary to be realistic\" given the age of the sewerage systems and the potential disruption to homes and businesses.\nThe accusation that he voted to allow water companies to pump raw sewage into rivers \"is far from the truth\", he said. \n\"It would be just as fair to say that Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs voted to pump raw sewage into your home given that resolving the problem by their half-baked proposal of sewage discharges would require rebuilding the sewage system and could cost up to \u00a3600bn and take many years,\" he added. \nWater companies discharged raw sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times last year, according to figures published by the Environment Agency.\nUntreated effluent, including human waste, wet wipes and condoms, was released into waterways for more than three million hours in 2020. \nThe Environment Agency allows water utilities to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather events such as prolonged heavy rain.\nThis protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes.\nThe agency says that overflows are \"not a sign that the system is faulty\", and that they are \"a necessary part of the existing sewerage system\".\nA government spokesperson said the amount of sewage discharge by water companies into rivers was \"not acceptable\". \nThe spokesman added: \"We have made it crystal clear to water companies that they must significantly reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows as a priority. \n\"If we do not start to see significant improvements, we will not hesitate to take action through the new measures directly on water companies in the Environment Bill. \n\"We have provided over \u00a33bn of investment to tackle pollution in rivers and we expect to see results.\"\nThe Environment Bill will return to the Lords on Tuesday, where peers are expected to re-insert the measures before it goes back to the House of Commons later this week.

      "tags": "Oil,Fuel,Motoring",
      "text": "Petrol prices have hit 142.94p a litre, their highest level to date, according to the RAC motoring organisation.\nFuel prices were last around this level in April 2012. \nIt is now \u00a315 more expensive to fill up an average family car than a year earlier, said the RAC, which called the new high a \"dark day for drivers\".\nThe RAC said the increase was partly due to a doubling of the oil price since last year. Some analysts believe the oil price could rise further.\nThe price of unleaded petrol has jumped by 28p a litre since last October, the RAC said, meaning it now costs \u00a378.61 to fill a family car.\n\"This will hurt many household budgets and no doubt have knock-on implications for the wider economy,\" a spokesman for the RAC said.\nThe organisation said that other costs, aside from oil, had also pushed up fuel prices. \nRetailers had increased their profit margins by 2p a litre from around 5.5p in April last year to 7.5p a litre. \nThe RAC said retailers, particularly the smaller, independent ones, were trying to rebuild their profits after the steep fall in sales prompted by the first UK lockdown in spring last year. \nIn addition to this, the ethanol component of unleaded petrol was doubled to 10% last month in the more eco-friendly E10 fuel, but as ethanol is more expensive than petrol, that added about 1p a litre.\nDuty paid on fuel is currently 57.95p a litre, more than the cost of the combined bio and petrol components, which amount to around 50p. \nVAT, currently around 24p a litre, is applied on top of all other elements of the petrol price, including duty and the retailer's profit margin. \nPetrol and diesel cars are slowly being phased out as part of pledges to tackle climate change.\nThe government says it will ban the sale of these from 2030. \nThe introduction of the E10 fuel as standard this summer is also part of that drive.\nThe Department for Transport says bringing in this new fuel could cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year, the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road."

All of them have been linked to the highly transmissible Delta variant.\nThe latest surge is considered the largest outbreak in the country since Nanjing in August this year.\nIt has raised concerns over China's ability to maintain its zero-tolerance approach to the virus, especially leading up to the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nHeld annually since 1981, the Beijing marathon is one of China's biggest local sporting events. \nThe race traditionally begins at Tiananmen Square and ends in Celebration Square in Beijing's Olympic Park. \nAround 30,000 people were expected to take part in the marathon, which was scheduled to happen on October 31. \nMarathon organisers said it was cancelling the event \"in order to prevent the risk of the epidemic spreading (and) effectively protect the health and safety of the majority of runners, staff and residents.\"\nThe latest surge is believed to have been spread by local tour groups visiting other provinces and cities.\nChina has enforced travel restrictions, ramped up testing and urged heightened vigilance in a bid to stamp out the latest outbreak.\nOfficials have banned travel agencies from arranging cross-provincial tours that involve affected regions. \nMeanwhile, authorities in the capital Beijing have said they will not allow people with travel history to affected counties into the city. \nMany countries such as Australia have switched from a zero-tolerance policy to living with the virus. \nBut China has stuck to a zero-Covid strategy by implementing harsh lockdowns, mass testing and pursuing mass vaccination drives - about 75.6% of China's population, or 1.068 billion people, had received complete vaccine doses as of Saturday. \nHowever, it has recently suffered sporadic local outbreaks of Covid, mostly due to the Delta variant.

      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver his Budget and Spending Review to the House of Commons next week, setting out the government's spending and financial strategy.\nChanges to the national minimum wage could be announced, as those earners have been badly hit by the economic downturn.  \nNew climate measures and changes to company taxes are also expected. \nWe asked six people across the UK what they want to see from this Budget. \nRuby Torry, a 23-year-old waitress at Zizzi's restaurant in the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield, lives in Rotherham with her mother and earns the minimum wage.\n\"I'm careful with my bills and don't go silly with shopping, but I want to see the minimum wage go up or national insurance tax come down,\" she told the BBC. \nZizzi's had put Ms Torry on furlough, but she said she couldn't cover her bills, so she worked for Asos in the firm's Barnsley warehouse during the pandemic. She says she would also like to see more incentives for apprenticeships.  \n\"I wanted to do an engineering apprenticeship, but wouldn't have been able to live on \u00a3800 a month wages - I couldn't even pay for my car on that,\" she explains.  \n\"Minimum wage needs to go up, I don't know how the government thinks we can do anything on that little.\" \nMichelle Wilson is a single mother from Glenrothes in Scotland and has already felt challenges after the \u00a320 weekly uplift in Universal Credit was ended on 6 October. \n\"It's a real worry because the uplift was almost \u00a3100 a month, which is my main shop gone now, so it's another big stress,\" she told the BBC. \nShe added that she would like to see increases in Universal Credit and the minimum wage to reflect the rise in household costs from inflation. \n\"My kids have been eating healthier with that uplift and it's been a big drop when I'm worried about my gas and fuel bills,\" she says.\nMs Wilson used to work as a support officer for Fife council, but one of the reasons she left the job was because she struggled with the cost of childcare as a lone parent. \nShe said it would be \"helpful\" for the Budget to encourage more flexible hours for working and finding childcare, as she is limited to 09:00 to 15:00.\nMs Wilson would support government measures to help with the sharp rise in energy bills, which she said she is \"struggling to keep up\" with, as rising costs are making life \"harder and harder\" for her. \nNick Grey founded Gtech, which makes floor cleaning and garden products and has a turnover of \u00a370m. The firm employs 200 people across the UK and sells more than 22 million products in 19 countries. \nMr Grey says the Budget should not make it more difficult for firms to employ overseas workers, which he thinks would be a \"backwards step\" amid the labour shortages. \nAnother of his requests is that a rise in corporation tax should be avoided, as he says it \"risks businesses setting up headquarters elsewhere and less bureaucracy would be better for attracting investment in the UK\". \nRaising tax on high earners also \"risks lowering the overall tax income for the country\", he adds. \nJon Tolley runs independent record shop Banquet Records in Kingston, Surrey. He believes the fairest way to pay for the pandemic is through increased tax for people and businesses that earn the most, rather than a rise in everyone's National Insurance tax. \n\"I want customers and my employees to have disposable income and cash in their pockets, so they can spend it on the High Streets,\" he adds. \nMr Tolley explains the business has had an \"OK\" year and received a cash grant of \u00a325,000 twice from the government for having had to close the shop - action that he says was \"welcome and effective\".\nBut he adds that he would like to \"see something changed about business rates\". \n\"We're in competition with online stores who don't have to pay the same rates and High Street rents, so that playing field needs to be levelled.\" \nThe business pays the standard 20% VAT on products and Mr Tolley doesn't want to see this increase. \n\"We haven't had 'just-in-time' stock control at all, because of delivery delays, but we're fortunate to have storage capacity and have ordered well ahead for Christmas.\"\nHollie Whittles, digital strategy specialist and HR director at Purple Frog Systems, says she wants to see a review of the business rates system. \nShe says small businesses often \"lack the time to understand\" tax and rates. \nMs Whittles says it is \"crucial\" to make sure taxes designed for large organisations are not avoided or passed \"further down the chain to their small business customers\".  \nOn climate measures, she commends grant schemes such as the Low Carbon Opportunities Programme (LOCOP) and the Business Energy Efficiency Programme (BEEP), which encourage businesses to adopt greener technologies.\n\"It is vital that the government supports small businesses' journey to net zero, especially with small businesses making up more than 99% of all private sector enterprises,\" she adds.  \nOn changes to apprenticeship schemes and student loans, Ms Whittles, who works with 14 staff, says she would welcome more support for small businesses wanting to train and upskill staff in new technologies that help benefit long-term careers and the local economy.\nMs Whittles says there have been \"considerable challenges\" in accessing the government's Kickstart scheme, which creates new jobs for 16 to 24-year-olds on Universal Credit. \nThe government should also support schemes and skills investment for older people wanting to change careers, in her view.  \nLynne Turner is 71 years old and would like to see her basic government pension of \u00a3137.60 per week increased. \n\"It's absolutely not enough. I'm frugal, but couldn't survive with a decent lifestyle if I only had my pension,\" Ms Turner explains. \nMs Turner says she could not afford to pay into a private pension in the past because of childcare costs. Without an inherited cottage in Wales, the rent from which supplements her pension, she \"wouldn't be able to manage\", she says.  \nShe adds that she would support a beer levy, which \"wouldn't bother her at all\", but says that because so many small businesses have struggled during the pandemic, she would be against making them pay more taxes.\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

That record belongs to the rapper Kanye West, whose Nike Air Yeezy 1 Prototypes fetched $1.8m via a private sale in April.\nThe record price for trainers has been broken several times in recent years, and the market now attracts interest from general buyers as well as leading collectors."

      "text": "Scotland's health secretary says there is \"absolutely a risk\" of Covid cases rising after the COP26 summit in Glasgow.\nHumza Yousaf said he expects to see a spike in cases after 25,000 delegates descend on the city in a week's time.\nMr Yousaf said the Scottish government was not currently considering imposing more restrictions.\nHe also stressed that there were many mitigations in place to prevent Covid being transmitted at the conference. \nSpeaking on BBC One's The Sunday Show Mr Yousaf said that the Scottish government was doing everything it could to limit transmission of the virus during the 12 days of the summit.\nHe said: \"We have been working with the UK government and the United Nations (UN) to make COP as safe as we possibly can. \n\"Mitigations like daily testing in the blue zone, very strict isolation protocols in place, face coverings being worn in the blue zone and so on. We will do everything we possibly can to make the event because we recognise the climate emergency itself is the biggest public health emergency and crisis that we face globally.\"\nHe said: \"There is no public health expert in the world who would say there is no risk in the midst of a global pandemic to have tens of thousand of people descending onto largely one city so there is absolutely a risk of Covid cases rising thereafter but we will do everything we can to mitigate that.\n\"Of course we would expect there to be positive cases linked to COP but we are also very, very assured by the protocols we have got in place to be able to isolate those cases as best as we possibly can.\"\nThe UK government has insisted every measure is being taken to mitigate risk.\nCOP President Alok Sharma told BBC Scotland's No Hot Air podcast: \"People want to know we are taking every measure to ensure that COP26 is safe for the participants and also, really importantly, for the people of Glasgow. That is why we have a detailed regime in terms of safety.\n\"People will be tested every day before they come into the venue. If they are found to be positive they will have to self-isolate.\n\"They will be wearing masks moving around the venue, we will have rigorous cleaning regimes in place and social distancing. \n\"We also made an offer to any accredited delegate who wasn't able to get vaccinated in their home nation to say we would support them in that vaccination process.\"\nCases in Scotland were on the rise throughout the summer as coronavirus restrictions were relaxed, but began to fall in September as the vaccination programme reached its end with young people included, but the drop has levelled off, with cases in October rarely falling below 2,000 per day.\nExperts, including government adviser Prof Devi Sridhar, have raised concerns over a potential increase in cases associated with so many people being in a relatively small area.\nResponding to a tweet from a member of the public last week, Prof Sridhar said: \"I could be wrong (and hope I am) but yes. A mass event with major movement of people in and out with an infectious virus will cause an increase in cases.\n\"While in the case of Covid will put stress on limited health services. Which triggers need for further restrictions.\"\nThe health secretary said that the Scottish government was not actively considering bringing back restrictions. \nBut he did not rule out any measures later in the year. He said restrictions would continue to be reviewed every three weeks but said it would be \"foolish\" to pretend he knew what was going to happen in two or three months' time.\nMr Yousaf admitted he was concerned about the months ahead.\n\"We can't get away from the fact that this will be the most challenging winter in the NHS's 73-year existence and this is the case across the entire UK,\" he said.\nScottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie called for more action ahead of the summit and before winter pressures increase.\nShe said: \"The health secretary simply had no answers to the potential impact of COP26 on our NHS.\n\"We are looking down the barrel at a winter of extreme pressure on our NHS and potentially surging levels of Covid.\n\"We need action from the health secretary to avoid this, not warm words.\"\nScottish Conservative MSP Dr Sandesh Gulhane said that Mr Yousaf was \"unable to provide any confidence that our NHS is prepared\" as delegates started to arrive for COP26.\nHe said: \"This event is unlike anything that Scotland has previously hosted, and under the backdrop of Covid there needs to be reassurance that every mitigation is being taken, so health services are not overwhelmed by a surge in cases.\n\"The minster needs to focus on stepping up testing and the booster programme to protect capacity within our NHS and those most vulnerable.\n\"Humza Yousaf needs to take action if the SNP are serious about managing the potential impact COP26 could have on our NHS.\"\nMr Yousaf also strongly denied claims that Scotland's Covid-19 booster vaccine programme was lagging behind.\nHe said the rollout started as soon as the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation (JCVI) had authorised the move.\n\"I completely reject the suggestion the booster programme is failing. We are on track to meet the targets I laid out to parliament previously.\n\"Groups 1-4, the JCVI priority groups, we are confident of getting vaccinated by mid November. Then groups 5-9 in the months thereafter and absolutely by early next year. Those aged 60-69 can expect letters to be received very soon.\""

      "tags": "Healthcare,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021,NHS England,NHS",
      "text": "The NHS in England is to receive an extra \u00a35.9bn in this week's Budget, the government has announced.\nThe money will be used to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans, which has been worsened by the pandemic, and also to buy equipment and improve IT.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak called the announcement \"game-changing\".\nHealth bodies welcomed the latest pledge but said it would not solve the problem of staff shortages.\nSajid Javid, the health secretary, said the funding was \"new money\" and that Mr Sunak would set out exactly where it was coming from during Wednesday's Budget and Spending Review.\nMore than five million people are waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England, with hundreds of thousands waiting more than a year.\nThe \u00a35.9bn is on top of the \u00a312bn a year that was announced in September..\nThat money will be raised through tax increases - the rise in National Insurance and, from 2022, the Health and Social Care Levy - and will be spent on resources such as staffing.\nThe \u00a35.9bn will be used to pay for physical infrastructure and equipment - not day-to-day spending.\nSome of the \u00a35.9bn - \u00a32.3bn - will be used to fund more diagnostic tests, like CT, MRI and ultrasound scans, the government said.\nMore clinics in shopping centres for scans and tests - which the government had already announced - will be opened.\nThese will help clear the backlog of tests by the end of this Parliament, the government said.\nAlso included in the \u00a35.9bn total is: \nA proportionate amount will also go to the health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nAccess to tests and scans is a real bottleneck in the system at the moment, slowing down the ability of the NHS to work its way through the backlog in routine care and, sometimes, delaying the diagnosis of cancer.\nIt has been known for years the NHS does not have enough equipment to carry out tests and scans. And the machines it has are ageing.\nThe problems mean as demand has increased, performance has deteriorated.\nThe aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case.\nBut currently around a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did.\nThe funding will help, in time, improve the situation.\nBut the big issue that it does not tackle is staffing - there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests.\nAround one in 10 posts are currently vacant. \nThere are various reasons for this, including more part-time working, the numbers retiring and problems recruiting internationally because of the pandemic.\nBuying new machines is much easier than training, recruiting and retaining staff. Until that is resolved, many are sceptical about what this announcement will actually achieve. \nWaiting lists have grown as routine operations were cancelled throughout the pandemic and people who put off seeking help for symptoms come forward.\nSome of those in the healthcare sector warned it was not enough to keep up with costs and demand.\nChristopher Rigby, an NHS radiographer from Yorkshire, said: \"We haven't got the workforce to staff the hospitals we have now let alone all these new centres.\"\nNHS Providers - which speaks for hospital and other NHS trusts - warned the health service needed more staff to deliver services.\nA body representing healthcare leaders, the NHS Confederation, said the funding \"falls short of what is needed to get services completely back on track\". \nThe NHS is sending out a further two million invites for Covid booster jabs this week.\nThe health secretary said \"we should actively be looking at\" making jabs mandatory for NHS staff, as they are for care workers.\nMr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would wear a face covering during Wednesday's Budget announcement in the Commons.\nBut he said now was not time to activate England's \"Plan B\", that would make face masks mandatory in many places.\nAre you an NHS professional or patient affected by the NHS backlog?

      "tags": "ScotRail,GMB,RMT,Glasgow,Strike action",
      "text": "Unions representing rail and council workers have confirmed plans for strike action during the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.\nCleaners, refuse and recycling workers are among staff who could take industrial action from 8 November.  \nScotRail could also be hit by strikes from 1 November after the RMT's AGM in Leeds rejected the latest pay offer. \nThe Scottish government has set a deadline of Wednesday for the rail union to accept its pay offer.\nMinisters also said ScotRail will now go ahead and implement the pay rise for members of three other trade unions which accepted its offer, as well as non-unionised ScotRail workers.  \nTransport Minister Graeme Dey said the government was \"utterly perplexed\" at the RMT position while the union hit back at the \"arbitrary\" Wednesday deadline.\nAbout 120 world leaders are expected to attend the crucial United Nations summit from 31 October to 12 November.\nA joint trade union group, including Unison, Unite and the GMB, is seeking a \u00a32,000 flat rate pay increase or 6%, whichever is greater, from Scotland's local authority umbrella body Cosla. \nIt has now notified councils that it will call on some school cleaners, caterers and janitors along with waste, recycling and maintenance staff to take \"targeted\" strike action during the second week of the summit. \nWendy Dunsmore, of Unite,  said: \"The incredible professionalism and sacrifice by local government workers has not been recognised during the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\nJohanna Baxter, of Unison, said more than half of local government workers earned under \u00a325,000 a year and many were at \"breaking point\".\nDrew Duffy, of the GMB union, added:  \"It's been over 18 months since any of these key workers had a pay rise and that is a disgrace given the work they have done over the last 18 months.\"\nCosla has offered an \u00a3850 flat rate rise for the lowest paid staff and 2% for those paid less than \u00a340,000 a year.\nA spokesman said: \"We appreciate everything that local government workers have been doing, and continue to do, to support people and communities during the pandemic and as we begin to recover. We continue with ongoing constructive negotiations.\"\nEarlier, the AGM of the RMT union confirmed plans for strike action by ScotRail staff from 1 to 12 November, almost the entire duration of the summit.\nThe union described the offer of a 2.5% increase this year, 2,2% in 2022 and a one-off \u00a3300 bonus for staff working during the summit as \"pitiful\".\nThree other rail unions, Unite, Aslef and the TSSA have already accepted the offer.\nTransport Minister Graeme Dey said: \"We remain utterly perplexed at the position the RMT leadership is taking here. While we think their action is misguided and does their members no favours, we, of course,  respect the right of trade unions to do what they think is appropriate for their membership.\n\"But we are clear that this is a fair and good offer that will put cash in the pockets of rail workers who have worked hard during the pandemic. This is evidenced by the fact that the three other rail unions (Aslef, Unite and TSSA) have accepted it.\n\"ScotRail, with the full support of the Scottish government, has tried a number of times to reach a deal with the RMT leadership - as of yesterday, the offer being made to its members consisted of a 4.7% pay increase over this and next year, a \u00a3300 payment for COP26, an additional payment equivalent to three hours salary for booking on for a Rest Day shift for the rest of the year.\n\"That last enhancement was offered just yesterday, and we understood that we were close to agreement with negotiators apparently happy with the offer, RMT leaders have then moved the goalposts.\"\nThe RMT said it had been given an \"arbitrary\" deadline to accept the pay offer by Wednesday, but said strikes on both ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper services could still be avoided. \nGeneral secretary Mike Lynch said: \"Our message to Nicola Sturgeon, Transport Scotland, Abellio and Serco is that there is still time to resolve the pay disputes but it requires some serious movement, the lifting of bogus deadlines and genuine talks.\"\nMeanwhile, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has invited Glasgow workers who plan on striking during COP26 to join her in a protest march through the city.\nShe said she would be taking part in the Climate Strike march from Kelvingrove Park to George Square.\nShe wrote on Twitter: \"On Friday Nov 5 I'll join the climate strike in Glasgow - during #COP26 Climate justice also means social justice and that we leave no one behind.\n\"So we invite everyone, especially the workers striking in Glasgow, to join us. See you there!\"\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "tags": "Methane,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The build-up of warming gases in the atmosphere rose to record levels in 2020 despite the pandemic, according to the World Meteorological Organization. \nThe amounts of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide rose by more than the annual average in the past 10 years. \nThe WMO says this will drive up temperatures in excess of the goals of the Paris agreement.\nThey worry that our warmer world is, in turn, boosting emissions from natural sources.\nThe news comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was \"touch and go\" whether the upcoming COP26 global climate conference will secure the agreements needed to help tackle climate change.\n\"It is going to be very, very tough this summit. I am very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it is touch and go, it is very, very difficult, but I think it can be done,\" he said on Monday.\nThe restrictions imposed around the world during the Covid pandemic saw an overall decline in emissions of CO2 of 5.6%.\nSo why hasn't that fall been echoed in atmospheric concentrations - which are the subject of this latest data from the WMO?\nThere are a number of factors involved.\nAround half of emissions from human activity are taken up by trees, lands and oceans. But the absorbing ability of these sinks can vary hugely, depending on temperatures, rainfall and other factors. \nAnother issue is that over the past decade, emissions of CO2 have increased progressively.\nSo even though carbon output was down last year, the increase in the level in the atmosphere was still bigger than the average between 2011-2020. \nAccording to the WMO's annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, CO2 reached 413.2 parts per million in the atmosphere in 2020 and is now 149% of the pre-industrial level. \nThis is bad news for containing the rise in Earth's temperature.\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\n\"At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, we will see a temperature increase by the end of this century far in excess of the Paris Agreement targets of 1.5 to 2C above pre-industrial levels,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof Petteri Taalas. \"We are way off track.\"\n\"This is more than just a chemical formula and figures on a graph. It has major negative repercussions for our daily lives and well-being, for the state of our planet and for the future of our children and grandchildren,\" said Prof Taalas.\nThe authors say the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when temperatures were 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than it is today.\nOne of the big concerns for researchers is that the ongoing rise in temperatures may actually cause a rise in warming gases from natural sources. \nScientists are concerned that this is already happening with methane. \nAlthough it has a shorter lifespan than CO2, methane is far more potent as a warming chemical.\nAround 60% of the CH4 that ends up in the atmosphere comes from human sources such as agriculture, fossil fuels, landfills and biomass burning. \nThe other 40% comes from the activities of microbes in natural sources such as wetlands.  \nLast year's rise was the biggest increase since global methane levels started rising again in 2007. \nThe majority of it was from natural sources. \n\"If you increase the amount of precipitation in the areas of the wetlands, and if you increase the temperature, then these methane producing bacteria, produce more methane,\" said Dr Oksana Tarasova from the WMO.\n\"So this will only increase in the future because the temperature is going to rise. It's a big concern,\" she told BBC News. \nScientists describe these vicious cycles as feedback loops. They are also being observed in the Amazon where researchers earlier this year reported that parts of the rainforest were now emitting more CO2 than they were absorbing. \n\"The higher the temperature, the less the precipitation, the more stress goes into the trees,\" said Dr Tarasova.\n\"So, trees have increased mortality, they stop taking up CO2. In addition to our own emissions, we will have emissions from our forests.\"\nThe WMO is also concerned about the rise in nitrous oxide, which comes from human activities such as the use of nitrogen fertiliser but also from natural sources.\nIt has also risen by more than the average over the last ten years. \nWith just days left before world leaders gather in Glasgow for COP26, the news on the level of warming gases in the atmosphere is stark. \n\"Greenhouse gas measurements are like skidding into a car crash. The disaster gets closer and closer but you can't stop it,\" said Prof Euan Nisbet from Royal Holloway, University of London. \n\"You can clearly see the crash ahead, and all you can do is howl.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Manchester,Manchester Arena attack inquiry",
      "text": "The decision not to question the Manchester Arena bomber after he returned to the UK from Libya four days before the attack was a mistake, a senior MI5 officer has conceded.\nThe officer, referred to as Witness J, told the Manchester Arena Inquiry Salman Abedi was assessed in the months before the 22 May 2017 bombing.\nHe said \"no intelligence\" indicating a threat to national security was found.\nBut he conceded it was an error not to ask police to question Abedi on 18 May.\nThe inquiry has begun looking at what was known about the 22-year-old before the attack, which saw 22 people die and hundreds more suffer injuries in a bombing at the venue on 22 May 2017.\nThe hearing was told that from December 2013 to January 2017, Abedi was identified as being in direct contact with three \"subjects of interest\", one who was suspected of planning travel to Syria, one who had links to al-Qaeda and a third who had links to extremists in Libya.\nBetween April 2016 and April 2017, he was identified as a second-level contact with three more \"subjects of interest\", all with suspected links to the Islamic State terror group.\nWitness J, appearing in court inside a bespoke wooden box and shielded from victims' families to maintain his anonymity, was asked by Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, if increased contact with \"a person of an extremist mindset\" would increase \"the concern [someone] might share their mindset?\"\nWitness J said it did not \"necessarily follow\" that having contact was \"a cumulative risk\".\n\"We have to make very fine judgments about whether someone meets the threshold of investigation,\" he said.\n\"A second-level contact is a contact of a contact. \n\"I'm not sure that... indicates a cumulative risk developing.\"\nThe inquiry was told Abedi had himself been made a \"subject of interest\" for five months, but his file was closed in July 2014, due to a \"lack of engagement\" with extremists.\nWitness J was asked about two prison visits by Abedi, the second of which was in January 2017.\nMr Greaney asked him if the visits, along with the other intelligence, should have led to Abedi being designated a \"subject of interest\" once again.\nWitness J said there was \"no intelligence to indicate that the contact was related to Abedi posing a threat to national security\". \n\"The decision to not open [an investigation] was a reasonable one,\" he added.\nThe hearing was also told that twice in the months prior to the attack, intelligence was received by MI5 about Abedi which was highly relevant to the planned attack but was assessed at the time to relate to non-terrorist criminality.\nAbedi's name also hit a \"priority indicator\" during a separate \"data-washing exercise\" as falling within a small number of former subjects of interest who merited further consideration.\nThe hearing was also told an assessment on 1 May 2017 had concluded Abedi should be considered for further investigation and a meeting to consider that conclusion was scheduled for 31 May.\nWitness J conceded it was a mistake not to ask police to stop and question Abedi on his return to the UK on 18 May.\nThe bomber immediately took a taxi to a store of explosives and set about making his final attack preparations.\nAsked by Mr Greaney if it had been a missed opportunity, Witness J said stopping him \"would have been the better course of action\".\nInquiry chairman Sir John Saunders said MI5 had known Abedi was in contact with terrorist suspects and his father had been involved in such activities in Libya, adding that he looked like an \"obvious candidate\" to be involved in terrorism himself.\nWitness J had earlier told the inquiry Abedi's extremist views were \"likely to have been influenced by his father Ramadan Abedi\".\nThe court has previously heard Ramadan Abedi has refused to help the inquiry and remains a suspect in the police investigation into the atrocity.\nSir John asked Witness J about why Salman Abedi had not been referred to the Prevent counter-extremism scheme when he was closed as a subject of interest in July 2014.\nThe witness said consideration of a Prevent referral was not \"policy\" at the time and that it was a \"reasonable\" decision not to refer Abedi.\nSir John said it was a government de-radicalisation scheme and \"MI5 didn't take advantage of it\".\nThe inquiry continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "UK National Minimum Wage,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "Workers on the minimum wage are set to get a pay boost from April, with the rate for those aged over 23 rising to \u00a39.50 an hour from \u00a38.91.\nThe rise means a full-time worker will get \u00a31,074 extra a year before tax.\nThe move will be announced at this week's Budget and follows the recommendation of independent advisers, the Low Pay Commission. \nThe government has faced pressure to help low-paid, younger workers, who are among the worst hit by the pandemic.\nThe 6.6% increase in the minimum pay rate for those aged over 23 - known as the National Living Wage - is more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living.\nMinimum pay rates for younger workers are also set to go up. \nThe National Minimum Wage for people aged 21-22 will rise from \u00a38.36 to \u00a39.18 an hour and the Apprentice Rate will increase from \u00a34.30 to \u00a34.81 an hour.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said the rise \"ensures we're making work pay and keeps us on track to meet our target to end low pay by the end of this Parliament\". \nBut Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, described it as an \"underwhelming offer\" that would be mostly swallowed up by tax rises, universal credit cuts and higher energy bills.\nHow much is the minimum wage?\nFinn Oldfield, 23, earns the National Living Wage for his communications job at the People's Powerhouse social enterprise.\nHe lives at home with his parents in Widnes, but said the increase would help him move to Liverpool city centre, which was unaffordable before the rise. \n\"It's hard if you're from a regional town. I have a politics and philosophy degree from Edinburgh University and thought I'd be able to find opportunities,\" Mr Oldfield told the BBC. \nAfter graduating last year in the middle of the pandemic, Mr Oldfield found his role through the government's Kickstart scheme, which encourages six-month jobs with businesses for people aged 16-24 who are currently claiming universal credit. \n\"With no rent control and higher energy prices, I think this will offset perhaps the harshest of the blows that have come,\" he said.\n\"But I think there's more that could be done by the government to help with rising everyday costs.\"\nCampaign group the Living Wage Foundation welcomed the increases, but said there was still \"a substantial gap\" between the government-mandated minimum wage and its own calculations of a real living wage based on living costs.\nThe foundation's director, Graham Griffiths, called on employers to \"commit to go beyond this new government minimum, do the right thing, and commit to pay a real living wage\".\nSalima Vellani, founder of restaurant chain Absurd Bird, says although higher wages will be \"tougher\" on the hospitality sector, increasing the minimum wage \"is the right move\".\n\"It is hard work, it's unsociable hours, so if people are leaving the industry in droves, then we have to attract them back,\" she said.\n\"That's not just about pay, it's about training.\"\nMs Vellani said agreeing with the minimum wage rise \"might be going against the grain, with all the labour issues we are facing\", but added her company had been pushing up wages generally to retain staff. \n\"You're going to have to pass some of this on to consumers, if your costs are going up,\" said the restaurant owner.\n\"It's going to be a challenge for a lot of operators who are facing extreme costs.\n\"If we what produce is good enough, people will keep buying from us.\"\nNye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the National Living Wage increase was \"very welcome\", but would \"not remotely compensate\" for the cut to universal credit.\nHe said the universal credit change affected 4.4 million families, whereas only 2.2 million workers were on the living wage.\nThe minimum wage that workers should get depends on their age and whether they are apprentices.\nEmployers often worry that a higher minimum wage will lead to more unemployment, and that they will be forced to lay off workers in order to afford the increases.\nBut independent experts maintain there has been little or no evidence of job losses as a result of rising minimum wage levels.\nGiving millions of workers a 6.6% pay rise sounds generous and will be a welcome boost to many pay packets.\nIt also follows the government's - and particularly the prime minister's - narrative of pushing towards a higher-wage economy.\nYet this would be no bumper pay day for low-income families.\nThey spend a higher proportion of income than others on heating and lighting their homes. Hefty gas and electricity bill rises, on top of recent increases this month, are inevitable in the spring. Prices in the shops are going up and many economists believe the increases could last longer than previously expected.\nFinally, a National Living Wage rise is not compensation for welfare cuts, such as a removal of the \u00a320-a-week universal credit uplift, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has consistently pointed out. \nNot all of those receiving benefits are in work, and for low-income employees who are, a rise in wages can mean a reduction in their benefits.\nMike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said wage increases needed to be matched by support for smaller firms.\nMeanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry called on the chancellor to use the Budget to help get more firms \"investing to lift UK productivity\".\n\"We all want to see a higher-wage economy, but the real challenge is how to do so sustainably,\" it said.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said that although a wage increase would be welcomed by staff, it was a \"further cost increase for pubs who are still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future\".\n\"It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,\" she added.\nTom Ironside, director of business and regulations at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers supported the objective of higher wages and had been working hard to secure productivity improvements, so that those pay increases would be sustainable.\n\"This is made more challenging when retailers are currently grappling with an assortment of other government-imposed costs - higher National Insurance contributions, rising business rates, higher corporation tax - at a time when sales are slowing and supply chains are experiencing significant disruption,\" he added.\nUK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said her industry was \"committed to good and fair pay for its highly-valued staff\" and called for further government support, including \"immediate root-and-branch reform of business rates\"."

      "tags": "Companies,Mobile phones,5G,Fraud",
      "text": "Major phone networks have agreed to automatically block almost all internet calls coming from abroad if they pretend to be from UK numbers, Ofcom has confirmed. \nCriminals have been using internet-based calling technology to make it look like a phone call or text is coming from a real telephone number. \nAlmost 45 million consumers were targeted by phone scams this summer.\nOfcom said it expected the measures to be introduced at pace as a \"priority\". \nSo far, only one operator - TalkTalk - has implemented the new plans. Other phone networks are still exploring methods of making it work. \n\"We've been working with telecoms companies to implement technical solutions, including blocking at source, suspicious international calls that are masked by a UK number,\"  said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's networks and communications group director.\n\"We expect these measures to be introduced as a priority, and at pace, to ensure customers are better protected.\" \nShe added tackling the phone scams issue was a \"complex problem\" that required a coordinated effort from the police, government, other regulators and industry.\nThe move follows months of discussions between Ofcom and the UK telecoms industry. \nInternet-based calling technology, also known as Voice Over Internet Protcol (VoIP), is used by millions of consumers globally to make phone calls free or cheaply every year.\nPopular services that use this technology include WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom and Microsoft Teams.\nThe Sunday Telegraph, which first reported the story, cited Whitehall sources that have cast doubt on Ofcom's plans.\nThey say blocking traffic from foreign VoIP providers will not work to stop scam texts and calls, because much of the UK still relies on old copper-based networks dating back to the 1970s.\nBut some experts the BBC spoke to disagree.\nApart from consumers, many businesses also use the VoIP technology for internal corporate phone networks. \nWhenever a corporate phone network makes a call, a VoIP provider hands over the call from the internet to the phone networks.\nGabriel Cirlig, of US cyber-security company Human, said telecoms companies were not inspecting the traffic they received from VoIP providers, they just let it through on to the network.\n\"Recently, because of the ease in implementing your own private-enterprise telephone system, everybody can have access to critical telephone infrastructure,\" Mr Cirlig said.\n\"Because of this lower barrier of entry, it is very easy for scammers to build their own systems to spoof mobile numbers - the cyber-criminals are essentially pretending to be legitimate corporate telephone networks in order to have access to legitimate telco infrastructure.\"\nHe adds that right now, it is up to the VoIP provider to check whether the calls it is handing over to telecoms networks are actually legitimate.\n\"This is not a regional problem or restricted to one type of infrastructure, this is a systemic issue that allows crime to cross any borders,\" said Mr Cirlig.\n\"This feature is enabling the VoIP business model so they don't want to stop it.\"\nMatthew Gribben, a former consultant to GCHQ, the UK government intelligence agency, agrees. He used to see many scams while monitoring networks for GCHQ.\n\"It's fundamentally the foreign VoIP providers that are technologically enabling these gangs to operate, so it will make a huge dent in this,\" he said. \"It doesn't fix everything but it's an excellent step in the right direction.\"\nExperts agree that the only way to completely fix the problem is to implement new telephone identification protocols that enable phone networks to authenticate that all calls and text messages actually come a real telephone number.\nThe new protocols, known as \"Stir and Shaken\" in a nod to James Bond, were developed by an international standards body, the US-based Internet Engineering Task Force.\nUS authorities have ordered mobile operators to implement the protocols by the end of 2021, but Ofcom told the BBC in August that introducing full authentication in the UK would only be possible when the  technology that supports voice services is upgraded, which is due to be completed by 2025.\nThe Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications said that it cannot impose Stir and Shaken on EU phone networks. \nIt is only able to ask mobile operators to block, on a case-by-case basis, access to numbers or services in case of fraud.\nHowever, it said it was now discussing whether to implement the protocols.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS,Intensive care,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Doctors and health service leaders are warning the NHS is on the edge of a crisis, staff are burnt-out and Covid cases are rising sharply - but, in England, the government says there is no reason to change tack.\nSo far, ministers have refused to budge from their Plan A to deal with Covid this winter - which is to offer booster jabs and get more young people, including 12-15 year olds, vaccinated.\nBut there is growing pressure to move to its stricter Plan B - which would put England on a similar path to Scotland and Wales, where face coverings are still compulsory on public transport and in shops. People could also be advised to work from home and Covid passports introduced for entry to large events.\nThese are seen by some as relatively small changes to most people's lives and a very long way from the strict restrictions of earlier in the pandemic. And for some on the frontline, taking those actions now could make a huge difference in the long run.\nProf Charlotte Summers, who works in intensive care, told the BBC that the situation was \"incredibly serious\", with one in five ICU beds in UK hospitals occupied by someone with Covid-19.\nShe said doctors were treating more patients ill with Covid, who tended to stay longer in ICU, as well as more people with non-Covid emergencies, and this was reducing their ability to catch up on the massive backlog of elective surgery.\nControlling the numbers of Covid patients in intensive care would make a \"significant difference\", she said, adding that there was also the workforce to consider.\n\"Staff have left intensive care units so we have fewer than we had at the start of the pandemic,\" Prof Summers said. \"So, providing services with exhausted staff, fewer staff and more patients is incredibly challenging.\"\nAccording to the Intensive Care Society, there are 823 patients with Covid in beds which can provide mechanical ventilation, out of a total of roughly 4,000 adult intensive care beds across the UK. That's way down on the winter peak, when extra wards and hospitals were built to care for the most seriously ill.\nThe majority in intensive care are not vaccinated, Prof Summers said - although precise figures on vaccination status have not been published.\nThe vaccination programme is working and has weakened the link between the numbers of people infected with the virus and the numbers ending up seriously ill in hospital and dying.\nEven as UK cases rise above 45,000 a day, hospital admissions and deaths have stayed relatively flat over the last few months - and it's not clear yet whether slight rises in the last few days are part of a long-term trend.\nProf Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said what happens next was \"difficult to predict\" and cases could peak this month and start to fall again.\nIt's acknowledged that the NHS in England is clearly extremely busy, but the 6,000 Covid patients in hospital in England equates to 7% of all hospital beds. And there were more Covid patients in hospitals at the start of September 2021.\nSo the focus is to get more people vaccinated quickly - by speeding up access to booster vaccines for the over-50s, and jabs for young teens in vaccination centres and schools, as well as targeting the five million people who've so far refused a vaccine.\nMore than four million people out of 30 million who are eligible have now had a booster jab in England, but across the UK as a whole, 14% of people aged over 12 are still unvaccinated.\nThe drive to get more people vaccinated is backed up by official government figures, which show that in every age group, the rate of hospital admissions is much higher among unvaccinated people than those who are fully vaccinated. \nIt's a plan that is also backed by a number of senior scientists.\nProf Andrew Pollard, head of Oxford University's vaccine group, who helped develop their Covid vaccine, said the real issue was protecting people who had not had any vaccine doses and those with weakened immune systems, who were ending up in intensive care.\nOn the whole, he said people with Covid in hospital were staying for a shorter period of time than before, and were more likely to be frail and elderly. \nBecause the virus was spreading in the community among vaccinated people, there would be \"an inevitable feed-through\" into hospitals where people could be admitted for other reasons but then test positive, he added.\n\"Both vaccines are holding up well against severe disease,\" Prof Pollard said, adding that transmission among young adults \"will extend immunity even further\".\nThere's no magic number or set of figures that would mean moving from the current Plan A.\nThis week Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the vaccination programme remains its first line of defence, and there were no current plans to bring in Plan B \"at this point\".\nBut the government also says it will keep a close watch on the number of Covid patients in hospital, any sudden changes in trends and the overall state of the NHS.\nAs the British Medical Association and NHS leaders have their say on the matter, the pressure to change course is ramping up.\n\"Being pre-emptive now would mean there is less likelihood of ending up in a further lockdown,\" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London, who described Plan B as only three simple steps to protect others.\nHowever, it's not known how effective compulsory mask-wearing would be in reducing cases. \nRestrictions in the rest of the UK already reflect many of these Plan B measures, but cases in Scotland and Wales are still edging up.\nDeciding what steps to take as winter approaches will involve considerations over the economy, over jobs and over schools - not just public health."

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nIn an effort to help clear the huge - and record - backlog of people waiting for non-urgent tests and procedures, the government's announcing more money for the NHS in England. The extra \u00a35.9bn included in Wednesday's Budget will fund more beds, equipment, new \"surgical hubs\" and also cover the costs of improving IT. According to Chancellor Rishi Sunak the money's \"game-changing\", and although welcomed by health bodies, they say staff shortages need to be fixed. Health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive a proportionate amount of extra cash.\nDescribing it as \"sickening\" that protesters are spreading \"dangerous misinformation\" about vaccination, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is calling for councils to be able to use exclusion orders to stop anti-vaccination demonstrations taking place outside school gates. He urged the government to update the law and his suggestion comes as ministers also expressed concern about such demonstrations.\nThe Beijing marathon, one of China's biggest local sporting events, has been postponed until further notice amid a surge in coronavirus infections. Around 30,000 people were expected to take part on 31 October but the country's top health official warned a fresh outbreak is expected to spread further. Those cases are linked to the highly transmissible Delta variant.\nThe COP26 climate summit is a week away and ahead of world leaders gathering for the conference in Glasgow, Scotland's health secretary is warning there is \"absolutely a risk\" of Covid cases rising. Humza Yousaf says he expects to see a spike in cases after 25,000 delegates descend on the city but procedures are in place to mitigate transmission.\nA man, who realised his addiction to video games was out of control when he considered ending his life, says coronavirus lockdowns have been difficult for people like him. Cam Adair, 32, founded Game Quitters for people struggling with gaming addiction and says while he was able to stay away from a relapse during Covid, many of those in the online support group didn't.

      "tags": "Rachel Reeves,Rishi Sunak,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Labour is calling on the government to bring in its Plan B measures to tackle Covid in England, including advice to work from home and compulsory masks. \nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves also told the BBC the vaccine programme was \"stalling\" and needed to work better. \nBut Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the data did not currently suggest \"immediately moving to Plan B\". \nThe measures, which aim to protect the NHS from \"unsustainable pressure\", also includes mandatory Covid passports. \nPlan A, which is currently in place, involves offering booster jabs to the most vulnerable, a single dose to healthy 12 to 15-year-olds and encouraging unvaccinated people to get jabbed. \nThe NHS Confederation and the British Medical Association are among the groups who have called for some restrictions to be reintroduced in England, amid rising cases. \nMeanwhile in Wales, ministers are to consider whether to extend the use of Covid passes for a wider range of venues.\nMs Reeves told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: \"I think the first thing is the government have got to do more to make Plan A work.\n\"If the scientists are saying work from home and masks, we should do that. So get A working better because the vaccination programme has been stalling, and introduce those parts of Plan B.\n\"But there are also things not in A or B that need to be done, like paying statutory sick pay from day one and also better ventilation in public spaces.\"\nAsked whether Plan B should be introduced now, she said: \"Yes, but let's not let the government off the hook with Plan A either.\"\nA Conservative Party spokesman said it was the third time Labour had changed its position on Plan B in four days.\nAppearing on the same programme, Mr Sunak was also asked whether it was time to bring in the government's back-up plan. \n\"We're monitoring everything, but at the moment the data does not suggest that we should be immediately moving to Plan B, but of course we will keep an eye on that and the plans are ready,\" he said. \nThe chancellor also said reintroducing the furlough scheme was \"not on the cards because we don't envisage having to impose significant economic restrictions in the way that we had to over the last year\". \nHe added that the vaccine rollout was the \"first line of defence\" and the booster campaign was the best way to protect people through the winter. \nMore than 325,000 booster jabs were given in England on Saturday - the biggest daily figure for boosters yet, NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard tweeted.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the vaccination programme by itself was not enough \"to bring things under control\". \n\"We do need to have people using lateral flow tests, avoiding contact with large numbers of people in enclosed spaces, using masks, all of those things now need to happen if we're going to stop this rise and get things under control soon enough to stop a real meltdown in the middle of the winter,\" he told Sky News' Trevor Phillips On Sunday.\nAsked if the government should move to Plan B now, he said: \"Well, some kind of Plan B.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats said it looked \"increasingly likely\" Covid restrictions would have to be reintroduced because of the \"government's bungling and inaction\".\nDr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the programme emergency departments were \"already struggling to cope\", with large queues of ambulances waiting outside hospitals. \nby Jim Reed, BBC health reporter\nOne in 55 people in England had Covid last week, according to the latest ONS figures, the highest rate since the end of January.\nDemands for compulsory mask wearing, vaccine passports and more working from home have been growing - backed by many doctors and people representing NHS trusts.\nLabour's position has not been altogether clear on this. \nWhen asked by Andrew Marr whether Plan B should be introduced \"now\", shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves agreed. But she also suggested the priority should be accelerating the rollout of booster vaccines to the over-50s and first jabs to teenagers.\nOn the same programme, Chancellor Rishi Sunak repeatedly ruled out reimposing stricter measures \"immediately\" - perhaps suggesting a slight change of tone from senior ministers.\nThe key measure to watch for is pressure on hospitals.\nAs things stand, there are currently 6,405 people being treated for Covid on wards in England. The number has been rising but is still no higher than it was in mid-September - and well below the 34,000 seen in January.\nIn minutes of a meeting of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on 14 October, which were published on Friday, the scientists said restrictions should be prepared for \"rapid deployment\" and that acting earlier could reduce the need for stricter measures over a longer time period. \nThey said that out of the government's back-up measures, advising people to work from home was likely to have the most impact on the spread of Covid. \nStricter rules are already in place in other parts of the UK, with masks compulsory in some settings in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nOn Sunday, the UK reported 39,962 new cases - the first time in 12 days that cases have dropped below 40,000.\nThere were also another 72 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test.\nIn other developments: "

      "text": "Recycling plastic materials \"doesn't work\" and \"is not the answer\" to threats to global oceans and marine wildlife, Boris Johnson has said.\nAnswering children's questions ahead of the COP26 climate change summit, the prime minister said reusing plastics \"doesn't begin to address the problem\".\nInstead, he said, \"we've all got to cut down our use of plastic\".\nThe Recycling Association said the PM had \"completely lost the plastic plot\".\nThe association's Simon Ellin told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme Mr Johnson's comments were \"very disappointing\" and seemed to conflict with government policy.\nBut some anti-plastic campaigners praised the prime minister's stance and urged him to follow it up with measures to dramatically reduce plastic at source.\nSian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet, said: \"Less than 10% [of plastic] is actually recycled in the UK. Despite being touted by industry as a solution to the problem, all it has done is justify overproduction and created an industrial addiction to this indestructible, toxic material.\"\nDuring the special event organised by Downing Street, Mr Johnson told an audience of eight to 12-year-olds that rather than relying on recycling, people should reduce their consumption of plastic products.\nTanya Steele, chief executive of the World Wide Fund for Nature, told the event: \"We have to reduce, we have to reuse - I do think we need to do a little bit of recycling, PM, and have some system to do so.\"\nBut the PM said it was a \"mistake\" to think society can recycle its way out of the problem, and added: \"It doesn't work.\"\nAsked later about Mr Johnson's comments, his official spokesman said the PM continued to encourage recycling - though he said relying on it alone would be a \"red herring\".\nThe prime minister's words might have been careless, but they have an element of truth.\nPolls consistently show many people feel they're doing their bit to protect the climate if they gather up plastic bottles and take the car up to the recycling point on a Saturday.\nBut in truth, recycling is a bit of a soft option. It's far less important than many other actions to curb emissions, such as stopping flying, or buying an electric car, or giving up meat. But these actions are harder to do.\nAnd as the PM said, there's a limit to how many times plastic can be recycled.\nBut having said that, it's far better to recycle a plastic bottle than to throw it away.\nBecause recycling plastic isn't just helping a little to rein in climate change, it's also keeping waste out of the oceans, conserving energy and saving some of the earth's precious resources.\nThere are plans to increase recycling in England, which the government has said \"typically results in lower carbon emissions in comparison to manufacturing products from virgin materials\".\n\"Priority goes to preventing the creation of waste in the first place, followed by preparing waste for reuse; to recycling, and then recovery,\" the waste management plan for England said.\nThe most recent figures for England showed a recycling rate of 45.5% for household waste. Waste policy is largely set by the devolved administrations in the UK.\nEach UK council collects its plastic recycling differently. A BBC analysis in 2018 showed there were 39 different sets of rules for what can be put in plastic recycling collections.\nMeanwhile, with just days to go before COP26 begins in Glasgow next week, the PM said it was \"touch and go\" whether the summit would deliver progress.\nMillions of lives could be affected by any changes agreed at the conference - and we have devised a quiz for you to discover which policies would have the most impact.\nBy Esme Stallard, BBC Reality Check\nThe prime minister criticised drinks giant Coca-Cola for being among 12 big corporations \"that are producing the overwhelming bulk of the world's plastics\".\nThe company sells more than 100 billion throwaway plastic bottles each year, causing problems in countries too small to effectively recycle them, BBC Panorama has found.\nCoca-Cola said it was making \"steady progress\" in efforts to cut waste and all its smaller bottles in Great Britain were made from 100% recycled plastic.\nDuring the event, Mr Johnson also signalled the government does not want to support new coal mines, as ministers face pressure to prevent a site opening in Cumbria.\nAnd he jokingly suggested feeding human beings to animals to \"bring nature back\".\nMs Steele told the audience: \"97% of the mass of mammals on this planet is humans and our animals, our domestic animals. Just 3% is left for the wild.\"\nIn response, Mr Johnson said it was \"so sad\", and quipped: \"We could feed some of the human beings to the animals.\"\nMs Steele replied: \"We could have a vote later and ask if there's any candidates.\"\nHow many tonnes of CO2 per year each action would save for an average person, according to research by the University of Leeds:\nSource: Environmental Research Letters\nViewers in the UK can watch the full story on Panorama: Coca-Cola's 100 Billion Bottle Problem on BBC One at 19:35 BST. It will also be available on BBC iPlayer."

      "text": "A teenager with a passion for cleaning has turned his love of car washing into a successful business with a celebrity client list.\nZykiah, 15, got into car valeting when his family bought him a kit for Christmas after he was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). \nHis clients include influencer Molly-Mae Hague and pundit Gary Neville.\nHe said he started on family cars, but \"I realised it was something I really loved doing\" and it grew from there. \nOCD is a common mental health condition which causes obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours.\nIt can affect all ages, but it usually starts during early adulthood, and can be distressing and significantly interfere with people's lives, though treatment can help keep it under control.\nZykiah told BBC Breakfast that he first started by cleaning the cars of family and friends at the weekend before asking if he could clean neighbours' cars.\nHours after his mother posted in a local residents' group about her son's love of car cleaning, a queue of cars had formed outside the family home. \n\"I realised it was something I really loved doing,\" he said.\n\"I thought I would start a business and I thought it would just be family and friends' cars at the weekends.\n\"It was mad. I got one famous car and it went from there.\" \nHe added that he had found car cleaning therapeutic after setting up the business two years ago.  \nIf you're affected by the issues in this piece, you can find support from BBC Action Line.\nHis client list now also includes boxer Tommy Fury and Manchester United footballer Scott McTominay, who Zykiah said was \"a top lad\". \nJo said Zykiah had been \"constantly cleaning\" from a young age.\n\"I would buy him Hoovers, little cleaning kits when he was six, seven, eight,\" she said. \n\"At 13, he got diagnosed with OCD and I said... he is going to turn it into something positive and that's what he has done.\"\nA spokesman for OCD Action said: \"We are pleased that Zykiah found his diagnosis of OCD to be a catalyst to starting a successful business. \n\"However, we know that for the majority of people who live with OCD, it is a debilitating condition which can cause huge distress. It is also important to know that OCD can get better with the right treatment and support, and we would encourage anybody who is struggling to seek this.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

I think he would have gone ahead with the flight anyway.\"\nOn Friday, Martin Goudie QC, prosecuting, asked Mr Henderson whether he thought Mr McKay and Sala had a right to know if the pilot was qualified.\nMr Goudie accused Mr Henderson of running a \"cowboy outfit\" after he admitted not keeping basic information on the pilots he employed.\nThe defendant is said to have been the plane's operator because he was in charge of its maintenance and hiring out for the aircraft's owner, Fay Keely.\nHe has already pleaded guilty to another charge of attempting to discharge a passenger without valid permission or authorisation.\nThe trial continues."

But that's for ministers.\"\nDr Atherton accepted people were \"really tired\" of the pandemic, but added: \"We're all sick to the back teeth of coronavirus let's be honest, so that's probably a factor, but you know the reality is that, you know, being tired is better than being dead.\"\nCompulsory NHS Covid passes were introduced this month for people to legally attend big events or nightclubs in Wales.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said the Welsh government would be \"thinking about\" extending to other venues, such as cafes, bars and restaurants, because they were \"hugely\" concerned about the high levels of Covid.\nDr Atherton said the move \"may have some marginal benefits\" but added the public could help the situation.\nDr Richard Pugh, intensive care consultant at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, and chairman of the Welsh Intensive Care Society, agreed people needed reminding the pandemic has not gone away.\n\"It certainly hasn't from a hospital perspective, from a critical care perspective, it's not gone away at all,\" he said.\n\"It feels relentless at the moment - the stress on our healthcare system and heading into what inevitably is going be a very difficult winter ahead of us.\n\"This is going to have an impact on all of us, and not necessarily strictly related to Covid, this will have implications for access to healthcare across the system.\"\nCovid passes show people have either tested negative on a lateral flow test, are fully vaccinated against Covid or have had confirmation of a positive test within the last six months which has been followed by the appropriate period of isolation. They are currently compulsory for over-18s to enter:\nPHW has started publishing data on the rollout of the vaccine booster programme, with 61% of NHS staff and 58.1% of care home workers having received a third jab.\nThe health minister said the booster rollout was \"going according to schedule but we are seeing if there's anything we can do to increase the pace on that\".\nThe BBC took to the streets of Rhyl to ask people what they thought about whether people were following the rules.\nLinda Hodges, from St Helen's, Merseyside, said: \"There's hardly anyone wearing masks now. They don't mind crowds and standing together.\"\nHolly McDonald, from Tamworth, said: \"It does look as though there's more people wearing masks from what we've seen here, it's quite poor in England at the moment.\"\nAngela McDonald, also from Tamworth, added: \"I think if people did the basics, sanitising and wearing masks, keeping a distance, then we'd be in the best position to have a normal-ish Christmas, but at the minute it's on a bit of a slippery slope.\"\nKathleen Winter, from Crewe, said: \"You can go in a shop and they've got no mask on, nothing, touching. \n\"And I just stand aside and they look at me like I'm weird. I've got my hand sanitiser, the lot, it's not worth it is it?\"\nIan Moncrieff, from Liverpool, said: \"A few weeks ago I went to a concert in Liverpool and it was really packed and a single sneeze can go everywhere, so I do think the restrictions need tightening.\n\"For outdoor events maybe not so much, but definitely indoor events.\n\"I've got vulnerable children, so I do hand washing and I do wear masks when I take them to hospital.\""

That compares to 74 referrals in 2016, which led to 10 investigations.\nBetween April 2018 and March 2021, 66 police officers and members of staff have faced disciplinary proceedings. Misconduct was proven in 63 cases.\nOf the 52 who faced the more serious charge of gross misconduct, 38 are no longer serving and barred from policing for life - six were later convicted of criminal offences.\nNot all APSP allegations will be covered by these figures as many incidents will be investigated by the police forces themselves.\nIOPC deputy director general Claire Bassett described these cases as an \"appalling abuse of the public's trust\", which has a \"devastating impact on the people involved, who are often in a vulnerable situation\".\nShe said: \"The police are there to help them, not exploit them.\n\"Recent events we have seen, including the horrific actions of Wayne Couzens, remind us that policing must act to root out this kind of behaviour once and for all.\"\nIn 2017 legislation was introduced setting out the criteria in which mandatory referrals to the watchdog should be made, including an explicit reference to APSP, which has led to the steep rise in the number of cases being reported, the IOPC said.\nAPSP is the \"single largest form of police corruption\" the watchdog explained, accounting for around a quarter of all referrals and almost 60% of investigations last year. \nChief Constable Lauren Poultney from the National Police Chiefs' Council said: \"There is no place in policing for those who abuse their position for a sexual purpose.\"\n\"Any case of such abuse is one too many, it is a serious betrayal of what policing stands for and its duty to protect the public.\"\nSeparate figures obtained after a Freedom of Information Request by BBC Newsnight show the number of complaints made about police officers accused of sexual misconduct across the UK.\nOf the 44 out of 46 UK forces who responded, 2,702 police officers have been accused of sexual misconduct in the last five years.\nDisciplinary action taken from these allegations ended with three per cent of cases in criminal court, eight per cent with an officer dismissed and a further eight per cent issued with a reprimand.\nNewsnight spoke to a victim of domestic violence who was exploited by a serving officer.\nJessica (not her real name) reported she had been blackmailed about sexually explicit images of her being posted on the internet.\nAn officer she believed to be investigating repeatedly asked her for the explicit videos and images and sent explicit images of himself in return - including while in uniform.\nHe had previously contacted another woman in a similar way and received training about forming inappropriate relationships.\nThe officer was dismissed after a police misconduct hearing and barred for five years.\nCaroline Nokes MP, chairwoman of the women and equalities committee, told Newsnight officers who exploit vulnerable people should be \"barred forever\".\n\"It shouldn't be the case that they can serve a five-year bar and come back. That simply isn't protecting the vulnerable,\" the Conservative MP added."

      "text": "A coup is under way in Sudan, where the military has dissolved civilian rule, arrested political leaders and declared a state of emergency.\nThe coup leader, Gen Abdel Fattah Burhan, blamed political infighting. \nProtests have erupted in several cities including the capital Khartoum. Three people are said to have died after being shot by the armed forces.\nMilitary and civilian leaders have been at odds since long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir was overthrown two years ago.\nLarge numbers of protesters are on the streets of the capital demanding the return of civilian rule, BBC Arabic's Mohamed Osman reports from Khartoum. \nMore protesters are expected to join the crowds after calls for action by political parties and professional unions, our correspondent says. Doctors have refused to work at hospitals and institutions under military rule, except in emergencies, he adds.\nOne demonstrator, Sawsan Bashir, told AFP news agency: \"We will not leave the streets until the civilian government is back and the transition is back.\"\n\"We are ready to give our lives for the democratic transition in Sudan,\" fellow protester Haitham Mohamed said. \nArmy and paramilitary troops have been deployed across Khartoum, the city's airport is closed and international flights are suspended. The internet is also down.\nAt least three people have been killed and 80 have been injured, the Sudan Central Doctor's Committee wrote on its Facebook page. Those who died had been shot by soldiers, it said.\nVideo footage from Khartoum on Monday showed large groups in the streets, including many women. Barricades of burning tyres can be seen, with plumes of black smoke rising in various parts of the city.\n\"There is tension and also violence because people tried to go to the army headquarters\u2026 they were met with gunshots\", human rights defender Duaa Tariq told the BBC. She added there was fear and confusion in the streets, but also solidarity between the protesters.\nWorld leaders have reacted with alarm to the military's move.\nPrime Minister Abdallah Hamdok and his wife are among those reported to have been detained and put under house arrest, along with members of his cabinet and other civilian leaders. Their whereabouts are unknown.\nThey are part of a transitional government designed to steer Sudan towards democracy after the rule of former president, Omar al-Bashir.\nMr Hamdok was reportedly being pressed to support the coup but was refusing to do so, and instead he urged people to continue with peaceful protests to \"defend the revolution\".\nGen Burhan had been leading the power-sharing arrangement between military and civilian leaders, known as the Sovereign Council.\nIn a televised address, he said infighting between politicians, ambition and incitement to violence had forced him to act to protect the safety of the nation and to \"rectify the revolution's course\".\nHe said Sudan was still committed to \"international accords\" and the transition to civilian rule, with elections planned for July 2023.\nBut a senior official from the prime minister's office, Adam Elhiraika, told the BBC the coup could lead Sudan back into a civil war, adding the risk was \"extremely high\".\nAlthough Sudan remains in a deep economic crisis, it had been receiving more international support. A military takeover will put that at risk.\nThe UK's special envoy for Sudan and South Sudan, Robert Fairweather, tweeted that military arrests of civilian leaders were \"a betrayal of the revolution, the transition and the Sudanese people\".\nThe African Union, of which Sudan is a member, said it had learned with \"deep dismay\" of the situation, and called for the \"strict respect of human rights\".\nThe US, EU, UN and Arab League have also expressed deep concern.\nThe military and civilian transitional authorities have ruled together since 2019, when President Bashir was toppled after months of street protests.\nThe power-sharing deal between the military and a loose coalition of groups - the Forces for Freedom and Change - saw the launch of the Sovereign Council.\nIt was scheduled to rule the country for another year - with the aim of holding elections and transitioning to civilian rule.\nBut the deal was always fractious, with a large number of rival political groups - and divisions within the military too.\nTensions grew further after a coup attempt attributed to followers of Mr Bashir was foiled in September.\nSudan has been unable to find a workable political system since independence in 1956 and has seen numerous coups and coup attempts.\nRecent weeks have seen a rapid build-up of tension in Khartoum. A hostile takeover of power is what many in Sudan and beyond have feared could happen anytime. The signs have been all too clear.\nA pro-military sit-in right in front of the presidential palace in Khartoum was seen as choreographed to lead to a coup. No attempt was made to disguise its purpose. The protesters demanded that the military overthrow \"failed\" civilian leaders. It was an unusual attempt at legitimising a military takeover, using the guise of a popular protest.\nNearly a week later, a counter-protest was held. This time, huge crowds came out in support of the civilian government. \nWith more protests called by pro-democracy groups to \"counter a military coup\", Sudan could be set for yet another period of showdown between the armed forces and the people.\nThe country has made huge strides in normalising ties with the West and unlocking much-needed funding streams. The promise of transition to democracy has kept many Sudanese and the country's allies hopeful. But all that could be at risk now. "

      "text": "Friends stars including Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox and Matt LeBlanc have paid tribute to James Michael Tyler, who starred as Gunther in the sitcom, after he died at the age of 59.\nTyler was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in 2018.\nAniston said the show \"would not have been the same\" without Tyler's performance as the Central Perk waiter.\n\"Thank you for the laughter you brought to the show and to all of our lives. You will be so missed,\" she said.\nTyler's much-loved character worked in the show's coffee house and had a crush on Aniston's character Rachel, who also worked there as a waitress in the show's early seasons.\nShe shared an Instagram post which included a photo of Tyler from the set and a clip of the pair in the final episode as Gunther declared his love for the departing Rachel, who turned him down gently.\nCo-star Cox, who played Monica, added her own tribute. \"The size of gratitude you brought into the room and showed every day on set is the size of the gratitude I hold for having known you,\" she wrote.\n\"Rest In peace, James.\"\nLisa Kudrow, who played Phoebe on the show, offered: \"James Michael Tyler, we will miss you.\" Referencing a line from the show's there tune, she added: \"Thank you for being there for us all.\"\nLeBlanc, meanwhile, shared a photo of his character Joey chatting to Gunther in Central Perk.\n\"We had a lot of laughs buddy,\" LeBlanc posted. \"You will be missed. RIP my friend.\"\nDavid Schwimmer, aka Ross, thanked Tyler \"for playing such a wonderful, unforgettable role\" and \"for being such a big hearted gentleman and all around mensch off screen\".\n\"You will be missed, buddy,\" he went on.\nTyler appeared in almost 150 episodes of the comedy, which ran from 1994 to 2004. Gunther was and remains a hugely popular character among fans.\nTyler's manager said the actor \"passed away peacefully at his home in Los Angeles on Sunday morning\".\nA statement added: \"The world knew him as Gunther (the seventh Friend)... but Michael's loved ones knew him as an actor, musician, cancer-awareness advocate, and loving husband. If you met him once you made a friend for life.\n\"Wanting to help as many people as possible, he bravely shared his story and became a campaigner for those with a prostate to get a... blood test as early as 40-years-old.\"\nDavid Crane, who co-created Friends, told the BBC that Tyler started as an extra on the show and was given the role because he could work the coffee machine.\n\"As time went on, I think we realised he's funny - a really good actor,\" Crane said.\n\"We just kept giving him more and more, and when we realised there was a storyline about his secret love for Rachel, it was just the gift that kept on giving.\"\nOn Tyler's comedic timing, Crane added: \"His delivery was impeccable, he was so good that we found ourselves going to him for the punchline for a whole scene or for a whole episode.\n\"With just the littlest opportunity he created this indelible character.\"\nIn May, Tyler made a brief appearance on the Friends reunion special via Zoom. \n\"It was the most memorable 10 years of my life, honestly,\" the actor said at the time.\n\"I could not have imagined just a better experience. All these guys were fantastic and just a joy to work with. It felt very, very special.\"\nWarner Bros Television, one of the co-producers of the sitcom, said Tyler was \"a beloved actor and integral part of our Friends family\".\nHe continued to perform in recent years while undergoing treatment for cancer.\nHe also starred in two short films - The Gesture and the Word, and Processing - winning best actor awards at film festivals. \nIn 2021, his spoken word performance of Stephen Kalinich's poem If You Knew was adapted into a short video to raise awareness for the Prostate Cancer Foundation.\nTyler is survived by his wife Jennifer Carno, whom his manager described as \"the love of his life\"."

      "text": "Almost \u00a32bn will be invested by the government into building new homes on derelict or unused land in England, the chancellor is expected to announce in Wednesday's Budget.\nThe government said 160,000 greener homes could be built on brownfield land the size of 2,000 football pitches.\nIt also pledged to invest \u00a39m towards 100 urban \"pocket parks\" across the UK.\nHowever, concerns have been raised that not enough affordable homes are being built.\nNigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal and General, told the BBC's Today programme the \u00a31.8bn investment was the \"right direction of travel\", but was \"not enough scale right now\".\nHe warned people living in smaller cities and towns were being \"left behind\" due to not enough homes being constructed.\n\"You shouldn't have to be rich to be green,\" he said. \"It's very difficult for poorer people to get on the green (housing) ladder.\n\"There's a lot of active listening going on (by the government), but we don't just want CGI housing - we want real housing built across the UK.\"\nThe government said the funding was part of its efforts to meet the UK's net zero target by 2050.\nIt hopes the plans will help regenerate parts of England and support 50,000 new jobs.\nThe proposals also include creating so-called \"pocket parks\" - measuring the size of a tennis court - to create more green spaces.\nMore than 2.5 million people across the UK currently live further than a 10 minute walk from their closest green space.\nTim Farron, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for housing, said people buying new homes would be \"forced to fork out thousands to upgrade their homes in the future to cut their bills and reduce emissions\".\n\"In his Budget, the chancellor should bring forward new standards for greener homes to ensure all new homes are cheap to heat and produce minimal emissions,\" he said. \nZoe Nicholson, Green Party leader of Lewes District Council, said building on brownfield sites made sense, but added the government's investment was an \"absurdly small amount of money\".\n\"It would be more effective if they handed this \u00a32bn of funding to local authorities, which would allow them to build net zero council homes,\" she said,. \n\"This announcement seems to be little more than a gimmick intended to distract us from the fact that their agenda is to simply 'build, build, build' on our countryside to the benefit of greedy developers.\"\nThe Labour Party has not responded to requests for comment.\nAs well as funding for new housing developments, the chancellor is expected to confirm \u00a365m to develop new software to help with the digitisation of the town planning system.\nThe first phase will see the system rolled out to up to 175 local authorities in England."

      "tags": "Spending reviews,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday. Here are five things to look out for.\nThe forecasts will reflect an economy that has rebounded faster than the 4% predicted for this year at the last Budget in March. That means significantly lower borrowing. \nThe forecast peak for unemployment will again be further lowered, reflecting the success of the furlough scheme. \nHowever, much of this is already old news, and some of those who predicted a \"boom\" are now scaling back their estimates. \nWhat matters now is the immediate implications for the economy of supply chain problems, worker shortages, rising prices and interest rates. The chancellor's speech, along with accompanying forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, should have some pointers.\nAn immediate test of the Downing Street rhetoric on wage rises will take place with the announcements on public sector pay, largely frozen last year, and the National Living Wage (NLW). \nThe NLW is earmarked for a 5% rise to \u00a39.42 an hour from April, as part of a pathway to \u00a310 an hour by 2024, which could be brought forward by a year. \nBut could that, in fact, widen what has been significant wage rises in shortage sectors, such as haulage, to a more general and therefore inflationary economy-wide phenomenon?\nRishi Sunak has had a year-and-a-half as a high spending emergency chancellor, racking up debts for a once-in-a-century crisis, expanding the state, and taking taxes to post war highs. \nThis will be his chance to re-establish his fiscally conservative free market credentials. His method for doing so will be a set of new fiscal rules to bring both annual borrowing under control and the debt down. \nThese rules have been routinely broken by previous chancellors. But how strictly he decides to set these restraints on his power to borrow, will determine room for manoeuvre for extra spending and possible tax cuts.\nThe chancellor will tout this as the first full multi-year post austerity spending review. Spending will rise more than one of the Gordon Brown Spending Reviews. But two-thirds of the funding decisions - for health, schools, defence and aid, are already baked in the cake. \nWhat remains, are important areas of spending, such as courts, prisons, and, crucially, local Government, which are on course for another two-year spending squeeze, before spending goes up. \nEven more importantly, little cash has been so far allocated for permanent post pandemic legacy spending in health, care, and schools. If that happens, the immediate squeeze elsewhere will be even tighter. This will have consequences for services, and potentially council tax bills.\nLocal council spending cuts will be difficult to reconcile with promises made to regions outside the big cities. But this spending review really is show time for Downing Street to reveal the substance behind their promise to \"level up\" Britain. \nThe phrase originated in promises to equalise per-pupil spending across England. Transport spending is hugely skewed in the UK - with regions such as the North East of England missing out. Will this Spending Review fundamentally change that pattern, even if it would never seek to equalise such spending with, say, London? \nThe answer to that question will start to be seen in the capital funding allocations in the review. \nLikewise, net zero: Tens of billions of investment will be required to rewire the economy away from burning carbon. Most of that will come from the private sector, but a huge amount will need to come from the public sector too. \nAgain just how ambitious and serious the government is here will be seen in black and white in the numbers allocated in the review."

      "tags": "Budget 2021",
      "text": "The Treasury has released a deluge of funding announcements, days before the chancellor delivers his Budget on 27 October. \nStatements from the government setting out spending for transport, health and education have been put out in the past few days.\nCommons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is furious, telling MPs on Monday it was \"not acceptable\" to brief the media ahead of MPs and on Tuesday that the government was behaving in a \"discourteous manner\".\nHe thundered that ministers used to \"walk\" if they briefed about a Budget.\nIndeed, in 1947, then-Chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after he leaked details of his budget to a journalist.\nDefending pre-Budget announcements, Treasury Minister Simon Clarke said the government had not commented on the \"substantive tax measures\" that would appear in the Budget.\nSo what do we know?\nFirstly, this isn't the complete story. \nRishi Sunak's Budget won't all be about displays of generosity. The Treasury has asked departments to identify \"at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets\" and we may hear more about those plans on Wednesday. \nThe government has already committed to spending for health, schools, defence and overseas aid so other areas such as local government, justice and further education may face a squeeze on their budgets.\nAnd there may be more to some of the seemingly lavish spending pledges than meets the eye.\nAnalysis by political correspondent Damian Grammaticas\nBeware what you are reading! They sound good, all these announcements in the run up to Budget and Spending Review. \nBut they need to be taken with caution. This is the PR blitz seeking good headlines. We don't yet know the detail of exactly what the government is planning. \nThe raft of investments will make a difference. But there are questions. \nAre the transport links, treatment centres and other projects entirely new or have some parts been announced (with equal fanfare) before now? \nCrucially what is happening more broadly to the budgets of the departments getting cash? \nA shiny investment in something is great, but is that department's day-to-day spending being squeezed? And what of those areas that aren't getting the handouts?\nBest to wait until Wednesday to truly judge the chancellor's largesse.\nThe government has announced that England's city regions will receive \u00a36.9bn to spend on train, tram, bus and cycle projects.\nThis includes \u00a31.07bn for Greater Manchester, \u00a31.05bn for the West Midlands and \u00a3830m for West Yorkshire.  \nHowever, the figure of \u00a36.9bn only includes \u00a31.5bn of additional spending because the government is including the \u00a34.2bn promised in 2019 alongside funding for buses announced by the prime minister last year.\nThe chancellor has refused to be drawn on the future of the eastern leg of High Speed Two, which could be delayed or cancelled to save an estimated \u00a340bn.  If built, the extension would cut journey times between London and the North East by 31 minutes. It would also shave 52 minutes off trips between London and Leeds.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding through the Barnett formula - a mechanism the UK government uses to allocate additional money to the devolved nations when it spends more in England.\nNHS England will get \u00a35.9bn to tackle the backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. That covers \u00a32.3bn for diagnostic tests including clinics in shopping centres for scans; \u00a31.5bn on beds equipment and new \"surgical hubs\"; and \u00a32.1bn to improve IT. \nHealth bodies welcomed the money but warned it would not solve the problem of staff shortages. According to data published by NHS digital, in June there were 93,806 full-time vacancies across the NHS in England.\nMr Sunak is set to announce a rise in the National Living Wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50, to come into effect from 1 April next year.\nThis is a 6.6% increase in the minimum wage for all those aged 23 and over - more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living.\nAssuming a 40 hour week, the new minimum wage amounts to a salary of \u00a31,646 per month or \u00a319,760 a year. \nThe increases to the wage rates follow recommendations made by the Low Pay Commission, an independent advisory board.\nThe Treasury has also announced it will be lifting a pay freeze imposed on millions of public sector workers last year as a result of the pandemic. \nIndependent pay review bodies will recommend how much extra money workers will get early next year.\nThe government's major tax change has already been announced, as earlier this year the prime minister told MPs he would introduce a tax in England designed to tackle the NHS backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and later to pay for social care.\nHowever, we know a few other changes (or rather lack of changes) that will be announced on Wednesday.\nCampaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the levy to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row. \nAnd separately, the BBC has been told VAT on household energy would not be cut. \nThe health department will get \u00a35bn over the next three years for research and development.\nThis includes \u00a395m which will go towards researching methods for treating cancer, obesity and mental health.\nThe money will also be spent on developing genome technology which could detect more than 200 conditions in newborn babies.\n\u00a32.6bn will be spent on creating 30,000 new school places for children with special educational needs and disabilities.\nThe money will also go towards improving school buildings' accessibility and funding new, special provision in free schools England.\nThe Budget will also include \u00a31.6bn over three years to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds plus \u00a3550m for adult skills in England.\nCurrently there are over 6,000 on T-level courses, but the government hopes to ramp up those numbers. \nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, warned that the extra money was a \"gamble\" as it was unclear how many would want to take the qualification. \nThe government will also spend a further \u00a3830m modernising colleges in England.\nThe Treasury is allocating \u00a31.8bn for building around 160,000 new homes on derelict or unused land - also known as brownfield sites - in England. \nAn extra \u00a39m will also go towards allowing councils to turn neglected urban spaces into \"pocket parks\" roughly the size of a tennis court.\nThe chancellor is also expected to confirm \u00a365m for digitising England's planning system.\nGrants worth \u00a31.4bn will be given to \"internationally mobile\" companies to invest in UK infrastructure.\nThis includes \u00a3345m aimed at increasing resilience for future pandemics and \u00a3800m for the production of electric vehicles in north-east England and the Midlands.\nAs part of the package, a talent network team will aim to attract high-skilled workers to the UK, through \"innovation hotspots\" initially based in San Francisco and Boston in the US and Bengaluru in India.\nThe government has announced \u00a3500m to support parents and children in England. \nThis includes \u00a3200m to support families with complex issues; \u00a382m to fund centres in 75 different areas to provide advice for parents; \u00a3100m for mental health support for expectant parents; and \u00a350m for breastfeeding support.\nLabour has argued that the government previously closed over 1,000 children's centres - known as Sure Start centres - and that this new announcement \"rings hollow\".\nMr Sunak defended past cuts, arguing that the new funding would \"create a network of family hubs which are broader than the Sure Start centres\".\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "Exoplanets,Astronomy",
      "text": "Astronomers have found hints of what could be the first planet ever to be discovered outside our galaxy.\nNearly 5,000 \"exoplanets\" - worlds orbiting stars beyond our Sun - have been found so far, but all of these have been located within the Milky Way galaxy.\nThe possible Saturn-sized planet discovered by Nasa's Chandra X-Ray Telescope is in the Messier 51 galaxy.\nThis is located some 28 million light-years away from the Milky Way.\nThis new result is based on transits, where the passage of a planet in front of a star blocks some of the star's light and yields a characteristic dip in brightness that can be detected by telescopes.  \nThis general technique has already been used to find thousands of exoplanets.\nDr Rosanne Di Stefano and colleagues searched for dips in the brightness of X-rays received from a type of object known as an X-ray bright binary. \nThese objects typically contain a neutron star or black hole pulling in gas from a closely orbiting companion star. The material near the neutron star or black hole becomes superheated and glows at X-ray wavelengths.\nBecause the region producing bright X-rays is small, a planet passing in front of it could block most or all of the rays, making the transit easier to spot.\nThe team members used this technique to detect the exoplanet candidate in a binary system called M51-ULS-1.\n\"The method we developed and employed is the only presently implementable method to discover planetary systems in other galaxies,\" Dr Di Stefano, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, US, told BBC News.\n\"It is a unique method, uniquely well-suited to finding planets around X-ray binaries at any distance from which we can measure a light curve.\"\nThis binary contains a black hole or neutron star orbiting a companion star with a mass about 20 times that of the Sun. A neutron star is the collapsed core of what had once been a massive star.\nThe transit lasted about three hours, during which the X-ray emission decreased to zero. Based on this and other information, the astronomers estimate that the candidate planet would be around the size of Saturn, and orbit the neutron star or black hole at about twice the distance Saturn lies from the Sun.\nDr Di Stefano said the techniques that have been so successful for finding exoplanets in the Milky Way break down when observing other galaxies. This is partly because the great distances involved reduce the amount of light which reaches the telescope and also mean that many objects are crowded into a small space (as viewed from Earth), making it difficult to resolve individual stars.\nWith X-rays, she said, \"there may be only several dozen sources spread out over the entire galaxy, so we can resolve them.  In addition, a subset of these are so bright in X-rays that we can measure their light curves.\n\"Finally, the huge emission of X-rays comes from a small region that can be substantially or (as in our case) totally blocked by a passing planet.\"\nThe researchers freely admit that more data is needed to verify their interpretation.\nOne challenge is that the planet candidate's large orbit means it would not cross in front of its binary partner again for about 70 years, quashing any attempts to make a follow-up observation in the near-term.\nOne other possible explanation that the astronomers considered is that the dimming has been caused by a cloud of gas and dust passing in front of the X-ray source.\nHowever, they think this is unlikely, because the characteristics of the event do not match up with the properties of a gas cloud.\n\"We know we are making an exciting and bold claim so we expect that other astronomers will look at it very carefully,\" said co-author Julia Berndtsson of Princeton University, New Jersey. \n\"We think we have a strong argument, and this process is how science works.\"\nDr Di Stefano said that the new generation of optical and infrared telescopes would not be able to compensate for the problems of crowding and dimness, so observations at X-ray wavelengths would likely remain the primary method for detecting planets in other galaxies.\nHowever, she said a method known as microlensing might also hold promise for identifying extra-galactic planets.\nThe study has been published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Astronomy.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."
