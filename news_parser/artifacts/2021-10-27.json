      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,NI economy,Conor Murphy",
      "text": "Finance minister Conor Murphy has disputed a claim by the chancellor that Northern Ireland will get an extra \u00a31.6bn per year for public services. \nRishi Sunak said his budget allocation represented the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998.\nBut Mr Murphy said it would create \"significant challenges\".\nHe said it would amount to \u00a31.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - \"nowhere near\" what is required. \nTreasury figures show the budget allocation will mean day-to-day spending in Northern Ireland will increase by an average of 2.1% in real terms each year up to 2025.\nInfrastructure spending will increase by an average of 2.5% a year over the same period.\nThe Treasury said this gave the Northern Ireland Executive \"sufficient funding certainty\" to plan in-year spending and to provide additional future investments in areas such as health, social care and education.\nBut Mr Murphy said when compared to the executive's 2021-22 budget, there will be an additional \u00a3450m, \u00a3670m and \u00a3866m over the next three years for day-to-day spending \"against growing demand for public services\".\nThis, he added, represented a 0.9% real term increase to the executive's budget next year, turning to zero real terms change by 2024-25.\n\"This spending review was the opportunity to deliver a budget which would have enabled the executive to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery,\" Mr Murphy said. \n\"However it provides a marginal real terms increase in funding next year which will be far outweighed by increased demands on public services, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic.\"\nMr Murphy said a multi-year budget enables the executive to better plan and prioritise its finances.\nHe said his priority was supporting the health service and tackling waiting lists. \nSeparately, there is an initial budget allocation of \u00a350m from the government's levelling up fund.\nIt is for 11 projects including redeveloping the Dundonald Ice Bowl and extending cycle routes across the Belfast City Region.\nMr Sunak also said he will cut Air Passenger Duty (APD) by half on internal UK flights.\nA cut in APD is a long standing request of Northern Ireland politicians and business leaders.\nIt will mean a new domestic band for APD set at \u00a36.50. \nThe rate will apply to all flights between airports in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (excluding private jets). \nThe government has also announced a proposal to solve a NI Protocol related issue concerning the VAT paid on second cars coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. \nMr Murphy has previously already played down expectations that the spending review would mean significant extra resources.\nEarlier this week, he said there was \"little indication\" the government would \"provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery\".\nHowever, he said the ability to produce a multi-year budget would provide an opportunity to \"better plan and prioritise finances\".\nStormont has not had a multi-year budget since 2011-2015.\nThat has made it difficult for public sector managers to plan services, particularly in health.\nThe finance minister is trying to build consensus among his executive colleagues that the bulk of any additional funds should go to health even if other departments lose out.\nHe aims to publish a draft budget before Christmas which would then go out to consultation before being finalised early next year.\nThe Institute of Directors Northern Ireland said the additional money will be a \"shot in the arm for the local administration\".\n\"It is incumbent now on ministers to deliver on the incredible potential it presents, with a focus, through targeted investment in key services and infrastructure, on ensuring this region is fit to capitalise on the green recovery as we continue to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic,\" said national director, Kirsty McManus. \nRetail NI said the chancellor's 50% rates discount for retailers in England was welcome. The organisation added it was \"absolutely vital\" that Conor Murphy ensures this also applies to small traders in Northern Ireland. \nMatthew Hall, George Best Belfast City Airport chief executive, said the airport had for many years been lobbying government for the abolition of APD.\n\"A 50% reduction in APD is a half-way house in terms of solving a problem which has placed the aviation sector in Northern Ireland at a competitive disadvantage with other regions in attracting new airlines and routes,\" he said. \"Today's announcement by the chancellor will not take effect until April 2023 and does little in the short term to alleviate a sector still decimated by Covid.\"\nSDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said the budget was a \"grim spectacle\".\n\"Now we have some certainty on multi-year funding the onus is on Conor Murphy to actually take responsibility and deliver a multi-year plan to tackle our waiting list crisis and present a credible plan for our economy,\" he said. \nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member Steve Aiken said the extra \u00a31.6bn a year \"underlines the advantage of being part of the fifth largest economy in the world\".\n\"We still have a long way to go to emerge fully from the Covid pandemic but this budget, if properly used to support the needs of Northern Ireland, gives us a good chance,\" he said. \nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said the multi year budget should help devolved finance ministers plan spending better. \n\"The last two years have been unprecedented, and the Treasury responded in an unprecedented manner to protect jobs and safeguard employers,\" he said. \nBuckfast tonic wine faces a significant tax increase under government plans to reform alcohol duty.\nThe new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said.\nA Treasury fact sheet suggests a 75cl bottle of Buckfast will face additional tax of 81p.\nThe fortified wine is popular in some areas of Northern Ireland and is sometimes called Lurgan Champagne.\nIt has been made by Benedictine monks at Buckfast Abbey in Devon for almost 100 years.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said he was proposing the \"most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years\".\n\"To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,\" he said.\n\"Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. \n'This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength.\"\nMr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were \"currently overtaxed\", adding: \"Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less.\""

      "tags": "Economics,UK economy,UK national debt,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "Government borrowing fell in September compared with a year earlier as the economy continued to recover from coronavirus lockdowns.\nBorrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - stood at \u00a321.8bn, which was \u00a37bn less than in September 2020.\nBut the figure was still the second-highest for September since monthly records began in 1993. \nBorrowing hit record levels during the pandemic.\nThe government spent billions of pounds on emergency measures to protect wages, such as the furlough scheme, which wrapped up last month.\nAs a result, government debt has been pushed up to more than \u00a32.2 trillion at the end of September this year - about 95.5% of the UK's gross domestic product (GDP), and the highest level recorded since the early 1960s.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the government has borrowed a total of \u00a3108.1bn so far in the current financial year (April to September), although this is \u00a3101.2bn less than in the same period last year.\nAs well as higher spending on Covid measures, the government has collected less in tax receipts during the pandemic, having given some badly-affected firms tax holidays from VAT, for example. \nAs a result of a lower income from taxes and higher spending, the ONS now estimates that in the 2020-21 financial year the government borrowed \u00a3319.9bn. That amounted to 14.9% of GDP, the highest rate seen since the end of World War Two.\nSome government sources of income have started to recover more recently. In September, the amount it collected through Value Added Tax (VAT) rose by 4.5% in comparison with the same month a year earlier. \nFuel duty payments were also up by 6%, although alcohol and tobacco tax takes fell by 12.7% and 7% respectively.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak is due to deliver a new Budget and growth forecasts on 27 October, as well as new multi-year spending limits for individual government departments.\nThe monthly borrowing figure for September was lower than economists had expected. However, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the picture had improved for the government ahead of next week's Budget, he did not expect a \"major fiscal giveaway\".\n\"Borrowing has fallen much more quickly than almost everyone expected,\" he said.\n\"That said, the rumours are that the chancellor will still keep a very tight grip on the public finances in next Wednesday's Budget to try and bring down borrowing even quicker and build a fiscal war chest to deploy ahead of the 2024 election.\"\nIn response to the latest official figures, the chancellor said that although debt levels have risen, \"our recovery is well underway - with more employees on payrolls than ever before and the fastest forecast growth in the G7 this year\".\n\"At the Budget and Spending Review next week, I will set out how we will continue to support public services, businesses and jobs while keeping our public finances fit for the future.\"\nProf David Miles, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and professor of financial economics at Imperial College, warned that there could be \"a long struggle ahead\" for the chancellor.\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"The debt came down very rapidly after the end of the Napoleonic wars, the First World War, the Second World War. \n\"All those people who had been in the army and the other armed forces came back into employment, tax revenue went up, the government was spending less on armaments - that's not going to happen now, so I think it is considerably more difficult to bring down the stock of debt to GDP than it was in the aftermath of those earlier wars.\"\nIn recent years, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which makes its debt more affordable.\nBut rising inflation means that the Bank of England may increase interest rates soon, in an attempt to ensure the cost of living does not increase too quickly.\nThe Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, warned on Sunday that it \"will have to act\" over rising inflation soon.\nAlthough he did not give any indication as to when it might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%, investors are expecting rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022.\nWhat's striking in the public sector finance figures is not how big the borrowing or debt is in the financial year to date. That's the same story we've known for months: the second-highest borrowing in peacetime, second only to last year's even more extraordinary amounts. \nWhat's newer, and more eyebrow-raising, is what the figures show about how rapidly borrowing can fall, before any spending cuts or tax rises have taken effect, simply because the economy is growing. \nWith expected growth this year of 7% or more, tax money is flowing into the Exchequer far faster than was anticipated at the last Budget. And much of the emergency spending required in the more severe lockdown last year no longer has to be spent because the economy has, mostly, reopened. Public sector borrowing (the amount government has to borrow to plug the gap between its income and its spending) has nearly halved, dropping by more than \u00a3100bn.  \nNot only that: all the borrowing accumulated over the years, also known as net debt, is also falling, down two percentage points, from 97.6% of gross domestic product in August to 95.5% in September. \nBoth borrowing and debt are falling, not because of any economic hairshirt the chancellor is requiring us all to wear, but because a successful vaccination programme has helped the economy to recover.

      "text": "The RMT union has outlined its \"final position\" on solving a pay dispute which threatens strike action during the COP26 summit in Glasgow.\nIn a letter to ScotRail, the union's general secretary Michael Lynch listed three demands.\nThe train operator acknowledged the RMT proposal and said it would give it \"due consideration\".\nThe union had until 17:00 on Wednesday to accept the same deal which had been agreed by three other unions.\nScotRail said that just before that deadline, the RMT submitted its proposal.\nIt is asking for its members - who are mainly conductors and ticket examiners - to be given;\nOpposition politicians have been calling for ministers to do more in a bid to avert what Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross warned could be \"absolute chaos\".\nScotRail said the deadline was necessary to finalise its contingency plans, which would see suitably trained supervisors and managers replace striking staff.\nThe operator said its focus would be on connecting Glasgow and Edinburgh and providing key routes through the host city.\nBut it would not be drawn on the frequency of services or their period of operation.\nThree other unions representing rail workers - Unite, Aslef and TSSA - have accepted a pay deal which is worth 4.7% over two years and includes a \u00a3300 bonus for working during the summit.\nBut the RMT wanted a one-year deal worth 4.9% which was not linked to efficiency savings. \nScotRail operations director David Simpson defended the current offer, especially as passenger numbers have halved due to Covid.\nMr Simpson added that he could not understand why Mr Hogg had not put the deal to his members.\nOn the impact of a strike as the eyes of the world are on Glasgow, he told BBC Reporting Scotland: \"I think everybody wants to make sure COP is successful and rail to play its part in that but we can't just throw money at that without consequences. There is a very strong offer on the table.\"\nHe added that he hoped the strike could be resolved but on the basis of the RMT's position it was very wise and prudent to make contingency plans.\nUp to 30,000 delegates are set to descend on Glasgow for the UN climate summit which runs from Sunday to 14 November.\nAt the same time, the sheer scale of the road closures around the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) will put additional pressure on the rail network for those who need access to the city for work and leisure.\nOn Tuesday, Transport Minister Graeme Dey accused the RMT of moving the goalposts during negotiations.\nAnd he said there were contingency plans to keep some train services running during the UN climate change summit. \nIn response, RMT Scotland organiser Mick Hogg said: \"The goalposts were never there to be moved in the first place - we have been stonewalled for the last 18 months.\"\nMr Hogg said while there had been movement over a separate issue of rest day working, there had been no progress on pay and proposed efficiency savings. \nRail services in Scotland have been crippled for months by strike action due to a separate dispute, with few trains running on Sundays.\nThe RMT is threatening strike action from 1 November, for the duration of the summit.\nAnother dispute could see thousands of council workers across Scotland including refuse, recycling, maintenance and school catering and janitorial staff taking strike action during the second week of the climate talks.

      "tags": "European Court of Justice,European Union,Poland",
      "text": "The EU's top court has told Poland to pay a daily fine of \u20ac1m (\u00a3850,000) in a row over judicial reforms.\nEarlier this year, Poland was ordered to suspend a controversial disciplinary chamber, but has not yet done so.\nIt is the latest development in a bitter feud with the EU over changes that are seen as weakening the independence of Polish courts.\nThe hefty penalty was immediately denounced as \"blackmail\" by Polish government spokesman Piotr Muller.\nSome fear the escalating situation could put Poland's membership in the EU at risk.\nEarlier this month, Poland's constitutional court ruled that Polish law supersedes EU law when there is a conflict between the two - angering European leaders by, in effect, rejecting the primacy of EU law.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was a \"direct challenge to the unity of the European legal order\".\nThe disciplinary chamber of Poland's Supreme Court was set up in 2018 to penalise top judges where necessary - the government said it was needed to fight corruption. But critics argue it is being used to punish independent judges because it has the power to sanction the content of their rulings.\nIn July, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ordered it to be shut down as it was neither sufficiently independent nor impartial. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Brussels was making demands with a \"gun to our head\" and insisted that EU institutions have no right to tell Poland how to organise its judiciary. He did agree to dismantle the chamber, however, but never gave a date.\nBBC Warsaw correspondent Adam Easton says the Supreme Court has stopped scheduling new cases for the chamber, but it has continued hearing cases that are already scheduled.\nOne significant factor in the row is that the European Commission is yet to approve \u20ac57bn (\u00a348bn; $66bn) of Covid-19 recovery funds earmarked for Poland, and may not do so until this dispute is settled.\nAn opinion poll on Tuesday suggested that 40.8% of Poles believed their government should concede defeat and end the row, while another 32.5% said it should compromise.\nThe ECJ's ruling on Wednesday stated that the fine of \u20ac1m a day would have to be paid until Poland either suspended the chamber or until the final ruling on its future.\nThe vice-president said the fine was being imposed to deter Poland from further delaying the shut down of the chamber and said it was necessary to \"avoid serious and irreparable harm to the legal order of the European Union\".\nPoland's Deputy Justice Minister Sebastian Kaleta said the ruling \"completely disregards and ignores the Polish constitution and the rulings of the Polish constitutional tribunal\".\nPoland's leader told the European Parliament this month it was \"unacceptable to talk about financial penalties\" and he accused the EU of overstepping its powers.\nHis conservative-nationalist government has already been ordered by the ECJ to pay \u20ac500,000 a day for failing to shut down temporarily the enormous Turow coal mine and power plant close to the German and Czech borders. Poland has refused to pay that fine because it argues the plant heats and provides water to local homes."

      "title": "What does the UK budget mean for Scotland?",
      "tags": "Scotland economy,Scottish Parliament,Kate Forbes",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged a \"new economy\" while increasing UK government spending by \u00a3150bn. But what does his Autumn Budget mean for Scotland?\nWhile many of the decisions about tax and spending in Scotland are made in Edinburgh, the UK Budget still has a big impact - well beyond the simple question of how much cash goes into Holyrood's coffers.\nMr Sunak has opted to turn on the spending taps across every government department, and this means Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will have more cash to allocate when she sets out her own draft budget in December.\nThis is because many of the eye-catching announcements in the UK budget relate to matters which are devolved to Holyrood - for example the \u00a324bn earmarked for housing or the \u00a321bn for roads.\nNorth of the border, Scottish ministers are in charge of housing and transport. So when the Chancellor pledges fresh funding to these areas, an extra chunk of cash is added to the Scottish budget to balance things up and ensure Scottish taxpayers don't end up subsidising giveaways in England.\nThe windfall is calculated based on population levels using the Barnett Formula, and Scottish ministers can spend the cash on whatever they want - this is rather the point of devolution.\nMr Sunak said his spending spree would send an average of \u00a34.6bn per year extra to Holyrood, resulting in \"the largest block grants for the devolved administrations\" since they were established.\nHowever, Ms Forbes contends this is still not enough to deal with the \"significant challenges\" facing Scotland in the wake of the pandemic.\nShe also says it is important to \"get behind the rhetoric and understand what the figures mean\" before she announces her own spending plans on 9 December.\nNot all spending in devolved areas triggers Barnett consequentials. As of this year, some cash is actually going around Holyrood and directly to local projects.\nThe UK government has established a \u00a34.8bn \"levelling up\" fund, which allows local authorities to bid for cash for things like building roads and bridges, refurbishing museums and installing electric vehicle charging points. Mr Sunak told MPs that this year, \u00a3170m had been awarded to Scottish projects.\nThese include the redevelopment of Inverness Castle, the renovation of the Westfield Roundabout in Falkirk, and a new marketplace in Aberdeen city centre - each of which is getting \u00a320m of funding. \nA redevelopment of the Artizan shopping centre in Dumbarton is getting another \u00a320m, while \u00a338m will be spent improving travel links between Paisley and a local manufacturing innovation hub.\nUp to \u00a33m is also being committed to the Burrell Collection in Glasgow in a bid to bring world-class art exhibitions to the city, while another \u00a31m is being spent on local projects via the Community Ownership Fund.\nThis is partly to do with the government's \"levelling up\" agenda, an attempt to rebalance an economy previously seen as being skewed towards London and the south-east of England - while helpfully winning over former Labour voters in \"red wall\" constituencies in the north of England.\nBut it also plays into a longer-term Downing Street strategy to have a more visible presence in Scotland. UK ministers hope that by directly funding projects north of the border, they can write themselves into some local success stories and perhaps dampen enthusiasm for independence.\nScottish ministers meanwhile do not like the idea of being cut out of the loop, saying this \"undermines devolution\". They instinctively contest the idea that officials in London are better placed to assess the merit of funding bids than those in Edinburgh.\nThe political difficulty though is that these are positive projects backed by local councils - some of them SNP-run - and so extra cash for them cannot be opposed outright. Instead, the complaint tends to be more procedural, about the decision-making process and the complexity of the funding landscape.\nThis may also become a more common occurrence going forward, with the UK Shared Prosperity Fund set to replace EU structural funds in 2022 - again sparking complaints that Holyrood is being bypassed.\nA range of different taxes are devolved to Holyrood - but others are not, and the interplay between the two means changes announced at Westminster can still have far-reaching implications in Scotland.\nFor example, income tax rates and bands are devolved, with Scotland operating its own five-band system which the government in Edinburgh argues is fairer. However, the tax-free allowance is still reserved, which as the starting point where taxes kick in clearly has a knock-on effect on the entire system.\nSo what is actually changing, and what is not?\nThe national living wage is set UK-wide, so the increase there - to \u00a39.50 an hour for over-23s - will apply north of the border.\nAnd while an increasing range of welfare powers are being taken over by Social Security Scotland, Universal Credit is also reserved to Westminster - so the changes to the \"taper rate\", allowing working claimants to keep more of the money they earn as their wages increase, will also apply in Scotland.\nMoving away from personal taxes, business rates are fully devolved to Holyrood as non-domestic rates - and the Scottish government has already committed to rates relief for the hospitality and retail sectors.\nThe cut to air passenger duty on domestic flights will apply in Scotland - Aberdeen and Inverness were specifically cited by the Chancellor as beneficiaries, although Inverness is actually exempt from the levy. \nWhile there have long been plans to replace air passenger duty with a devolved Air Departure Tax, the move has been tied up in technical wrangles for years - chiefly because of that exemption for Highlands and Islands airports.\nIncidentally, Scottish ministers wanted to do away with the levy entirely - but ditched this plan in 2019 citing environmental concerns. This has freed them up to raise an eyebrow at Mr Sunak's plan coming on the eve of the COP26 climate conference.\nThe overhaul of alcohol duties will have effect in Scotland too. While there is a system of minimum unit pricing in Scotland, this is not actually a tax, with retailers pocketing the proceeds of increased prices.\nThe freeze on current alcohol duty is also good news for the Scottish whisky industry, which had been lobbying against a planned increase.\nRishi Sunak seems determined that this is seen as a red, white and blue budget - a budget for the whole of the UK.\nAs he chose to put it: \"We are, and always will be, one family - one United Kingdom\".\nThat is obviously in dispute in Scotland where the SNP and others aspire to independence - so what did the Chancellor do to try and strengthen the Union?\nAs well as extra cash for the Scottish government, there is the so-called \"levelling up\" money which involves the UK government spending more directly in Scotland.\nThere's likely to be more of this after COP26 when UK ministers publish their Union connectivity review identifying cross-border transport investments.\nThe budget also included a cut to air passenger duty for internal UK flights which Mr Sunak said was designed to \"bring people together across the UK\".\nThere was even a UK-wide scheme to boost numeracy skills, although education is a Holyrood responsibility.\nWhat nationalists might see as Treasury overreach was also a signal to unionists that this Chancellor is committed to their cause. \nA tiny pub in the most inaccessible village in Scotland; a roundabout in Falkirk: a shopping centre in Dunbartonshire; the stable block in Glasgow's Pollok Park - the UK budget is going very local.\nOver 22 years of devolution, it had become increasingly a spending budget for England, with devolved bells and whistles, and taxes that mainly covered the whole of the UK.\nBut that's changing. This budget marks a big shift towards the UK government planting its union flags on Scottish government turf.\nThe Levelling Up Fund offers \u00a3170m to Scottish projects, this year, and \u00a3400m over three years - money that would previously have gone through the block grant at Holyrood, for ministers there to allocate.\nCommunity Ownership and Regeneration Funds also pick pet projects that show the difference some Whitehall money can make, backing some really small projects from Whithorn to Kinloch Rannoch.\nAn extension of that will come with the Shared Prosperity Fund, which will ramp up as European Union structural funds are wound down. That, too, will bypass Holyrood, because Westminster wants its own direct links to projects on the ground."

      "tags": "HM Treasury,Money,Tax,Personal finance,Personal debt,UK taxes,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021,Pay",
      "text": "This is not the first, but the second Budget delivered by Chancellor Rishi Sunak this year. It is certainly not the first time we have heard some of the content.\nDespite a swathe of announcements having been released in advance, the measures as a whole will have a significant impact on your finances. This is how the money in your pocket will be affected. \nIf you are working and also receiving universal credit, then you are probably affected by what is officially known as the taper rate. That means the universal credit payment you receive is reduced as you earn more.\nFor every pound earned (sometimes above a base level of earnings known as the work allowance), 63p is automatically deducted from your benefit payment.\nBy reducing that to 55p, the chancellor is allowing people to keep more of what they earn. By raising the work allowance, the same is true.\nDepending on their circumstances around two million would be better off, but another two million claimants will see no benefit because they either do not work or do not earn enough. \nIt is a significant policy in tackling the rising cost of living which will be brought in \"within weeks\" and no later than 1 December. It comes after criticism of cancelling the \u00a320-a-week universal credit uplift given during the pandemic which had benefitted 5.5 million people.\nThere is plenty of evidence of prices going up in the shops and on bills, with the cost of living expected to rise by 4% over the next year according to official forecasters.\nThere has been a freeze on fuel duty for more than a decade and this will continue for at least another year, as drivers are hit by higher prices at the pumps.\nAbout 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT.\nHowever, there were no measures to assist householders with rising domestic gas and electricity bills.\nThose on minimum wages will receive a significant pay rise in April. For those aged 23 and above the rate - known as the National Living Wage - will go up by 6.6%, as the hourly rate increases from \u00a38.91 to \u00a39.50.\nThere will also be increases in the minimum wage for younger workers. \nIf they also receive universal credit, they could be affected by the taper rate mentioned earlier.\nHow much is the minimum wage?\nPublic sector staff will also receive a pay rise in April when the freeze on wages in place during the pandemic is lifted. How much this amounts to, and whether it equates to more than the rising cost of living, will be decided at later date.\nThe government's official, independent forecasters - the Office for Budget Responsibility - said that real incomes for everyone would typically rise very slowly in the coming years. Household income rises, after taking into account inflation and changes in tax will be no higher than 1.5% a year for each year up to and including 2026.\nIn the year from April 2022, a middle earner's take-home pay will fall by about 1%, or \u00a3180 per year, in real terms.\nDrinking is getting more expensive, with pub chains warning that higher wages and energy costs will mean much higher prices for a pint.\nHowever, Mr Sunak announced an overhaul which he described as \"the most radical simplification of alcohol duties for 140 years\", coming into force in February 2023.\nThis will lead to higher-strength drinks going up in price, but lower duty on drinks ranging from sparkling wine to draught beer.\nThere will be no immediate increase in alcohol duties, contrary to what often happens on Budget day.\nThe cost of smoking is rising again, with an above-inflation rise in duty on cigarettes and an 11% rise in duty on hand-rolling tobacco, taking effect within hours.\nMr Sunak said he planned to reduce taxes during the rest of this Parliament.\nAlthough announced before this Budget, two massive tax decisions had already been made that will affect your money in the coming years.\nIn the last Budget, Mr Sunak said the thresholds as which income tax is paid would be frozen at April 2021 levels for five years (although Scotland has different levels). That means pay rises will push more people into higher tax bands.\nIn September, the government also announced employees, employers and the self-employed would all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance (NI) from April 2022 to fund social care.\nThe cost of a domestic flight ticket could be cut, but very long-haul flights could get more expensive.\nThat is because the chancellor has made changes to Air Passenger Duty - a levy paid by airlines, but ultimately funded by passengers through the cost of their tickets.\nMany homeowners of high-rise flats have faced crippling costs owing to the cladding crisis, following the Grenfell Tower tragedy.\nA levy on the biggest property developers of high rises to pay for the removal of dangerous cladding has been confirmed by the chancellor.\nTo help those of the youngest age, there is extra funding for projects supporting new parents.\nThere is also a new UK-wide programme to improve numeracy skills. The chancellor said that individuals with poor numeracy faced up to \u00a31,600 a year in lost earnings, according to the charity National Numeracy."

      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,NI economy,Conor Murphy",
      "text": "Finance minister Conor Murphy has disputed a claim by the chancellor that Northern Ireland will get an extra \u00a31.6bn per year for public services. \nRishi Sunak said his budget allocation represented the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998.\nBut Mr Murphy said it would create \"significant challenges\".\nHe said it would amount to \u00a31.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - \"nowhere near\" what is required. \nTreasury figures show the budget allocation will mean day-to-day spending in Northern Ireland will increase by an average of 2.1% in real terms each year up to 2025.\nInfrastructure spending will increase by an average of 2.5% a year over the same period.\nThe Treasury said this gave the Northern Ireland Executive \"sufficient funding certainty\" to plan in-year spending and to provide additional future investments in areas such as health, social care and education.\nBut Mr Murphy said when compared to the executive's 2021-22 budget, there will be an additional \u00a3450m, \u00a3670m and \u00a3866m over the next three years for day-to-day spending \"against growing demand for public services\".\nThis, he added, represented a 0.9% real term increase to the executive's budget next year, turning to zero real terms change by 2024-25.\n\"This spending review was the opportunity to deliver a budget which would have enabled the executive to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery,\" Mr Murphy said. \n\"However it provides a marginal real terms increase in funding next year which will be far outweighed by increased demands on public services, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic.\"\nMr Murphy said a multi-year budget enables the executive to better plan and prioritise its finances.\nHe said his priority was supporting the health service and tackling waiting lists. \nSeparately, there is an initial budget allocation of \u00a350m from the government's levelling up fund.\nIt is for 11 projects including redeveloping the Dundonald Ice Bowl and extending cycle routes across the Belfast City Region.\nMr Sunak also said he will cut Air Passenger Duty (APD) by half on internal UK flights.\nA cut in APD is a long standing request of Northern Ireland politicians and business leaders.\nIt will mean a new domestic band for APD set at \u00a36.50. \nThe rate will apply to all flights between airports in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (excluding private jets). \nThe government has also announced a proposal to solve a NI Protocol related issue concerning the VAT paid on second cars coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. \nMr Murphy has previously already played down expectations that the spending review would mean significant extra resources.\nEarlier this week, he said there was \"little indication\" the government would \"provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery\".\nHowever, he said the ability to produce a multi-year budget would provide an opportunity to \"better plan and prioritise finances\".\nStormont has not had a multi-year budget since 2011-2015.\nThat has made it difficult for public sector managers to plan services, particularly in health.\nThe finance minister is trying to build consensus among his executive colleagues that the bulk of any additional funds should go to health even if other departments lose out.\nHe aims to publish a draft budget before Christmas which would then go out to consultation before being finalised early next year.\nThe Institute of Directors Northern Ireland said the additional money will be a \"shot in the arm for the local administration\".\n\"It is incumbent now on ministers to deliver on the incredible potential it presents, with a focus, through targeted investment in key services and infrastructure, on ensuring this region is fit to capitalise on the green recovery as we continue to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic,\" said national director, Kirsty McManus. \nRetail NI said the chancellor's 50% rates discount for retailers in England was welcome. The organisation added it was \"absolutely vital\" that Conor Murphy ensures this also applies to small traders in Northern Ireland. \nMatthew Hall, George Best Belfast City Airport chief executive, said the airport had for many years been lobbying government for the abolition of APD.\n\"A 50% reduction in APD is a half-way house in terms of solving a problem which has placed the aviation sector in Northern Ireland at a competitive disadvantage with other regions in attracting new airlines and routes,\" he said. \"Today's announcement by the chancellor will not take effect until April 2023 and does little in the short term to alleviate a sector still decimated by Covid.\"\nSDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said the budget was a \"grim spectacle\".\n\"Now we have some certainty on multi-year funding the onus is on Conor Murphy to actually take responsibility and deliver a multi-year plan to tackle our waiting list crisis and present a credible plan for our economy,\" he said. \nUlster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member Steve Aiken said the extra \u00a31.6bn a year \"underlines the advantage of being part of the fifth largest economy in the world\".\n\"We still have a long way to go to emerge fully from the Covid pandemic but this budget, if properly used to support the needs of Northern Ireland, gives us a good chance,\" he said. \nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said the multi year budget should help devolved finance ministers plan spending better. \n\"The last two years have been unprecedented, and the Treasury responded in an unprecedented manner to protect jobs and safeguard employers,\" he said. \nBuckfast tonic wine faces a significant tax increase under government plans to reform alcohol duty.\nThe new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said.\nA Treasury fact sheet suggests a 75cl bottle of Buckfast will face additional tax of 81p.\nThe fortified wine is popular in some areas of Northern Ireland and is sometimes called Lurgan Champagne.\nIt has been made by Benedictine monks at Buckfast Abbey in Devon for almost 100 years.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said he was proposing the \"most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years\".\n\"To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,\" he said.\n\"Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. \n'This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength.\"\nMr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were \"currently overtaxed\", adding: \"Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less.\""

      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told MPs the Budget begins the work to prepare for a new economy post Covid, as he delivers his speech in the Commons.\nSpending plans for transport, health and education have been unveiled in the press.\nMr Sunak is under pressure to help people with the cost of living.\nSources say he will adjust the universal credit taper rate, meaning those working will be able to take home more of the money they earn.\nA \u00a320 a week top up to the benefit was cut earlier this month, but details of any changes have yet to be announced.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer will not be responding to the Budget, as the leader of the opposition is normally expected to do, as he is isolating after testing positive for Covid. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out Labour's response instead.\nAccording to Downing Street, Mr Sunak told the cabinet on Wednesday morning that his Budget \"will deliver a stronger economy for the British people\" with the \"levelling-up\" agenda - spreading prosperity around the country - a \"golden thread\" running through it.\nThe chancellor is under pressure to reveal more about the economic outlook, with government debt soaring to record peace time levels in the wake of the pandemic.\nAnd he will deliver a three-year spending review alongside his Budget.\nThe Treasury has asked departments to find \"at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets\" - so it is clear not every area will get the same treatment. \nPolicies already unveiled from the chancellor's Budget include:\nYou can read more on the announcements the government has already made here. \nOne of the pre-announced policies is the end to a pay freeze for public sector workers - such as teachers, nurses and police officers - but ministers have so far refused to say whether it will be a real-terms rise by being higher than inflation.\nPay for most frontline workforces is set by independent pay review bodies and No 10 has said it could not \"prejudge that process\".\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was furious about the number of spending plans that were given to the media before Mr Sunak's big speech - they are traditionally meant to be announced in Parliament so MPs can challenge and scrutinise them. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing echoed the reproof just before the Chancellor got to his feet.\nA No 10 spokesman said they \"recognised the importance of parliamentary scrutiny\" and they \"always listen very carefully to the Speaker\".\nWhisper it. After the economy took an absolute hammering during the pandemic, might the chancellor tomorrow actually be in a much cheerier political mood than he could have predicted? \nDuring his Budget warm-up in the last few days, Rishi Sunak has already totted up promises of around an extra \u00a320bn of spending, as well as announcing how some of the cash that was already promised is going to be carved up.  \nHold on for a second though. On the specifics, there is no guarantee that unfreezing the wages of 2.5 million workers in England will mean they get pay rises that aren't eroded by inflation. \nThe same goes for increases for workers on low pay, and cuts to universal credit will pinch too. \nHaving treated us all to cosy snaps of him and his Labrador, Nova, and him hard at work in his athleisure wear, Rishi Sunak wants to give the political impression that he's a chancellor we can all be comfortable with - careful with our money, but not afraid to spend it on things that matter, who has modern Tory instincts, but won't ditch the party's traditions.  \nBut remember Budget warm-ups are just that. However many announcements there have already been, however carefully the photographs of the prep have been thought through and selected, what matters is what he actually says at lunchtime on Wednesday.\nWhat matters are the numbers - what's in black and white - in the end.\nRead more from Laura here. \nSir Keir Starmer tweeted: \"The Budget must take the pressure off working people.\n\"With costs growing and inflation rising, Labour would cut VAT on domestic energy bills immediately for six months.\n\"Unlike the Tories, we wouldn't hike taxes on working people and we'd ensure online giants pay their fair share.\"\nEx-Tory chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Newscast the government should not use higher wages as \"a bung\" to secure the support of low income voters.\n\"The instinct to send a message to business that we need to invest more capital rather than just relying on cheap labour, I think is the right instinct, I would support that,\" he said.\nAdam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, warned it was going to be a \"brutal and bitter winter for millions of householders\" who were unable to bear the costs of energy price rises.\nHe called for the chancellor to find a way to put some of the extra tax receipts raised by the price increases back in the pockets of the most vulnerable."

      "text": "A zoo in Bosworth and a pool in Halifax are among the beneficiaries of the government's levelling up fund. \nThe \u00a34.8bn pot of money was launched last year and now the Treasury has said which areas were successful in their bids for the first tranche of cash.\nLocal authorities, with the support of local MPs, could apply for money for regeneration and transport projects. \nNewly-appointed levelling-up secretary Michael Gove has said the policy would mean people would see a visible difference in their area.\nHowever, critics of this fund have questioned whether small pots of money for local projects across the UK will transform the economy and create jobs long-term without a country-wide strategy. \nAddressing the Conservative conference earlier this month, Mr Gove said \"levelling up\" was also about long-term economic transformation.\nSuccessful bids for the initial \u00a31.4bn pot of money include:\nAnalysis by political correspondent Ione Wells\nThe government has been under pressure to define what their much-touted policy - \"levelling up\" - actually means. \nWe know it's usually used to describe tackling regional inequality - but has at times been a catch-all phrase to promote everything from more money for tennis courts to tackling crime. \nThe government's new levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has previously said the first part of it involves people seeing a visible difference in their areas being made more attractive - which the government hopes these pots of cash will start to do. \nBut he's also said levelling up involves long-term economic transformation and job creation. \nCritics of this fund have questioned whether or not small pots for different local projects around the UK - bid for competitively by councils and local MPs - will strategically transform the economy or create jobs long-term. \nThough the government would argue other policies, like their cut to the universal credit taper rate and investment in transport links, are more targeting these things. \nThe fund has also been criticised for not giving devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a role in handing out the cash, especially where bids involve funding things like infrastructure that might otherwise be a matter for governments there to make decisions on. \nWe also don't know who the 'losers' were in this first round of bids, and which areas missed out on cash.\nIn his Budget speech the chancellor appeared to deliberately address accusations of 'pork-barrel' politics - as bids had to be backed by local MPs and bypassed devolved governments. \nPork barrel politics is term generally used to refer disapprovingly of politicians funnelling money to their own constituents, regardless of need. \nHowever, Mr Sunak specifically referred to the three successful bids in Conservative Stoke-on-Trent seats but also highlighted the successful bids in Ashton under Lyne, Doncaster, South Leicester, Sunderland and West Leeds - which include the seats of Angela Rayner, Ed Miliband, Jonathan Ashworth, Rachel Reeves and Bridget Philipson - all members of Labour's shadow cabinet. \nHe said: \"We are so committed to levelling up that we are even levelling up the opposition front bench.\"\nResponding to the Budget, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the chancellor \"gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other\".\nShe accused Mr Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of operating a \"classic con game\". \n\"The prime minister is the front man - distracting people with his wild promises -all the while, his chancellor dips his hand in their pocket. \n\"It all seems like fun and games until you walk away and realise your purse has been lifted.\"\nAnalysis by Peter Barnes and Joseph Cassidy, BBC Political Research Unit \nThe list of successful bids includes 76 in England, 11 in Northern Ireland, 10 in Wales and 8 in Scotland (105 total) with a total value of \u00a31.7bn.\nIn some instances more than one parliamentary constituency is set to benefit, and in some cases it's hard to judge how the effects will be shared between constituencies.\nBut BBC analysis suggests the following breakdown by party:\nOver Twitter, Mr Sunak challenged Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, to celebrate the news that as part of the fund, \u00a317.6m would go toward improving Leicester railway station.\n\"Let me know if you want me to retweet,\" he said.\nMr Ashworth hit back tweeting: \"We're still waiting for you to properly compensate our Leicester businesses for forcing a local lockdown on us last year or reverse the increasing numbers of children in poverty across Leicester thanks to your cuts.\n\"Let me know when that's sorted so I can retweet,\" he replied.

The rail firm will be taken over by a company owned and controlled by the Scottish government in March.\nMr Hogg said the union would be able to return to the negotiating table with a new employer.\n\"Abellio ScotRail are not going to be there next year,\" he said. \"It is going to be the operator of last resort and I hope the main focus has to be getting our  industrial relations back on track in order to have a dialogue next year. \n\"We are hoping there is going to be a different approach.

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Universal Credit,Housing Benefit,Benefits,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Universal credit will rise for some people under plans announced by the chancellor in his Budget.\nRishi Sunak has reduced the \"taper rate\" - this affects the amount of money lost by working claimants if they earn more money.\nUniversal credit is a single benefit payment for working-age people, which was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people, and make the system simpler. \nIt's claimed by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, both in and out of work - 40% of universal credit claimants are workers.\nClaimants received an extra \u00a320 per week during the pandemic, but this ended at the beginning of this month.\nMost universal credit claimants lose some of their benefits if they earn more money.\nThe rate at which they lose the benefits is known as the taper rate.\nAt the moment the taper rate is 63%, which means that if you earn an extra pound you lose 63p in benefits.\nWorkers with responsibility for children or disabilities that limit their ability to work are allowed to earn a certain amount before they start losing their universal credit, which is called a work allowance. \nThe work allowance means such people can earn up to \u00a3515 a month without losing benefits. Claimants who receive help with housing costs have a lower work allowance. \nThe chancellor has announced that in the coming weeks the taper rate will be reduced to 55p, which would mean that workers would take home 8p more of an extra pound earned.\nAlso, the work allowances for eligible claimants will go up by \u00a3500 a year.\nFor some workers that will make up for the loss of the \u00a320 a week uplift to universal credit.\nEmployees claiming universal credit who earn enough to pay National Insurance (\u00a39,564 a year) will also see the amount of tax they have to pay increase next April. That will affect somebody working more than about 20 hours a week on the minimum wage.\nTake as an example somebody without children, working 10 hours a week on the National Living Wage - which is going up to \u00a39.50 an hour in April.\nThey would earn \u00a395 a week, which means - at the current 63% taper rate - they lose \u00a359.85 of their universal credit. If the taper rate were cut to 55% they would get to take home an extra \u00a37.60 a week.\nHowever, most universal credit claimants are not working, so they would not receive any extra money.\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) says that 1.4 million households still claim working tax credit and have not moved to universal credit, so they also would not benefit.\nThe cut to universal credit was opposed by many charities, opposition parties, and also some Conservative MPs.\nWriting on Twitter, Resolution chief executive Torsten Bell said that removing the boost would mean \"4.4 million households, with 5.1m adults and 3.5m children, will see their incomes fall by \u00a31,000 overnight. \nThe charity Citizens Advice warned that a third of people on universal credit would end up in debt when the extra payment is removed.\nIt said the average shortfall would be between \u00a351 and \u00a355 a month.\nThe government has defended its decision, saying the \u00a320 uplift was always meant to be temporary and that people getting back into work is the best way to tackle poverty.\nIt is complicated to work out exactly how much universal credit you might receive. Some people, such as those with \u00a316,000 or more in savings, are not eligible.\nOthers may find what they receive depends on their circumstances, including any income their family has, as well as housing and childcare costs.\nIt usually takes five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible.\nAn application for universal credit may put a stop to any tax credits you receive, even if it proves to be unsuccessful.\nYou may be able to claim a reduction in council tax when on universal credit, and get help with childcare costs. There is also support to pay the rent, which works in different ways across the UK. \nIn time, there may also be assistance in paying the mortgage, although there are some strict criteria involved.\nThe main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work is new-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA).\nThis is worth \u00a359.20 a week, if you are under 25, or \u00a374.70 a week if you are 25 or over.\nYou can get this for up to six months and it will be paid into your bank, building society, or credit union account every two weeks. Unlike universal credit, your partner's or spouse's income will not affect your claim.\nYou may be able to claim new-style JSA as well as universal credit.\nUniversal credit may not be appropriate or available for everyone.

      "tags": "France,November 2015 Paris attacks,Paris",
      "text": "The sister of the only British national killed in the 2015 Paris attacks has told the suspects on trial over the atrocity that while her family \"deplore what you did, we don't hate you\".\nHer brother Nick Alexander, 35, was killed when gunmen stormed the Bataclan Theatre in Paris during a rock concert.\nThe attack was part of a co-ordinated assault by Islamic State (IS) group extremists that killed 130 people.\nIt was the worst attack in France since World War Two.\nSalah Abdeslam, the only surviving member of the IS cell, and 19 other defendants are being tried in Paris over the attacks on a busy Friday night.\nThe deadliest attack of the night came at the Bataclan, where Californian rock band Eagles of Death Metal was playing a gig in front of a sold-out crowd.\nMr Alexander, from Essex in the UK, was working as the merchandise manager for the band when three gunmen entered the venue and started shooting indiscriminately into the crowd.\nHe suffered gunshot wounds and died in the arms of his ex-girlfriend Helen Wilson.\nIn court on Tuesday, Mr Alexander's sister, Zoe, addressed the defendants directly as she testified on the 33rd day of the biggest trial in France's modern history.\nHer brother, she told the court, shunned hatred. \"You cannot neutralise poison with more poison,\" she said.\nDescribing her brother as a music lover who upended conventions, she told the court Mr Alexander lived \"a life of true authenticity, something those who carried out the atrocities of that night, under the orders of others, will never know\".\n\"We're not at war with you, you're at war with yourselves,\" Ms Alexander told the defendants.\nOn the first anniversary of the attack, Ms Alexander and her parents created the Nick Alexander Memorial Trust, which provides music equipment to disadvantaged communities across the UK. \n\"The terrorists tried to leave a legacy of darkness but through the work we have done we have left a legacy of light,\" Ms Alexander told AFP news agency after testifying.\nShe is one of the latest relatives of a victim to testify since the trial opened at the Palace of Justice last month.\nOn Wednesday she told the BBC the atmosphere in court was \"very emotional\".\n\"It's very intense and it's hard to relive those details, especially six years later, when a lot of healing has gone on,\" she said. \"To unpack those emotions again has been a difficult process for a lot of those survivors.\"\nOn Tuesday, the court also heard from the father of Guillaume Valette, who killed himself two years after the attacks.\nKnown in French media as the 131st victim of the attacks, he came out alive and physically unharmed from the massacre in the Bataclan.\nWhen the attackers struck, Mr Valette had recounted lying on the ground, hiding among a mass of bodies, cut down by the bullets, his father Alain told the court.\nHe then hid until police intervened and managed to escape unscathed. However, he received \"invisible bullets, which killed him, slowly but surely\", his father said. He said his son suffered from post-traumatic stress and took his own life two years later, aged 31.\nAbout 350 survivors and relatives of the dead are expected to give their accounts during the trial.\nIS admitted carrying out the co-ordinated attacks on the Bataclan concert hall, a major stadium, restaurants and bars on 13 November 2015.\nOf the 20 suspects on trial, six are being tried in absentia. They are facing charges of murder, complicity and terrorist conspiracy.\nMost of the accused, including Abdeslam, could be sentenced to life in jail if convicted."

      "tags": "New York,Hillary Clinton",
      "text": "A former close aide to Hillary Clinton has written in a new memoir how a US senator attempted to kiss her without her consent.\nHuma Abedin said the unnamed politician pounced on her on a couch in the mid-2000s after inviting her into his home, according to the Guardian.\nShe says she rebuffed him as he made the advance and escaped.\nThe claim is detailed in her new book, Both/And: A Life in Many Worlds, which is being published next week.\nMrs Clinton, who was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee and secretary of state under President Obama, relied on Ms Abedin as one of her most trusted aides. Mrs Clinton once described her as her \"second daughter\".\nMs Abedin does not reveal the senator's identity or even his party in describing the incident, which happened while she was working for Mrs Clinton when she was a US senator for New York between 2001-09.\nIn an interview with CBS, Ms Abedin, now 45, said the senator \"kissed me in a very... shocking way\".\nShe was asked by the interviewer whether she felt she had been the victim of a sexual assault.\n\"I'm suggesting that I was in an uncomfortable situation with a senator and I didn't know how to deal with it and I buried the whole experience,\" Ms Abedin said\n\"In my own personal opinion, no, did I feel like he was assaulting me in that moment? It didn't feel that way.\n\"It felt like I needed to extricate myself from the situation. And he also spent a lot of time apologising and making sure I was OK and we were actually able to rebalance out relationship.\"\nMs Abedin wrote in her book that after a Washington dinner she walked out with the politician and when they stopped in front of his home he invited her inside for coffee. She accepted.\nAccording to the Guardian, which has seen an advance copy of the memoir, Ms Abedin writes: \"Then, in an instant, it all changed. He plopped down to my right, put his left arm around my shoulder, and kissed me, pushing his tongue into my mouth, pressing me back on the sofa.\n\"I was so utterly shocked, I pushed him away. All I wanted was for the last 10 seconds to be erased.\"\nShe adds: \"Then I said something only the twentysomething version of me would have come up with - 'I am so sorry' - and walked out, trying to appear as nonchalant as possible.\"\nShe also details in the book her anger at her ex-husband, former Democratic New York congressman Anthony Weiner, whose career was destroyed by sex scandals."

      "tags": "Alec Baldwin,Film,New Mexico,United States",
      "text": "Criminal charges may still be filed over last week's fatal shooting on a film set in New Mexico, US police say.\nActor Alec Baldwin accidentally shot dead cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded a director on the set of the Western film Rust.\nInvestigators said a \"lead projectile\" had been removed from the director's shoulder, and that it appeared to be a live round.\nThey said there was \"some complacency\" around safety on the set.\n\"All options are on the table,\" District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said of any potential charges. \"No one has been ruled out at this point.\"\nPresenting the department's initial findings, Sante Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said: \"We suspect there were other live rounds found on set.\"\n\"We're going to determine how those got there, why they were there, because they shouldn't have been there,\" he added.\nHe said police had recovered 600 pieces of evidence so far - including three firearms and 500 rounds of ammunition.\nSheriff Mendoza also said the projectile removed from Joel Souza's shoulder had been handed over as evidence.\n\"I think the facts are clear - a weapon was handed to Mr Baldwin. The weapon [was] functional and fired a live round killing Ms Hutchins and injuring Mr Souza,\" he said about the killing.\nThe sheriff told reporters there had been up to 100 people on the set of the film when the shooting happened on Thursday.\nHe also confirmed that two other people had handled the gun, an antique Colt .45 revolver, before it was given to Mr Baldwin - the film's armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and assistant director Dave Halls.\nMr Halls told investigators he had failed to check all the rounds in the gun before handing it over, according to a court document made public on Wednesday.\nHe reportedly called out \"cold gun\" as he gave it to Mr Baldwin, meaning he believed it to be safe.\nMs Gutierrez-Reed, meanwhile, told investigators that guns had been safely secured shortly before the shooting but ammunition had not been. She said guns were usually kept in a safe that only a few people had access to.\n\"We're going to try to determine exactly how [this] happened and if they should have known that there was a live round in that firearm,\" Sheriff Mendoza said.\nMr Baldwin and the film's producers have hired a private law firm to conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the shooting, according to the Reuters news agency. \nSeveral legal experts, however, have said it is unlikely that criminal charges will be filed against Mr Baldwin.\nThe actor, known for his work on shows like 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live, is named as both an actor and producer on Rust. He is co-operating with investigators and has expressed his shock over what he described as a \"tragic accident\".\nThe incident has sparked debate about safety regulations on Hollywood sets and the use of prop guns on productions. \n\"Obviously I think the industry has had a record recently of being safe,\" Sheriff Mendoza told reporters. \"[But] I think there are some safety issues that need to be addressed by the industry and possibly by the state of New Mexico.\""

      "text": "NI's finance minister has played down expectations of significant extra money as a result of the UK spending review.\nThe chancellor's announcement on Wednesday will set the executive's spending limits for three years.\nConor Murphy said a multiyear budget \"provides an opportunity to better plan and prioritise finances.\"\nHe said there was \"little indication\" that the government would \"provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery\".\nThe amount of money available to Stormont and the other devolved administrations is set by the Barnett formula.\nIt is a population-based share of additional funding announced for England.\nOn Sunday Chancellor Rishi Sunak said \"strong investment in public services\" would be at the heart of his plans for rebuilding the economy.\nHe said: \"One of the elements of building a stronger economy is having strong public services, and you will see that next week - whether it's the NHS, which we've already taken steps to support significantly to recover from coronavirus, children, schools, skills, all of these things, policing and crime.\"\nAsked if he would raise public sector wages in line with inflation, the chancellor said: \"That will be one of the things we talk about.\n\"Over the past year, we took a decision to have a more targeted approach to public sector pay,\" he continued, but added: \"Going forward we'll have to set a new pay policy and that'll be a topic for next week's spending review.\"\nWriting in the Irish News, Conor Murphy expressed scepticism about what the chancellor would deliver and again called on the executive to prioritise health spending on Stormont's budget.\nHe said: \"While the indications are that the spending review outcome will not be good for the executive, a collective approach can produce a budget that finally brings down waiting lists on a sustainable basis.\"\nMr Murphy also said that increasing domestic rates, a locally controlled property tax, would not give Stormont much extra spending power.\n\"I would caution that a 1% increase in domestic rates generates less than \u00a33m,\" he said.\n\"To put that into context, a 22% increase in domestic rates would be needed to pay for a 1% increase in the health budget.\""

      "tags": "Julian Assange,Wikileaks",
      "text": "Lawyers for the US have told the High Court the judge who blocked Julian Assange's extradition was misled by his psychiatrist.\nThe United States government is starting a legal appeal to try to get the Wikileaks founder extradited.\nIn January, a court ruled Mr Assange could not be extradited to the US due to concerns over his mental health.\nMr Assange is wanted over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011.\nThe documents revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents during the war in Afghanistan, while leaked Iraq war files showed the 66,000 civilians had been killed and prisoners tortured by Iraqi forces.\nThe US says the leaks broke the law and endangered lives, but Mr Assange says the case is politically motivated.\nHis lawyer told the court that the risk of suicide would be \"imminent the moment extradition becomes likely\".\nIn January, the district judge overseeing the US's extradition appeal, Vanessa Baraitser, said Mr Assange's publication of classified military and government documents arguably amounted to a crime. But he could not be transferred to the US because he was unwell and could take his own life.  \nOn Wednesday, James Lewis QC, representing the US, told the Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justice Holroyde that conclusion was wrong. \nHe said Mr Assange's psychiatrist had misled the earlier judge and the US had not been given an opportunity to answer her concerns. \nMr Assange, 50, is wanted in the US on allegations of a conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information following Wikileaks' publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. \nThe publications include the release in April 2010 of footage showing US soldiers shooting and killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq.\nMr Assange has been in Belmarsh Prison since 2019, when he was carried out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London by police and arrested for breaching his bail conditions.\nHe had been in the embassy since 2012, avoiding extradition to Sweden, where he faced sex offence allegations. He has always denied those and they were eventually dropped.\nOn Wednesday morning, Mr Assange's legal team initially told judges he would not attend because he was not well. He later attended via a video link from prison.\nUS lawyers said it had now given four binding assurances as to how Mr Assange would be treated:  \nMr Lewis said the assurances were binding on the United States.\nHe said the previous judge's approach \"carries with it the risk of rewarding fugitives for their flight, and of creating an anomaly between the approach of the courts in domestic criminal proceedings, and in extradition\".\nMr Lewis said that Mr Assange's psychiatrist, Prof Michael Kopelman, had misled the court about Mr Assange's psychiatric state by concealing his relationship with his partner, Stella Moris, and that they had two children together.\nThe lawyer for the US argued this meant the judge could not consider the true risks of Mr Assange taking his own life, because the need to protect children can be a factor that discourages people from suicide.\nHe also said that during cross-examination, Prof Kopelman would not accept that Mr Assange could be safe in the US - even if he received a short sentence and reasonable time with other inmates.\nMr Lewis called psychiatrist Prof Seena Fazel from the University of Oxford, who said he did not share the defence's view that Mr Assange would certainly take his own life in the US. \nMr Assange's lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald QC, said the risk of suicide is \"not something in the future - it is something imminent the moment that extradition becomes likely\".\nHe said Parliament had given district judges the power to protect \"mentally disordered\" people from extradition to countries where the UK has no control over their treatment.\nHe said that in January, the judge took the evidence fully into account and relied on the fact Mr Assange would be isolated and deprived of the protections he had in Belmarsh. \nThe US assurances were \"caveated, vague or simply ineffective\", he said, calling the suggestion that he could be detained in Australia \"meaningless\", as the country has not said it would accept him.\nSupporters, family members and friends of Mr Assange outside court expressed their \"outrage\" after he did not attend his hearing in person.\nThey said they were concerned he was thin, he was not there to instruct his lawyers or clarify what was going on in court. \nThe High Court hearing is expected to end on Thursday with a decision at a later date."

      "tags": "Chancellor's Autumn Statement,Rishi Sunak",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out changes to universal credit he says will give low income families an extra \u00a31,000 a year.\nIn an upbeat Budget speech, he said the UK economy had not been hit as hard by the Covid pandemic as expected.\nHe promised more money for schools, business rate cuts and took 3p off the price of a pint of beer.\nLabour said his universal credit measure would not make up for axing the \u00a320-a-week top-up to the benefit.\nThe chancellor painted a positive picture of the health of the UK economy as it emerges from the pandemic, in his autumn statement to a packed House of Commons.\n\"Employment is up. Investment is growing. Public services are improving. The public finances are stabilising. And wages are rising,\" he told MPs.\n\"Today's Budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people: stronger growth, with the UK recovering faster than our major competitors.\"\nHe said unemployment had not hit the levels feared at the height of the pandemic - but inflation was set to rise further, from 3.1% to 4% over the next year.\nMuch of his Budget had been pre-announced, including an end to the public sector pay freeze and an increase to the National Living Wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50.\nBut Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News the \"almost non-existent\" increase in living standards predicted over the next five years was a \"big blow\" to families.\nHousehold disposable income is set to rise by 0.8% per year, according to Office for Budget Responsibility figures.\nEconomic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023.\nNew Budget measures included:\nThe teetotal chancellor also announced plans to \"radically simplify\" alcohol tax, so that it was based purely on the strength of the drink. \nTaxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine and \"white ciders\", from 2023.\nHe also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled.\nAnd he scrapped next year's planned increase in business rates in England and promised more frequent revaluations, and tax breaks for firms that make improvements to their properties, from 2023.\nIn further moves to boost the leisure industry as it emerges from the pandemic, he announced a 50% business rate discount for pubs, cinemas, restaurants, gyms and other venues.\nRishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory - who doesn't like heavy taxes, who doesn't like big government. \nBut he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. \nNor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. \nInstead, his plans increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. \nMr Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge; less keen to remind you that they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. \nDespite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Mr Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election.  \nBut with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even if they could so with cheaper cider or prosecco.\nThe chancellor waited until the end of his 70 minute speech to announce changes to universal credit, which come after a widely condemned \u00a320-a-week cut to the benefit earlier this month.\nThe universal credit \"taper\" will be cut, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every \u00a31 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p.\nThe amount people can earn before starting to lose the benefit will also increase by \u00a3500 a year. The new rate will be introduced by 1 December, he told MPs.\n\"This is a tax cut next year worth over \u00a32bn,\" said the chancellor.\n\"Nearly two million families will keep, on average, an extra \u00a31,000 a year.\"\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour welcomed the move but it would not make up for the \u00a36bn cut from universal credit earlier this month, which affected five million families. \n\"Even after this reduction, working people on universal credit still face a higher marginal tax rate than the prime minister. And those unable to work - through no fault of their own - still face losing over \u00a31,000 a year,\" she said.\nThe opposition leader normally responds to the chancellor's Budget speech, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid.\nMs Reeves, who was drafted in to replace him at the last minute, said Mr Sunak had \"no coherent plan\" to deal with cost of living crisis facing many families, with rising energy bills, food prices and tax increases.\nShe told MPs Mr Sunak was a chancellor that \"gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other\".\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, branded the chancellor's planned cut to domestic air passenger duty a \"disgrace\", asking what kind of message it sent to the world on the eve of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nThe Liberal Democrats said cutting bank taxes would cost the Treasury more than \u00a33.8bn over the next four years, compared with \u00a31.8bn extra to help school pupils catch up.\n\"He is offering a measly pound a day of extra catch up funding for each child, six times less than the tax cut being offered to the Conservatives' banker buddies,\" said leader Sir Ed Davey."

People keep phoning and asking if I've seen them,\" he said.\n\"I'd love them to call in for a beer. My wife will probably faint, I would imagine, if Ryan Reynolds walks through the door.\"\nMr Jones said the actors would be coming to his pub to film the promotion for their access-all-areas documentary, Welcome to Wrexham, on Thursday.\nThe Turf Hotel was where Wrexham AFC was first formed in 1864, he said.\nThe Roberts family, who are Wrexham fans, said the club owners' visit had \"really brought the town to life\".\n\"Everyone seems to know about it,\" said Shaun Roberts. \nHe said he was stopped in Torquay a few months ago and asked about the football club owners because he was wearing a Wrexham shirt.\n\"It's really given a bit of oomph to Wrexham,\" his wife Rachel added. \"It's something to perk us up a bit.\"\nWrexham fan Daniel Sides was on his way to buy an away kit from the club store on Wednesday morning.\n\"I think it's still a bit of a dream where I'm waiting to be woken up, to be honest,\" he said.\n\"It's going to generate a lot of buzz with a lot of the people around the town centre as well because obviously they're megastars.\"\nLandlord Mr Jones said the game against Maidenhead had given the stars \"a crash course in what supporting Wrexham is all about\".\n\"It wouldn't have been the Wrexham way if we had turned up and walloped them 7-0 last night,\" he said.\n\"If they didn't know what to expect, they certainly do now.\"\nBut he added \"a lot of fans are a little bit disgruntled\" about the club's performance.\nThe actors were accompanied to the match by a crew filming their documentary.\n\"As nice as it is to have them, we need to remember that we're a football team and we need to focus on the points,\" Jones said.\n\"We need to get the football right first.\"\nRob McElhenney joked in a tweet afterwards that they \"didn't want our first win to be away anyway\" and that they would see the club play their next game at home on Saturday.\nWrexham manager Phil Parkinson had been told beforehand that Reynolds and McElhenney would be at the game, but neither he nor the players met with the pair ahead of the game.\nHe said: \"They flew in and they were trying to keep a low profile but I imagine it's fairly difficult to be low profile, and they let us get on with it.\n\"We look forward to meeting them later in the week.\""

      "text": "A new chapter in physics has opened, according to scientists who have been searching for a vital building block of the Universe.\nA major experiment has been used to search for an elusive sub-atomic particle: a key component of the matter that makes up our everyday lives.\nThe search failed to find the particle, known as the sterile neutrino.\nThis will now direct physicists towards even more interesting theories to help explain how the Universe came to be.\nProf Mark Thomson, the executive chair of the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), which funds the UK's contribution to the Microboone experiment, described the result as ''pretty exciting''.\nThat is because a sizeable proportion of physicists have been developing their theories on the basis that the existence of the sterile neutrino was a possibility. \n''This has been out there for a long time now and generated a lot of interest,'' Prof Thomson told BBC News.\n''The result is really interesting because it has an influence on emerging theories in particle physics and cosmology.''\nThe Microboone experiment is based at the US Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois - just outside Chicago. But physicists from many countries are involved with the project.\nNeutrinos are ghostly sub-atomic particles that permeate the Universe, but barely interact with the everyday world around us. Each second, billions of them pass right through the Earth - and everyone living on it.\nNeutrinos come in three known types, or flavours - the electron, muon and tau. In 1998, Japanese researchers discovered that neutrinos changed from one flavour to another as they travelled.\nThis flavour-flipping cannot fully be explained by the current \"big theory\" of sub-atomic physics - called the Standard Model. Some physicists believe that finding out why the neutrino has such a tiny mass - which is what allows them to change flavour - will give them a deeper understanding of how the Universe works and specifically how it came into being.\nCurrent theories suggest that, shortly after the Big Bang, there were equal amounts of matter and its shadowy mirror-image anti-matter. However, when matter collides with anti-matter, they violently annihilate each other, releasing energy.  If there were equal amounts in the early Universe, they should have cancelled each other out.\nInstead, most of the Universe today is made of matter, with much smaller amounts of anti-matter.\nSome scientists believe that, contained within the neutrino's flavour-changing, is the cosmic sleight-of-hand that enabled some matter to survive after the Big Bang and create the planets, stars and galaxies that make up the Universe.\nIn the 1990s, an experiment called the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector experiment at the US Department for Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico saw the production of more electron neutrinos than could be explained by the three-neutrino flavour-flipping theory. That result was confirmed by a separate experiment tin 2002.\nPhysicists proposed the existence of a fourth flavour called the sterile neutrino. They believed this form of the particle could explain the over-production of electron neutrinos and, crucially, give an insight into why the particles change flavour. \nThey were named sterile neutrinos because they are predicted not to interact with matter at all, whereas other neutrinos can - though very rarely. Detecting a sterile neutrino would have been a bigger discovery in sub-atomic physics than the Higgs boson because, unlike other forms of neutrino and the Higgs particle, it is not part of the current Standard Model of physics. \nA team involving nearly 200 scientists from five countries developed and built the Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment, or Microboone, in order to find it. Microboone consists of 150 tonnes of hardware in a space that's the size of a lorry.\nIts detectors are highly sensitive: its observations of the sub-atomic world have been likened to looking in ultra-high definition.\nThe team has now announced that four separate analyses of data gathered by the experiment show \"no hint\" of the sterile neutrino. \nBut this result is not so much the end of the story, but the beginning of a new chapter.\nDr Sam Zeller from Fermilab says that the non-detection does not have to contradict previous findings. \n\"The earlier data doesn't lie,\" she said.\n\"There's something really interesting happening that we still need to explain. Data is steering us away from the likely explanations and pointing toward something more complex and interesting, which is really exciting.\"\nProf Justin Evans, from the University of Manchester, believes that the puzzle posed by the latest findings marks a turning point in neutrino research. \n\"Every time we look at neutrinos, we seem to find something new or unexpected,\" he said. \n\"Microboone's results are taking us in a new direction, and our neutrino programme is going to get to the bottom of some of these mysteries.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"

      "text": "Australia has confirmed it will lift a ban next week that has prevented its own citizens travelling overseas without permission.\nAustralians have spent 19 months under some of the world's strictest border rules, in an effort to keep out Covid.\nFrom 1 November people will no longer need an exemption to leave the country - provided they are fully vaccinated.\nOnly Australians are eligible but some rules for foreigners will be relaxed soon, the government said.\n\"Before the end of the year, we anticipate welcoming fully vaccinated skilled workers and international students,\" Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said in a statement.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison had foreshadowed the reopening of Australia's border, saying it was \"time to give Australians their lives back\".\nThe changes have been met with delight by Australians and others globally. Many have spent long periods separated from loved ones.\n\"But I'll believe the borders have reopened when I see it and hear the stories of stranded Aussies being able to get home uninhibited,\" Amy Hayes, who lives in England, told the BBC earlier this month.\nA surge in vaccinations has allowed some Australian states to end their strategy of eliminating all cases.\nMr Morrison has said Australia is \"very close\" to agreeing to a travel bubble with Singapore. On Tuesday the Asian city-state said it would allow fully vaccinated Australians, permanent residents and their families to enter without quarantine from 8 November.\nBut states such as Queensland and Western Australia have threatened to keep their borders closed until vaccine rates are even higher.\nAt present, people can leave Australia - which has recorded more than 160,000 Covid infections and 1,653 deaths - only for exceptional reasons such as essential work or visiting a dying relative.\nEntry is permitted for citizens and others with exemptions, but there are tight caps on arrival numbers. This has left tens of thousands stranded overseas.\nAustralians under 12 will be exempt from the new vaccination requirement for travel. \nAll other unvaccinated travellers still need exemptions and must quarantine for 14 days in hotels on return."

      "text": "The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned.\nIts latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022.\nHowever, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%.\nThe chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained.\nRishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as \"strong\" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously.\nHowever, he acknowledged the inflation rate was \"likely to rise further\" from its 3.1% rate in September.\nHe said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns.\n\"The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\"It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight.\"\nThe UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR said in its latest report.\nThe OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThe independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses. \nIt previously said it had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and \"in response to a request from the chancellor\".\nRichard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer.\nBut the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term \"scarring\" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%.\nThe effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said.\nBut it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021.\nIn 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March.\nGrowth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.\nWhile the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months. \nThe OBR reckons inflation will hit 4.4.%; it warns it may go as high as 5%. And, it makes clear that leaving the EU has heightened the UK's experience of the bottlenecks that are bumping up business costs, that in turn will lead to higher prices.  \nThat higher cost of living, together with looming tax rises will dampen the effect of wage rises over the next couple of years. \nStrip out inflation and the OBR reckons that household income after tax will only recover to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2023. And those lost years of prosperity increases could weigh on growth - and sentiment in the run up to the next election.\nHigher inflation is also likely to put pressure on how much the chancellor is able to spend in the future.\nBut Mr Sunak has been offered some room for manoeuvre, as the improving economic picture and higher tax incomes means the government will not have to borrow as much.\nBorrowing hit a record \u00a3319.9bn during the 2020 financial year as the government poured money into pandemic support schemes such as furlough.\nIt is now forecast to fall every year between 2021 and 2026. \nJane Mackay, head of tax at audit, tax, advisory and risk firm Crowe, said there was still a \"huge\" Covid bill to deal with, though.\n\"The Budget statement hasn't really given us clarity on who will pay that bill. \n\"The tax increases that were announced before the Budget, including corporation tax rising to 25%, and the NHS and social care levy additional NICs of 1.25%, might suggest the strategy will spread the burden as widely as possible, rather than to make the structural changes to our tax system that may be what is really needed.\"\nA risk of rising inflation as well is that it will increase the amount of interest the government needs to pay back on what it has borrowed for pandemic spending.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned in September that it \"will have to act\" over rising inflation.\nThe Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4%, before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid.\nThe UK's central bank can raise interest rates in an attempt to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In theory, when borrowing costs rise - which would make loans such as mortgages more expensive - people spend less and prices are driven down.\nMr Sunak said on Wednesday that he had written to the Bank to \"reaffirm their remit to achieve low and stable inflation\". \nInvestors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's 2% target.\nHowever, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%.\nThe governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought."

      "tags": "Gazprom,Russia,Moldova,Natural gas",
      "text": "His country is immersed in a gas crisis. But Nicu Popescu is trying to remain positive. \n\"On Monday our country made history,\" Moldova's foreign minister tells me. \"For the first time Moldova bought gas from a source that was not Russia's Gazprom.\"\nThe gas shipment from Poland's PGNiG was one million cubic metres. \nMoldova will need much larger volumes if Gazprom does what it has threatened to do: turn off the gas taps.\nUp until now, 100% of Moldova's gas has come from Russia. But the contract to supply it expired at the end of September. Gazprom raised the price and Moldova balked at paying it. In the absence of a new deal, the Russian energy giant reduced supplies, prompting Moldova to declare a 30-day state of emergency. Gazprom accused Moldova of \"provoking a crisis\" and demanded repayment of a $709m (\u00a3514m) debt, which Moldova disputes. \nNegotiations continue. Moldovan officials say they would like to sign a new contract with Gazprom, but only if the terms are favourable. \nIf there is no deal with Russia, could Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, buy enough gas elsewhere? \n\"It's the worst time to have a gas crisis at home,\" Mr Popescu admits. \"The prices are higher than ever. We see this market crunch on a global scale. But we've had support. In recent years Romania built a new gas pipeline into Moldova which gives us a safety valve. We've also had some advice from the European Union on how to diversify a country's gas supply within a few days.\" \nLike many enterprises in Moldova, the sugar factory in Drochia has been affected by the gas shortage.\n\"We're able to use just a quarter of the gas we need,\" manager Rostislav Magdei explains. \"We're topping that up with alternative sources of energy. We hope our government will compensate any losses arising from the high price of fuel.\"\nOnce in Moscow's orbit, Moldova has been tilting from Russia towards the West more recently.\nThe country's leadership is now pro-European and supports closer ties with the EU. Many here suspect that the gas crisis is the Kremlin's way of expressing its disapproval. \n\"This year we had parliamentary elections and the pro-Russia party lost,\" says Sergiu Tofilat, former energy adviser to the president of Moldova. \"We have a pro-Western party in power here. So, Russia changed its approach on the gas supply. The Kremlin wants to punish the Moldovan people for voting against a pro-Russia party. It's pure politics.\"\n\"Vladimir Putin is trying to keep former Soviet countries within the area of influence of the Kremlin. We do not want to stay on our knees in front of Moscow. We must say no to Russian blackmail and we have the opportunity now to get rid of Russian influence in Moldova.\" \nThe Kremlin denies using energy as a weapon. President Putin recently dismissed the suggestion as \"utter nonsense, drivel and politically-motivated tittle-tattle.\"\nEUROPEAN CRISIS: Is Russia squeezing Europe's gas supply? \nWHAT NEXT? Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions \nFor Moldova, though, reducing Russia's influence won't be easy. In energy terms, Moldova is closely tied to Moscow. Not only has the country been 100% dependent on Russian gas. But its own gas company, Moldovagaz, is majority-owned by Gazprom. And more than 80% of Moldova's electricity comes from a Russian-owned power plant in Trans-Dniester - a separatist region of Moldova, backed economically, politically and militarily by Moscow. \nIf you think of gas negotiations as a game of poker, then Russia has a very strong hand. \nBut Trans-Dniester could prove to be a weak point for Moscow.\n\"Gazprom needs a gas contract with Moldova so that it can supply the breakaway region, too, with gas,\" says Sergiu Tofilat. \"Gazprom is a public company, with shares listed on the stock exchange.

      "tags": "Science policy,Chancellor's Autumn Statement,Budget 2021",
      "text": "The chancellor will increase science spending to \u00a320bn a year by 2024 - \u00a32bn less than he pledged in 2020.\nThe boost was announced in the Budget by Rishi Sunak on Wednesday.\nThere is some disappointment among many scientific leaders - but the commitment to sustained additional investment has been welcomed by some.\nThe President of the UK's Royal Society, Prof Sir Adrian Smith, told BBC news that the settlement sent out a positive signal.\n\"It is not absolutely ideal. But we are grown-ups. There are real pressures on the economy, but the government is saying that it really does recognise that R&D [research and development] is absolutely vital,\" he said.\nAlthough the chancellor's increase is less many had hoped for, it is more than some had feared. Last week, those negotiating with the Treasury told BBC News they were getting clear signals that the commitment to increase spending to \u00a322bn a year would be kicked into the long grass. \nScientific and business leaders lobbied hard, arguing that a long deferral of scientific investment would mean that other countries, which are investing more in research, would overtake the UK.\nThose sources say that the Mr Sunak seems to have listened to those arguments. The chancellor said that the commitment of \u00a322bn would be pushed back by two years to 2026. But that will be after the next General Election, when someone else might have Mr Sunak's job - and take a different view. \nBut the Chancellor has promised to deliver what has been described as a sizeable increase of around \u00a35bn before the end of this Parliament. That's a 33% increase on top of the current research budget of \u00a315bn a year. What is notable is that the bulk of the increase will come in 2023, so a large amount of the additional funding for science is not that far away. \nSome \u00a32bn of that increase is for membership of the EU's collaborative research programme, Horizon Europe. BBC News reported earlier this week that the UK's access to the programme was being used as a bargaining chip in wider negotiations with the EU over the status of Northern Ireland.\nNow that the money has been allocated to the science budget, research leaders have a clear choice between spending it on membership fees or on doing more science. The Treasury itself is understood to feel that spending money on Horizon Europe is an inefficient use of funds but will leave the decision to the scientific community.\nSir Jeremy Farrar, who is director of the Wellcome Trust, believes that, given the financial pressures the chancellor faces, this is not a bad settlement.\n\"We welcome the government's ongoing commitment to making the UK a science superpower. But it will need to continue to increase investment in science to catch up with other leading science nations. The UK's investment in R&D as a proportion of GDP lags behind the OECD average, and it will take time to change that,\" he said.\nScientific and business leaders say that the most important aspect of the science settlement is that they now have a firm timetable and an upward trajectory for science spending. According to the president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, Prof Sir Jim McDonald, that sends out a clear message to the private sector thinking of investing in research and to overseas scientists and businesses thinking of coming to Britain. \n\"The comprehensive package of investment for R&D announced today gives much needed confidence to businesses that the UK is a great place to invest. The measures outlined by the chancellor today will stimulate innovation for a better, faster and more resilient recovery.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter."

      "tags": "School funding,State schools,Budget 2021",
      "text": "Funding per pupil in England's schools is to be restored to 2010 levels over the next three years, the Chancellor has announced.\nThis means an extra \u00a34.7bn for schools in England by 2024-2025 and a cash increase for every child of \u00a31,500, Rishi Sunak said.\nBut it will not cover the 9% fall in funding since 2009 - the biggest cut in 40 years.\nThe Chancellor also pledged an extra \u00a32bn for education recovery from Covid.\nThis brings spending on Covid catch-up since 2019 to nearly \u00a35bn, Mr Sunak said in his Budget statement.\nThe recovery fund falls far short of what education unions and the former catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, said was required - around \u00a315bn.\nAnd the cash injection in basic school funding is unlikely to meet the hopes of teachers and head teachers in the biggest unions.\nThe spending will also have to cover any rise in teachers' pay, which has been signalled with the announcement that the public sector pay freeze would be lifted.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"Even in the best-case analysis this still represents no growth in school funding for 15 years, and this commitment does not address the stark reality in 16-19 education where the learner rate is far too low. \n\"What we do know is that school and college budgets are very thinly stretched and the financial situation continues to be extremely difficult.\n\"The additional funding for education recovery following the Covid pandemic is nowhere near what is needed. \n\"Alongside other education organisations and school trusts, we submitted in August a proposal for an additional \u00a35.8 billion of spending over the next three years focused in particular on supporting disadvantaged young people.\"\nNational Education Union joint general secretary, Kevin Courtney said:\"Taking so long to restore the cuts made from 2010 onwards should not be a matter of pride for any Government, but one of embarrassment.\"\nA recent snapshot survey of 1,500 heads for the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) found almost a third were already making budget cuts last year with 35% expecting to make cuts this academic year.\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, said: \"Children and young people have been hugely affected by the pandemic. The government has made bold claims about 'levelling up' and 'no child left behind'. The investment announced today doesn't meet those goals or the futures needs of the country.\n\"The increase in per pupil spending announced by the government takes us back to 2010 levels. This is no proud boast, as it represents a failure to invest in children's futures for over a decade.\n\"Schools will do their best with what they are given, as they always do. It is important that schools are able to spend recovery money flexibly on the programmes they know work best for the children in most need in their schools.\"\nThere was a surprise additional \u00a32 billion for education recovery in England in today's Budget, taking the total so far to around \u00a35 billion.  This will be welcomed but it falls far short of the more substantial  \u00a310 to \u00a315 billion called for by education charities, unions and the government's former advisor Sir Kevan Collins. \nThey have pointed to a disadvantage gap which has widened during the pandemic. Schools facing rising costs from heating bills, national insurance and teachers pay will be disappointed that overall spending per pupil is not being given a greater uplift.   Instead the Chancellor confirmed that by 2024-25 per pupil spending in England's schools will be restored, in real terms,  to the same level as 2010. \nThere was also confirmation of funding to increase the number of places for children with special educational needs and disabilities. \nThe Chancellor also announced an additional \u00a3170m by 2024-25 for the funding paid to nurseries and early years providers for state-backed nursery places.\nNeil Leitch, of the Early Years Alliance, welcomed the extra money but said: \"As always, however, the devil is in the detail and we await further confirmation on how exactly this funding will translate into rate increases for the sector over the coming years. \n\"While the annual level of investment our sector is set to receive over the next three years will result in a higher increase in early entitlement funding rates than we have seen over recent years, there is still an incredibly long way to go to make up the \u00a32.60 per hour funding shortfall that the government's own cost calculations revealed.\n\"What's more, we know that for many nurseries, pre-schools and childminders, even remaining afloat until next April is set to be a real struggle. As such, we would urge the government to look at what short-term, emergency support can be given to those providers already on the brink of closure.  "

      "text": "The UK's new polar research ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, has completed basic sea trials and is ready to undertake its first expedition.\nThe vessel came up the Thames on Wednesday through the Woolwich Barrier and is now tied up in Greenwich.\nIt is spending a few days at the home of the Prime Meridian to enable the public to see it, but also to mark the start of the COP26 climate conference.\nWorld governments meet in the Scottish city of Glasgow from Sunday.\nThe Attenborough, named after the TV naturalist and BBC presenter Sir David, is the ship the public wanted to call \"Boaty McBoatface\" in an online poll but were overruled by ministers. \nInternational senior scientific advisers are using the Attenborough as a platform to issue a statement about the urgent need to address the climate crisis.\nThey want to see a concerted drive to develop - and use - the technologies that will keep global temperature rise to1.5C and underpin the net zero economies of tomorrow.\nThese technologies include better ways of creating, storing and using low-emissions energy - including improving semiconductors, batteries and low-emitting fuel production - as well as work on heating and cooling, and carbon capture and storage.\n\"I think the first thing to say is sticking to 1.5 is both important and achievable,\" Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, told BBC News.  \n\"But it's only achievable if we get urgent action. If you work back, for example, from 2050, and ask what you need to do, you can't rely on something coming along late in the day and saving us. It's about utilising the technologies we have now, getting them in place as soon as we can at scale. And that in itself requires R&D (research and development), and making sure that we use both technology, and, of course, natural actions, and the behavioural changes that we all need to take.\"  \nThe 129m-long Attenborough has spent the past year in shake-down trials around the British coast.\nIts first ocean voyage will go to Antarctica for the new austral summer research season.\nThe vessel must deliver supplies to the UK's main scientific base, at Rothera, on the continent's peninsula, as well as to other minor stations dotted around the Southern Ocean.\nIt is expected to head south on or around 18 November.\nEngineers will want to check its performance in sea-ice, something they haven't had the chance to do.\nThe Attenborough is what's termed a Polar Class 4 icebreaker, which means it should have the strength to crash through metre-thick floes at a steady pace and without damage to its hull.\nThe \u00a3200m ship is state of the art. It has a helipad (helicopters are essential for exploration and safety), cranes and onboard labs, and it has an enhanced ability to deploy subs and other ocean-survey and sampling equipment.\nThe Attenborough was the product of lessons learned after decades of operations in the frozen south and north, said Dr Rob Larter.\n\"The way science has progressed means you now have to be able to handle much bigger gear. So, that's why this ship has these very big cranes and gantries,\" the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) marine geophysicist told BBC News.\n\"You also need to be very flexible, because there's so many different sorts of science that people want to do now. We have laboratories that come in containers, like for example a radioisotope lab, an ultra-clean chemistry lab and an experimental aquarium. These can all be added to the ship.\" \nThe Attenborough will be at the forefront of understanding how Earth's atmosphere and oceans are warming, and the impacts the temperature rise will have, in particular, on the ice-covered waters and lands of the Arctic and Antarctic.\nSir David was present on Thursday to inspect his namesake.\nHis hope, he said, was that world leaders meeting at COP26 would listen to the science and take action to curb global warming. \n\"I am indeed a very proud man to be standing in this remarkable vessel, to be associated in any way with best, the British Antarctic Survey,\" he told his audience.\n\"May I wish this ship and all who sail in her, and all the scientists who research on board, bon voyage on her forthcoming voyage to the Antarctic. I know that the findings made on this ship in the next few years will be of the greatest value and importance to the welfare of the world. Let us listen to the science.\"\nBAS scientists have already established, for example, how the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica, actually helps to shield us from the worst effects of global heating. \nOceanographer Dr Emma Boland explained: \"The Southern Ocean takes up about 40% of the carbon dioxide that the oceans as a whole take up, even though it only accounts for 20% of the total ocean surface area. So, it's doing double the work. \n\"And if that CO2 didn't get taken up by the ocean, it'd be in the atmosphere, and global warming at the surface as we experience it, as human beings, would be that much worse.\"\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nScientists have even calculated a value for this \"service\" provided by the Southern Ocean: \u00a360bn per year (\u20ac72bn/yr). In other words, if the Southern Ocean didn't exist, this is how much it would cost to remove the CO2 from the atmosphere in a different way.\nThe new Royal Research Ship is tied up to a pontoon in the Thames a short distance from the famous 19th-Century tea clipper, the Cutty Sark.\nThe public won't be able to board the Attenborough, but they will be able to visit an associated exhibition hosted by the Royal Museums Greenwich called \"Ice Worlds\". This will showcase live virtual tours of the polar ship on a big screen, alongside a range of interactive stands."

Moreover, staff who have spoken out have faced retaliation, such as having their hours cut or being fired, organisers say. \n\"I'm going on strike because despite years of protests, McDonald's still refuses to take responsibility for the countless women and teenagers who face harassment on the job at its stores across the globe,\" said Jamelia Fairley, a McDonald's worker in Sanford, Florida.\n\"No matter what McDonald's says, not much has changed for workers like me.\"\nIn a 2020 survey of nearly 800 female workers at McDonald's restaurants and franchises, three-quarters said they were harassed at work. \nIn the same survey, which was commissioned by unions, 71% said that they suffered consequences for reporting the behaviour.\nAfter a review of workplace safety earlier this year, McDonald's said it will require all workers, at both corporate and franchise-owned stores, to undergo anti-harassment training from next January. \nHowever, campaigners say the announcement is \"short on specifics\", including what might happen to those who fail to follow the rules. \nIn a statement, McDonald's said it was committed to \"thoroughly investigating\" allegations at its corporate-owned restaurants, and that it expected its franchisees to \"uphold a similar standard\".\n\"Every single person working at a McDonald's restaurant deserves to feel safe and respected when they come to work, and sexual harassment and assault have no place in any McDonald's restaurant,\" it said.\n\"We know more work is needed to further our workplace ambitions, which is why all 40,000 McDonald's restaurants [worldwide] will be assessed and accountable to global brand standards.\n\"These standards prioritise action in multiple areas, including prevention of harassment, discrimination and retaliation.\""

      "tags": "Tax,Personal finance,UK taxes,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "Rishi Sunak might liken himself to a reluctant taxman, but his strategic decision has been to spend at the same time as keeping borrowing down, so taxation has taken the hit.\nThere are four big figures that tell the broad story here.\nThe really good news is that unemployment is now forecast to peak at 5.2%.\nHowever, a significant spike in inflation to higher than 4%, set to last a year or so, partly reflects rising energy and fuel prices.\nMeanwhile, taxation as a proportion of the economy at 36.2% is at its highest level since the 1950s Labour Atlee government.\nAnd spending as a proportion of the economy, at nearly 42%, is at its highest sustained level since the 1970s.\nAll that leaves the British state under a Conservative government permanently bigger as a legacy of the pandemic.\nBut borrowing at the end of the new forecast is even lower than forecast before the pandemic.\nAnd so the big story is that the corporation tax rises from the March Budget, required to shore up public finances after bad forecasts, have been kept as they were, even as those bad forecasts have been reversed. \nThere might have been some room to delay those tax rises or extend the corporation super deduction.\nBut that extra taxation has been kept to be deployed mainly in terms of extra spending. \nThat spending has been sprinkled towards some help with cost of living, and some surgery on the economy to improve skills and long term productivity. \nUnprotected areas of the public finances forecast for a continuing squeeze have all been topped up. All will now enjoy rising spending.\nTo be clear, the slowing in the rise in unemployment would have been scarcely believable 18 months ago and is the best measure of the pandemic economic rescue plan's success.\nBut before the Budget, I raised the question as to whether, after furlough, the public were becoming used to the idea that the government should solve problems such as rising living costs. \nDespite the chancellor's protestations of his love for low, tax free-market conservatism, his actions show an attachment to higher tax and spending.\nWith new restraints on the ability to borrow, delivering on lowering this tax burden will require the economy to grow far more robustly than the disappointing rates forecast after 2023 of as low as 1.3%.\nSmall wonder that the chancellor was proclaiming a \"new era of optimism\" for the economy. \nTo deliver on his promises to reverse tax rises, that isn't just a hope, it's a necessity.

      "tags": "Sewage,Conservative Party,Water pollution,House of Lords",
      "text": "The government says it will force water companies to make a \"progressive reduction\" in the sewage it dumps in rivers, amid pressure from the Lords. \nPeers proposed a change to the Environment Bill last week in an attempt to cut the pollution, but it did not win enough support from MPs.\nIt led to a backlash on social media, and Lords promising to try again. \nBut Environment Secretary George Eustice has now promised to bolster measures by making them a legal duty.\nHe said the government already had plans in place to require water companies to act on sewage, but added: \"We've listened to the debate in Parliament [and] we will write what was already government policy into [law] to give people the reassurance they seek.\"\nThe crossbench peer who put forward the Lords amendment, the Duke of Wellington, said he met Mr Eustice earlier on Tuesday ahead of a debate in Parliament on the Environment Bill. \nSpeaking in the Lords, he said was \"grateful for the gesture\", but he had yet to form an opinion on the language of the government's proposal, so would be pushing ahead with his own plan to end the \"revolting practice\".\nThe duke's amendment passed in the Lords by 213 votes to 60, and will now be debated by MPs at a later date.  \nHowever, due to parliamentary rules, his amendment would have to be approved by the Lords anyway to allow the government to replace it with its own plan when the bill returns to the Commons. \nThe environmental issue has come to a head days before the start of the COP26 climate summit, being hosted by the UK in Glasgow.\nThe Environment Agency allows water utilities to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather events, such as prolonged heavy rain.\nThis protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes.\nBut according to the public body's own figures, water companies discharged raw sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times last year, with untreated effluent - including human waste, wet wipes and condoms - released into waterways for more than three million hours in 2020.\nThe Lords agreed an amendment to the Environment Bill that would put a legal duty on water companies and the government to demonstrate progressive reductions in discharges of untreated sewage and required them to \"take all reasonable steps\" to avoid using combined sewer overflows.\nBut when the proposal was voted on by MPs last week, it lost by 265 votes to 202 - even with 22 Tories rebelling against the government to vote in favour of the plan. \nThe government had said the amount of sewage discharged by water companies was \"not acceptable\" and that it had made it \"crystal clear\" to firms that significant reductions must be a priority. \nBut a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the intentions of the Lords' amendment, which it said would involve an overhaul of the UK's Victorian sewerage system - would cost upwards of \u00a3150bn.\n\"That would mean that individuals - every one of us as taxpayers - paying potentially thousands of pounds each as a result,\" they added. \nShortly before the issue was brought up again for debate in the Lords, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs proposed its own amendment for when the bill returns to the Commons.\nThe new legal duty would be placed directly on water companies to make a \"progressive reduction\" in the sewage it dumps into rivers. \nIt follows on from advice it gave the industry's financial regulator, Ofwat, earlier this year, saying water companies must take steps to significantly reduce storm overflows and that the regulator should ensure funding should be approved for them to do so.\nAnd the firms would need to produce \"comprehensive statutory Drainage and Sewerage Management Plans, setting out how they will manage and develop their drainage and sewerage system over a minimum 25-year planning horizon - including how storm overflows will be addressed\".\nA number of peers welcomed the move by the government, but some warned it still may not go far enough, with Labour's Baroness Quin saying she hoped the government would move even further now people across the country were \"waking up to the problem\".\nLabour's shadow environment secretary, Luke Pollard, also said the \"screeching u-turn\" on the issue due to the public backlash would \"do little to convince the public that the health of our rivers, rather than the health of Conservative polling, is at the forefront of ministers' minds\".\nHe added: \"The government still has no clear plan and no grip on the issue of raw sewage being pumped into our seas and rivers.\""

      "text": "A US government panel has voted to recommend the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine should to be given to children aged five to 11.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experts backed the move on Tuesday, paving the way for emergency authorisation within a matter of weeks. \nIn September, the company said its trial data showed the Covid jab was safe for children in that age group.\nThe US is already giving the vaccine to those aged 12 and over. \nThis latest decision affects some 28 million US children.\nThe decision now awaits further approval from the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They are expected to do that on 2 November, meaning vaccinations could begin the very next day.\nThe FDA's expert panel determined that the benefits of having the jab outweigh any other health risks. \nCompany trial data submitted to regulators in September said the jabs produced a \"robust\" antibody immune response in that age bracket. \nChildren aged five to 11 are given a jab with a third of the dosage given to adults. \nRegulators, however, also had to weigh up the risk of heart inflammation, a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. \nOfficial data from the US shows 160 children aged five to 11 have died of Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. In total, the country has recorded close to 740,000 deaths from the virus.\nBut millions have contracted the illness, thousands of whom ended up in hospital. The US has also reported more than 5,000 cases of a rare inflammatory disease linked to Covid infections, which has killed 46 children.\nOn Monday, Moderna announced it would submit trial data to regulators after a study found its own Covid vaccine produced a \"robust neutralising antibody response\" in children aged six to 11.\nThe UK has just begun to roll out jabs for children aged 12 to 15. The country's chief medical officers recommend one dose of a vaccine for children in that age group, although approaches differ in other countries. \nThis is a landmark decision that could influence practice in other countries, not just the US.\nSome nations, like Israel, have already intimated that they plan to follow suit.\nThe US regulator has carefully weighed the pros and cons and says there is a case for vaccinating younger children against Covid. \nAlthough most children are unlikely to get seriously ill if they catch coronavirus, they may still be infectious, even with no symptoms. \nThe vaccine could help stop them from spreading the virus to others. \nAnd some young children can still get sick with Covid. The vaccine would guard against that too.\nThe world will be watching how the rollout goes with the Pfizer jab and what impact it has on the pandemic. "

We are not concerned with our fears. \n\"We are concerned with fulfilling our duties and responsibilities at this 'period of consequence'.\n\"Starting from 07.00 BST on the morning of Wednesday 27 October, the M25 will become a place of non-violent civil resistance to stop our government committing crimes against humanity.\"\nThe Met Police arrested 17 activists on the A40 in Acton, six of whom had locked themselves to the ground but \"specialist units are on scene to unglue them\", the force said.\nThirty-two people have been arrested by Kent Police after traffic was obstructed at two locations in Dartford.\nThe group - an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion - wants the government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to cut carbon emissions.\nSuzie, 47, a protester from Cambridge, who works in childcare, said: \"If going to prison and losing my home is what it takes to get the government to do the right thing and cut our carbon emissions, then it's a price worth paying.\n\"I can't be a bystander while this government betrays the public, our children and future generations by failing to defend our country from the climate crisis.\"\nShe said she had been arrested 11 times since 13 September.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps has previously accused Insulate Britain of \"risking lives and ruining journeys\".\nHe has said the \"long term solution lies in changes to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill\" to give \"additional powers against disruptive protests\".\nJeremy Kite, leader of Dartford Borough Council, also called for greater powers for police to prevent protests happening.\nMr Kite said: \"The law needs to be beefed up so when they're talking about action in a couple of days' time, or predicting it tomorrow, the police ought to be able to pay them a visit at six o'clock in the morning and make sure they don't go out.\n\"These are people who are just spoiled and entitled and they're narcissistic in their aims, regardless of what they want to achieve, and what they want to do.\n\"There are other, better ways to do it in a free society and you cannot deprive one person of freedom, simply to establish yours.\"\nHe added: \"Quite frankly, some of these people, rather than gluing themselves to a road, it's time they glued themselves to a job or glued themselves to something productive.\"\nThose who break the injunctions could be found in contempt of court and face maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine.\nBut prosecutions for this offence usually take several months.\nMembers of the group were also arrested on Monday after targeting London's financial district in Canary Wharf and the City of London during rush hour, obstructing Limehouse Causeway as well as nearby Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate and Upper Thames Street."

      "tags": "Jair Bolsonaro,Fake News,Brazil,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Brazilian senators have voted to recommend charging President Jair Bolsonaro over his handling of the devastating Covid pandemic.\nA Senate panel backed a report calling for charges against Mr Bolsonaro including crimes against humanity, after 600,000 deaths from coronavirus. \nThe report has been handed to the chief prosecutor, a Bolsonaro appointee.\nThe president has maintained he is \"guilty of absolutely nothing\" but the crisis has dented his popularity.\nBrazil's death toll is second only to that of the United States.\nThere is no guarantee this vote will lead to actual criminal charges, as the report's recommendations must now be assessed by Prosecutor-General Augusto Aras, who is expected to protect the president.\nThe report alleges that Mr Bolsonaro's government pursued a policy of allowing coronavirus to rip through the country in the hope of achieving herd immunity.\nIt describes the president as \"the main person responsible for the errors committed by the federal government during the pandemic\".\nThe report's lead author, centrist Senator Renan Calheiros, called for the panel's recommendation to charge President Bolsonaro with crimes against humanity to be submitted to the International Criminal Court (ICC).\nBrazil is a party to the Rome Statute, which created the ICC, so the international court could take up the case.\nBut a referral would only be a first step in a lengthy process in which it would be up to the ICC to determine the merits of the case and whether to take it forward.\nIn addition to crimes against humanity, the Senate committee has recommended eight further charges be brought against Mr Bolsonaro in Brazilian courts, including incitement to crime, falsification of documents and the violation of social rights.\nMr Bolsonaro is also accused of misusing public funds and spreading fake news about the pandemic.\nThe 1,300-page report also recommended bringing charges against two corporations and 77 other people, including three of the president's adult sons. \nFollowing the announcement, Senator Calheiros said that the \"chaos of Jair Bolsonaro's government will enter history as the lowest level of human destitution\". \nThe vote concludes a six-month inquiry which has highlighted scandals and corruption inside the government. \nThe Senate's recommendation is expected to be delivered to the prosecutor-general on Wednesday morning. His office said it would be carefully reviewed as soon as it was received, the Associated Press reports.\nThroughout the process, Mr Bolsonaro has insisted that his government \"did the right thing from the first moment\" of the pandemic and his allies have been quick to dismiss Tuesday's recommendations as being driven entirely by \"political and electoral\" motivations.\n\"It is a totally political report, without any legal basis,\" said Flavio Bolsonaro, one of the president's sons accused in the report.\n\"The intent of some senators on the investigative committee is to cause the maximum amount of wear and tear on the president.\"\nFormer US President Donald Trump, a Bolsonaro ally, said in a statement he endorsed the Brazilian president because \"he fights hard for, and loves, the people of Brazil\".\nToday marked the end of a long process. Six months of hearings, scandals uncovered, a light shone on a government accused of recklessness. \nJust before the vote, leading senators delivered impassioned speeches. Senator Calheiros said the inquiry had slowed down the clock of death in Brazil. \nThe inquiry's vice-president, Randolfe Rodrigues, underlined how important the process had been to put pressure on the government and speed up vaccinations, and he paid tribute to those on the front line of containing the pandemic.\nBut for many, it's too little, too late - the families of the dead will be wanting to know where this inquiry will lead. Will Mr Bolsonaro have to stand up in court to defend his actions? \nThe inquiry's president, Omar Aziz, said the federal prosecutor had a duty to investigate the evidence gathered these past few months - but not everyone thinks justice will be done. \nIn March, Mr Bolsonaro caused outrage when he told Brazilians to \"stop whining\" about Covid, a day after the country saw a record rise in deaths over a 24-hour period.\nHe has continued to spread misinformation on social media and, on Monday, Facebook removed a video in which the president falsely claimed a link between Covid-19 vaccines and Aids.\nYouTube blocked the video and suspended Mr Bolsonaro's channel for a week.\nBrazil, a country of 208 million people, has recorded at least 606,000 deaths and 21.7 million cases of infection, Johns Hopkins University reports."

      "tags": "Alcohol,Inflation,UK economy,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The price of a pint of beer will have to rise by as much as 30p to help pay for higher wages and energy costs, one pub company has warned. \nAs the government prepares to unveil its Budget, City Pub Group said price rises were \"the only way forward\".\nOn Monday, the government said the National Living Wage would rise to \u00a39.50 per hour in April for those over 23 years old.  \nClive Watson, the chain's boss, said this would cost it about \u00a31m a year. \nOther pub owners echoed Mr Watson's warning, with industry bodies calling for help for the sector.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said that while increases to the minimum wage and the minimum living rate would be \"welcomed\" by many staff in pubs, it was a further cost increase for pubs who were \"still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future\". \n\"It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,\" she added. \nWetherspoons, however, has announced it will cut drink prices next month on a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. \nBecks bottles and whisky measures will be sold for 99p at some branches. Wetherspoons said prices will be reduced at all of its almost 900 pubs but the discounts will vary. \nIn October, JD Wetherspoon reported a record annual loss after Covid lockdowns saw its pubs shut for 19 weeks. \nThe firm was also recently affected by a shortage of some beer brands, caused by driver shortages due to a combination of Covid and Brexit.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak's latest Budget, to be delivered later, comes as the pub trade is still recovering from lockdown measures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic.\nCity Pub Group weathered the financial storm thanks to government assistance, putting 99% of its staff on furlough during the pandemic.  \n\"That's basically kept the industry on life support, but we're coming off life support now and we need to be able to have a road to recovery,\" Mr Watson told the BBC.\nLast month, the group, which owns 45 pubs, reported that sales had been above 90% of pre-pandemic levels since Covid restrictions were eased in May.\nBut now it faces further challenges - not just minimum wage rises, but also higher energy and food costs, as well as employers' national insurance contributions going up next April.\nThe price of beer \"would probably have to go up by 25 to 30p a pint\" to take account of all that, Mr Watson said.\n\"We want to do our bit - it's very important, but at the same time we don't want everything going up the whole time, because all that will do is stoke inflation,\" he added. \nUK inflation is expected to rise above 4% by the end of this year.  \nWhile Mr Watson said increases to the minimum wage were a \"good idea\", he warned that those increases could be \"gobbled up by other inflationary pressures\". \nHe said a more effective measure would be for the government to cut VAT as a way of reducing the cost of living. \nThe hospitality industry currently benefits from a reduced VAT rate of 12.5%, but that is due to revert to 20% in April.\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade group UK Hospitality, said the VAT tax rise would be \"unsustainable\" and mean that businesses would have \"no option\" but to pass the cost on to customers.\n\"We are facing into considerable headwinds with a bubble of inflationary pressures coming through the supply chain, as well as wage rate inflation,\" she added.\nCosts 'inevitably' passed on.\nMartin Greenhow, managing director at Mojo, a chain of six pubs in the north of England, said supply chain costs were \"certainly putting pressure\" on the business. \n\"If costs go up, prices go up, it's fairly inevitable,\" he said. \nAll of the 89 staff the firm employs are currently on or above the National Living Wage.\n\"The coming increase will of course affect everyone, as those above it will also expect to see a pro-rata increment which will cost the business thousands,\" he explained. \nMr Greenhow said that these staffing and supply costs would \"inevitably be passed on to the consumer\". \n\"Furlough and grants helped us survive, but essentially our survival was achieved by huge borrowings, which represent another cost to the business and therefore another inflationary driver.\"\nIan Ridley runs three pubs and the majority of his 50 staff earn the National Living Wage. \n\"Something's got to give, we cannot absorb these cost pressures,\" he explained.  \nAlthough he has not worked through the cost projections for next year yet, Mr Ridley estimates the price of a pint could rise by 20p.\n\"When we're trying to encourage customers to come back and we're compete with supermarkets on booze, higher prices are not going to help us,\" he told the BBC. \nThe wage increases will mean an estimated \u00a320,000 of extra costs, in addition to higher food, transport and brewery bills. \nRising energy costs are causing concern and Mr Ridley said the VAT hike in April and business tax rates were another \"huge worry\".

So that's why, even when they added #ad at the end, it wouldn't be enough to comply with the rules.\"\nIf someone breaks the rules, there are different levels of sanctions.\nEd says the ASA will get someone to amend the content so it follows the rules, or get them to remove it. \nIf things escalate, people can be placed on a public list, with the ASA working with platforms to remove further content and eventually even referring them to legal authorities.\nThis year, Love Island's Luke Mabbott, Towie's Lauren Goodger and TikTok collective The Wave House have all been made to take posts down because they weren't clearly labelled as adverts.\nIn August, the ASA named and shamed four celebrities who it said repeatedly broke the rules: Chloe Khan, Jodie Marsh, Lucy Mecklenburgh and Chloe Ferry.\nMolly-Mae Hague was found to have broken the rules over a competition she tried to run on Instagram. \n\"Targeting someone like Molly-Mae sends a message to other influencers, who may have smaller followings, to remind them that they are under the same requirements as any other brand,\" Nick Breen from law firm Reed Smith told the BBC at the time.\n\"So, as they do more sophisticated campaigns - beyond copying and pasting marketing from an advertiser - they need to take even more care.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "text": "Cuts to foreign aid spending will stay in place until at least 2024-25, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said.\nLast year the government broke an election pledge when it cut spending to 0.5% of national income, blaming the economic pressures of Covid.\nDuring his Budget, Mr Sunak said forecasts suggested the cut could be reversed in three years.\nWaterAid said this would mean three more years of dirty water and infant mortalities in vulnerable communities.\nAnd Bond - a network of international development organisations - accused the government of \"accountancy trickery\" for using the aid budget to pay for excess vaccine doses, debt relief and Special Drawing Rights - a term for complex currency handouts from the International Monetary Fund.\nLast week, senior government climate change advisers expressed concern over the Treasury's efforts to broaden the definition of what is included in overseas aid. \nThe promise to spend at least 0.7% of the country's income on international aid became a legal requirement in 2015.\nIn the last general election, the Conservatives told voters it would continue to maintain the spending levels.\nHowever in 2020, the government announced it would cut the aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of GDP.\nDefending the reduction, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government had spent \u00a3407bn during the pandemic and that \"there must inevitably be consequences\".\nThe Treasury said it would return to 0.7% levels, but only when its official figures forecast two things.\nFirstly, that the government wouldn't be borrowing money for day-to-day spending. \nAnd secondly, that underlying debt would be falling as a percentage of national income. \nSetting out his Budget, Mr Sunak said \"forecasts show that we are scheduled to return to 0.7% in 2024-25 - before the end of the Parliament\".\nHe said the UK would \"remain a development superpower and one of the largest ODA [Overseas Development Assistance] donors in the G7\". \nThe footnotes of the Budget tell the real story about overseas aid. \nThe chancellor is not promising to increase the spending target to 0.7 percent of national income in 2024. \nHe is merely saying it might be possible by then. \nThe so-called 'fiscal tests' are flexible to say the least. \nThe Budget paperwork makes very clear that \"should future forecasts deteriorate\", then any decisions about the aid target will be made at the time. \nThe chancellor also fails to note that by 2024, there may well be a different government with different priorities.\nAnd in the intervening years, there is a growing debate not just about the size of the aid budget but also what it is spent on. \nThe Budget documents seem to imply - without being explicit - that the Chancellor will start counting different spending streams towards the 0.5% of the foreign aid target. \nWe await clarity from the Treasury but this could include the cost of overseas vaccine donations and special currency reserve handouts from the International Monetary Fund. \nCharities fear that this will mean that several billion pounds less will be spent on humanitarian and development aid. \nSo the headline from the Budget is that the UK's billion pound aid cuts will continue for at least another three years and in the meantime much less may well be spent on development and humanitarian support than before. \nResponding to this announcement, Green MP Caroline Lucas tweeted: \"Is Rishi Sunak really expecting praise for returning to 0.7% GDP for development aid by 2024/5?  This is still utterly shameful.  The cut should be reversed now.\"\nLabour's Sarah Champion - who chairs the International Development Committee - said it was \"good news\" but added: \"I'll celebrate when the poorest in the world start seeing the cash.\"\nChildren's charity World Vision UK said it was \"pleased to see\" the chancellor's intention but expressed concern levels would not rise for at least three years.\nMeanwhile WaterAid warned that: \"Ten million people will miss out every year until the budget is restored.\n\"The chancellor's delay on restoration means three more years of dirty water, further infant mortality and the wider spread of disease for millions in vulnerable communities.\" \nStephanie Draper, CEO of Bond, accused the government of \"once again balancing the books on the backs of the poorest and jeopardising trust in the UK around the world\".\n\"This makes the UK's standing in addressing global inequality even more questionable, whilst severely undermining crucial COP26 negotiations.\"\nSave the Children said any decision to include other costs in the aid budget meant existing aid programmes faced cuts of around \u00a33.6bn."

      "text": "Many breakfast radio shows now have smaller audiences than before the pandemic, according to new figures.\nZoe Ball, Greg James, Roman Kemp, Chris Evans and the Today programme are among the shows to have fewer listeners than the last time ratings were measured.\nThe drop can be partly explained by lower commuter numbers as many people continue to work from home.\nBut industry body Rajar urged caution when making comparisons because it is also measuring audiences in new ways.\nThe latest radio listening figures are the first to be published since May 2020, and now incorporate smartphone data in the methodology.\nThe ratings cover July to September this year, with some data based on a smaller sample of listeners from the previous three months also included.\nSome DJs, such as Radio X's Chris Moyles, appear to have bucked the downward trend for breakfast shows; while radio listening in general has increased slightly and many stations improved their overall reach.\nBBC Radio 5 Live, for example, recorded a significant boost, probably helped by coverage of summer sport events such as the Euros and the Olympics.\nThe station attracted 5.9 million weekly listeners between July and September, up from 5.2 million before the pandemic. Its sister station 5 Live Sports Extra was also up, to 1.6 million.\nThe increase in radio listening as a whole, juxtaposed with the decrease for breakfast show audiences, suggests the figures reflect how listening habits and lifestyles have been changed by the pandemic.\nWhile fewer people might listen to a breakfast show, some radio stations noted their daytime figures were up, likely a result of people listening more while working at home during the day.\nRajar said 89% of the UK population listen to radio at least once a week, with the average listener clocking up just over 20 hours of listening over seven days.\nA great deal of radio listening is now on digital platforms such as DAB, smartphone and tablet apps or websites. Around 74% of people surveyed said they listen digitally every week.\nSmart speakers now account for a large proportion of listening - around 48% of people who own speakers said they used it to listen to radio weekly. \nOf those users, 20% said they listen to radio via a smart speaker on a daily basis.\nRajar figures were suspended during the pandemic, as the industry body was not able to conduct its usual face-to-face research.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Spending reviews,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday. Here are five things to look out for.\nThe forecasts will reflect an economy that has rebounded faster than the 4% predicted for this year at the last Budget in March. That means significantly lower borrowing. \nThe forecast peak for unemployment will again be further lowered, reflecting the success of the furlough scheme. \nHowever, much of this is already old news, and some of those who predicted a \"boom\" are now scaling back their estimates. \nWhat matters now is the immediate implications for the economy of supply chain problems, worker shortages, rising prices and interest rates. The chancellor's speech, along with accompanying forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, should have some pointers.\nAn immediate test of the Downing Street rhetoric on wage rises will take place with the announcements on public sector pay, largely frozen last year, and the National Living Wage (NLW). \nThe NLW is earmarked for a 5% rise to \u00a39.42 an hour from April, as part of a pathway to \u00a310 an hour by 2024, which could be brought forward by a year. \nBut could that, in fact, widen what has been significant wage rises in shortage sectors, such as haulage, to a more general and therefore inflationary economy-wide phenomenon?\nRishi Sunak has had a year-and-a-half as a high spending emergency chancellor, racking up debts for a once-in-a-century crisis, expanding the state, and taking taxes to post war highs. \nThis will be his chance to re-establish his fiscally conservative free market credentials. His method for doing so will be a set of new fiscal rules to bring both annual borrowing under control and the debt down. \nThese rules have been routinely broken by previous chancellors. But how strictly he decides to set these restraints on his power to borrow, will determine room for manoeuvre for extra spending and possible tax cuts.\nThe chancellor will tout this as the first full multi-year post austerity spending review. Spending will rise more than one of the Gordon Brown Spending Reviews. But two-thirds of the funding decisions - for health, schools, defence and aid, are already baked in the cake. \nWhat remains, are important areas of spending, such as courts, prisons, and, crucially, local Government, which are on course for another two-year spending squeeze, before spending goes up. \nEven more importantly, little cash has been so far allocated for permanent post pandemic legacy spending in health, care, and schools. If that happens, the immediate squeeze elsewhere will be even tighter. This will have consequences for services, and potentially council tax bills.\nLocal council spending cuts will be difficult to reconcile with promises made to regions outside the big cities. But this spending review really is show time for Downing Street to reveal the substance behind their promise to \"level up\" Britain. \nThe phrase originated in promises to equalise per-pupil spending across England. Transport spending is hugely skewed in the UK - with regions such as the North East of England missing out. Will this Spending Review fundamentally change that pattern, even if it would never seek to equalise such spending with, say, London? \nThe answer to that question will start to be seen in the capital funding allocations in the review. \nLikewise, net zero: Tens of billions of investment will be required to rewire the economy away from burning carbon. Most of that will come from the private sector, but a huge amount will need to come from the public sector too. \nAgain just how ambitious and serious the government is here will be seen in black and white in the numbers allocated in the review."

All I can do is burn them down.\"\nDefence solicitor advocate Jim Keegan QC said Imrie visited the Islamic Centre in Glenrothes on 4 July 2019 in broad daylight but did not do anything.\nInstead, his client went to the dilapidated Strathmore Lodge, in Thornton, Fife, and set fire to a doorway. He filmed it and claimed to the group it was a mosque or Islamic centre. \nMr Keegan added: \"The effect on his audience was that they ridiculed him.\nImrie said his comments were a joke and he was not serious about setting a mosque on fire. \nOn Wednesday, Imrie was convicted of a terrorism charge of making statements on Telegram and Facebook which encouraged acts of terrorism. \nA second charge stated Imrie made a \"record of information\" which would be useful to somebody who was committing acts of terrorism. \nHe was acquitted of a terrorism charge which stated that he engaged in conduct in \"preparation\" of terrorism acts. \nAfter his arrest, his mum Joyce told police: \"I would describe him as a loner who rarely leaves his room. He has no friends that I know of and he has no visitors to the house. He has never had a girlfriend that I know of.\"\nPolice also confiscated a USB stick from Imrie. The images contained \"extreme\" pornographic images of dead women being subjected to sexual acts.\nImrie is expected to be sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow on 24 November."

      "text": "The family of a Kenyan woman allegedly killed by a British soldier in 2012 have told the BBC of their anger and despair that no-one has yet been convicted of her murder.\nThe UK defence ministry says it has been co-operating with a Kenyan inquiry into Agnes Wanjiru's death following allegations of a cover-up reported by the Sunday Times at the weekend (subscription required).\nHer body was found in a septic tank at a hotel in central Kenya nearly three months after she had spent an evening partying with soldiers.\nThe 21-year-old left behind a five-month old daughter, who is now being cared for by her sister Rose Wanyua in the town of Nanyuki, 200km (125 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi.\nMs Wanyua sobbed as she revealed how the Sunday Times report had raked up painful memories.\nShe and her husband John Muchiri said the family had given up any hope of finding justice for Ms Wanjiru, who they knew as Ciru.\n\"If it was Ciru who had killed that white person, by now I wouldn't even know where she is jailed,\" Ms Wanyua said.\n\"But whoever killed her went free and is living his life. I am raising her child alone, no-one has asked about their well-being, not even the government.\"\nMs Wanjiru, who dropped out of high school and later became a sex worker to look after her baby, was last seen by witnesses on the night of 31 March 2012.\nShe was walking out of a Nanyuki bar accompanied by two British soldiers.\nHer body was later discovered behind a room where the soldiers had stayed, with missing body parts and a stabbing injury. \nKenyan judge Njeri Thuku concluded after an inquest in 2019 that Ms Wanjiru had been murdered by one or two British soldiers.\nShe ordered two further criminal inquiries, but the military took no action, the Sunday Times reports.\nA soldier told the paper that the killer had confessed to him and he had reported it, but the army had failed to initially investigate. \nKenyan detectives are also said to have asked British military police to question some of the soldiers, but the UK's defence ministry denied receiving such a request. \nOn Tuesday, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the Ministry of Defence (MOD) had fully co-operated with the Kenyan investigation - and would continue to do so.\nMr Muchiri said the family felt let down, but could not afford legal representation to take the matter further.\n\"You know, we are poor. I'm a casual labourer. We'd have loved to retain a lawyer to follow up. We can't,\" he said.\nFor decades, locals have complained about the British army, which has a training base in Nanyuki.\nA lawyer who represents them told the BBC many of the issues go unaddressed.\n\"Even with our local police, you will just report a case, and then nothing goes beyond the investigation stage,\" Kelvin Kubai said. \"Most of the locals do not have the resources and financial capacity, to enable them pursue justice on such grounds.\"\nThe UK High Commissioner to Kenya, Jane Marriott, has expressed \"shared concern\" over Ms Wanjiru's death and reiterated her government's support for the investigation.\nThe British Army Training Unit Kenya (BatUK) has also said it is supporting the MOD's discussions with Kenyan authorities over the murder. \nFor Agnes Wanjiru's family - nine years after her murder - the wait for justice continues.

      "text": "There was an \"unjustified reliance\" on firefighters to evacuate Grenfell Tower on the night of the fatal fire, a union has told the inquiry into the disaster.\nThe Fire Brigades Union said building owners and managers should draw up evacuation plans to prevent future catastrophes.\nUnion lawyer Martin Seaward said there was a \"near total failure\" of fire safety measures at Grenfell Tower.\nThe June 2017 disaster at the west London tower block killed 72 people.\nThe comments came on the final day of closing statements in a section of the inquiry focusing on the fire safety measures in the building, its management, risk assessment and the communication with residents.\nMr Seaward criticised the approach to fire safety taken by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO).\nHe told the inquiry on Tuesday the \"hazardous rainscreen cladding system\" should have been identified as a risk and removed by April 2016.\n\"Additionally, the near total failure of all the active and passive fire safety measures allowed the rapid deterioration of conditions inside the tower, which grossly impeded the firefighters' operations, including search and rescue,\" Mr Seaward said.\nMr Seaward added if the fire risk management system from the tenant management organisation had worked \"most, if not all\" of the people who died would have been saved.\nThe lawyer argued to the inquiry the safety plans were characterised by an \"unjustified reliance\" on the London Fire Brigade to evacuate residents, \"including those especially at risk in the event of fire in Grenfell tower\".\nMr Seaward said: \"Of course, the fire and rescue service will attend and do its best at any fire or other emergency, but fire safety depends on everyone doing their bit.\n\"That very much includes responsible persons developing and practising building-specific evacuation plans for residents, including personal emergency evacuation plans for those especially at risk, in the same way that employers do in office blocks or factories.\"\nAnne Studd QC, representing London Mayor Sadiq Khan, told the inquiry the tenant management organisation did \"very little\" to see if Grenfell was suitable for the stay put strategy in its fire assessments and Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council (RBKC) had limited oversight of them.\n\"The evidence before you, Mr Chairman, has demonstrated a culture of failings in transparency and candour by the KCTMO, which, coupled with a lack of intrusion from RBKC, was a toxic combination,\" she said.\nJames Maxwell-Scott QC, representing the council, told the inquiry it \"apologised unreservedly\" again for council failings before the disaster.\nThe failings included the number of council officers devoted to monitoring the KCTMO being \"insufficient\" and its housing commissioning team not making enough use of the corporate health and safety team's expertise to \"prevent issues falling between the gaps,\" he said. \nThe lawyer added the KCTMO was an independent, managing agent of Grenfell Tower which was at an \"arm's length\" from the council, which was the building's landlord.\n\"The council fully admits that it retained some control over the tower, and therefore continued to have some responsibilities for it under the Fire Safety Order. But those responsibilities are better described as residual ones than shared primary ones,\" he told the inquiry."

      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told MPs the Budget begins the work to prepare for a new economy post Covid, as he delivers his speech in the Commons.\nSpending plans for transport, health and education have been unveiled in the press.\nMr Sunak is under pressure to help people with the cost of living.\nSources say he will adjust the universal credit taper rate, meaning those working will be able to take home more of the money they earn.\nA \u00a320 a week top up to the benefit was cut earlier this month, but details of any changes have yet to be announced.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer will not be responding to the Budget, as the leader of the opposition is normally expected to do, as he is isolating after testing positive for Covid. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out Labour's response instead.\nAccording to Downing Street, Mr Sunak told the cabinet on Wednesday morning that his Budget \"will deliver a stronger economy for the British people\" with the \"levelling-up\" agenda - spreading prosperity around the country - a \"golden thread\" running through it.\nThe chancellor is under pressure to reveal more about the economic outlook, with government debt soaring to record peace time levels in the wake of the pandemic.\nAnd he will deliver a three-year spending review alongside his Budget.\nThe Treasury has asked departments to find \"at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets\" - so it is clear not every area will get the same treatment. \nPolicies already unveiled from the chancellor's Budget include:\nYou can read more on the announcements the government has already made here. \nOne of the pre-announced policies is the end to a pay freeze for public sector workers - such as teachers, nurses and police officers - but ministers have so far refused to say whether it will be a real-terms rise by being higher than inflation.\nPay for most frontline workforces is set by independent pay review bodies and No 10 has said it could not \"prejudge that process\".\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was furious about the number of spending plans that were given to the media before Mr Sunak's big speech - they are traditionally meant to be announced in Parliament so MPs can challenge and scrutinise them. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing echoed the reproof just before the Chancellor got to his feet.\nA No 10 spokesman said they \"recognised the importance of parliamentary scrutiny\" and they \"always listen very carefully to the Speaker\".\nWhisper it. After the economy took an absolute hammering during the pandemic, might the chancellor tomorrow actually be in a much cheerier political mood than he could have predicted? \nDuring his Budget warm-up in the last few days, Rishi Sunak has already totted up promises of around an extra \u00a320bn of spending, as well as announcing how some of the cash that was already promised is going to be carved up.  \nHold on for a second though. On the specifics, there is no guarantee that unfreezing the wages of 2.5 million workers in England will mean they get pay rises that aren't eroded by inflation. \nThe same goes for increases for workers on low pay, and cuts to universal credit will pinch too. \nHaving treated us all to cosy snaps of him and his Labrador, Nova, and him hard at work in his athleisure wear, Rishi Sunak wants to give the political impression that he's a chancellor we can all be comfortable with - careful with our money, but not afraid to spend it on things that matter, who has modern Tory instincts, but won't ditch the party's traditions.  \nBut remember Budget warm-ups are just that. However many announcements there have already been, however carefully the photographs of the prep have been thought through and selected, what matters is what he actually says at lunchtime on Wednesday.\nWhat matters are the numbers - what's in black and white - in the end.\nRead more from Laura here. \nSir Keir Starmer tweeted: \"The Budget must take the pressure off working people.\n\"With costs growing and inflation rising, Labour would cut VAT on domestic energy bills immediately for six months.\n\"Unlike the Tories, we wouldn't hike taxes on working people and we'd ensure online giants pay their fair share.\"\nEx-Tory chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Newscast the government should not use higher wages as \"a bung\" to secure the support of low income voters.\n\"The instinct to send a message to business that we need to invest more capital rather than just relying on cheap labour, I think is the right instinct, I would support that,\" he said.\nAdam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, warned it was going to be a \"brutal and bitter winter for millions of householders\" who were unable to bear the costs of energy price rises.\nHe called for the chancellor to find a way to put some of the extra tax receipts raised by the price increases back in the pockets of the most vulnerable."

      "tags": "Economics,Rishi Sunak,Economic growth,UK economy,Budget 2021,Office for Budget Responsibility",
      "text": "The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned.\nIts latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022.\nHowever, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%.\nThe chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained.\nRishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as \"strong\" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously.\nHowever, he acknowledged the inflation rate was \"likely to rise further\" from its 3.1% rate in September.\nHe said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns.\n\"The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\"It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight.\"\nThe UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR said in its latest report.\nThe OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThe independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses. \nIt previously said it had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and \"in response to a request from the chancellor\".\nRichard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer.\nBut the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term \"scarring\" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%.\nThe effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said.\nBut it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021.\nIn 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March.\nGrowth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.\nWhile the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months. \nThe OBR reckons inflation will hit 4.4.%; it warns it may go as high as 5%. And, it makes clear that leaving the EU has heightened the UK's experience of the bottlenecks that are bumping up business costs, that in turn will lead to higher prices.  \nThat higher cost of living, together with looming tax rises will dampen the effect of wage rises over the next couple of years. \nStrip out inflation and the OBR reckons that household income after tax will only recover to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2023. And those lost years of prosperity increases could weigh on growth - and sentiment in the run up to the next election.\nHigher inflation is also likely to put pressure on how much the chancellor is able to spend in the future.\nBut Mr Sunak has been offered some room for manoeuvre, as the improving economic picture and higher tax incomes means the government will not have to borrow as much.\nBorrowing hit a record \u00a3319.9bn during the 2020 financial year as the government poured money into pandemic support schemes such as furlough.\nIt is now forecast to fall every year between 2021 and 2026. \nJane Mackay, head of tax at audit, tax, advisory and risk firm Crowe, said there was still a \"huge\" Covid bill to deal with, though.\n\"The Budget statement hasn't really given us clarity on who will pay that bill. \n\"The tax increases that were announced before the Budget, including corporation tax rising to 25%, and the NHS and social care levy additional NICs of 1.25%, might suggest the strategy will spread the burden as widely as possible, rather than to make the structural changes to our tax system that may be what is really needed.\"\nA risk of rising inflation as well is that it will increase the amount of interest the government needs to pay back on what it has borrowed for pandemic spending.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned in September that it \"will have to act\" over rising inflation.\nThe Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4%, before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid.\nThe UK's central bank can raise interest rates in an attempt to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In theory, when borrowing costs rise - which would make loans such as mortgages more expensive - people spend less and prices are driven down.\nMr Sunak said on Wednesday that he had written to the Bank to \"reaffirm their remit to achieve low and stable inflation\". \nInvestors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's 2% target.\nHowever, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%.\nThe governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nThe Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has tested positive for Covid-19. It means he missed giving the official opposition response to Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget, and Prime Minister's Questions at lunchtime. This is the fifth time that Starmer has had to self-isolate since the start of the pandemic - most recently in July.  \nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects the UK economy to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the Commons in his speech. It was expected to bounce back more slowly, but the OBR has now revised its growth prediction from 4% to 6.5%. However, inflation in September was at 3.1% and is likely to rise further, said Sunak. \nIt's been a point of contention which reflects the debate in the wider country, and earlier this week face coverings were made mandatory for everyone working in the House of Commons, except MPs. At both Prime Minister's Questions and the Budget announcement on Wednesday, the majority of the government had put on masks, including PM Boris Johnson, Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab. The health secretary has said MPs should wear one to set an example, but Jacob Rees-Mogg - who has claimed Tory MPs don't need them due to their fraternal spirit - did not. \nThe spread of coronavirus by climate activists attending the COP26 summit in Glasgow is a \"concern\", a public health expert has said. The summit, which begins on Sunday, will have safety measures in place for guests but Professor Linda Bauld told BBC's Good Morning Scotland show that the \"main worry\" is those attending to protest.\nWest Midlands Trains has said it is facing a driver shortage because training opportunities have been restricted by the onset of the pandemic. The operator said delays and cancellations are likely to continue into 2022 for passengers using the route between Worcestershire and Birmingham and apologised.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nHow did Covid affect differences between public and private sector pay?

      "tags": "Comedy,United States,California",
      "text": "Legendary US comedian and political satirist Mort Sahl - who skewered US presidents from Dwight Eisenhower to Donald Trump - has died. \nHe passed away on Tuesday in Mill Valley, California, at the age of 94 of old age, a friend told AP News.\nSahl's biting political commentary won him legions of fans starting in the 1950s and has been credited as the inspiration for modern stand-up comedy.\nHis Cold War material is credited for setting the bar for political comedy.\nA host of comedians and comedy show producers have paid tribute, including Albert Brooks, Laraine Newman and Richard Lewis.\nThis is Spinal Tap star and Simpsons stalwart Harry Shearer said Sahl had \"invented modern American political satire\".\nBorn in Montreal, Sahl moved with his family to Los Angeles as a child and got his start as a comedian at San Francisco's beatnik hungry i club.\nHe quickly went on to perform at comedy clubs around the US. He hosted the first-ever Grammy Awards in 1959 and co-hosted the Academy Awards that same year. \nHe was featured on the cover of Time Magazine in 1960, starred in several films and was a frequent guest host on Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show on NBC. \nKnown for his trademark sweater and loafers - at a time when performers often wore tuxedos - Sahl would come on to stage carrying a newspaper with notes for his act written on it. \nHe favoured story-telling rather than lounge-style stand-up punchlines.\nA comedic blunderbuss, Sahl prided himself on poking fun at all sides, often asking at shows: \"Is there anyone here I haven't offended?\"\n\"A conservative is someone who believes in reform,\" he once said. \"But not now.\"\nHe also joked: \"Liberals are people who do the right things for the wrong reasons so they can feel good for 10 minutes.\"\nSahl ridiculed President John F Kennedy before going on to write jokes for his campaign. After Kennedy was elected, he turned to mocking him again. \nFollowing the Democrat's assassination, Sahl's career took a downturn as he dedicated large portions of his shows to ridiculing the official account of Kennedy's death. \nBut after the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s, which led to the resignation of Richard Nixon, his career picked up again. Sahl's opposition to the Vietnam War also brought him some new followers in the late 60s and early 70s.  \nHe continued to perform stand up into his 80s, even after suffering a stroke. At age 80 he began teaching a course in critical thinking at Claremont McKenna College in California.\nAll four of his marriages ended in divorce, and his only son died in 1996. He has no immediate surviving family members."

      "text": "The Duchess of Cornwall has called for more urgent action to tackle sexual violence against women.\nShe spoke of her shock at Sarah Everard's murder and warned \"on average, one woman is killed by a man every three days\" in the UK.\nIn a speech in London, Camilla said men also needed to be \"on board\" with tackling a culture of sexual violence.\nAnd she questioned whether people had become \"indoctrinated into believing that violence against women is normal\".\nThe duchess spoke of the \"unimaginable torment\" facing female victims of violent sexual attacks and how their families, such as those of Sarah Everard, \"continue to suffer in the wake of their deaths\".\nSarah Everard was murdered earlier this year by Wayne Couzens, then a police officer, who had abducted her as she walked home in south London.\nAnd the duchess warned of a pervasive, underlying culture of sexual harassment.\n\"On the same day that Wayne Couzens was arrested, a survey was published stating that 86% of young women in the UK have been sexually harassed in a public space,\" she said.\nCamilla was speaking at the launch of a project called Shameless, supported by the Women of the World Foundation and Birkbeck, University of London, and aimed at changing attitudes to sexual violence.\nThe duchess said a high proportion of women who had been harassed did not report what had happened - and pointed to an unfair sense of \"shame\" among victims.\n\"Often, this sense of shame causes the victim to blame herself, mistakenly take responsibility for the crime, and want to hide away from others - and yet she has done nothing wrong,\" she said.\n\"Let us resolve to support survivors to be 'shameless' and not to take on misplaced feelings of stigma,\" the duchess told an audience including Carrie Johnson, wife of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nMrs Johnson, then Carrie Symonds, had given evidence against \"black-cab rapist\" John Worboys, jailed in 2009.\nThe duchess warned of a \"culture of silence\" around sexual violence and said it was important men were engaged in efforts to change attitudes.\n\"It takes an entire community, male and female, to dismantle the lies, words and actions that foster a culture in which sexual assault is seen as normal,\" she said."

      "tags": "Budget 2021",
      "text": "The Treasury has released a deluge of funding announcements, days before the chancellor delivers his Budget on 27 October. \nStatements from the government setting out spending for transport, health and education have been put out in the past few days.\nCommons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is furious, telling MPs on Monday it was \"not acceptable\" to brief the media ahead of MPs and on Tuesday that the government was behaving in a \"discourteous manner\".\nHe thundered that ministers used to \"walk\" if they briefed about a Budget.\nIndeed, in 1947, then-Chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after he leaked details of his budget to a journalist.\nDefending pre-Budget announcements, Treasury Minister Simon Clarke said the government had not commented on the \"substantive tax measures\" that would appear in the Budget.\nSo what do we know?\nFirstly, this isn't the complete story. \nRishi Sunak's Budget won't all be about displays of generosity. The Treasury has asked departments to identify \"at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets\" and we may hear more about those plans on Wednesday. \nThe government has already committed to spending for health, schools, defence and overseas aid so other areas such as local government, justice and further education may face a squeeze on their budgets.\nAnd there may be more to some of the seemingly lavish spending pledges than meets the eye.\nAnalysis by political correspondent Damian Grammaticas\nBeware what you are reading! They sound good, all these announcements in the run up to Budget and Spending Review. \nBut they need to be taken with caution. This is the PR blitz seeking good headlines. We don't yet know the detail of exactly what the government is planning. \nThe raft of investments will make a difference. But there are questions. \nAre the transport links, treatment centres and other projects entirely new or have some parts been announced (with equal fanfare) before now? \nCrucially what is happening more broadly to the budgets of the departments getting cash? \nA shiny investment in something is great, but is that department's day-to-day spending being squeezed? And what of those areas that aren't getting the handouts?\nBest to wait until Wednesday to truly judge the chancellor's largesse.\nThe government has announced that England's city regions will receive \u00a36.9bn to spend on train, tram, bus and cycle projects.\nThis includes \u00a31.07bn for Greater Manchester, \u00a31.05bn for the West Midlands and \u00a3830m for West Yorkshire.  \nHowever, the figure of \u00a36.9bn only includes \u00a31.5bn of additional spending because the government is including the \u00a34.2bn promised in 2019 alongside funding for buses announced by the prime minister last year.\nThe chancellor has refused to be drawn on the future of the eastern leg of High Speed Two, which could be delayed or cancelled to save an estimated \u00a340bn.  If built, the extension would cut journey times between London and the North East by 31 minutes. It would also shave 52 minutes off trips between London and Leeds.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding through the Barnett formula - a mechanism the UK government uses to allocate additional money to the devolved nations when it spends more in England.\nNHS England will get \u00a35.9bn to tackle the backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. That covers \u00a32.3bn for diagnostic tests including clinics in shopping centres for scans; \u00a31.5bn on beds equipment and new \"surgical hubs\"; and \u00a32.1bn to improve IT. \nHealth bodies welcomed the money but warned it would not solve the problem of staff shortages. According to data published by NHS digital, in June there were 93,806 full-time vacancies across the NHS in England.\nMr Sunak is set to announce a rise in the National Living Wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50, to come into effect from 1 April next year.\nThis is a 6.6% increase in the minimum wage for all those aged 23 and over - more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living.\nAssuming a 40 hour week, the new minimum wage amounts to a salary of \u00a31,646 per month or \u00a319,760 a year. \nThe increases to the wage rates follow recommendations made by the Low Pay Commission, an independent advisory board.\nThe Treasury has also announced it will be lifting a pay freeze imposed on millions of public sector workers last year as a result of the pandemic. \nIndependent pay review bodies will recommend how much extra money workers will get early next year.\nThe government's major tax change has already been announced, as earlier this year the prime minister told MPs he would introduce a tax in England designed to tackle the NHS backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and later to pay for social care.\nHowever, we know a few other changes (or rather lack of changes) that will be announced on Wednesday.\nCampaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the levy to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row. \nAnd separately, the BBC has been told VAT on household energy would not be cut. \nThe health department will get \u00a35bn over the next three years for research and development.\nThis includes \u00a395m which will go towards researching methods for treating cancer, obesity and mental health.\nThe money will also be spent on developing genome technology which could detect more than 200 conditions in newborn babies.\n\u00a32.6bn will be spent on creating 30,000 new school places for children with special educational needs and disabilities.\nThe money will also go towards improving school buildings' accessibility and funding new, special provision in free schools England.\nThe Budget will also include \u00a31.6bn over three years to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds plus \u00a3550m for adult skills in England.\nCurrently there are over 6,000 on T-level courses, but the government hopes to ramp up those numbers. \nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, warned that the extra money was a \"gamble\" as it was unclear how many would want to take the qualification. \nThe government will also spend a further \u00a3830m modernising colleges in England.\nThe Treasury is allocating \u00a31.8bn for building around 160,000 new homes on derelict or unused land - also known as brownfield sites - in England. \nAn extra \u00a39m will also go towards allowing councils to turn neglected urban spaces into \"pocket parks\" roughly the size of a tennis court.\nThe chancellor is also expected to confirm \u00a365m for digitising England's planning system.\nGrants worth \u00a31.4bn will be given to \"internationally mobile\" companies to invest in UK infrastructure.\nThis includes \u00a3345m aimed at increasing resilience for future pandemics and \u00a3800m for the production of electric vehicles in north-east England and the Midlands.\nAs part of the package, a talent network team will aim to attract high-skilled workers to the UK, through \"innovation hotspots\" initially based in San Francisco and Boston in the US and Bengaluru in India.\nThe government has announced \u00a3500m to support parents and children in England. \nThis includes \u00a3200m to support families with complex issues; \u00a382m to fund centres in 75 different areas to provide advice for parents; \u00a3100m for mental health support for expectant parents; and \u00a350m for breastfeeding support.\nLabour has argued that the government previously closed over 1,000 children's centres - known as Sure Start centres - and that this new announcement \"rings hollow\".\nMr Sunak defended past cuts, arguing that the new funding would \"create a network of family hubs which are broader than the Sure Start centres\".\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "Taxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine following a shake-up of alcohol duty.\nThe new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said. \nThe duty premium on sparkling wines will end and the duty on draught beer and cider served in pubs will be cut.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak called it the \"most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years\".\nHe also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled.\n\"To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,\" the chancellor said.\n\"Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength.\"\nMr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were \"currently overtaxed\", adding: \"Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less.\"\nIn relation to sparkling wines, Mr Sunak said: \"I'm going to end the irrational duty premium of 28% that they currently pay. Sparkling wines - wherever they are produced - will now pay the same duty as still wines of equivalent strength.\"\nThe cut to sparkling wine duty was welcomed by Kate Goodman, owner of Cheshire drinks importer Reserve Wines, but she was disappointed that the change was not immediate.\n\"Christmas is our busiest period. It would have great to introduce this before that time. We need help to get back on our feet after a pretty crippling 18 months,\" she said.\nReducing duty on lower alcohol drinks will encourage people to buy English wines, said Jonathan Piggins, chief executive of English wine merchant Corkk.\n\"The UK's vineyards are being taken increasingly seriously by the major overseas players and reducing the tax on lower alcohol drinks, will give the country an even more prominent position on the global wine map.\"\nThe changes were less welcomed by Liam Manton, co-founder of Didsbury Gin.\n\"Additional tax on high ABV drinks will present a real challenge to businesses like ours,\" he said, adding that on average 70% of the price of a bottle of gin is already tax.\nIn a move to help struggling pubs, Mr Sunak announced a new lower rate of duty for draught drinks, which he said would cut the cost of a pint by about three pence.\nHe said the \"draught relief will cut duty by 5%\" and \"will apply to drinks served from draught containers over 40 litres\".\nThe chancellor said this would particularly benefit community pubs \"who do 75% of their trade on draught\".\nHe also announced proposals for a new \"small producer relief\" to include small cidermakers and other producers making alcoholic drinks of less than 8.5% alcohol by volume (ABV).\nJez Lamb, founder of Wirral-based craft beer marketplace, Beers @ No.42, said the draught relief favoured the big players in the market, not the smaller, independent breweries who need support most.\n\"It's brilliant to see alcohol duty cut on draught beer but that's only for \"containers\" more than 40L. That is great for the big breweries but so many smaller craft brewers only supply in 30L containers,\" he said.\nCreating a draught rate and simplifying the duty system is positive news, said Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, which has 2,700 pubs.\n\"It is a much needed vote of confidence in the great British pub as we face into an uncertain winter, labour disruption and rising costs.\" \nWilliam Robinson, managing director of Stockport brewery Robinsons, said the lower draught beer duty rate and the cancellation of the planned inflation-linked increase in beer duty showed that the chancellor \"recognises the contribution pubs make to the communities they support and serve.\""

Recent statistics suggest just under 100,000 people in Wales in low-wage jobs are on universal credit.\nIt follows the decision to end the \u00a320-a-week uplift given during the pandemic.\nMr Sunak said: \"An additional \u00a32.5bn per year in Barnett funding means the Welsh government is well-funded to deliver all their devolved responsibilities, while the people in Wales will also benefit from this government's commitment to levelling-up opportunity and delivering for all parts of the UK.\"\nThe chancellor said all of the UK will benefit from the planned UK Shared Prosperity Fund, which is planned to replace EU aid.\n\"Over time\" it will match EU funding of around \u00a31.5bn a year, he said.\nBut the Welsh government suggested Wales would receive less than the \u00a3375m in European funds it had in the past, although it said arrangements for replacing EU cash remain unclear.\nWelsh finance minister Rebecca Evans said: \"While the spending review does give us some medium term financial certainty and some additional investment, it is more than offset by the inflationary and system pressures that we are facing. \n\"The budget fails to meet the scale of the challenge that families, public services and the wider economy are still facing as a result of the pandemic.\"\nWhile many services in Wales like health and education are run from Cardiff, and Rishi Sunak cannot decide how money on them is spent, big decisions on benefit and tax are UK-wide.\nThey include:\nWelsh government money funds services like health and schools, which are overseen by ministers in Wales rather than Westminster.\nThe Treasury said it would provide an \"additional \u00a32.5bn per year\" in funding for that purpose.\nBudget documents show the cash received by Welsh government will go up from \u00a315.9bn this financial year to \u00a317.7bn by 2023, to \u00a318bn in 2024 and \u00a318.2bn in 2025 - with an overall increase of \u00a32.3bn by 2025.\nThe Treasury said the figures in the budget document take into account money taken off the grant to the Welsh government because of devolved taxes.\nIt explained the \u00a32.5bn figure is an average of the extra cash earmarked for Wales, when compared to this year, for each of those three years - \u00a32.2bn in 2022/23, \u00a32.6bn in 2023/24 and \u00a33.0bn in 2024/25.\nMinisters in Cardiff will decide how to spend their money over the next couple of months.\nThe Treasury also promised \u00a3460,000 of the Community Ownership Fund for three projects.\nThe UK government said it would fund a \"Veterans Commissioner for Wales\", and would bring forward \u00a3105m for the Cardiff City Region Deal projects.\nPlaid Cymru's Ben Lake accused the chancellor of failing to offer a \"transformative Budget that would put money in people's pockets in the short and long-term as well as ambitious policies to set a global example ahead of COP26\".\n\"\u00a32.5bn for Wales is a good headline for the UK government. But let's put that into perspective. Wales is owed around \u00a35bn in consequential funding from HS2, which the chancellor once again today decided to withhold from Wales.\"\nWelsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said it is \"shocking to see the UK government is cutting air passenger duty on the eve of COP26\".\n\"What message does this send to the world about how seriously we take our climate goals?\" she said.\nSimon Hart, Conservative Welsh Secretary, told BBC Wales that he was \"mystified\" by the Welsh government's calls for support to clear up coal tips.\n\"Actually, courtesy of the Barnett formula and the money that we are able to provide Welsh government, they're getting at least \u00a3250m from UK government over the next six years for flood alleviation alone,\" he said.\n\"It completely dumbfounds me that they can possibly turn around and say that we're not providing sufficient funding.\" \nWhere are the levelling-up fund projects?\nThe UK government has offered a total of \u00a3121m from its \u00a34.8bn levelling-up fund to ten projects, including:\nSince the UK government is chairing a global conference on combating climate change, starting in Glasgow in a few days, you might have expected the chancellor to have focused his budget on moving towards a green economy.\nThere was no news for one of Wales' big employers, Tata Steel, which has called for a road map to help it decide how to move from using fossil fuels.\nThe chancellor did announce a second issue of green bonds, but his focus was on general economic growth not on developing new green industries and ways of operating.\nIn contrast, rather than encouraging us to fly less he reduced air passenger duty to lower the cost of flying between England, Scotland and Wales to \"bring people together\". \nThe planned increase in fuel duty has been cancelled.\nDrivers struggling with higher prices at the pump may welcome this but those who want to encourage us out of cars to help the planet will be disappointed. \nAverage wages in Wales are significantly below the average for the UK and many working families are dependent on extra money from Universal Credit. The \u00a320-a-week top up that they had been getting has of course ended but now if they work extra hours they will lose less money from their UC payments.\nHowever prices are predicted to continue to rise and that along with increases in national insurance will continue to squeeze incomes."

      "text": "Face coverings have been made mandatory for everyone working in the House of Commons except MPs.\nIn updated guidance, the Commons authorities said all staff, visitors, contractors and press must cover their faces to combat the spread of Covid.\nBut it remains up to individual MPs to decide whether to follow suit - and many Conservatives have chosen not to.\nSajid Javid has said he will wear a mask for Wednesday's Budget when the chamber will be packed.\nBut the health secretary said on Monday it was a \"personal decision\" for ministers and backbenchers as to whether they did too.\nMPs are not employed by the Commons authorities and cannot be forced to wear masks.\nThey have been encouraged to do so by Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle - but unions representing Parliamentary workers have urged him to take a tougher line.\nMost opposition parties, including Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP have decided to cover their faces during debates.\nBut Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg last week said Conservatives did not need to do so because they knew each other well, and this meant they were complying with government guidance.\nAnd he claimed Labour MPs only wore masks when the television cameras were around.\nThe latest official guidance says people in England should cover their faces around \"people you don't normally meet\".\nIt comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) urged MPs to wear masks during Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget speech, when there is likely to be standing room only in the Commons chamber.\nDr David Nabarro, the WHO's special envoy for Covid-19, told Sky News that \"everybody\" should be wearing masks in close confinement with other people, \"including our leaders\".\n\"This virus, it is absolutely unstoppable, it gets everywhere, and so we have to do everything we possibly can to stop it.\n\"And one of the best ways to stop it is a well-fitting surgical mask properly over your face, pushed in over your nose, covering everything, and that reduces the risk to others and the risk to you.\n\"If it works, why on earth don't people use it? It's not a party political issue - this virus doesn't vote.\"\nGarry Graham, deputy general secretary of the union Prospect, said the public looked to MPs to set an example.\n\"It's welcome that House authorities are finally catching on to what unions have been saying, that it's too early to relax. But we're still left in the ludicrous situation where MPs do as they please on masks while everyone else does the right thing,\" he said.\n\"Continuously changing an already inconsistent message is a recipe for non-compliance and increased risk to everyone.\""

      "text": "Adelaide United player Josh Cavallo has come out as gay, becoming the only current top-flight male professional footballer in the world to do so. \nThe 21-year-old wrote on social media that he was \"ready to speak about something personal that I'm finally comfortable to talk about in my life\".\n\"I'm a footballer and I'm gay,\" the midfielder said in an accompanying video.\n\"All I want to do is play football and be treated equally.\"\nJosh said he was tired of trying to perform at his best \"and to live this double life, it's exhausting\".\n\"It's been a journey to get to this point in my life, but I couldn't be happier with my decision to come out.\"\n\"I have been fighting with my sexuality for six years now, and I'm glad I can put that to rest.\" \nJosh says it got to the point his mental health was affected and he was \"going into dark places\".\n\"At the end of the day I just wanted to be happy. This is bigger than football, it's my life. I'd go home and I wasn't happy,\" he told the BBC's Newshour programme.\n\"It just slowly eats away at you and it's not something I wish upon anyone.\"\nHe thought \"people would think of me differently when they found out\".\n\"They would start saying bad things about me or making fun out of me. That's not the case. If anything you would earn more respect from people.\"\nAnalysis by Jack Murley, presenter of the BBC's LGBT Sport Podcast\n\"I'm a footballer and I'm gay.\" \nThose six words may not sound like much, but Josh Cavallo's decision to open up about his sexuality is hugely significant.  \nHe's chosen to speak while still an active player - something that marks him out from the likes of Thomas Hitzlsperger, who only came out publicly after retiring.  \nIn many ways, gay and bisexual men are more represented in football than you think. \nThere are out players at the non-league level of the English football pyramid, as well as gay referees like Ryan Atkin and James Adcock. \nBut to have a top-level professional like Josh Cavallo feel comfortable enough to come out while still playing is a huge step - and, as evidenced by the reaction on social media, a welcome one as well.  \nAs Josh himself says, too many men have felt as if the only way to be successful in football is by hiding their sexuality - with many choosing to step away from the game altogether rather than being their authentic self. \nHis decision to speak out (with the full support of his team-mates) shows that, in 2021, it just doesn't have to be that way anymore.\nFew elite male football players have come out as gay during their careers.\nAndy Brennan became the first former Australian League player to come out in 2019 when the ex-Newcastle Jet was still playing in a lower tier.\nFormer Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger revealed he was gay after retiring from the sport.\nIn 1990, Justin Fashanu came out as gay. He took his own life in 1998 after allegations of sexual assault were made against him by a 17-year-old in the US.\nThomas Beattie, a former youth player for English club Hull City came out in 2020, and said he was proud of Josh, adding \"visibility and representation matters\".\nJosh's statement has sparked an outpouring of support for him, which he's called \"immense\".\nAustralia's professional players union said it was a \"wonderful moment\" for him, the sport and \"the LGBTI+ community\".\n\"Coming out as a gay footballer in the public eye takes incredible courage,\" says Liz Ward, director of programmes at Stonewall.\n\"His brave decision will undoubtedly mean a lot to lesbian, gay, bi, trans and queer sportspeople around the world, who are too-often held back from playing and watching the sports they love.\"\nJosh says before coming out, he had to \"mask my feelings in order to fit the mould of a professional footballer.\"\n\"That's a lot of wasted young players missing out - players that could be very talented, but who don't fit the norm.\"\n\"As a gay footballer, I know there are other players living in silence. I want to help change this, to show that everyone is welcome in the game of football and deserves the right to be their authentic self,\" he added.\nNewsbeat has contacted Josh's management but they've not yet responded. \nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "tags": "Chancellor's Autumn Statement,Rishi Sunak",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out changes to universal credit he says will give low income families an extra \u00a31,000 a year.\nIn an upbeat Budget speech, he said the UK economy had not been hit as hard by the Covid pandemic as expected.\nHe promised more money for schools, business rate cuts and took 3p off the price of a pint of beer.\nLabour said his universal credit measure would not make up for axing the \u00a320-a-week top-up to the benefit.\nThe chancellor painted a positive picture of the health of the UK economy as it emerges from the pandemic, in his autumn statement to a packed House of Commons.\n\"Employment is up. Investment is growing. Public services are improving. The public finances are stabilising. And wages are rising,\" he told MPs.\n\"Today's Budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people: stronger growth, with the UK recovering faster than our major competitors.\"\nHe said unemployment had not hit the levels feared at the height of the pandemic - but inflation was set to rise further, from 3.1% to 4% over the next year.\nMuch of his Budget had been pre-announced, including an end to the public sector pay freeze and an increase to the National Living Wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50.\nBut Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News the \"almost non-existent\" increase in living standards predicted over the next five years was a \"big blow\" to families.\nHousehold disposable income is set to rise by 0.8% per year, according to Office for Budget Responsibility figures.\nEconomic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023.\nNew Budget measures included:\nThe teetotal chancellor also announced plans to \"radically simplify\" alcohol tax, so that it was based purely on the strength of the drink. \nTaxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine and \"white ciders\", from 2023.\nHe also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled.\nAnd he scrapped next year's planned increase in business rates in England and promised more frequent revaluations, and tax breaks for firms that make improvements to their properties, from 2023.\nIn further moves to boost the leisure industry as it emerges from the pandemic, he announced a 50% business rate discount for pubs, cinemas, restaurants, gyms and other venues.\nRishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory - who doesn't like heavy taxes, who doesn't like big government. \nBut he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. \nNor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. \nInstead, his plans increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. \nMr Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge; less keen to remind you that they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. \nDespite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Mr Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election.  \nBut with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even if they could so with cheaper cider or prosecco.\nThe chancellor waited until the end of his 70 minute speech to announce changes to universal credit, which come after a widely condemned \u00a320-a-week cut to the benefit earlier this month.\nThe universal credit \"taper\" will be cut, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every \u00a31 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p.\nThe amount people can earn before starting to lose the benefit will also increase by \u00a3500 a year. The new rate will be introduced by 1 December, he told MPs.\n\"This is a tax cut next year worth over \u00a32bn,\" said the chancellor.\n\"Nearly two million families will keep, on average, an extra \u00a31,000 a year.\"\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour welcomed the move but it would not make up for the \u00a36bn cut from universal credit earlier this month, which affected five million families. \n\"Even after this reduction, working people on universal credit still face a higher marginal tax rate than the prime minister. And those unable to work - through no fault of their own - still face losing over \u00a31,000 a year,\" she said.\nThe opposition leader normally responds to the chancellor's Budget speech, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid.\nMs Reeves, who was drafted in to replace him at the last minute, said Mr Sunak had \"no coherent plan\" to deal with cost of living crisis facing many families, with rising energy bills, food prices and tax increases.\nShe told MPs Mr Sunak was a chancellor that \"gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other\".\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, branded the chancellor's planned cut to domestic air passenger duty a \"disgrace\", asking what kind of message it sent to the world on the eve of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nThe Liberal Democrats said cutting bank taxes would cost the Treasury more than \u00a33.8bn over the next four years, compared with \u00a31.8bn extra to help school pupils catch up.\n\"He is offering a measly pound a day of extra catch up funding for each child, six times less than the tax cut being offered to the Conservatives' banker buddies,\" said leader Sir Ed Davey."

      "text": "The assistant director of Rust, Dave Halls, had been sacked from a previous production over gun safety violations.\nActor Alec Baldwin accidentally shot dead Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western last week.\nThe producers of Freedom's Path confirmed to press agency AFP on Monday that Halls had been dismissed in 2019.\nIt came after a crew member \"incurred a minor and temporary injury when a gun was unexpectedly discharged\", the statement said.\nRocket Soul Studios said Halls could not be reached for a comment. There is no suggestion that Halls was at fault for the Rust incident.\nThe studio's producers said in a statement sent to the BBC: \"First of all, our condolences go out to everyone affected by the recent tragic event in New Mexico.\n\"Halls was removed from set immediately after the prop gun discharged. Production did not resume filming until Dave was off-site. An incident report was taken and filed at that time.\"\nAn affidavit filed over the Rust incident said Halls had handed the gun to Baldwin during a rehearsal and called out \"cold gun\" as he did so, meaning the weapon had no live ammunition.\n\"The assistant director (Dave Halls) did not know live rounds were in the prop gun,\" the affidavit said. \nThe description \"prop gun\" can refer to a range of items, from non-functioning weapons to cap guns. It can also mean a real gun, as in this case. \nSpeaking on Monday, Juan Rios, spokesman for the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department which is investigating the incident, described it as \"a complicated case\".\nHe said investigators had interviewed Hannah Gutierrez, who was responsible for the safety of weapons on the set, but gave no further details.  Gutierrez has not yet commented publicly and the BBC has been unable to reach her. \nAn inventory of seized items that was released on Monday also showed that detectives had recovered loose and boxed ammunition from the set, though they would not say which kind. \nInvestigators hope a forensic analysis of ballistic evidence will shed light on what kind of projectile was fired from the gun and how it got there.\nHutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was injured when a revolver that Baldwin was using during rehearsal discharged. \nBaldwin, the director and other members of the cast and crew have also been interviewed. No charges have been brought yet.\nBefore the incident, camera operators had walked off the set to protest against working conditions.\nIn her first public statement about the incident, Baldwin's wife Hilaria said on Monday that \"it's impossible to express the shock and heartache of such a tragic accident.\"\n\"My heart is with Halyna. Her husband. Her son. Their family and loved ones. And my Alec,\" she posted on Instagram.\nElsewhere, a T-shirt which declares: \"Guns Don't Kill People, Alec Baldwin Kills People\" is being sold for $27.99 (\u00a320.32) on a merchandise site linked to Donald Trump Jr, the son of the former US President - who Baldwin has routinely mocked on Saturday Night Live.\nMany have criticised the T-shirts but Trump Jr has defended the product, tweeting: \"Spare me your fake sanctimony.\"\nMeanwhile, Flint: Who Can You Trust?, an environmental documentary narrated by Baldwin, has been postponed, its director said, following the fatal shooting.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget.\nHe'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on.\nEach year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. \nIt outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services.\nThe Budget speech will be delivered on Wednesday 27 October.\nIt usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. \nThis year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: \nAfter the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing.\nThe Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid.\nA number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise in the minimum wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50 and an end to the public sector pay freeze.\nThe chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions:\nBudget 2021: What has already been announced?\nMeasures such as the furlough scheme - which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic.\nTo close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. \nIn the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed \u00a3320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. \nEconomists expect it to borrow around \u00a3180bn more this year, another enormous sum. \nDuring his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead.\nThe government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises.\nOne major tax rise was announced in September - the \u00a312bn Health and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT.\nThere has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier.\nAt the same time, the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills.\nHe is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. \nOverall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England.\nThe government has already said that the NHS in England will receive an extra \u00a35.9bn to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans.\nBut other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport, are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgets next year. \nThey have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful.\nSome parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. \nOthers, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions.\nScotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government will publish its Budget on 9 December.\nIf the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rule called the Barnett formula. \nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver his Budget and Spending Review to the House of Commons next week, setting out the government's spending and financial strategy.\nChanges to the national minimum wage could be announced, as those earners have been badly hit by the economic downturn.  \nNew climate measures and changes to company taxes are also expected. \nWe asked six people across the UK what they want to see from this Budget. \nRuby Torry, a 23-year-old waitress at Zizzi's restaurant in the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield, lives in Rotherham with her mother and earns the minimum wage.\n\"I'm careful with my bills and don't go silly with shopping, but I want to see the minimum wage go up or national insurance tax come down,\" she told the BBC. \nZizzi's had put Ms Torry on furlough, but she said she couldn't cover her bills, so she worked for Asos in the firm's Barnsley warehouse during the pandemic. She says she would also like to see more incentives for apprenticeships.  \n\"I wanted to do an engineering apprenticeship, but wouldn't have been able to live on \u00a3800 a month wages - I couldn't even pay for my car on that,\" she explains.  \n\"Minimum wage needs to go up, I don't know how the government thinks we can do anything on that little.\" \nMichelle Wilson is a single mother from Glenrothes in Scotland and has already felt challenges after the \u00a320 weekly uplift in Universal Credit was ended on 6 October. \n\"It's a real worry because the uplift was almost \u00a3100 a month, which is my main shop gone now, so it's another big stress,\" she told the BBC. \nShe added that she would like to see increases in Universal Credit and the minimum wage to reflect the rise in household costs from inflation. \n\"My kids have been eating healthier with that uplift and it's been a big drop when I'm worried about my gas and fuel bills,\" she says.\nMs Wilson used to work as a support officer for Fife council, but one of the reasons she left the job was because she struggled with the cost of childcare as a lone parent. \nShe said it would be \"helpful\" for the Budget to encourage more flexible hours for working and finding childcare, as she is limited to 09:00 to 15:00.\nMs Wilson would support government measures to help with the sharp rise in energy bills, which she said she is \"struggling to keep up\" with, as rising costs are making life \"harder and harder\" for her. \nNick Grey founded Gtech, which makes floor cleaning and garden products and has a turnover of \u00a370m. The firm employs 200 people across the UK and sells more than 22 million products in 19 countries. \nMr Grey says the Budget should not make it more difficult for firms to employ overseas workers, which he thinks would be a \"backwards step\" amid the labour shortages. \nAnother of his requests is that a rise in corporation tax should be avoided, as he says it \"risks businesses setting up headquarters elsewhere and less bureaucracy would be better for attracting investment in the UK\". \nRaising tax on high earners also \"risks lowering the overall tax income for the country\", he adds. \nJon Tolley runs independent record shop Banquet Records in Kingston, Surrey. He believes the fairest way to pay for the pandemic is through increased tax for people and businesses that earn the most, rather than a rise in everyone's National Insurance tax. \n\"I want customers and my employees to have disposable income and cash in their pockets, so they can spend it on the High Streets,\" he adds. \nMr Tolley explains the business has had an \"OK\" year and received a cash grant of \u00a325,000 twice from the government for having had to close the shop - action that he says was \"welcome and effective\".\nBut he adds that he would like to \"see something changed about business rates\". \n\"We're in competition with online stores who don't have to pay the same rates and High Street rents, so that playing field needs to be levelled.\" \nThe business pays the standard 20% VAT on products and Mr Tolley doesn't want to see this increase. \n\"We haven't had 'just-in-time' stock control at all, because of delivery delays, but we're fortunate to have storage capacity and have ordered well ahead for Christmas.\"\nHollie Whittles, digital strategy specialist and HR director at Purple Frog Systems, says she wants to see a review of the business rates system. \nShe says small businesses often \"lack the time to understand\" tax and rates. \nMs Whittles says it is \"crucial\" to make sure taxes designed for large organisations are not avoided or passed \"further down the chain to their small business customers\".  \nOn climate measures, she commends grant schemes such as the Low Carbon Opportunities Programme (LOCOP) and the Business Energy Efficiency Programme (BEEP), which encourage businesses to adopt greener technologies.\n\"It is vital that the government supports small businesses' journey to net zero, especially with small businesses making up more than 99% of all private sector enterprises,\" she adds.  \nOn changes to apprenticeship schemes and student loans, Ms Whittles, who works with 14 staff, says she would welcome more support for small businesses wanting to train and upskill staff in new technologies that help benefit long-term careers and the local economy.\nMs Whittles says there have been \"considerable challenges\" in accessing the government's Kickstart scheme, which creates new jobs for 16 to 24-year-olds on Universal Credit. \nThe government should also support schemes and skills investment for older people wanting to change careers, in her view.  \nLynne Turner is 71 years old and would like to see her basic government pension of \u00a3137.60 per week increased. \n\"It's absolutely not enough. I'm frugal, but couldn't survive with a decent lifestyle if I only had my pension,\" Ms Turner explains. \nMs Turner says she could not afford to pay into a private pension in the past because of childcare costs. Without an inherited cottage in Wales, the rent from which supplements her pension, she \"wouldn't be able to manage\", she says.  \nShe adds that she would support a beer levy, which \"wouldn't bother her at all\", but says that because so many small businesses have struggled during the pandemic, she would be against making them pay more taxes.\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "Popular support for governments to take tough action on climate change is growing around the world, according to a BBC World Service opinion poll.\nThe survey of over 30,000 people finds that 56% want their countries to play a leadership role at the critical COP26 meeting next week. \nThe desire to see ambitious goals set in Glasgow has grown substantially since 2015.\nConcern about climate change is also at its highest point since 1998.\nPresidents and prime ministers from around 120 countries will gather in Glasgow next week for the COP26 conference, dubbed the last, best chance of averting dangerous climate change. \nRecent research shows that the plans so far on the table will not prevent global temperatures going far above 1.5C this century - a level that scientists say is the gateway to extreme impacts. \nThe UK, which is presiding over the talks, will hope that in negotiations with leaders they will be able to find a pathway that reduces emissions fast enough to stay below 1.5C.\nThis new poll suggests that people in rich and poor nations alike are supportive of the idea of greater ambition from their leaders. \nAcross the 31 countries polled, an average of 56% of people want their governments to set stronger targets that would address climate change as quickly as possible. \nAnother 36% want their government to take a more moderate approach and support gradual action.  \nJust 8% want their governments to oppose a deal. \nIn the 18 countries where a similar survey was carried out ahead of COP21 in Paris in 2015, the expectation for governments to play a leading role has grown substantially. \nIn 2015, 43% of those polled wanted strong action, but that has risen to 58% now.\n\"In advance of the COP21 meeting in Paris in 2015, global public opinion exhibited relatively strong expectations for governments to deliver an ambitious climate change agreement, which in the end is what transpired,\" said Chris Coulter, the chief executive of Globescan, which carried out the poll. \n\"Now, in advance of the COP26 meeting in Glasgow next week, we are seeing significantly higher levels of expectations - an increase of 25% worldwide - for governments to conclude an ambitious deal. This is an extraordinary shift in a relatively short period of time and the implications being that governments that don't deliver on these expectations could face political consequences.\"\nThere are some interesting changes in some of the biggest emitting countries, particularly China, where the percentage of respondents wanting to see their country play a leadership role has increased from 18% in 2015 to 46% now.  \nIndia also sees a rise from 38% then to 56% now, with the US also showing an uptick from 45% of respondents then to 56% now. \nOnly in Russia did the pollsters find a decline in support for stronger government leadership at COP26, with only 38% backing this approach, down from almost 50% in 2015.\nOn the question of addressing climate change, respondents were fairly evenly divided, with 61% overall saying that governments had the responsibility while 57% said that companies were in the frame. \nOn the issue of individuals, only 36% said that the answers should come from them.\nThis question turned up an interesting age difference with four in 10 respondents under 30 years of age saying that individuals held a great deal of responsibility, while only three in 10 of those over 30 saw it the same way. \nOverall concern about climate change is at its highest level since Globescan first started tracking this concern - in 17 countries -back in 1998. Some 63% of people now see it as a \"very serious\" issue.\nThere have also been large increases in the numbers of people saying that weather patterns have become highly unusual and alarming, particularly in France and the UK, where the numbers have doubled since 2015.\nMore details on the poll can be found here. \nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Sewage,Conservative Party,Water pollution,House of Lords",
      "text": "The government says it will force water companies to make a \"progressive reduction\" in the sewage it dumps in rivers, amid pressure from the Lords. \nPeers proposed a change to the Environment Bill last week in an attempt to cut the pollution, but it did not win enough support from MPs.\nIt led to a backlash on social media, and Lords promising to try again. \nBut Environment Secretary George Eustice has now promised to bolster measures by making them a legal duty.\nHe said the government already had plans in place to require water companies to act on sewage, but added: \"We've listened to the debate in Parliament [and] we will write what was already government policy into [law] to give people the reassurance they seek.\"\nThe crossbench peer who put forward the Lords amendment, the Duke of Wellington, said he met Mr Eustice earlier on Tuesday ahead of a debate in Parliament on the Environment Bill. \nSpeaking in the Lords, he said was \"grateful for the gesture\", but he had yet to form an opinion on the language of the government's proposal, so would be pushing ahead with his own plan to end the \"revolting practice\".\nThe duke's amendment passed in the Lords by 213 votes to 60, and will now be debated by MPs at a later date.  \nHowever, due to parliamentary rules, his amendment would have to be approved by the Lords anyway to allow the government to replace it with its own plan when the bill returns to the Commons. \nThe environmental issue has come to a head days before the start of the COP26 climate summit, being hosted by the UK in Glasgow.\nThe Environment Agency allows water utilities to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather events, such as prolonged heavy rain.\nThis protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes.\nBut according to the public body's own figures, water companies discharged raw sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times last year, with untreated effluent - including human waste, wet wipes and condoms - released into waterways for more than three million hours in 2020.\nThe Lords agreed an amendment to the Environment Bill that would put a legal duty on water companies and the government to demonstrate progressive reductions in discharges of untreated sewage and required them to \"take all reasonable steps\" to avoid using combined sewer overflows.\nBut when the proposal was voted on by MPs last week, it lost by 265 votes to 202 - even with 22 Tories rebelling against the government to vote in favour of the plan. \nThe government had said the amount of sewage discharged by water companies was \"not acceptable\" and that it had made it \"crystal clear\" to firms that significant reductions must be a priority. \nBut a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the intentions of the Lords' amendment, which it said would involve an overhaul of the UK's Victorian sewerage system - would cost upwards of \u00a3150bn.\n\"That would mean that individuals - every one of us as taxpayers - paying potentially thousands of pounds each as a result,\" they added. \nShortly before the issue was brought up again for debate in the Lords, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs proposed its own amendment for when the bill returns to the Commons.\nThe new legal duty would be placed directly on water companies to make a \"progressive reduction\" in the sewage it dumps into rivers. \nIt follows on from advice it gave the industry's financial regulator, Ofwat, earlier this year, saying water companies must take steps to significantly reduce storm overflows and that the regulator should ensure funding should be approved for them to do so.\nAnd the firms would need to produce \"comprehensive statutory Drainage and Sewerage Management Plans, setting out how they will manage and develop their drainage and sewerage system over a minimum 25-year planning horizon - including how storm overflows will be addressed\".\nA number of peers welcomed the move by the government, but some warned it still may not go far enough, with Labour's Baroness Quin saying she hoped the government would move even further now people across the country were \"waking up to the problem\".\nLabour's shadow environment secretary, Luke Pollard, also said the \"screeching u-turn\" on the issue due to the public backlash would \"do little to convince the public that the health of our rivers, rather than the health of Conservative polling, is at the forefront of ministers' minds\".\nHe added: \"The government still has no clear plan and no grip on the issue of raw sewage being pumped into our seas and rivers.\""

      "text": "The exemption of teachers in Northern Ireland from fair employment legislation \"is outdated and needs to be removed\", according to a union.\nA number of MLAs and the former first minister, Arlene Foster, have previously criticised that exemption.\nThe teaching union, the NASUWT, is the latest to call for the exemption to be scrapped.\nThe recruitment of teachers is exempt from legislation outlawing religious discrimination in Northern Ireland.\nThe NASUWT said removing the exemption would \"tackle endemic nepotism and lack of diversity in the teaching profession.\"\nThe union is to present a motion to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) conference in Belfast on Tuesday.\nIt calls for the backing of the wider trade union movement for the exemption to be removed.\n\"The practical effect of this is that it is not currently unlawful to discriminate against someone in an appointment process on the basis of their religious belief,\" the NASUWT said.\nIn 1976, the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act exempted teachers and clergy as \"the essential nature of the job requires it be done by a person holding, or not holding, a particular religious belief\".\nThat was maintained in the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.\nThe exemption allows schools to use religious background or belief in deciding who to recruit to teaching posts.\nIt also means schools have no legal obligation to monitor the community background of their teaching staff.\nIn 2004, the Equality Commission investigated the exemption and found \"the exception of teachers from the religious discrimination provisions is widely accepted, and the support for change is a minority view\".\nAccording to the Equality Commission, there were concerns from the Catholic church at the time that ending it would lead to Catholic schools losing their religious ethos and becoming non-denominational.\nThere were also concerns from the Protestant churches that Protestant teachers would be disadvantaged because of the need for teachers in Catholic primary schools to have a certificate in religious education.\nThe commission did recommend scrapping the exemption for post-primary schools but no changes to the law were subsequently made.\nGeraldine McGahey, chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said: \"It definitely should go from post-primary schools and, in primary schools, we think there should be a concerted effort to find a way to remove from that as well.\"\nIn recent years a number of assembly members have been critical of the recruitment of teachers being exempt from fair employment laws.\nIn 2019, research from the Unesco Education centre at Ulster University (UU) also suggested it contributed to relatively few teachers from a Protestant background teaching in Catholic maintained schools, and vice-versa.\nThe Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) said it was \"actively considering its position on the issue\".\nBut CCMS added it believed the exemption \"should remain in place until such time as any proposals for its repeal can be demonstrated to give complete confidence to the future of, in our case, Catholic education\". \nThe NASUWT's Northern Ireland official Justin McCamphill said the exemption was \"outdated and needs to be removed\".\n\"We are calling on the first and deputy first minister to remove this and ensure that every teacher has equality of opportunity and is able to apply for work in any school regardless of their religion or perceived community background,\" he said.\nThe leaders of the five main political parties in Northern Ireland are also expected to speak at the ICTU conference at the Waterfront Hall on Tuesday."

We will consider what further action is necessary in that light.\"\nDowning Street said the \"disappointing and disproportionate\" threat of sanctions was \"not what we would expect from a close ally and partner\".\n\"The measures being threatened do not appear to be compatible with the Trade and Co-operation Agreement and wider international law, and, if carried through, will be met with an appropriate and calibrated response,\" a spokeswoman said.\nShe said that the UK will raise concerns with both the EU and French government, arguing that it had granted 98% of licence applications from European boats.\nThe UK maintains the rejected applications which sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show they had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters."

      "tags": "Retailing,Rishi Sunak,Hospitality industry,UK economy,Budget 2021,Travel & leisure industry",
      "text": "Shops, restaurants and bars and gyms in England which have been badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic have been given a financial boost in the Budget.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak announced a temporary 50% cut in their business rates, up to a maximum of \u00a3110,000.\nIn addition, he has scrapped 2022's planned annual increase in rates for all firms for the second year in a row. \nThe hospitality industry welcomed the move, although it added \"the devil will be in the detail\".\nBusiness rates are charged on commercial premises based on the value of the property and the level is set by central government, rather than councils. They are devolved across the UK's nations. \nThe Treasury only decides business rates in England, but the UK government also allocates funding to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland through a formula. \nThis could allow the devolved nations to mirror the changes in England or, alternatively, keep their current business rates and spend the money elsewhere.\nBricks and mortar firms have long complained that they are at an unfair disadvantage compared with online retailers, which do not have to pay business rates. They want to see an online sales tax being applied. \nIn his Budget speech, Mr Sunak said that in the 2022-23 tax year, pubs, music venues, cinemas, restaurants, hotels, theatres and gyms would be able to claim a discount on their bills of 50%, up to a maximum of \u00a3110,000. He said that was a tax cut worth almost \u00a31.7bn. \nIn conjunction with the existing Small Business Rates Relief, the chancellor said the move meant more than 90% of all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses would see a discount of at least 50%.\nBusiness rates in the retail and leisure sectors have already been reduced during the present financial year following the rates holiday during the pandemic.\nThe Treasury has been carrying out a wider review of business rates. \nIn his Budget speech, Mr Sunak confirmed they would be retained and reformed. \"We on this side of the House are clear that reckless, unfunded promises to abolish a tax which raises \u00a325bn every year are completely irresponsible.\"\nHowever, he said the system would be made \"fairer and timelier with more frequent revaluations every three years\". beginning in 2023.\nIn addition, from 2023, all firms, not just in retail and hospitality, would be able to make improvements to their property without having to pay extra business rates for 12 months. \nThe reforms also include a new relief for firms that invest in green technologies, such as solar panels and heat pumps.\nUK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls: \"We have been lobbying hard for significant reform of the outdated business rates system and therefore very much welcome the chancellor's move today to extend the 50% business rates relief for the hospitality and leisure sector for the next financial year. \n\"The devil will be in the detail, though, so we look forward to learning to what extent it will benefit businesses.\"\nMs Nicholls also said announcements simplifying, and in some cases cutting, alcohol duties were \"great news\" for pubs, bars and restaurants and \"will benefit all\".\nHowever, she added: \"Positive as these announcements are, hospitality remains incredibly fragile, facing myriad critical issues. Rising utility bills, wage bills and food and drink prices have resulted in 13% inflationary costs that businesses are having to absorb at the same time as they navigate severe supply chain issues and chronic staff shortages. \n\"Given this toxic cocktail, it is imperative the government go further to support businesses in our sector.\"\nShe said the best way to do that would be to keep the current lower rate of 12.5% VAT on hospitality. \n\"The chancellor has been bold and radical with alcohol duty - we urge him to adopt the same approach when implementing root and branch reform of business rates, to ensure industries share the burden equally.\"\nElsewhere, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), Shevaun Haviland, said the chancellor had listened to the BCC's \"long-standing calls for changes to the business rates system and this will be good news for many firms\".\n\"It will provide much-needed relief for businesses across the country, giving many firms renewed confidence to invest and grow.\"\nCBI director general Tony Danker said the chancellor had made \"real strides in making the system more palatable for businesses in the shorter term. More frequent valuations, wider reliefs and improving the incentives for firms to decarbonise their premises is what firms have been calling for\".\nHowever, he added that the \"hard truth\" was that \"the government missed the opportunity to truly reform a business rates system that diminishes Britain's high streets and factories\".\nJulian Bird, chief executive of Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, welcomed the move, saying it would \"provide venue operators with the cushion of a lower cost base as they reopen and develop an audience post-pandemic.\n\"The 100% improvement relief for business rates, providing 12 months relief from higher bills for occupiers where eligible improvements to an existing property increase the rateable value, from 2023 will encourage innovation and enhancement of our theatre buildings,\" he added.

      "text": "The Queen will not attend the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow following medical advice to rest.\nThe 95-year-old monarch underwent preliminary medical checks in hospital last Wednesday after cancelling a visit to Northern Ireland.\nShe resumed public engagements on Tuesday by meeting ambassadors via video link from Windsor Castle.\nBuckingham Palace said she \"regretfully\" decided not to attend a reception at the summit.\nBut the palace said she would deliver her address to delegates using a recorded video message instead.\nThe Queen was due to travel to Scotland as part of a string of COP26 engagements by senior members of the Royal Family including the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge between 1-5 November.\nThe other royals will still attend the summit.\nIt is understood that the monarch very much wants COP26 to result in meaningful action on climate change from participating nations, and hopes her absence will not be used by others as a reason not to attend.\nThe Queen was overheard at the opening of the Welsh Parliament earlier this month saying it was \"really irritating\" when people talk but don't act on climate issues.\nSir Peter Westmacott, a former UK ambassador to the US, said the cancellation was a \"blow\" to the summit, but argued the substance of the talks should not be affected.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the Queen's attendance would have been the \"icing on the cake\" but it was still a \"very important opportunity\" for Prince Charles to speak alongside other senior royals.\nIn photographs released on Tuesday, the Queen was seen smiling on camera as she greeted the South Korean and Swiss ambassadors, who were speaking to her from Buckingham Palace.\nShe also spoke to Chancellor Rishi Sunak by phone on Tuesday evening ahead of his Budget unveiling on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe photographed video calls were the first occasions she had been seen since she hosted an investment summit at Windsor Castle on the evening of 19 October.\nThe following day, Buckingham Palace said the monarch had \"reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days\".\nA cancelled trip to Northern Ireland and a night in hospital last week were followed by reassurances that this would only mean a rest and recharging of the royal batteries ahead of the COP26 summit.\nThat trip to Glasgow has now been cancelled too. It was a big moment in the royal calendar and it's a decision that would not have been taken lightly.\nOnly on Tuesday morning the 95-year-old Queen was shown back at work and sending a signal that all was well.\nHer meetings on Tuesday were held on video - and a video message will be sent to the Glasgow summit - so perhaps this will be more of how we'll see the monarch in future.\nShe will be more online, while those in-line will take up more of the public responsibilities.\nThe Queen spent the night of 20 October in a London hospital before returning the next day to Windsor Castle, where she was said to be \"in good spirits\".\nShe did not attend a church service at Windsor on Sunday.\nIt has been a busy period of official engagements for the Queen.\nAn official record of her diary showed at least 16 formal events during October.\nShe has been seen using a walking stick at recent public events, including at a Westminster Abbey service and when she opened the sixth term of the Senedd in Wales.\nIn its latest statement, the palace said: \"Following advice to rest, The Queen has been undertaking light duties at Windsor Castle.\n\"Her Majesty has regretfully decided that she will no longer travel to Glasgow to attend the evening reception of COP26 on Monday, 1 November.\"\nThe statement concluded: \"Her Majesty is disappointed not to attend the reception but will deliver an address to the assembled delegates via a recorded video message.\"\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."

      "text": "Players and fans have marked the third anniversary of a helicopter crash at Leicester City's stadium ahead of the club's game against Brighton. \nThe crash, which killed the club's chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, happened at the King Power Stadium after a match on 27 October, 2018. \nTwo of his employees and two pilots on board also died.\nA crowd display and minute's silence took place before kick-off for the first home match to fall on the date. \nMr Vichai, Kaveporn Punpare, Nusara Suknamai, Eric Swaffer and Izabela Lechowicz all died when the chairman's helicopter crashed and exploded moments after taking off at the stadium.\nIt happened just over an hour after Leicester had drawn 1-1 against West Ham and was witnessed by many players, club executives and members of the press still at the ground. \nEmma Ruckley, 42, who watched the match at the stadium with her father Peter on the night of the crash, said it was \"scary\".\n\"It was all a blur, we didn't know what people were saying,\" she added.\nDean Smith, 52, is a lifelong fan who recently became a steward at the ground.\n\"I don't think you ever get to grips with the magnitude of what happened and the loss that we suffered,\" he said.\nElaine Trinder, 65, said she was \"hoping against hope\" that the crash was not true when she heard about it.\n\"Unfortunately, it was... it was awful. Dreadful,\" she said.\nDave Ryan, 69, added: \"I'm feeling quite emotional. Khun Vichai was Leicester City. He did so much for the club and the city as a whole.\"\nThe Foxes are playing Brighton in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup.\nThe club invited fans to take their seats early to take part in a crowd display and a minute's silence before kick-off.\nPrivate services will take place at the Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Memorial Garden although it is open for fans to pay their respects between 11:00 and 16:10 BST and again after 17:00. \nLeicester City said in a statement: \"Khun Vichai's amazing legacy at Leicester City was defined by his belief in achieving the seemingly impossible - realised in the most incredible fashion when his team reached the top of the English football pyramid to lift a legendary Premier League title in 2016.\n\"That legacy continues to grow to this day, under chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha with the football club now the current FA Cup holders, playing in European competition, competing in the FA Women's Super League and developing talent through one of the world's best training facilities in Seagrave - a key part of the Srivaddhanaprabha family's vision for the club.\"\nIt said plans for the next phase of its former chairman's vision included the expansion and development of the King Power Stadium site, which was recently revealed.\nMr Vichai also supported many community projects, which the club said it had continued through a foundation set up in his honour.\nAn interim Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report into the crash found cockpit pedals had disconnected from the tail rotor which had caused the helicopter to spin out of control.\nThe final report into the crash has yet to be released but Crispin Orr, chief inspector of air accidents, said it would be published \"as soon as we're able\".\nHe added: \"It is now three years since the tragic helicopter accident in Leicester and our thoughts are of the five people who sadly lost their lives that evening, their families and all of those affected by their loss. \n\"The AAIB has conducted an extremely thorough and detailed investigation that has proven to be technically very complex and which is still ongoing.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "Rain has continued to fall overnight in Cumbria after about 40 properties were flooded and road and rail travel were hit on Thursday.\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow warning, meaning some disruption is possible, and the Environment Agency has nine flood warnings in place.\nOn Thursday Honister Pass saw over 30cm (12in) of rain in a 24-hour period.\nMotorists are warned that some roads are only passable with extreme care, and asked only to travel if necessary.\nTrain operators are asking people to avoid travelling on the West Coast Main Line and Cumbria Coastal routes, and there is no service between Barrow and Carlisle until the line has been inspected.  \nOn Thursday a number of roads, including the A591 between Rydal and Grasmere and the A592 Patterdale Road, were flooded.\nKarl Melville, the senior manager at the county council's highways team, said work had been going on all night to try to re-open as many roads as possible.\nHe said: \"We have made some good progress [and] a lot of the roads that were closed are now passable with care.\n\"But obviously this does not take away the very clear advice of if you don't need to travel then don't travel.\"\nThe Environment Agency said 1,200 properties had been protected from flooding by its officers shutting flood gates and removing debris and blockages from grilles and watercourses.\nBut flood duty manager Ben Lukey urged people \"to remain vigilant\".\n\"Surface water and river flooding could still bring disruption to further communities,\" he warned.\nTwo holiday makers and their dog had to be rescued from their accommodation at Southwaite Mill by the Cockermouth Mountain Rescue Team.\nWith water chest high in places, volunteers brought them to safety in a raft.\nCockermouth and District Chamber of Trade chairman Andrew Marshall said huge insurance policy excesses introduced after the floods of 2009 and 2015 meant 90% of businesses would have to pay for any repairs themselves.\n\"Ever since then it's been nigh on impossible to get insurance,\" he said.\n\"If we get flooded this time we've got to pay for the rebuild and everything, which goes into hundreds of thousands.\"\nInsurers have imposed excesses of up to \u00a350,000 for business flooding claims in the area, Mr Marshall said.\nAfter previous floods caused widespread damage to properties the government introduced a scheme to help residents get insurance \"but it wasn't extended to business\", he said.\nGillian Jackson owns holiday lets in Cockermouth, some of which have flooded.\n\"We've been through this before so it's just get up, get on with it,\" she said.\n\"Yes, it's upsetting but we've kind of got a bit hardened to it, got used to it, and we've just got to crack on and sort it out.\" \nOn Thursday afternoon, staff at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant were advised to speak to their bosses about returning home if possible, after checking road conditions.\nIn a message to employees, the company warned detours would be needed around road closures on the A595 at Duddon Bridge, Santon Bridge and Holmrook and that Millom was reported to be unreachable by road.\n\"Shift co-ordinators will maintain minimum safety manning levels in plants but others should head home once clarified with their line managers,\" it said.\nNine flood warnings (where flooding is expected) and 15 flood alerts (where it is possible) were in place on Friday morning.\nIn the 24 hours to 03:00 on Thursday Honister Pass saw 307.4mm (1ft) of rain, according to the Environment Agency.\nThe River Rothay was among those that burst their banks.\nTranspennine Express has advised people not to travel on the West Coast Main Line unless essential and has lifted ticket restrictions until the weekend.\nPhil James from Network Rail told BBC Radio Cumbria on Thursday that the heavy rain was \"widespread\" so it was \"likely to affect many rail routes over the next few days\" and urged people to check National Rail Enquiries for travel details.\nRichard Warren from the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association warned people not to go fell walking during the current conditions. \nHe said: \"It's half-term, Scafell Pike is a bit of a honey pot, there were a lot of walkers out on the road looking very, very wet, the car park had quite a few cars in, so people may have gone up Scafell Pike when the rivers were low.\n\"But when they come down they will find they won't be able to cross the rivers, so the message really is stay off the mountains.\"\nStewart Mounsey, the Environment Agency's flood risk manager for Cumbria said: \"We expect river levels to be peaking this afternoon, the quicker responding ones, and then obviously the River Eden is even bigger so we'll see that responding Friday into Saturday.\"\nEnvironment Agency teams were monitoring the effect of the rain on rivers, focusing on western and southern parts of the county, \"making sure flood defences work\", he said.\nAlan Goodman, from the Met Office, said the rain was \"on the wane slowly as today unfolds\". \n\"There's still more steady rain to come but hopefully it will gradually fragment so the problems we have had on the roads should start to ease.\n\"But yes, there's been an awful lot of rain.\"\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Alcohol,Inflation,UK economy,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The price of a pint of beer will have to rise by as much as 30p to help pay for higher wages and energy costs, one pub company has warned. \nAs the government prepares to unveil its Budget, City Pub Group said price rises were \"the only way forward\".\nOn Monday, the government said the National Living Wage would rise to \u00a39.50 per hour in April for those over 23 years old.  \nClive Watson, the chain's boss, said this would cost it about \u00a31m a year. \nOther pub owners echoed Mr Watson's warning, with industry bodies calling for help for the sector.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said that while increases to the minimum wage and the minimum living rate would be \"welcomed\" by many staff in pubs, it was a further cost increase for pubs who were \"still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future\". \n\"It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,\" she added. \nWetherspoons, however, has announced it will cut drink prices next month on a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. \nBecks bottles and whisky measures will be sold for 99p at some branches. Wetherspoons said prices will be reduced at all of its almost 900 pubs but the discounts will vary. \nIn October, JD Wetherspoon reported a record annual loss after Covid lockdowns saw its pubs shut for 19 weeks. \nThe firm was also recently affected by a shortage of some beer brands, caused by driver shortages due to a combination of Covid and Brexit.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak's latest Budget, to be delivered later, comes as the pub trade is still recovering from lockdown measures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic.\nCity Pub Group weathered the financial storm thanks to government assistance, putting 99% of its staff on furlough during the pandemic.  \n\"That's basically kept the industry on life support, but we're coming off life support now and we need to be able to have a road to recovery,\" Mr Watson told the BBC.\nLast month, the group, which owns 45 pubs, reported that sales had been above 90% of pre-pandemic levels since Covid restrictions were eased in May.\nBut now it faces further challenges - not just minimum wage rises, but also higher energy and food costs, as well as employers' national insurance contributions going up next April.\nThe price of beer \"would probably have to go up by 25 to 30p a pint\" to take account of all that, Mr Watson said.\n\"We want to do our bit - it's very important, but at the same time we don't want everything going up the whole time, because all that will do is stoke inflation,\" he added. \nUK inflation is expected to rise above 4% by the end of this year.  \nWhile Mr Watson said increases to the minimum wage were a \"good idea\", he warned that those increases could be \"gobbled up by other inflationary pressures\". \nHe said a more effective measure would be for the government to cut VAT as a way of reducing the cost of living. \nThe hospitality industry currently benefits from a reduced VAT rate of 12.5%, but that is due to revert to 20% in April.\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade group UK Hospitality, said the VAT tax rise would be \"unsustainable\" and mean that businesses would have \"no option\" but to pass the cost on to customers.\n\"We are facing into considerable headwinds with a bubble of inflationary pressures coming through the supply chain, as well as wage rate inflation,\" she added.\nCosts 'inevitably' passed on.\nMartin Greenhow, managing director at Mojo, a chain of six pubs in the north of England, said supply chain costs were \"certainly putting pressure\" on the business. \n\"If costs go up, prices go up, it's fairly inevitable,\" he said. \nAll of the 89 staff the firm employs are currently on or above the National Living Wage.\n\"The coming increase will of course affect everyone, as those above it will also expect to see a pro-rata increment which will cost the business thousands,\" he explained. \nMr Greenhow said that these staffing and supply costs would \"inevitably be passed on to the consumer\". \n\"Furlough and grants helped us survive, but essentially our survival was achieved by huge borrowings, which represent another cost to the business and therefore another inflationary driver.\"\nIan Ridley runs three pubs and the majority of his 50 staff earn the National Living Wage. \n\"Something's got to give, we cannot absorb these cost pressures,\" he explained.  \nAlthough he has not worked through the cost projections for next year yet, Mr Ridley estimates the price of a pint could rise by 20p.\n\"When we're trying to encourage customers to come back and we're compete with supermarkets on booze, higher prices are not going to help us,\" he told the BBC. \nThe wage increases will mean an estimated \u00a320,000 of extra costs, in addition to higher food, transport and brewery bills. \nRising energy costs are causing concern and Mr Ridley said the VAT hike in April and business tax rates were another \"huge worry\".

      "tags": "Economics,GDP,Economic growth,Budget 2021,Office for Budget Responsibility,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The impact of Brexit on the UK economy will be worse in the long run compared to the coronavirus pandemic, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility has said.\nRichard Hughes said leaving the EU would reduce the UK's potential GDP by about 4% in the long term.\nHe said forecasts showed the pandemic would reduce GDP \"by a further 2%\".\n\"In the long term it is the case that Brexit has a bigger impact than the pandemic\", he told the BBC.\nHis comments come after the OBR said the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, with suggestions inflation could hit almost 5%.\nSpeaking after Wednesday's Budget, Mr Hughes said recent data showed the impact of Brexit was \"broadly consistent\" with the OBR's assumption that the leaving the EU would \"reduce our long run GDP by around 4%\".\n\"We think that the effect of the pandemic will reduce that (GDP) output by a further 2%,\" he added.\nThe Treasury has been contacted for comment.\nGDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It is a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy.\nIn a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly higher than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. If GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking.\nThe UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc on 31 January 2020, however, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, before a new trade deal was announced and implemented on 1 January this year.\nBoth the pandemic and Brexit have played a part in current supply chain issues across the UK, and have further exposed the scarcity of lorry drivers, which has resulted in recent shortages of products for businesses and some empty shelves for customers.\nHowever, in the OBR's latest report, the independent body said \"supply bottlenecks had been exacerbated by changes in the migration and trading regimes following Brexit\".\nSupply chain issues has led to the government granting short-term visas to EU workers across certain sectors, including the haulage industry.\nThe British Poultry Council has said turkey farmers will do their best to ensure Christmas \"is as normal as it can be\", but warned shortages are likely, due to a shortage of seasonal overseas workers.\nThe government has assured consumers that turkeys will be available for the festive season and has also deployed temporary visas in a bid to bolster worker numbers."
