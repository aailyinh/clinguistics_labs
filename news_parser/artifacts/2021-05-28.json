      "text": "Olivia Rodrigo has become the youngest solo artist to top both the UK singles and album chart at the same time.\nThe 18-year-old's debut album Sour enjoyed the biggest opening week of 2021, setting a streaming record.\nIt attracted the highest number of streams for a debut album in its opening week, overtaking previous record holder Lewis Capaldi. \nMeanwhile, her single Good 4 U is the year's biggest number one, notching up 117,000 chart sales across seven days.\nThat figure includes 13.5 million streams, according to The Official Charts Company, who called the US singer \"the year's biggest breakthrough artist\". \nRodrigo's debut single Drivers License topped the UK charts in January.\nThat song broke Spotify's record for the most streams in one day, peaking at 17 million streams on 12 January. \nSour's 51,000 sales - including streams, sales and downloads - make it the biggest opening week for a debut album in two years, since Capaldi's Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent in May 2019.\nRodrigo's album achieved 45.7 million streams of individual tracks over the past seven days (30,945 streaming-equivalent sales), the Official Charts Company said.\nShe is also the first artist for six years to top both charts on the release of their debut album. The last was Sam Smith in 2015 with the album In The Lonely Hour and single Lay Me Down.\nBy Mark Savage, BBC music reporter\nOlivia Rodrigo has been singing as long she can remember. Growing up in Temecula, California, she would belt out the choruses to No Doubt's Bathwater and the White Stripes' Seven Nation Army.\nShe started vocal lessons in kindergarten and by the age of eight was a talent-show regular. Her ability to inhabit a song was evident even then. \"I was so dramatic,\" she laughs. \"There's videos on YouTube of me singing, and I'm so into it. I act everything out and I'm so performative. People always told my mom, 'You should put her in acting lessons.'\"\nRodrigo went on to star in two Disney series, Bizaardvark and High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, where she plays a student involved in a school production of the classic 2006 musical.\nWhen the show's creators discovered she was a budding musician, they encouraged her to write for the series. One of her songs, a power ballad called All I Want, racked up millions of streams and became a minor chart hit.\nBut although she arrived in a Disney vehicle, it was her own Drivers License - a devastating break-up ballad - that marked the arrival of pop's brightest new star. After two increasingly impressive singles, and now a number one album, she's on the road to even bigger things.\nRead more: The unstoppable rise of Olivia Rodrigo\nRodrigo also has two other singles in this week's top 10, with D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu at number four and Traitor at eight. \nThe highest new entry on the singles chart is Butter by BTS, which at number three, while last week's chart topper Tion Wayne & Russ Millions is at two with Body. \nIn the albums chart, Sour is followed by three new entries. \nGary Numan's Intruder is at two, Twenty One Pilots are at three with Scaled and Icy and Pink is number four with All I know So Far. \nRag 'n' Bone Man is at number five with Life By Misadventure, which was down two places. \nSuper Furry Animals' frontman Gruff Rhys is at number 10 with his seventh album Seeking New Gods, which is his first UK Top 10 album.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The UK has put a temporary export bar on a \u00a317m Renaissance bronze roundel.\nThe unique piece was found at a Devon country estate and sold at auction in 2003 for a then-record \u00a36.9m to Qatari royal Sheikh Saud al-Thani.\nThe artefact, depicting the Roman gods Venus, Mars, Cupid and Vulcan, was later lent to the Victoria and Albert Museum before being sold again.\nThe ban runs until 27 September in the hope that funds, plus \u00a33.4m VAT, can be secured to keep it in the UK. \nThis could be extended until 27 March 2022 if an offer to raise the money has been made.\nThe export bar was recommended by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA).\nThe panel of experts advises ministers on whether objects more than 50 years old and sold to buyers who want to take them abroad should be \"saved\" for the nation.\nThe committee praised the 15th Century roundel's \"remarkable craftmanship\", saying it was \"breathtaking in both beauty and grandeur\" and its \"loss... would be a misfortune\".\nAbout 42cm (16.5 inches) in diameter, the roundel depicts Vulcan and his wife Venus - the goddess of love. Venus is holding her son Cupid, while turning towards her lover Mars, the god of war.\nIt is thought to have been acquired on the Grand Tour by judge and MP George Treby III in the 1740s and kept at the family's Plympton estate.  Passed down through generations of the family, they were reportedly unaware of its importance and value when uncovered by auctioneers Christie's.\nChristie's concluded it had originated in the region of Mantua, northern Italy, between 1480 and 1500 but stated it was impossible to identify its maker for certain.\nThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \"The roundel is larger, more complex and more refined than other examples produced in Mantua at the same time which are currently in British collections. The decision to defer the export will give a UK buyer the opportunity to acquire the exceptional piece.\" \nCulture minister Caroline Dinenage added: \"This piece is a stunning combination of myth and mystery. I hope a UK buyer can be found so that researchers can reveal its secrets and the public can see this striking design on display.\" \nStuart Lochead, RCEWA committee member said: \"While it shows clear links to Mantegna and Donatello [Renaissance artists], it is hoped that further study might reveal who designed and produced it and for whom and therefore contribute to advancing knowledge of the period.\"\nThe roundel was also subject to an export bar in 2003 following its initial sale. The V&A raised the funds to buy it, only to see the Qatar ruling family withdraw their export application. They later allowed the museum to temporarily display it. \nThe DCMS says the roundel was purchased by its current owner in 2019 but has not named them. "

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Jonathan Ashworth,Boris Johnson,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has rejected claims by his former closest adviser Dominic Cummings that government mistakes led to thousands of extra Covid deaths.\nThe PM said some of the \"commentary\" didn't \"bear any relation to reality\". \nAnd Health Secretary Matt Hancock - who was accused by Mr Cummings of lying about his handling of the pandemic - said the allegations were \"not true\".\nBut Labour accused him of failing to answer \"pressing questions\" on testing, PPE and care home mistakes.\nIn a letter to Mr Hancock, the party's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said \"it is extremely disrespectful to those who have died and their loved ones\" not to address the claims.\nLabour has urged the government to bring forward the public inquiry into the Covid pandemic - due to start next year - but this idea was rejected.\nIn total, 127,748 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test for the disease, according to official figures.\nDuring a scathing attack on Mr Johnson and Mr Hancock on Wednesday, Mr Cummings told a committee of MPs \"tens of thousands of people died, who didn't need to die\", as a result of government mistakes.\nMore than 42,000 of total UK deaths involving Covid have happened in care homes in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nMr Cummings claimed Mr Hancock had assured him and the prime minister early in the pandemic that people \"were going to be tested before they went back to care homes [from hospitals]\".\n\"We only subsequently found out that that hadn't happened,\" said Mr Cummings, adding that subsequent government statements about putting a shield around care homes were \"complete nonsense\".\nAt the Downing Street press conference on Thursday afternoon, Mr Hancock said \"of course\" he had committed to testing everyone returning to a care home from hospitals, but that it \"took time\" to build the testing capacity.\nHe said without the capacity, \"it wasn't possible\" to test everyone, but that was why he set his target of 100,000 tests a day - something Mr Cummings had described as \"stupid\" and counter-productive.\nMr Cummings also attacked the health secretary's integrity, saying he \"should have been fired for at least 15 to 20 things, including lying to everybody on multiple occasions in meeting after meeting in the Cabinet Room and publicly\".\nAnd he told the MPs Mr Johnson - for whom he worked until he was ousted in a Downing Street power struggle last autumn -  was \"unfit for the job\" of leading the country.\nHe added that he had repeatedly urged Mr Johnson to sack Mr Hancock, calling the health secretary \"completely incapable of doing the job\". \nMr Hancock hit back as he answered an urgent Labour question on Covid in the Commons, saying he wanted to \"put formally on the record that these unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true,\" \nHe added: \"I've been straight with people in public and in private throughout.\"\nIn an apparent barb aimed at Mr Cummings, Mr Hancock said the \"operation and function\" of government had become \"easier\" over the past six months.\nOn a visit to a hospital in Colchester, Essex, the prime minister, when asked if tens of thousands of people had died needlessly, replied: \"No, no I don't think so. \n\"Of course, this has been an incredibly difficult series of decisions, none of which we've taken lightly.\"\nHe added that \"at every stage we've been governed by a determination to protect life, to save life, to ensure NHS is not overwhelmed\".  \nBut, on a visit to Avonmouth, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that the \"buck stops\" with the prime minister over the government's performance on Covid.\nHe added: \"Dominic Cummings can't be the last word on this. We need to get all the available evidence....\n\"I don't think the prime minister has made good decisions in this pandemic.\"\nDuring Wednesday's session with the Health and Science select committees, Mr Cummings also said:\nDowning Street said \"all sides\" of the story would be heard at the upcoming public inquiry into the pandemic, adding that the prime minister would be \"getting on with the job\" on Thursday by visiting a hospital."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has been approved for use in the UK by the medicines regulator.\nThe vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials and has met expected safety standards.\nTwenty million doses have been ordered for the UK and will arrive later this year.\nIt will be the fourth vaccine to be used in the UK to protect against Covid-19.\nMore than 38 million people have now received a first dose of a vaccine in the UK - nearly three-quarters of the adult population.\nThe vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures.\nThe UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) will produce advice on exactly who should receive the Belgian-made jab in due course.\nThe single-dose option has already been authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US and the World Health Organization (WHO).\nNadhim Zahawi, vaccine deployment minister, said the Janssen jab would be \"another weapon in our arsenal to beat this pandemic\".\n\"We are doing everything we can to vaccinate all adults as quickly as possible and I encourage everybody to come forward for a jab as soon as they are eligible.\"\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the approval was \"really good news\" but \"we're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible\", she said.\nOriginally, the UK ordered 30 million doses but reduced its order after the vaccination programme in the UK picked up pace.\nThe vaccine, developed by Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical arm, Janssen, uses the same technology as the Oxford-AstraZeneca one and is likely to be more suitable for older adults than younger people. Under-40s are being offered an alternative to AstraZeneca in the UK because of a potential link to a type of rare blood clot in the brain.\nBoth vaccines use a modified version of a different virus to deliver instructions to the body's cells to fire up the immune system and produce antibodies.\nSince the Janssen jab is given as one single dose, it could speed up rollout to vulnerable people in care homes and those living in remote locations.\nIt has not yet been tested against the variant first detected in India which is spreading fast in the UK, although at low levels.\nThe US, South Africa and the European Union briefly paused the rollout of the Janssen vaccine in April after reports of rare blood clots in very small numbers of people after their jab.\nThe US is now offering the vaccine to people over 18, after concluding that the benefits of using it outweighed any risks of side-effects. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) came to the same conclusion after looking at a potential link between the vaccine and clots.\nThe Janssen jab is currently being tested as part of a UK study to find out whether a third dose could protect against new variants.\nDr June Raine, head of the body which approves vaccines in the UK - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - said information on quality, safety and effectiveness of the Janssen jab had been thoroughly reviewed.\n\"We now have four safe and effective vaccines approved to help protect us from Covid-19,\" she said, adding that their work did not end there.\n\"We are continually monitoring all Covid-19 vaccines in use once they have been approved to ensure that the benefits in protecting people against the disease continue to outweigh any risks. \n\"The safety of the public will always come first - you can be absolutely sure of our commitment to this.\"\nThe MHRA said pregnant or breast-feeding women should decide whether to have the Janssen option in consultation with a healthcare professional after considering the benefits and risks.\nThere have been a further 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus and another 4,182 confirmed cases on Friday."

      "text": "A former Post Office worker says her life was ruined and her health suffered after she was falsely accused of stealing.\nLorraine Williams said she kept quiet for 10 years as people in her community on Anglesey turned their backs on her.\nShe suffered with depression and lost her home and her job, and said the only way she kept going was by hiding away.\nJudges quashed the convictions of former postmasters after the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.\nAfter the Court of Appeal case in London last month, Mrs Williams now feels strong enough to tell her story for the first time, and wants the world to know she is innocent.\n\"Since the appeal I've had about three people come to the door to say congratulations and I think I need to tell everyone I'm not guilty,\" she said.\n\"It's been a very, very difficult 10 years.\" \nMrs Williams lives in the village of Llanddaniel Fab and for years had been a central part of the community.\nShe fostered children, worked with after-school and youth clubs and was a warden on an estate for the elderly, living on the site with her husband Gareth and daughter Cameron.\nWhen the future of the village shop and post office were under threat, she was a member of the committee which raised money to buy the building and she donated to the appeal fund.\nThen, in 2009, facing more uncertainty about the service, she agreed to work as a sub-postmistress alongside her work as a warden.\n\"The shop was closing and the post office was closing and a lot of people in the village were asking 'why don't you take over? You could do it',\" Mrs Williams told BBC Cymru Fyw.\n\"I was a warden at the time for elderly people in the village, so we decided to take over - to help the village more than anything else.\"\nMrs Williams' nightmare began over Christmas in 2010. She said electrical problems affected the Post Office's computer system - Horizon - and she contacted the support line.\nWithin weeks the computer showed money and stock was missing, and the situation became worse and worse, but Mrs Williams had no idea what was happening.\n\"You think 'I'm in trouble here and I can't fix it'. I didn't even tell my husband for about three months, I was panicking so much. It was a strain.\n\"I couldn't sleep at all. I eventually slept in my daughter's room because I didn't want to disturb my husband so I just pretended my daughter wanted company.\"\nIn June 2011, Post Office lawyers arrived to tell Mrs Williams \u00a314,600 was missing.\n\"They were asking me 'where is it?',\" she said.\n\"I told them I didn't know, I didn't have it and I hadn't taken it. They locked me out of the post office that day, took the keys away from me and suspended me. It was a massive shock.\"\nThe Post Office insisted Mrs Williams was the only one having problems with the computer system and she was accused of theft.\nBut it is now known she was not the only one, by a long shot. And someone else who had similar problems lived just two miles down the road.\nFormer councillor Noel Thomas was wrongly jailed in 2006 for keeping false accounts after the Horizon system showed \u00a348,000 was missing from his post office in Gaerwen.\nFrom the beginning, he had said the computer was at fault - as others across the UK had also said.\nBut in a case at Caernarfon Crown Court in 2012, on legal advice, Mrs Williams pleaded guilty to keeping false accounts in order to avoid going to jail, fearing the effect that would have on her young daughter.\n\"We told her before the court case what was happening and that maybe mam wouldn't be coming home, and that I hadn't done it, 'but someone will look after you, please don't worry, you will be with your dad',\" she recalled.\n\"She was 10 years old. This has gone on for half of her life - she is now 20.\"\nMrs Williams was handed a 52-week suspended sentence, on the condition she would \"pay back\" the \u00a314,600 and perform 200 hours of community service.\nShe lost her income - the shop, the post office and her job with the elderly - and she had to leave her home of 10 years due to it being tied to the warden job.\nShe moved to a house she and her husband owned in the village, and took out a second mortgage to pay the compensation to the Post Office.\n\"I don't remember moving,\" Mrs Williams said.\n\"The only thing I remember is carrying a table in the middle of the night because we didn't have money to get a van or anything.\n\"We carried stuff in the middle of the night or early in the morning to hide the fact we were moving, not because we were ashamed of going but because we were ashamed we couldn't afford to pay anyone to help us.\"\nMrs Williams said the effect on her mental health was the worst part, and while family, some friends and community members supported her, others turned their backs and ignored her or were rude to her in front of her child.\n\"When my daughter was in school I didn't leave the house, I just took her to school and stayed in the house. It was depression, and fear... fear of how people would act towards me,\" she said.\n\"Nobody wanted to hear my side, I couldn't tell people what had happened, they had decided and that was that.\"\nBut Mrs Williams heard a knock on the door one day, and it was Noel Thomas.\n\"He had heard I was stuck in the house and said 'come out with your head up, you have nothing to be ashamed of, let's fight this together'.\"\nEvery fortnight she had to meet with the probation service to discuss her fraud, and she was struggling with not being able to tell the truth - having been warned by her solicitor not to say she was innocent or she could end up in jail.\n\"They were trying to teach me how to manage money and budget, it was awful. One woman said 'you won't be able to work in charity shops, not after what you've done',\" she said.\n\"I wanted to kill myself. I remember going to see a lawyer and him saying 'you'll go through a dark time but you'll come out of it'.\"\nMrs Williams said thinking of her daughter got her through.\n\"This sounds selfish but I thought 'my husband would cope but she won't'.\"\nMrs Williams also developed diabetes and alopecia in 2013 because of the shock, but gradually she gained the confidence to fight back.\nShe started volunteering and found work, and joined a group of other sub-postmasters, including Mr Thomas, who had been through the same thing.\n\"There was a time when I thought 'I'm taking on the crown, I've got no hope,\" she said.\n\"But Noel said 'no, carry on',\" and in 2019, the Post Office admitted there had been errors in its computer system in the past and apologised.\nMrs Williams had to wait more than a year again to clear her name, but last month she was successful.\nMore appeals are expected in the future, and questions will need to be answered over how so much money was lost.\nThe computer company, Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon system, said it takes the judgment very seriously and will thoroughly investigate the matter.\nMrs Williams received an apology this week from the chairman of the Post Office, Tim Parker, saying it accepted the Court of Appeal's decision and that she had not had a fair hearing.\nHe promised the Post Office would learn from its mistakes.\n\"Someone has to be accountable for this, someone knew,\" Mrs Williams said.\n\"Someone has to take the blame and be punished. I wouldn't want to go so far as calling for someone to go to jail, although they deserve it, because I am sick of thinking about jail.\n\"But they can't get away with this.\n\"I shouldn't cry, but sometimes I can't stop. It still affects me and I just think about my family and how they've suffered and how they've supported me.\n\"I know I'm supposed to be happy now but things are still in the back of my mind. I'm not so happy go lucky as I was before. I'm not the same person.\""

      "text": "The HS2 high speed rail network's eastern leg, linking Birmingham to Leeds, will go ahead and could even be delivered earlier than planned, the transport secretary has said.\nBut further work was needed on how to integrate it with plans for northern powerhouse rail, said Grant Shapps.\nThe HS2 network is due to be built in stages, with the final leg to Leeds completed by 2040.\nBut critics say its \u00a3106bn price tag cannot be justified.  \nIn December, the National Infrastructure Commission said that the government should focus on improving rail links between cities in the North and Midlands over new projects such as HS2.\nAs a result, transport groups in the North and Midlands had feared the eastern leg of the project could be scrapped.\nHowever, speaking at an online event run by the Policy Exchange think tank this week Mr Shapps said HS2 would be built in full and might be delivered earlier than previously planned.\n\"We are going to complete HS2 and include HS2 on the eastern leg to Leeds,\" he said.\n\"The only question that we have is how to better integrate that with plans which have developed a very long way since HS2 was first dreamt up all those decades ago. That particularly pertains to the northern powerhouse rail.\" \nMr Shapps suggested the eastern leg to Leeds originally scheduled for completion between 2035 and 2040 could be brought forward \"quite dramatically\" by building it \"in a smarter way\".\nHe said the government would provide further information on that \"soon\".\nHenri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a lobby group, said the government was doing the right thing.\n\"It's critical to ensuring levelling up is a reality not just rhetoric,\" said Mr Murison, referring to election promises to boost the economy in the north of England.\nMaria Machancoses, chief executive of Midlands Connect, a government-funded regional transport body, said: \"While these verbal commitments are encouraging, we need definitive action, namely the publication of the government's Integrated Rail Plan, to give businesses and investors the confidence they need to make decisions.\n\"The quicker we know government's intentions, the faster we can act, and the sooner we can deliver the benefits local communities,\" she added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nA single-dose vaccine has been approved for use in the UK, making it the fourth jab to be authorised in the country so far. The UK has ordered 20 million doses, which will arrive later this year. The vaccine is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures. The UK's vaccine committee, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, will produce advice on exactly who should receive the Belgian-made vaccine in due course.\nThere are signs of a small increase in coronavirus cases across the UK being driven by the variant first identified in India, Office for National Statistics figures suggest. Almost half of infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the Indian variant. But national data suggests this is still confined to a handful of areas. Earlier, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said there was nothing in the data to suggest the 21 June date for ending restrictions in England will have to be delayed - but he could not guarantee this. \nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been approved for use in 12-15 year olds in the EU - the first jab allowed for this age group in the bloc. The EU's medicines agency announced the move at a news conference on Friday, saying the age group would require two doses with an interval of at least three weeks. The vaccine had already been approved for use in those aged 16 and older. Member states will now decide if they will offer the jab to children.\nGlasgow is to remain the only part of Scotland under level three restrictions for at least another week. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was still concern about an outbreak of the Indian variant, which accounts for about half of the new cases in the city. Under level three restrictions people are forbidden from mixing in each other's homes, pubs are closed for indoor drinking and no-one is allowed to visit or leave the city without good reason. Read more here about how Glasgow has been locked down for nine months. \nWhen Rev Tim Hatwell began to have chest pains after having the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab he thought he might have been having a heart attack. Instead, he was one of the first patients in the UK to develop a post-vaccine blood clot. Having now recovered thanks to the swift work of doctors, he is back to work. He said: \"I do consider myself fortunate, and despite what happened I wouldn't change what I've done. My wife has had the AstraZeneca vaccine without any problems and the risks involved are miniscule.\"\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWorried about the blood clots that have been reported as a rare side-effect of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Johnson and Johnson coronavirus vaccines? Here's what we know about them.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

German leaders gave the green light on Thursday.\nThe US and Canada approved the Pfizer jab for adolescents earlier this month.\nFriday's announcement came as the World Health Organization (WHO) said Europe needed to speed up its vaccine rollout.\nWHO Europe director Hans Kluge warned that the pandemic would not be over until at least 70% of the population had been vaccinated.\nMarco Cavaleri, the EMA's head of vaccine strategy, said the 12-15 age group would require two doses with an interval of at least three weeks. \nHe said trials showed that the Pfizer vaccine was \"highly preventative\" for Covid-19 in children.\n\"From a safety perspective, the vaccine was well tolerated and the side effects in this age group were very much similar to what we have seen in young adults and not raising major concerns at this point in time,\" he added.\nThe EU has already approved the Pfizer vaccine for those aged 16 and older.\nGerman federal and state leaders agreed on Thursday that children over 12 could start receiving Covid jabs from 7 June. \nChancellor Angela Merkel said the vaccine would not be compulsory for teenagers and one survey suggested that only 51% of parents wanted their children to have the jab. \nFlorian Hoffmann, the head of Germany's Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine, has said that adults should be prioritised \"because they have a much higher risk of getting a serious course of the virus which could see them end up in intensive care\".\nEarlier on Friday, the WHO's Hans Kluge warned that the vaccine rollout across Europe was still \"too slow\".\n\"The pandemic will be over once we reach 70% minimum coverage in vaccination,\" he told AFP news agency.\nMr Kluge said he remained concerned about the increased contagiousness of new variants, adding that speed was of the essence.\n\"We know for example that the B.1617 (Indian variant) is more transmissible than the B.117 (UK or Kent variant), which already was more transmissible than the previous strain,\" he said.\n\"Our best friend is speed, the time is working against us. We need to accelerate, we need to enlarge the number of vaccines.\" \nFrance is to open up vaccinations to everyone aged over 18 from 31 May, the government has said. Until now only adults aged 50 and over have been eligible. \nCanada was the first country in the world to authorise the use of the Pfizer vaccine for children between 12 to 15, saying it made the decision based on data from phase three clinical trials.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) followed suit days later, calling it \"a significant step in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic\"."

      "text": "Two men have been found guilty of murder after a mother and her four-year-old son died in a house fire that was started after a drugs-debt row.\nGina Ingles, 34, and her son Milo Ingles-Bailey died in July 2018 at their Eastbourne home. Ms Ingles' partner Toby Jarrett was also injured.\nJacob Barnard and Andrew Milne have been convicted at Lewes Crown Court of their murder and attempted murder.\nJohn Tabakis was found guilty of perverting the course of justice.\nBarnard and Milne are due to be sentenced on Friday. Judge Mrs Justice Whipple said they \"will be facing lengthy terms\" in prison.\nTabakis was released on bail to be sentenced at a later date.  \nFire investigators concluded the blaze had been started deliberately close to the front door, and outside the house a petrol can and lighter were found.\nDNA matching Barnard was found on the lighter, and DNA matching Milne was found on the petrol can, the court was told.\nCCTV images showed two men walking away from scene of the fire just before 01.00 BST on 10 July 2018.\nBarnard dealt in second-hand cars, buying them in the UK and selling them in Portugal. He also dealt in drugs. \nMilne worked as a debt collector for Barnard, the court heard. He was arrested in Portugal.\nThe jury was told Mr Jarrett owed money to a local drug dealer, who in turn owed money to Barnard.\nMr Jarrett had woken at about 01:30 BST to find the house he shared with Ms Ingles in Croxden Way, Eastbourne, filled with smoke.\nHe fell from the bedroom window, and was seriously injured and suffered from extensive burns, while Ms Ingles went to get Milo from another room.\nThe remains of Ms Ingles and Milo were found in her bedroom under a window several days later, together with the body of a dog, the jury was told.\nMobile phone data showed Barnard and Milne exchanged calls the day before the fire. Barnard had also exchanged calls with Tabakis.\nA Mercecdes ML270 4x4 car, owned by Barnard, was picked up on number plate recognition systems driving into Eastbourne before the fire, and then leaving the town, after the time of the blaze. \nThe same car was then taken by Tabakis on a ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe, and on to Portugal.\nHe had been told by Barnard to \"get the vehicle out of the country as quickly as possible as it had been involved in some criminal activity\", the prosecution told the jury. \nBarnard, 32, who lived in Portugal, and Milne, 42, from Hastings, were found guilty of murdering Ms Ingles and Milo, and the attempted murder of Toby Jarrett.\nThe jury also found Milne guilty of being in possession of a prohibited weapon. \nTabakis, 31, from Hastings, was convicted of one charge of intent to pervert the course of justice. \nSenior Investigating Officer, Gordon Denslow from Sussex Police, said the investigation had been \"very long and very complex\". \n\"At no point have Barnard or Milne accepted responsibility for their actions in the early hours of 10 July 2018, or expressed any remorse or regret.\n\"Instead, their unfounded denials in the face of compelling evidence have meant that Gina's and Milo's family have had to endure a long and painful wait to find out what really happened that night, and why.\"\nHe said: \"This was a carefully planned, cowardly, but horrific attack carried out by Barnard and Milne in the middle of the night against a defenceless family. \n\"Tabakis then knowingly tried to help them get away with their crimes by driving the car they used during the attack to Portugal just hours afterwards.\"\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "tags": "Money,Financial Conduct Authority (FCA),Personal finance,Insurance",
      "text": "People renewing their home or motor insurance will pay no more than they would as a new customer from January.\nThe new rules have been confirmed by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), following years of complaints.\nThe FCA says the move will save loyal customers an estimated \u00a34.2bn over 10 years.\nBut it admitted it could spell the end of the cheapest deals for new customers.\nThe regulator has been trying to change the rules to prevent \"price walking\" - when insurance prices rise at each renewal even though the level of risk has not changed.\n\"These measures will put an end to the very high prices paid by many loyal customers,\" said Sheldon Mills, from the FCA.\n\"Consumers can still benefit from shopping around or negotiating with their current provider, but won't be charged more at renewal just for being an existing customer.\"\nIt follows complaints from consumer groups that loyal customers pay more unnecessarily.\nSo-called price walking is when a customer is charged more, year after year, by staying with the same insurance company - even though their risk is no greater.\nThe FCA has pointed to an example in which a new customer for home insurance typically pays \u00a3130 for a year's cover.\nBut for the same policy, having stayed with the same insurer for five years, that annual premium rises to \u00a3238.\nFor motor insurance, new customers pay \u00a3285 while people who have been with their provider for more than five years pay \u00a3370, according to the FCA's example.\nFollowing a super-complaint from Citizens Advice, the FCA has been looking to tackle the loyalty penalty - a result of the growth, and encouragement, of shopping around for better deals for insurance, overdrafts and utilities.\nThose who switch get the best deals as new customers. Those who stay loyal get charged more.\nTen million policies across home and motor insurance are held by people who have been with their provider for five years or more.\nAmong those facing the loyalty penalty was Mike Noone, from Manchester, who retired after running a fruit and vegetable stall with his wife for 16 years.\n\"Looking back, running a small business like ours was all consuming and you do tend to let things slide at home,\" he said.\nHe received a car insurance renewal quote in which the price had gone up by 20%.\n\"One of our daughters said: 'Dad, you've really got to get on the internet and find yourself a better quote than that'.  So I did,\" he said.\nHe challenged his insurer which did not budge on the price, so he switched provider. \nCharities said other people might not be able to switch so easily. They said the problems were worse for people on very low incomes who might not have the technology to search for the cheapest deals, or those who find the calculations difficult.\n\"We're pleased to see the FCA setting the bar so high in stamping out this systematic scam, and we now need to see similar action in the other markets,\" said Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice.\nThe FCA will also bring in new rules to make it easier for consumers to cancel automatic policy renewals and require insurers to look more closely at how they offer fair value for consumers. \nIt will also require home and motor insurance firms to report more data to the regulator.\nA spokesman for the Association of British Insurers, which represents the sector, said: \"As the FCA has said previously, insurers do not make excessive profits and, as they now point out, it is likely that firms will no longer be able to offer unsustainably low-priced deals to some customers.\"\nHe added that it was vital that customers still had incentives to shop around, and that people should look for the deal that suited their needs instead of just choosing the cheapest one."

I'm sitting in my kitchen in Manchester, speaking to President Obama. But immediately he made me feel at ease. \n\"It wasn't long before I realised just how aligned our experiences as children were in shaping the men you see today - adversity, obstacles and all.\"\nThis week Mr Rashford highlighted the \"racial slurs\" he faced on social media after his team's defeat in the Europa League final, with the attacks described by Manchester United as \"disgraceful racist abuse\".\nIn their Zoom call, the two men discussed the importance of books and reading.\nMr Obama said his mother had \"planted this love of reading\" and Mr Rashford said books had given him a freedom to follow his own ideas. \n\"Rather than someone telling me to do this and do that - books allowed me to do it my own way,\" said Mr Rashford.\nThe footballer last year launched his own children's book club, to improve reading skills among disadvantaged young people.\nWith TV chef Tom Kerridge, he is also offering free recipes and cooking tips for affordable, healthy meals, as part of his campaign against food poverty.\nMr Rashford has spoken about being hungry and relying on free school meals as a child - and successfully battled with the government over providing free meals over the school holidays during the pandemic.\nThis was raised by former Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings, who told a select committee of MPs that the prime minister had been advised: \"Do not pick a fight with Rashford\" but then had to \"surrender twice\".\nThe conversation between Barack Obama and Marcus Rashford, moderated by broadcaster June Sarpong, is available on YouTube."

      "text": "Stonewall head Nancy Kelley has defended the organisation's position amid a freedom of speech row and criticism from a founder.\nMatthew Parris said in the Times that Stonewall had become \"tangled up in the trans issue\" and \"cornered into an extremist stance\".\nBut Ms Kelley told the BBC she was \"really comfortable\" with the direction the charity was going in.\nShe likened so-called \"gender critical\" beliefs to anti-Semitism.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said its defence of the right to hold \"gender critical beliefs\" - that sex cannot be changed - \"does not have an impact on our commitment to uphold the rights of transgender people\". \nThe new EHRC chair, Lady Falkner, has said women have the right to question transgender identity without being abused, stigmatised or risking losing their job.\nMs Kelley said while Stonewall believed in freedom of speech, it was \"not without limit\".\n\"With all beliefs including controversial beliefs there is a right to express those beliefs publicly and where they're harmful or damaging - whether it's anti-Semitic beliefs, gender critical beliefs, beliefs about disability - we have legal systems that are put in place for people who are harmed by that.\"\nChallenged as to whether it might be considered offensive to compare anti-Semitic beliefs to gender-critical views, she insisted it was appropriate.\n\"We're talking about protected groups. We're talking about people that are protected on the basis of their sexuality, people that are protected on the basis of gender identity, people who are protected on the basis of race and that's why I think the analogy is apt.\" \nJournalist and former Tory MP Matthew Parris, one of Stonewall's 14 founders, recently suggested the charity had \"lost its way\". \nIn an article for the Times, he said: \"The organisation is tangled up in the trans issue, cornered into an extremist stance on a debate that a charity formed to help gay men, lesbian women and bisexual people should never have got itself into.\"\nMs Kelley said while Mr Parris was entitled to his views, being trans-inclusive was the \"absolute norm\" for LGBT organisations. \nShe also denied Stonewall had approved incorrect advice on transgender issues for the University of Essex, which is part of its Diversity Champions workplace inclusion scheme. \nA recent report found the university had unlawfully blacklisted a speaker after some protesters labelled her a \"transphobe\". \nMs Kelley said Stonewall had \"nothing to do\" with the university's process for deciding external speakers and was \"really confident\" in its legal advice.\nStonewall's been criticised for using the term \"gender identity\" when referring to the Equality Act's protected characteristic of \"gender reassignment\".\nBut Ms Kelley described that as \"the difference between natural language and statutory language\". \nShe also expressed frustration that the volume of media coverage and debate around trans rights meant \"it can be difficult to get across all the work we do... focusing on the experiences of LGB [lesbian, gay and bisexual] people.\" \nShe said the organisation's work could still benefit people, whether or not they agreed with its position, such as improving access to IVF.\nThat aim is part of the organisation's new \"free to be\" strategy, which includes campaigning for \"hate crime and hate speech laws in the UK that protect LGBTQ+ communities\" and a pledge to champion inclusion across schools. \nThe strategy also prioritises a \"legally enforceable ban on conversion therapy\".\nMs Kelley said the consultation process, planned for September, was an \"unnecessary delay\" but promised to work closely with the government on the ban.  \nConversion therapy is defined by health groups, including NHS England, as attempts to change someone's sexuality or gender identity.  \nIt is understood part of the consultation will look at how to ensure certain medical or other accredited professionals will not be criminalised. \nMs Kelley said a therapist, helping someone explore their gender identity or sexual orientation, wouldn't be caught by a ban, \"because that's not seeking to suppress or change something. That's exploring with you.\" \nA government Equality Hub spokeswoman said: \"The consultation will seek further views from the public and key stakeholders to ensure that the ban can address the practice while protecting the medical profession; defending freedom of speech; and upholding religious freedom.\"\nMs Kelly has also called for an \"individual cabinet level post\" to focus on the equalities brief. Liz Truss holds the role as well as being international trade secretary. "

      "tags": "Waiting times,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Surgeons are calling for specialist hubs in England to help tackle what they call a \"colossal backlog\" of non-urgent operations because of Covid-19.\nThe Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) wants a network of hospital sites focused on routine surgery, such as hip and knee replacements. \nThe government says it is working \"to accelerate the recovery of services\".\nIn March, around five million patients were waiting for surgery - the highest number since modern records began.\nMore than 436,000 were waiting more than a year, NHS England figures show - compared with just 1,600 before the Covid crisis. \nA similar proportion of the population is on waiting lists in Scotland and a higher percentage in Wales and Northern Ireland. \nProf Neil Mortensen, president of the RCS, said the pandemic has had a devastating impact on surgical services  - and that it must not be allowed to happen again. \n\"Surgery must be available on the NHS all year round, not stop and start,\" he said, adding that a \"New Deal for Surgery\" was required to help weather future pandemics.\n\"If a dangerous new variant of COVID-19 takes hold, or another bad flu arrives in the autumn, we cannot allow surgery to grind to a halt again or waiting lists will become insurmountable.\" \nProf Mortensen said patients and staff had already adapted to changes required because of the pandemic, such as flexible working and outpatient consultations by phone or video link.  \nHe added that politicians needed to be open to change and accept that services available at their nearest hospital might not be the same as before.\nThe RCS says there should be around 40 centres based in existing NHS buildings to carry out non-urgent surgery.\nThe idea is to reduce the risk of infections spreading from other parts of hospitals.  \nIt is hoped that by bringing specialist teams together under one roof, there would be greater efficiency and better use of operating theatres. \nPatients might need to travel further from their local hospitals, but the RCS says its own polling suggests most would support the idea if it reduced waiting times.\nIt wants to see an extra \u00a31bn a year of government funding and a longer-term commitment to train more staff.  \nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"We have backed the NHS at every point in the pandemic, safeguarding urgent treatment such as cancer and emergency care, while protecting the NHS to ensure it was not overwhelmed.\"\nHe said the government was providing \"an extra \u00a37bn for health and care services\" this year, and \u00a31bn to tackle backlogs.\n\"We face an unprecedented challenge and will continue to work closely with the NHS to accelerate the recovery of services so everyone gets the care they need, including \u00a3160m to support hospitals to find innovative ways to carry out even more operations and cut waiting lists,\" he added.\nIt comes amid growing concern about the Covid-19 variant first identified in India.\nPublic Health England data shows cases of the variant have risen by 3,535 to 6,959 since last week.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said up to three quarters of new UK Covid cases could be of the Indian variant, and that it was \"critical\" to monitor the link between cases and hospitalisations.\nThe prime minister said it was important to understand the extent to which the vaccine programme \"interrupts the link\" between infection, hospitalisation, serious illness and death.\nHave you been waiting more than a year for your operation?

His death was a tragedy but his life was a triumph.\"\nShe read tributes from friends and family, who described him as a \"true visionary\", a \"very cool brother\" and a \"fiercely loyal\" friend who \"championed the underdog\".\nFriends from Manchester University, where Mr Merritt studied, said: \"It was clear that Jack was intelligent, but when we started to study miscarriages of justice in further detail, it became clear how strongly Jack felt about criminal justice.\"\nThe family of Ms Jones, from Stratford-upon-Avon, described her as someone with a \"private nature\".\nIn a statement read by Henry Pitchers QC, the family said they chose not to provide a full portrait of the 23-year-old at the inquest.\n\"They believe that she would wish the focus of the coroner and the jury to be on the facts and evidence before them and for the emphasis to be on a thorough investigation as to how she came to lose her life,\" the statement continued.\n\"It would be her hope that no other family is devastated and heartbroken again in similar circumstances.\n\"It is very important to the family that Saskia's legacy should not solely be based on her work with Learning Together as she was about so much more than just that. \n\"She should be defined as someone who battled to improve the lives of others in several spheres and was driven to make real changes in the world.\"\nThe family statement said Ms Jones did \"incredible research in the field of sexual violence and Rape Crisis\".\n\"Her passion in this area enabled her to finally find her career path with the hope of becoming a detective in victim support within a police force,\" the family added.\n\"The grief and loss that the family and friends of Saskia continue to endure is personal to them and it is their wish that it remains so.\"\nAs the inquest got under way Det Ch Insp Dan Brown chronicled the attack in a series of photographs and videos.\nFootage from shortly before midday showed 28-year-old Khan talking \"animatedly\" with Ms Jones at a table, even though they had not known each other.\nA 13:56 GMT he launched his attack in the men's toilets at Fishmongers' Hall, strapping two knives on to his hands, leaving a bag containing a third blade in a cubicle and dropping a prayer book on the floor.\nHe came across Mr Merritt, stabbing him multiple times, causing 12 injuries including a fatal wound to the chest, the court heard.\nKhan made his way to the cloakroom area, where he gestured to a member of staff \"as if to be quiet\",  Det Ch Insp Brown said.\nMs Jones was stabbed once in the neck and staggered up a few steps before she collapsed, jurors heard.\nKhan went on to injure Stephanie Szczotko and Isobel Rowbotham before he was confronted by a number of attendees with makeshift weapons, including an ornamental pike taken from the wall.\nThe attacker approached a member of staff, held a knife to his chest and asked him to open the door, which he did, the court was told.\nKhan was pursued on to London Bridge by John Crilly, Steven Gallant and Darryn Frost at 14:01, jurors were told.\nMr Crilly sprayed a fire extinguisher at him and Mr Frost jabbed at him with a narwhal tusk before they all tackled Khan to the ground with other members of the public.\nPolice had been called at 13:58 and armed City of London Police officers arrived at 14:02.\nDet Ch Insp Brown said Khan appeared to be wearing an improvised explosive device (IED) strapped around his midriff and people were told stand clear.\nKhan was then shot and Tasered by police but still appeared to present a threat as he writhed on the floor wearing the suspected IED, Mr Brown said.\nBy 14:12 Khan was dead.\nAn examination of the device later revealed it was not genuine, the court heard.\nThe hearing is expected to be followed by a separate jury inquest into the death of Khan."

      "tags": "Colonialism,Germany,Namibia",
      "text": "Germany has officially acknowledged committing genocide during its colonial occupation of Namibia, and announced financial aid worth more than \u20ac1.1bn (\u00a3940m; $1.34bn).\nGerman colonisers killed tens of thousands of Herero and Nama people there in early 20th Century massacres.\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas said his country was asking Namibia and victims' descendants for forgiveness. \nBut activists say the aid is not enough to address the suffering inflicted.\nThe money will apparently be paid out over 30 years through spending on infrastructure, healthcare and training programmes benefiting the impacted communities.\n\"We will now officially refer to these events as what they are from today's perspective: genocide,\" Mr Maas said, adding that colonial-era actions should be discussed \"without sparing or glossing over\".\nA spokesman for the Namibian government told AFP news agency Germany's recognition was \"a first step in the right direction\".\nFriday's statement came after five years of negotiations with Namibia - which was under German occupation from 1884 to 1915.\nThe atrocities committed have been described by historians as \"the forgotten genocide\" of the early 20th Century, in what was then known as German South West Africa.\nThe UN defines genocide as a number of acts, including killing, committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\nThe genocide began in 1904 after a Herero and Nama rebellion over German seizures of their land and cattle. The head of the military administration there, Lothar von Trotha, called for the extermination of the population in response.  \nSurvivors from the Herero and Nama population were forced into the desert and later placed in concentration camps where they were exploited for labour. \nMany died of disease, exhaustion and starvation with some subject to sexual exploitation and medical experimentation. It is thought up to 80% of the indigenous populations died during the genocide - with a death toll in the tens of thousands. \nGermany has previously acknowledged the atrocities but ruled out paying reparations. In 2018 they repatriated some human remains to Namibia which had been used as part of now-discredited research attempting to prove the racial superiority of white Europeans.\nThe latest deal was reportedly agreed during a round of negotiations held by special envoys in mid-May.\nA declaration is expected to be signed by the German foreign minister in the Namibian capital, Windhoek, next month before being ratified by each country's parliament, German media reports say.\nPresident Frank-Walter Steinmeier is then expected to travel to the country to officially apologise.\nLaidlaw Peringanda, a Herero activist and chairman of the Namibian Genocide Association, said the offer of development aid was not enough.\n\"We're actually not accepting that offer because our people have lost lands, they have lost their culture and a lot of them have fled to Botswana, South Africa and some of them were taken to Togo and Cameroon,\" he told BBC World Service.\nHe insisted that Germany should buy back ancestral lands now in the hands of the German-speaking community, which reportedly makes up less than 1% of the population.  \n\"People are getting impatient, especially the minority black people who [don't] have a piece of land,\" he said. \"And from what I'm hearing from some of the people, there will be a land revolution. People will grab the land by force. So we must actually try to avoid these things.\"\nMr Maas said the negotiations had aimed to find \"a common path to genuine reconciliation in memory of the victims\" with members of the Herero and Nama communities closely involved in talks.\nAnother point of contention is around language. The agreed deal focuses on the idea of reconciliation over formalised compensation, with Mr Maas describing the aid package as a \"gesture\" rather than reparation.\nJ\u00fcrgen Zimmerer, professor of global history of University of Hamburg, told the BBC World Service a great number of descendants of the victims of the genocide felt excluded. \n\"This is quite a problem if reconciliation is the aim,\" he said. \"How do you reconcile with the victims if the victims feel left out of the entire process?\"\nTim Whewell, writing for the BBC earlier this year about the negotiations, said the discussions were the first of their kind by a former colonial power.\nHe wrote that many Herero and Nama living in overcrowded areas or informal settlements had hoped the deal would go some way to restoring land access and some of the prosperity their ancestors enjoyed before the genocide."

      "tags": "Money,Financial Conduct Authority (FCA),Personal finance,Insurance",
      "text": "People renewing their home or motor insurance will pay no more than they would as a new customer from January.\nThe new rules have been confirmed by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), following years of complaints.\nThe FCA says the move will save loyal customers an estimated \u00a34.2bn over 10 years.\nBut it admitted it could spell the end of the cheapest deals for new customers.\nThe regulator has been trying to change the rules to prevent \"price walking\" - when insurance prices rise at each renewal even though the level of risk has not changed.\n\"These measures will put an end to the very high prices paid by many loyal customers,\" said Sheldon Mills, from the FCA.\n\"Consumers can still benefit from shopping around or negotiating with their current provider, but won't be charged more at renewal just for being an existing customer.\"\nIt follows complaints from consumer groups that loyal customers pay more unnecessarily.\nSo-called price walking is when a customer is charged more, year after year, by staying with the same insurance company - even though their risk is no greater.\nThe FCA has pointed to an example in which a new customer for home insurance typically pays \u00a3130 for a year's cover.\nBut for the same policy, having stayed with the same insurer for five years, that annual premium rises to \u00a3238.\nFor motor insurance, new customers pay \u00a3285 while people who have been with their provider for more than five years pay \u00a3370, according to the FCA's example.\nFollowing a super-complaint from Citizens Advice, the FCA has been looking to tackle the loyalty penalty - a result of the growth, and encouragement, of shopping around for better deals for insurance, overdrafts and utilities.\nThose who switch get the best deals as new customers. Those who stay loyal get charged more.\nTen million policies across home and motor insurance are held by people who have been with their provider for five years or more.\nAmong those facing the loyalty penalty was Mike Noone, from Manchester, who retired after running a fruit and vegetable stall with his wife for 16 years.\n\"Looking back, running a small business like ours was all consuming and you do tend to let things slide at home,\" he said.\nHe received a car insurance renewal quote in which the price had gone up by 20%.\n\"One of our daughters said: 'Dad, you've really got to get on the internet and find yourself a better quote than that'.  So I did,\" he said.\nHe challenged his insurer which did not budge on the price, so he switched provider. \nCharities said other people might not be able to switch so easily. They said the problems were worse for people on very low incomes who might not have the technology to search for the cheapest deals, or those who find the calculations difficult.\n\"We're pleased to see the FCA setting the bar so high in stamping out this systematic scam, and we now need to see similar action in the other markets,\" said Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice.\nThe FCA will also bring in new rules to make it easier for consumers to cancel automatic policy renewals and require insurers to look more closely at how they offer fair value for consumers. \nIt will also require home and motor insurance firms to report more data to the regulator.\nA spokesman for the Association of British Insurers, which represents the sector, said: \"As the FCA has said previously, insurers do not make excessive profits and, as they now point out, it is likely that firms will no longer be able to offer unsustainably low-priced deals to some customers.\"\nHe added that it was vital that customers still had incentives to shop around, and that people should look for the deal that suited their needs instead of just choosing the cheapest one."

      "text": "Failings by the police, probation service and MI5 contributed to the deaths of two graduates killed by a convicted terrorist, a jury has found.\nUniversity of Cambridge alumni Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were stabbed by Usman Khan at a rehabilitation event at Fishmongers' Hall on 29 November 2019.\nKhan, 28, had been released from prison 11 months previously, the inquests at London's Guildhall heard.\nThe jury concluded that both victims were unlawfully killed.\nKhan, who had spent eight years in jail for planning to set up a terrorist training camp in Pakistan, was chased on to London Bridge by people at the event who were armed with a fire extinguisher and a narwhal tusk plucked from a wall. \nThe terrorist, who wounded three others in the attack, was shot dead on the bridge by police.\nJurors found there had been unacceptable management and a lack of accountability in the oversight of Khan, who had been allowed to travel on his own to London from his hometown of Stafford.\nThey concluded there had been failures in the sharing of information between state agencies responsible for monitoring him.\nDeficiencies in the organisation of the event at Fishmongers' Hall, including inadequate security measures, were also found to have been a factor in the deaths.\nAfter the conclusions were delivered, the jury forewoman said the jurors wanted to send \"heartfelt condolences to the families of Saskia and Jack\" who \"clearly touched the lives of so many, ours included\".\n\"We are so incredibly sorry. The world lost two bright stars that dreadful day,\" she said.\nThe forewoman added the jury wanted to \"thank the astonishing individuals who put themselves in real danger to help and our incredible emergency services for their response, both that day and every day\".\nAt the conclusion of the inquests, Ms Jones's family, from Stratford-upon-Avon, said there were still \"unanswered questions relating to failures of a number of organisations and individuals\".\n\"It is beyond understanding and astonishing that not one of the state agencies sufficiently considered the associated risk and therefore questioned the wisdom of sending Usman Khan unaccompanied to London,\" the family said in a statement.\nThey also criticised Learning Together, which ran the prisoner rehabilitation programme, and the Fishmongers' Company over failures to keep those at the event safe. \nMr Merritt's father David, from Cottenham in Cambridgeshire, said it was \"clear... that the arrangements put in place for managing Usman Khan after his release from prison in 2019 were not fit for purpose, despite the authorities having had six years to plan for this\".\n\"We hope that all other agencies and organisations involved with Khan will learn the lessons highlighted by the inquest and will make changes to their systems and working practices,\" he added.\nBy Dominic Casciani, home and legal correspondent\nThese verdicts are so clear and damning that they have far wider implications than this terrible tragedy.\nThey raise questions about the competence and ability of state agencies to properly manage the risk of men as dangerous as Usman Khan. If they wanted to, the families could now try to sue the agencies involved for a finding they breached their duty to take reasonable steps to protect life. The mistakes and omissions were clear to the jury - from the inexperience of the officers managing Khan in the community, through to a dreadful muddle over who should have passed them critical MI5 intelligence. \nAll of it, in the jury's view, was \"unacceptable\". There are questions too for Cambridge University, where the chiefs of a rehabilitation scheme believed Khan was such a success he could come to their reunion in London, despite the city being such an obvious target for a convicted, deviant and unrepentant terrorist.\nRead more from Dominic here.\nA Court of Appeal ruling meant Khan had to be automatically released on licence from prison, with the Parole Board having no say as to whether he was safe to be freed.\nThroughout his time in jail, he was classed among the 70 highest-risk inmates in the country, was frequently involved in violence and radicalisation and spent a significant period under investigation by MI5.\nUpon his release, Khan was assessed as being more dangerous than when he went into prison, and there was seen to be an imminent risk of him causing serious harm to the public.\nWhile he was still an inmate, the security services launched a new covert investigation, which became a priority inquiry after intelligence was received that Khan would carry out an attack once he was freed.\nBut the intelligence was never shared with Khan's probation officer nor the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel that managed him in the community. MAPPA did not even know that Khan was being investigated by MI5 - one of whose officers often secretly attended the panel's meetings.\nWhile in HMP Whitemoor, Khan was allowed to attend a prisoner education project run by Cambridge University called Learning Together.\nAfter his release, he remained in touch with Learning Together staff, even appearing as a case study of successful change in a project video and publication. He was consequently invited to the anniversary celebration at Fishmongers' Hall.\nPolice, MI5 and probation services all knew that Khan was going to attend the event, which was his first unescorted trip out of Staffordshire after leaving prison.\nBut the inquests heard none of them considered the potential risks nor took any steps to guard against them.\nIn the days before the event, Khan bought knives and items for a fake suicide vest. He made his way to London having had his licence conditions relaxed to allow unaccompanied travel by train.\nAssistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the national lead for Counter Terrorism Policing, said the way offenders were managed in the community had been improved but he was \"so deeply sorry we weren't better than this in November 2019\".\nHe added: \"The jury has today concluded that Jack and Saskia were unlawfully killed. \n\"This reflects the fact that whilst we, along with our partners, will constantly strive to improve, the ultimate responsibility for this barbaric act lies with the attacker.\"\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said it was \"important that the government and operational partners learn lessons to prevent further incidents like this\" and she would \"consider the inquest findings\".\nIn a statement, the co-founders of Learning Together - a University of Cambridge programme - said they were \"determined to reflect on the lessons of these inquests as we move forwards\".\nThe university also said it would consider the \"lessons to be learned\"."

      "tags": "US Capitol stormed,Donald Trump,US Congress",
      "text": "Republicans in the US Senate have blocked a bill to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol Hill riot.\nThe measure passed the US House of Representatives last week.\nMembers of ex-President Donald Trump's party said the riot is already being investigated by congressional panels.\nDemocrats argued that forming a commission, similar to the one created after 9/11, would prevent any repeat of a similar invasion on the Capitol.\nTrump supporters stormed Congress on 6 January in a failed bid to overturn the certification of President Joe Biden's victory in November's election.\nThe riot left five dead, including a Capitol police officer.\nAlthough 54 senators, including six Republicans, voted in favour of creating the commission, the bill failed.\nIt needed 60 votes due to a rule called the filibuster where 60 of the 100 senators must vote in favour of a bill for it to pass.\nSpeaking from outside an ice cream parlour in Ohio on Thursday, Mr Biden condemned Republicans, saying: \"I can't imagine anyone voting against establishing a commission on the greatest assault since the Civil War on the Capitol.\" \nAlso before the vote, the mother of police officer Brian Sicknick - who died a day after the attack from a stroke - visited Capitol Hill along with her son's girlfriend, Sandra Garza, to lobby lawmakers to support the commission.\n\"Not having a January 6 Commission to look into exactly what occurred is a slap in the faces of all the officers who did their jobs that day,\" said Gladys Sicknick.\u00a0\nShe suggested that any members of Congress opposed to the bill should visit her son's grave in Arlington National Cemetery, just outside the US capital.\nInvestigators say Mr Sicknick was targeted by a rioter with some kind of chemical spray, though a post-mortem examination found he died from natural causes.\nMore than 440 suspected participants in the attack have been arrested and officials say they expect to charge another 100. \nThe investigation is one of the most extensive ever undertaken by the Department of Justice, and the number of cases has overwhelmed the Washington DC court system.\nSeveral of those arrested were police officers, and dozens were military veterans. The defendants face charges including trespassing in a federal building, violent entry and disorderly conduct.\nThe reasons behind the filibuster were two-fold. Donald Trump himself has been actively working against the commission, which could have probed his actions - and inaction - before and during the assault. It's very clear the ex-president still has considerable sway within the party.\nEven Republicans who care little for Mr Trump, however, were concerned that the investigation would reflect poorly on the Republican party as a whole - and possibly stretch into 2022, damaging their hopes in the mid-term congressional elections.\nDemocrats could unilaterally form a new \"select\" congressional committee to investigate, but Republicans will be quick to dismiss it as a political show.\nThe prospects for a widely accepted \"official\" account of that horrific day now seem dim, at best.\nFriday saw the first successful use during the Biden presidency of a Senate filibuster - a tradition that requires 60 of the 100 senators to vote in favour of a bill.\nThe upper chamber is now evenly split 50-50 between the two parties, so Democrats need 10 Republicans to side with them on certain legislation.\nThe Republican use of a filibuster will fuel calls by Democratic supporters to lower the threshold for passing bills to 51 votes.\nAll eyes are on two moderate Democratic senators who have so far resisted pressure to support such an extreme step: Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\nOn Thursday, Mr Manchin said there was \"no excuse\" to oppose the commission, but he still did not support abolishing the filibuster.\n\"I'm not ready to destroy our government,\" he said.\nMs Sinema said the bipartisan commission would be a \"critical step\" towards investigating the \"horrific\" Capitol riot.\nThe Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, argued that ongoing bipartisan hearings into the Capitol riot by the Senate rules and homeland security committees were sufficient.\nMr McConnell said on Thursday that a commission would be \"extraneous\".\nMost other Republicans also stuck by their opposition to the commission. Texas Senator John Cornyn - who once supported the idea - said he believed Democrats would use the body as a political cudgel.\nCentrist Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, had proposed compromises to win over support from members of her party.\nHer amendment to the bill would have required the Democratic chair and Republican vice-chair of the commission to \"jointly appoint\" staff, and ensure its work did not spill over into next year's campaigning for US mid-term elections.\nFormer House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has kept a low profile since stepping down in 2018, is reportedly entering the fray with an implicit attack on Mr Trump.\nIn a speech on Thursday to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, Mr Ryan was reportedly to exhort fellow Republicans to move on from the \"populist appeal of one personality\", otherwise \"we're not going anywhere\".\nLast week, 35 Republicans in the House crossed party lines to vote to back the establishment of a commission. \nThat vote was seen as a test of loyalty to Mr Trump, who was acquitted by the Senate of inciting insurrection on 6 January over his unproven claims that last year's election was stolen from him. \nHe continues to propagate the conspiracy theory on his personal blog."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Birmingham,NHS,Cancer",
      "text": "Covid has left a toxic legacy for the NHS, with hospitals facing a huge backlog, putting lives at risk, patient groups and staff are warning.\nAnd in-depth analysis by BBC News has found:\nIt comes as NHS England has launched a \u00a3160m initiative to tackle the growing waiting lists.\nA network of \"accelerator\" areas is being established to pilot new initiatives, including extra clinics at weekends, virtual assessments at home and new clinics that can complete high numbers of cataract operations\nNHS England chief operating officer Amanda Pritchard says: \"With Covid cases in hospitals now significantly reducing, our focus is on rapidly recovering routine services.\"\nElaine Walsh was diagnosed with womb cancer in January. \nThe 61-year-old, from Essex, was immediately classed as an urgent case - and should have been operated on within weeks. \nBut her operation was cancelled - because of the pandemic and the backlog it had caused. \nIt was \"the most horrendous day\", she says. \"Every day that I'm not on a surgical operating table, it is more of a risk.\" \nElaine is now due to have surgery on Friday - but the wait has taken its toll. \nShe has been seeing a psychologist to help her emotionally, while physically she has started to deteriorate. \n\"I have got weaker,\" she says. \"I'm in more pain. Things I could do then, I can't now.\"\nElaine's story is not unique. Analysis by BBC News shows the numbers starting treatment within the target time have fallen during the pandemic. \nAnd some trusts are struggling to start treatment for even half of patients in the recommended timeframe - two months following an urgent referral from their GP.\nFor University Hospitals Birmingham, that proportion is well under a half.\nIt has seen performance deteriorate despite sending patients to be treated in local private hospitals.\nThe trust has treated more Covid patients than any other in the country - more than 14,000 have been admitted since the start of the pandemic, leading to the redeployment of 1,500 staff locally.\nLike others, it says the disruption has been unavoidable - and it is now \"working hard\" to have patients diagnosed and treated.\nBut it has found not all the delays are caused by the disruption to services.\nAbout one in every four of the patients waiting the longest has postponed treatment themselves - and nurses at the trust have been phoning and pleading with them to have treatment.\nThis reluctance to come forward coupled with problems accessing GP and screening services at points in the pandemic is the reason why the number of patients coming forward for checks and being diagnosed has dropped - although there are now signs the numbers are rising.\nNonetheless, analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support suggests across the UK there are 45,000 \"missing\" cancer patients. \nAnd the charity fears this will lead to more later-stage diagnoses, which reduce the chances of survival.\n\"The knock-on impact of the pandemic on cancer care cannot be overstated,\" Steven McIntosh says. \"We're likely to be dealing with Covid's long shadow for many years to come.\"\nAttempts are being made to get people to come forward. An NHS advertising campaign, Help Us, Help You, is urging people with cancer symptoms to come forward.\nBut cancer doctor and Catch Up With Cancer Campaign founder Prof Pat Price says a \"monumental political effort\" is needed, with significant investment in equipment and the workforce to \"super-boost\" services. \n\"Services have suffered years of underinvestment - so we were already at a disadvantage,\" she adds.\nBut this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the legacy of Covid. \nCancer was actually one of the areas of the health service prioritised from the very start to try to keep disruption to a minimum.\nAn analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Imperial College London has been looking at how all hospital services have been affected. It has focussed on England - although problems have been reported across the UK nations.\nIts report breaks the impact of the pandemic down by emergency admissions, planned care and outpatient work. \nCancer falls in all three categories and the data shows it has actually seen one of the smallest drops in activity with services such as knee and hip replacements affected much more.\nOverall planned care fell by a third in 2020 - with the north of England and Midlands hardest hit.\nOutpatient appointments fell by a fifth - with the amount of physiotherapy provided almost halving - as did non-Covid emergency admissions \nThe report says this will have a considerable impact on the quality of life and health of many people.\nThe consequence of this has been longer waiting times for many non-emergency treatments.\nIn England, nearly 5 million people are now on a hospital waiting list - 9% of the population - the highest number since records began, in 2007. \nA similar proportion are waiting in Scotland, while in Wales it is 17% and Northern Ireland 23%.\nMost worrying, the numbers waiting over a year have rocketed - in England, from 1,600 before the pandemic to 436,000 at the end of March 2021.\nNearly a third of hospitals now have more than one in every 10 of their patients in this position. A handful have one in every five.\nOne of those is Hull University Teaching Hospitals, which before the pandemic had none, chief operating officer Ellen Ryabov says.\nIt is now running extra weekend clinics, as well as using the private sector, she says, adding: \"Our aim is to get down to 14.5% of patients waiting over 52 weeks by the end of September and then look to clear that entirely.\" \nBut in the meantime, Tracey Loftis, of the charity Versus Arthritis says, the wait for \"life-transforming\" surgery can be devastating.\nBrenda Pugh has been waiting for a double hip replacement since June, after developing severe osteoarthritis at the end of 2019.\nThe 61-year-old, from Hampshire, used to enjoy swimming, running and walking her dog but became immobile and housebound within six months.\n\"The hip pain is unbearable,\" she says. \"I can just about walk from the sofa to the bathroom, in my house.\n\"Otherwise, I can't move. It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with.\"\nBut the long waits did not come out of the blue. The NHS was routinely missing its targets before March 2020.\n\"The problems predate the pandemic,\" Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, says.  \"We already had too few beds and not enough staff.\"\nAnd without investment on the scale last seen in the 2000s, when the Tony Blair government increased the budget by 7% in real terms, hospitals will struggle to get \"back on track\".\nThe concern now is the situation could become even worse before improving. Six million fewer patients were referred on to hospital treatment in 2020 than in 2019, an analysis by the Health Foundation has found, a drop of nearly a third.\nAs with cancer, people seem to have been deterred from seeking help either because they were worried about catching Covid or did not want to burden the NHS. \nAnd if just a fraction of these return, it could create serious problems for the recovery of services, particularly given what staff have gone through in the pandemic.\nSurveys by both the Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association in recent weeks have suggested high levels of exhaustion, fatigue and low morale, with many reporting they feel under pressure to work extra hours without pay, which, the unions warn, is unsustainable.\nDr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, a think tank that monitors NHS performance, has sympathy for staff. \nShe says workforce shortages are now at \"critical\" levels and if this is not solved the backlog will not be addressed any time soon.\n\"The impact of the pandemic on the NHS has been immense.\"\nAdditional reporting by Kristina Gray\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "The head of online pre-paid card firm Pockit has vowed to take action after admitting more than a thousand of its customers have had accounts frozen.\nVirraj Jatania told Radio 4's Money Box programme that new processes would be introduced to address the failings.\nPockit provides accounts to more than half a million customers that it says are typically \"financially underserved, low income, often unbanked consumers\". \nThe UK financial regulator has said it is aware of issues with the company.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) told Money Box it was engaging with Pockit to ensure the problems were being addressed as quickly as possible. \nPockit allows customers to load money on to a card and then, for a price, it offers many services that a bank would - such as faster payments and direct debits.\nHowever, one Money Box listener, Sian, told the programme that her Pockit account had been locked on 9 March.\nThe company asked her to send identification documents so they could verify her account. She sent them on the same day but the account - containing \u00a31,000 - is still locked. Sian says she desperately needs access to the money to pay for her car's service and MOT. \nAnother listener, Rob, told the programme he'd had an account with Pockit for years but it was blocked \"out of the blue\" last month. Like Sian he was asked to provide identification documents, which he did, but the account - containing \u00a31,700 - remains locked. Rob says he now has debt collectors chasing him for money. \nBoth Sian and Rob told Money Box they had been frustrated with the poor customer service they had experienced, saying it was impossible to speak to someone on the phone and that emails would often go unanswered.\nThe Financial Ombudsman received 97 complaints about Pockit between January and April 2021, compared with fewer than 10 in the same period the year before. \nMr Jatania told Money Box that he could not comment on specific cases but that he \"recognised that temporary blocks on accounts could be very distressing\" and he took it very seriously.  \nHe added that as Pockit operated in a regulated environment there were laws the company had to follow, and that accounts were only frozen when suspicious activity was detected and most cases were resolved quickly.\nRegarding the customer service concerns, he said the firm would employ more staff and that a \"live chat\" system would help to deal with customers' problems more quickly and effectively.\nHe added that additional processes would be introduced so that if a case was not resolved within a certain timeframe, accounts would be closed down and funds returned to source.   \nLast week, the FCA wrote to Pockit and other e-money firms to remind them that they need to adequately disclose the differences in protections between e-money accounts and bank accounts.\nThe Financial Services Compensation Scheme protects customers when financial firms fail. It can pay compensation of up to \u00a385,000 for deposits, but Pockit and other e-money firms are not covered by the scheme. \nYou can hear more on this story from BBC Radio 4's Money Box by listening again here shortly after broadcast at 12pm, Saturday 22 May.\nFollow Money Box and Ben on Twitter."

      "text": "Russia has denied entry to two European airlines because they planned to avoid flying over Belarus to get to Moscow.\nAir France and Austrian Airlines have both had to cancel services after their flight plans were rejected by Russia.\nEU leaders asked European carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace this week after a Ryanair plane was forced to divert and land in Minsk on Sunday.\nBelarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend were then arrested.\nThe UN's civil aviation agency has said it will launch a \"fact-finding\" investigation into Belarus's actions, and whether there had been any breach of international aviation law.\nRussia is a strong ally of Belarus and President Vladimir Putin is set to discuss the unfolding crisis with Belarus's leader of 26 years, Alexander Lukashenko, in the Russian resort of Sochi on Friday.\nThe decision to refuse entry to specific flights is the first move from the Kremlin over the diplomatic conflict. Other flights involving German carrier Lufthansa and Polish airline Lot have arrived as scheduled. Russia is yet to comment on the action it is taking.\nThe European Union and UK have banned Belarusian airlines from flying over their territories, and have said more sanctions are to come, including against Mr Lukashenko and other senior officials. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says there are plans \"on the table\" to target key economic sectors.\nThe European airspace ban has forced Belarusian carrier Belavia to cancel 12 of its routes until 30 October, according to Reuters. The routes affected are Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hanover, Kaliningrad, Milan, Munich, Rome, Vienna and Warsaw.\nBelarus will lose out on millions of dollars a year in over-flight fees as a result of European airlines avoiding Belarusian airspace.\nRussia's move in support of Mr Lukashenko has led to the cancellation of at least four Air France flights between Paris and Moscow. Some passengers were rebooked on Russian carrier Aeroflot.\nTwo Austrian Airlines flights have been grounded - one passenger plane travelling from Vienna to Moscow, and a cargo plane travelling from Nanjing in China to Vienna.\nAustria's foreign ministry said Russia's actions were \"absolutely incomprehensible\". The French ministry of transport told AFP news agency that \"the principle of reciprocity... must be respected\".\nTracking website Flightradar24 showed little activity in the skies over Belarus on Thursday, except for Belarusian and Russian airlines.\nOn Wednesday, the website showed a Minsk to Barcelona flight, operated by the Belarusian airline Belavia, in a long holding pattern at the border with Poland, which has banned Belarusian flights from its airspace. The plane eventually returned to Minsk. The BBC has contacted Belavia for clarification on why it turned back.\nOn Sunday, Ryanair Flight 4978 was travelling from Athens to Vilnius in Lithuania, when it was forcibly diverted to Minsk. A fighter jet was scrambled to tail the plane and ensure it changed course.\nAboard was Mr Protasevich, 26, who lives in exile in Lithuania, and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, an international law student. They were arrested as passengers disembarked.\nMr Protasevich was put on the Belarus terrorist list last year, and faces serious charges.\nOn Thursday, Mr Protasevich was able to see his lawyer for the first time.\n\"All is well, he is vigorous, positive and cheerful, there is nothing to worry about,\" Inesa Alenskaya was quoted as saying by the Belorusskiye Novosti website, adding she could not give any more information.\nRussia's foreign ministry says Ms Sapega is accused of breaking Belarusian law in August and September of 2020. But it is unclear what these crimes are.\nVideos were released showing the pair confessing to crimes, but it is likely they were speaking under duress.\nThe forced landing of the plane and their arrest caused international outrage.\n\"It was a serious attack on the rules governing civil aviation... This action also represents a serious attack on media freedom,\" a statement by the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US said.\nWhere is Belarus? It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.\nWhy does it matter? Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed \"Europe's last dictator\".\nWhat's going on there? There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile."

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe Royal College of Surgeons is calling for the creation of a network of 40 specialist hubs in hospitals to help clear a \"colossal backlog\" of five million non-urgent operations that built up in England during the pandemic. The government says it's providing \u00a31bn to tackle backlogs, including \u00a3160m to help hospitals \"find innovative ways to carry out even more operations\".\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon will announce later whether Glasgow will remain subject to Scotland's level three restrictions, having said there are \"reasons to be optimistic\", as business owners demand clarity on reopening. While the rest of the country has seen restrictions ease, Glasgow residents have endured strict curbs for 270 days. Here's how it affected them.\nLive music events in Wales can resume immediately, says the Welsh government, although nightclubs face a continued wait to reopen. Gig venues will need risk assessments in line with hospitality and performing guidance, , use one-way systems and follow ventilation guidelines. No more than six people from six households will be able to attend together in a single group.\nHigh Street banks have told MPs they are opening accounts for small businesses as normal after pressures amid the pandemic caused problems. In October, start-ups told BBC News how they were being \"stifled\" at birth owing to difficulties in opening a business bank account.\nWhen the pandemic put his business at risk, a British hotel owner in the Canary Islands accepted Spanish government funding to take in migrants and asylum seekers from Africa. Three months after the paid scheme ended, Calvin Lucock tells us why he's continuing to house dozens of young migrants.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nWorried about the blood clots that have been reported as a rare side effect of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Johnson and Johnson coronavirus vaccines?

It was a deeply humiliating time,\" she says.\nLawyers examining the birth mothers' cases have focused on the period between 1945 and 1975 - before a change in adoption law - when around 500,000 babies were adopted in Britain, mostly from mothers who were under 24 and unmarried.\nTheir research suggests about half of those women faced sustained pressure to give up their babies from professionals, including doctors, midwives, workers in mother and baby homes and adoption staff in religious and council-run homes.\n\u202fThe 1975\u202fand 1989 Children Acts\u202fand the 1976 Adoption Act are among the laws that have made it easier for\u202fadopted children\u202fand their birth mothers to regain contact with each other.\nIn a statement earlier this week, children and families minister Vicky Ford said: \"I want to express my deepest sympathy to all those affected by historic forced adoption. \n\"We cannot undo the past, but we can be reassured that our legislation and practices have been significantly strengthened since then.\"\u202f"

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson",
      "text": "Boris Johnson acted \"unwisely\" by not being more \"rigorous\" in finding out who had funded refurbishment work on the Downing Street flat, a report says.\nLord Geidt, the PM's adviser on standards, said a Tory donor had paid an invoice for some of the costs.\nBut he cleared Mr Johnson - who was seemingly unaware of the arrangement - of breaking ministerial conduct rules.\nThe works on the flat, overseen by the PM's fianc\u00e9e Carrie Symonds, are thought to have cost around \u00a390,000. \nThe report did not say how much former Conservative vice-chairman Lord Brownlow had put up to fund the refurbishment, but a figure of \u00a358,000 has been widely reported.\nDowning Street confirmed the prime minister had funded the \"wider refurbishment\", suggesting Lord Brownlow had been repaid.\nBut Labour said it was \"staggering\" that Mr Johnson could \"rack up\" a bill \"yet have no knowledge of how it was eventually paid\".\nSeparately, the Electoral Commission is carrying out an investigation into whether the Conservative Party broke the law on political donations regarding the funding of the flat.\nAnd Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been found guilty of a \"minor breach\" of the ministerial code, which sets the rules for behaviour in public office, over shares in an NHS supplier.\nPrime ministers receive an annual public grant of \u00a330,000 to spend on their Downing Street living quarters, which are publicly-owned.\nMr Johnson has faced repeated questions over how refurbishments to the flat above 11 Downing Street, where he lives with Ms Symonds, were financed. \nThe renovation work began in spring last year when Mr Johnson was in hospital with Covid.\nThe prime minister has previously said he paid the difference between the taxpayer-funded contribution and the full costs.\nBut he did not specify whether this involved paying the bills up-front or repaying money loaned to him or the government for the project.\nIn his report, Lord Geidt found \"no evidence\" that Lord Brownlow had told Mr Johnson \"he had personally settled\" costs.\nAnd, when Lord Brownlow informed government officials about the money, they had not \"acted on this information to the extent of informing the prime minister\", it said.\nBut Lord Geidt - who was appointed by Mr Johnson last month as standards adviser following the resignation of Sir Alex Allen - did criticise the prime minister's conduct.\nHe had, said the peer, \"unwisely... allowed the refurbishment of the apartment... to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded\".\nLord Geidt also said that \"in the middle of a pandemic\", Mr Johnson \"simply accepted\" that a trust he was hoping to set up to handle the Downing Street work \"would be capable of satisfactorily resolving the situation without further interrogation\".\nAlthough this report clears Boris Johnson of breaking the ministerial code, parts of it will be awkward reading in Downing Street.\nLord Geidt questions why Boris Johnson didn't pay more attention to who was paying for the work in his flat. Why wasn't the prime minister more curious, he wonders? \nIt is also critical of officials - saying the prime minister was \"ill-served\" by those around him when it came to this project. \nBut, crucially, there is no sense from this report that the arrangement led to a conflict of interest. \nDowning Street is also keen to point out the costs - beyond an annual allowance - have not been met by the taxpayer. \nBut Lord Geidt concluded that \"no conflict (or reasonably perceived conflict) arises\" from the involvement of Lord Brownlow or the Conservative Party in the refurbishment.\nHe said of Lord Brownlow that \"there is no evidence that he acted with anything other than altruistic and philanthropic motives\".\nSpeaking in Swindon, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said no public money was used in an improper way.\nHe said because the arrangement involved private money, the \"facts speak for themselves in favour of\" the prime minister.\nAnd responding to the report, Downing Street said it showed the prime minister had \"acted in accordance with the ministerial code at all times\".\nA spokesperson added: \"Cabinet Office officials were engaged and informed throughout and official advice was followed.\n\"Other than works funded through the annual allowance, the costs of the wider refurbishment of the flat are not being financed by taxpayers and have been settled by the prime minister personally.\"\nIf a politician or party accepts money from a donor - either as a gift or as a loan - they are expected to make that information public.\nThe Electoral Commission is investigating whether this rule was followed by the Conservative Party in relation to the Downing Street refurbishment.\nIf the commission finds it was not, it has the power to issue a fine of up to \u00a320,000.\nMeanwhile, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, is also looking into the refurbishment, including whether donations were properly declared."

      "text": "As schools break up for half term after weeks of low Covid rates, measures such as face coverings and class bubbles are still in place.\nBut restrictions should not last \"a day longer than is necessary\", according to Children's Commissioner Sally Holland.\nDeputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Chris Jones said it could \"make sense\" to relax controls during the summer months.\nBut teaching unions said they remained concerned about easing measures.\nProf Holland said it had been a \"remarkable, extraordinary and hugely challenging\" year-and-a-half for schools, keeping children safe and responding to changing circumstances.\nShe said new guidance allowing school trips, as well as music teachers increasingly being able to visit schools, were examples of a \"semblance of normality\" returning.\nBut on the most significant measures, such as maintaining contact groups and face coverings, she urged the Welsh government to review guidance all the time.\n\"You can't just let guidance sit for weeks and weeks, we can't have restrictions on children for a day longer than is necessary,\" she said.\nWhile the government deemed the measures to be necessary due to its public health and scientific advice, Prof Holland said pupils and teachers accepted it on the whole, but she urged the government to listen to all the arguments.\n\"Not only to evidence about epidemiology, but also the social impact it's having on children and young people so that's physical discomfort, it's how it impacts on their relationships with their peers, but also how it impacts on teaching and learning,\" she added.\nThe latest Public Health Wales figures recorded 55 Covid cases in schools over the past week, a total of 162 over the most recent 21 days.\nThe cases were reported by 11 of Wales' 22 local authorities.\nTwo thirds of cases were in Bridgend and Monmouthshire, linked to school cases in Porthcawl and Abergavenny.\nAlthough almost 81% of schools have had a Covid case since September, 208 schools have had only one case.\nCurrent guidance says face coverings should be worn by pupils and staff in secondary schools and colleges, including in classrooms, and by primary school staff where social distancing is not possible.\nSchools have formed contact groups of pupils to limit mixing.\nTwice weekly lateral flow tests are available for children over 11 years old and school staff.\nDr Jones said there were \"very few cases being reported in schools\", providing \"very reassuring evidence\" that schools were not \"a higher risk environment\".\nIan Gerrard, head teacher at Ysgol Aberconwy, in Conwy, said pupils had been \"really resilient\".\nHe said he was keen that the restrictions were relaxed \"in a safe way\", as mask-wearing \"does have an impact on learning in classrooms... but I think we've got to be driven by the science\".\nPupil Hannah Partington, 18, said: \"I think I'd feel comfortable to still wear them. It makes you feel a bit safer.\"\nHer classmate Marnie Cockrill, 18, said she would like restrictions to be \"a bit more relaxed\", but agreed she would also like to keep wearing a face mask at school.\n\"It's worth it for the protection,\" she said.\nWales' Education Minister Jeremy Miles has said school restrictions will be kept under review.\nDr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales (PHW), said the country's technical advisory group was considering dropping the rules.\n\"Personally, I would favour stepping back from face coverings during the summer months,\" Dr Jones said.\n\"We may need to reintroduce them again when the winter comes but we can't really decide that without gaining people's confidence - everybody has to feel happy that that approach makes sense.\"\nHe added information on face coverings was due \"shortly\" from the Technical Advisory Cell, a group of experts providing advice to the government.\n\"We know that there are some harms associated with face coverings and maybe they will get worse during the hot weather over the summer - difficulty with skin and irritation and the heat,\" he said.\n\"So I think there is an argument to say the benefit related to the risk is less for face coverings now, but we need to see that evidence and we need to discuss that with teaching unions and also children's representatives because we need to make sure that if there is a change in a policy everyone still has confidence in the protective measures that we have.\"\nDavid Evans, NEU Cymru secretary, said it was \"too early\" to lift Covid restrictions because of the current concerns over the Indian variant.\nHe said the younger population had not been vaccinated and that they were \"more mobile and were meeting more people\".\n\"There are a few weeks left until the end of the term, we should use this time to investigate more fully the Indian variant,\" Mr Evans added.\nHe said they still wanted to see pupils wear face masks in classrooms until the end of term and then assess the situation before they start back in school in September.\nDr Chris Jones added that Wales was \"ready to go\" if the UK-wide Joint Council on Vaccination and Immunisation gave the go-ahead for 16 and 17-year-olds to be vaccinated.\n\"I think it's fair to say if the JCVI recommended its use in 16 and 17-year-olds we would welcome that in Wales and we would be ready to start that age group sooner rather than later,\" he said.\n\"I think from our point of view, because we're already getting through large numbers of the 18 to 29-year-olds we would welcome advice to that effect sooner rather than later from the JCVI.\n\"They are an independent body of experts, we have to await their deliberations but there's no doubt that we would soon be ready to go if that was advised.\"\nHe said the evidence for vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds was still being assessed by medicines regulators."

      "tags": "UK economy,Economic effects of Brexit,European Union,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "British exports worth billions of pounds have faced tariffs on trade with the EU since Brexit, according to an analysis of official EU statistics. \nDespite the tariff-free deal agreed with the EU, a study by the University of Sussex found up to \u00a33.5bn of British exports had taxes applied.\nThat accounts for about 10% of British goods exports to the EU.\nSome firms paid due to the complexity of claiming zero tariffs, or said they planned to reclaim the fees later.\nFor exporters, maintaining zero tariffs under the post-Brexit deal is not automatic: it needs to be claimed on customs declarations that from January have had to accompany every export to the European Union. \nAn analysis for the BBC, by the University of Sussex's Trade Policy Observatory, used European customs data from these declarations.\nThe figures indicated that between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a33.5bn of British exports faced a tariff in the first three months of 2021. \nThe European Commission confirmed that according to data collected by its customs authorities, \u20ac2.5bn of eligible UK exports did not use the zero-tariff agreement. \n\"Tariff-free trade is only tariff-free if firms not only meet the rules of origin criteria, but also can deal with the necessary bureaucracy and paperwork,\" said Prof Michael Gasiorek, trade expert at the University of Sussex.\n\"What this analysis shows is that in the first quarter, around 27% of trade that could have entered tariff-free did not do so.\n\"In some sectors and for some firms, this will no doubt improve, but it reflects the reality that leaving the EU has imposed real costs on firms, with long-term implications for trade and production.\"\nThe data covers all British exports to the EU in January and February, and some reporting nations in March.\nIndividual businesses and groups told the BBC of instances where millions of pounds in tariffs had been paid. \nMost put this down to complex arrangements for claiming zero tariffs, difficulties over the re-export to the EU of goods processed in Britain, and an expectation that some of these fees could eventually be recovered. Some of the world's biggest multinationals have paid seven-figure tariff bills. \nA classic car repairer, The Classic Car Mechanic, showed tariff bills of hundreds of pounds for car parts for rare vehicles sent to Hungary, which could not be valued, and so were hit with a tariff by French customs.\n\"We've had to pay a tariff, even though we've got a zero tariff,\" said the boss of the business, Simon Spurrell.\n\"It's the same with all the other shipments, all UK origin parts, but they dispute it and they hold it up. \n\"We feel that we have no fight left in us, we have to then, as a small organisation just say, well, we'll cut our losses, and just pay the duty.\"\nThe Trade Policy Observatory has tried to quantify the effect of extra trade barriers with the EU on different sectors. \nAlthough exports began to recover from a massive drop in January, over the quarter, the Observatory calculated that, of the worst affected sectors, textiles saw exports fall 63%, food suffered a 36% drop, and the automotive industry saw exports down 20%.\nOther advanced manufacturing industries have not been affected, according to the analysis, which seeks to isolate the impact of post-Brexit barriers from the impact of the pandemic.\nA government spokesperson said: \"The vast majority of traders have adjusted well to our new trading relationship with the EU.\n\"HMRC continues to work closely with exporters to ensure they correctly apply rules of origin requirements and are aware of their right to refunds.\n\"The unprecedented zero-tariff zero-quota deal we secured with the EU allows businesses to trade smoothly, while we can now regulate in a way that suits the UK economy and our businesses - doing things in a more innovative and effective way, without being bound by EU rules.\"\nThe analysis also showed that in the early months of the deal, there were some marked differences between EU nations in the extent of use of the free-trade deal for imports of British goods. \nData for what is known as \"preference utilisation\" of British exports to Germany shows rates well below half in January and February at 42% and 44% respectively. The trade deal has been used more, according to the data, for exports to France, reaching 77% in March.\nPreference utilisation rates (PURs) measure the extent to which tariff preferences provided by a particular trade agreement are being used by imports and exports of either side.\nEuropean Commission sources stressed that overall use of the deal was in line with the first months of other free-trade deals and that it would take some time to assess the impact.\nUK government ministers told Parliament last month that they would be releasing their equivalent data for EU exports into Great Britain shortly."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Newcastle upon Tyne",
      "text": "A coroner will consider if the cause of BBC presenter Lisa Shaw's death might have been complicated by her having had the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.\nHer family said the 44-year-old was treated for blood clots days after her first jab. She died on Friday.\nAn interim fact-of-death certificate lists the vaccine as one of the possible factors being considered.\nThe Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said vaccine benefits exceed risks for most people.\nThe BBC has seen the interim fact-of-death certificate issued by Newcastle's senior coroner Karen Dilks.\nIt confirms an investigation into Ms Shaw's death will be held and lists a \"complication of AstraZeneca Covid-19 virus vaccination\" as a consideration. \nThe document does not determine a cause of death - that will not be issued until the investigation has been completed.\nThe BBC Radio Newcastle presenter was not known to have any underlying health problems.\nIn a statement, Ms Shaw's family said: \"Lisa developed severe headaches a week after receiving her AstraZeneca vaccine and fell seriously ill a few days later. \n\"She was treated by the RVI's [Royal Victoria Infirmary] intensive care team for blood clots and bleeding in her head.\n\"Tragically she passed away, surrounded by her family, on Friday afternoon. We are devastated and there is a Lisa-shaped hole in our lives that can never be filled. We will love and miss her always. \n\"It's been a huge comfort to see how loved she was by everyone whose lives she touched, and we ask for privacy at this time to allow us to grieve as a family.\"\nAn MHRA spokesperson said: \"We are saddened to hear about the death of Lisa Shaw and our thoughts are with her family.\n\"As with any serious suspected adverse reaction, reports with a fatal outcome are fully evaluated by the MHRA, including an assessment of post-mortem details if available.\n\"Our detailed and rigorous review into reports of blood clots occurring together with thrombocytopenia is ongoing.\"\nIt said the number of cases remained \"extremely low\".\nA distinctive type of blood clot is a known side effect of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThey are called cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVSTs) and what makes them unusual is people often have low levels of platelets (the raw materials of clot) in their blood. \nThey are considered extremely rare - there have been 332 reported cases and 58 reported deaths - after nearly 35 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK. \nBut all of medicine is a balance of risk and benefit; and the number of blood clots has already led to a shift in the vaccination campaign. \nIdeally, adults under the age of 40 should be given an alternative vaccine, such as those developed by Pfizer or Moderna.\nMs Shaw joined BBC Radio Newcastle in 2016 as a daytime presenter. Her voice was well-known in the north-east of England where she had also had a successful career in commercial radio.\nFollowing the announcement of her death, there were tributes from listeners and colleagues.\nThe BBC described her as a \"brilliant presenter\" who was \"loved by our audiences\".\nIt said: \"We've lost someone special who meant a great deal to a great many people.\"\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Viktor Orban,Hungary",
      "text": "Hungary's Viktor Orban has ended a controversial visit to Boris Johnson by acknowledging he is anti-immigration and standing by an earlier condemnation of Muslim migrants as \"invaders\".\nHe said they had destroyed the border and marched through the country.\nDowning Street said the UK prime minister had raised \"significant concerns\" about media freedom and human rights.\nThe visit prompted broad criticism from politicians and anti-racism groups.\nMr Johnson's opponents condemned the talks even before they took place, citing Mr Orban's treatment of press freedom and democratic values as well as his \"Islamophobic\" views on Muslim migrants.\nBut No 10 said Mr Johnson had brought up those issues, including LGBT rights and gender equality. Russia, Belarus and China were also discussed, it said, adding that Mr Orban had been urged to \"promote democracy and stability\".\n\"I said it's a Western democracy, so it's the same system as here,\" The Hungarian leader told reporters.\nThe right-wing Hungarian leader has courted China and is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, choosing to allow Covid-19 vaccinations with Russia's Sputnik V before it is given approval by the EU's medicines agency.\nLast year he pushed the EU to lift sanctions on Belarus, although he backed this week's response by EU leaders to the Belarus leader's decision to force a Ryanair plane to divert and land so that a dissident journalist and his girlfriend could be arrested.\nHe has praised the UK's decision to leave the EU, and pulled his ruling Fidesz party out of the the EU's main centre-right grouping this year, after it was suspended over its human rights record.\nViktor Orban's visit to Downing Street has prompted much scratching of heads. \nWhy on Earth would Boris Johnson decide that he should be the second EU leader since Brexit to get a warm welcome at Downing Street? \nThere are several reasons. \nThe first, I am told, is that the Hungarian leader asked for the visit. It's been in the diary for a couple of months. And as one No 10 source said, you have to have a pretty good reason to say no to an EU head of government if they ask to see you. \nSecond, Mr Orban is also taking over the presidency of a group of central European countries known as the Visegrad 4.\nAnd third, so the argument goes, the UK can't just talk to countries it agrees with. \nBut the visit may be seen by some in Europe as provocative, and it may sit uneasily with the government's agenda for its big G7 summit next month. Britain wants the G7 and its allies to do more to defend Western liberal democracy and its values. \nMr Orban is seen by some as the antithesis of that.\nHungary is currently ranked 92nd out of 180 countries on the Reporters without Borders World Press Freedom Index. \nPro-Orban supporters have taken control of Hungarian media in recent years and last year journalists walked out of the biggest remaining independent website, Index, accusing the government of trying to tame or destroy it.\nThe Orban government has also transferred a number of state universities to private control, while the Central European University (CEU), founded by liberal Hungarian-born philanthropist George Soros, has moved from Budapest to Vienna citing a \"serious violation of academic freedom\".\nA poster campaign against Mr Soros was condemned for whipping up anti-Semitism. But Mr Orban on Friday denied allegations of anti-Semitism as ridiculous. \"George Soros is a talented Hungarian businessman... he is very much in favour of migration, financing and helping the NGOs who are doing that. We don't like it but it has nothing to do with ethnic identity,\" he said.\nUK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng argued that the UK had to speak to all sorts of world leaders, even those whose values it might not share. \"I think Viktor Orban's views on migrants are things that I would not endorse in any way,\" he told Sky News.\nBut Labour's foreign affairs spokeswoman Lisa Nandy was damning of the decision to invite him. \"Turns out when you have no moral anchor, you end up adrift,\" she said, after Downing Street had condemned Mr Orban's comments on migrants as \"divisive and wrong\".\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey wrote to Mr Johnson ahead of the meeting with a list of challenges he wanted put to the Hungarian leader. \"Orban's rule has been marked by a sustained assault on Hungarian democracy, on press freedom and on human rights,\" he said.\nProtesters from the Stand Up To Racism group stood outside Downing Street condemning the Hungarian leader."

      "text": "Two ancient sandstone carvings, believed to have been stolen from Thailand and smuggled to the US during the Vietnam War, are being repatriated. \nThe carvings were originally lintels - support beams - in temples dating back to the 10th Century and feature the Hindu deities Indra and Yama. \nFor decades they have been on display in San Francisco's Asian Art Museum. \nThey are due to go on display at the National Museum in the Thai capital, Bangkok. \nThe San Francisco museum said it always wanted to return the beams to Thailand, but disputed experts' allegations that they had been stolen.\n\"We are very pleased that these lintels are going back to their country of origin,\" said Jay Xu, the museum director, in a statement.\nThe repatriation followed a three-year investigation by the US Department of Homeland Security.\nAgents learned that the relics had been illegally imported, making them forfeitable under federal law, CBS reported. In February, the US reached a settlement with the city of San Francisco which agreed to forfeit the items.\nThai Fine Arts Department Director General Prateep Pengtako told AFP news agency that the lintels showed the influence of the ancient Khmer Kingdom, which was based in modern-day Cambodia.\n\"The lintels were assessed to be taken away some time between 1958 and 1969. In particular, 1965-66 saw a lot of Thai artefacts go missing,\" he said.\nIt is believed the artefacts came from Prasat Khao Lon historical sanctuary, in Sa Kaeo province, and Prasat Nong Hong, in Buri Ram province, the Bangkok Post reported.\nA handover ceremony took place in Los Angeles earlier this week between US authorities and the Royal Thai Consulate General.\n\"The return of these antiquities holds great importance in terms of history, archaeology, and culture to the Thai government and the Thai people,\" the Thai foreign ministry said at the time. \n\"It is believed that both of the sacred lintels were illegally exported from Thailand around the 1960s during the Vietnam War.\"\nIn recent years, other countries have also seen calls to repatriate stolen artefacts.\nIn 2014 Australia agreed to return to India two ancient Hindu statues allegedly stolen from temples while last year France agreed to return to Senegal and Benin items that were looted during colonial times."

We're right to be anxious because the spread across the border, the greater transmissibility - we won't be immune from it in Wales,\" he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nEarlier this week Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton confirmed there were about 57 cases of the Indian variant, known formally as B.1.617.2.\nThe Welsh government had previously said most cases were in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, although it had been identified in all health board areas except Powys.\nMr Firth, consultant in health protection for Public Health Wales, said the cases in Conwy county showed people \"should not become complacent, even as rates of the virus across Wales remain low\".  \nA mobile testing unit has been set up at Conwy Business Centre until 6 June, he said.\nMr Firth said the current evidence was that the Indian variant was at least as easy to catch as the dominant Kent variant, but it might be slightly more transmissible.\u00a0\nHe said both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines were effective against it after two doses."

      "text": "A remote and uninhabited Scottish island is looking for a resident caretaker.\nIsle Martin, near Ullapool, has no full-time residents but needs someone to keep the island in shape for visitors this summer.\nIf months of lockdown didn't faze you, living without a soul for miles around might be the job for you.\nThe island's community trust is inviting solo applicants and couples to register their interest.\nIsle Martin has just enough to keep visitors busy for a few hours. Two beaches, a micro museum (in a hut) and a hill which affords fantastic birdwatching. \nThe island hosts Scotland's first seaweed festival (6-12 September) and, if you are lucky, one of the volunteers may be running a pop-up cafe when you visit.\nThe island was gifted to the community by the RSPB and Isle Martin Trust became a charity in 1999.\nThe volunteer caretaker will be the first full-time resident to live on the island in 30 years and the move signals the start of plans for the trust to generate interest in the island.\nThe island also aims to be plastic-free and sustainable. \nTrust director Becky Thomson told the BBC what the position entails. She said: \"It is a bit of housekeeping. They need to keep the three houses on the island prepared for guests, clean the public toilets, welcome the visitors and make sure they are sticking to Covid safety measures.\"\nThe work will amount to about three hours per day. In return, the caretaker gets to live on a little piece of island heaven in provided accommodation, earn \u00a3150 expenses per week and enjoy all the island has to offer. \nIsle Martin is located at the mouth of Loch Broom, about three miles north-west of Ullapool in Wester Ross. The nearest mainland is less than a mile away at Ardmair.\nAt just 400 acres in size, it lies below the towering cliffs of Beinn Mhor Coigach and opposite the ancient Viking Fort of Dun Canna. \nBeyond the island are the Summer Isles - a group of islands which lie off Achiltibuie on the beautiful Coigach Peninsula.\nIt is only five minutes by boat from the mainland.\nOver the years it has held a monastery, a herring curing station and a flour mill. It is now recognised as a bird sanctuary.\nThe trust does warn that it is a post for someone who likes the outdoors and is not reliant on creature comforts.\nThere is no running hot water and only a small solar electrical charger that may power a phone or a laptop or even some lights.\nThe candidate will have to be resourceful and resilient and probably very practical. And they will have to be able to drive a power boat - their only way on and off the island.\nIn particular, the trust would welcome volunteers who bring specific skills they may wish to share for the benefit of the community during their time on the island.\nBecky Thomson said: \"If someone enjoyed the land, they could revive our vegetable garden if they wanted.\"\nShe also explained why she thinks people fall in love with the place.\n\"The sense of escape and peace and quiet,\" she said. \"It is so near the mainland but as soon as you land on the island it's lovely and peaceful. There are no cars, no roads. Just quiet. That's what people like - the feeling of restfulness.\"\nThe trust has extended the application deadline until 22:00 on 1 June and more details on how to apply are at the island trust's Facebook page."

      "text": "UK music festivals face \"another lost summer\" due to the government's refusal to back insurance for events at risk, a committee of MPs has found.\nA report into the sector's future said the government should provide a safety net for live events set to take place after 21 June.\nSeveral major festivals have been axed for the second year running.\nThe government said it was \"continuing to work flat out to support festivals and live events\".\nGlastonbury and BST Hyde Park will not take place this year, but others, like Latitude and Download, are currently scheduled to go ahead.\nThe latter was called off in March but has since been resurrected as a government test event, albeit with a significantly reduced capacity. \nOn 21 June, the government hopes to move to the final stage of its roadmap for lifting lockdown.\nRestrictions on large events such as music festivals will be lifted if lockdown relaxations go ahead as planned.\nBut according to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee, the government \"has ruled out offering any support before all restrictions on the roadmap are lifted\".\nThis, it said in a 42-page report published on Saturday, \"would be simply be too late for festivals this summer\" given the long lead-up times involved.\nJulian Knight MP, chair of the DCMS committee, claimed music festivals had been treated \"as the poor relation\" by the government.\n\"Events need to know now whether the government will back them, or they simply won't take place this year,\" he continued.\nMany of the festivals that have already cancelled cited the inability to obtain cancellation insurance as a factor in their decision.\nOthers have moved to seemingly safer dates later in the summer, with the August bank holiday weekend proving particularly popular.\nGlastonbury organisers have secured a licence for a one-off concert in September that up to 50,000 people could attend.\nThe regular festival normally takes place in June and attracts 200,000 people to Worthy Farm near Pilton, Somerset.\nA government spokesperson told BBC News: \"We are continuing to work flat out to support festivals and live events. \n\"Our Events Research Programme has explored how festivals can get back up and running safely and festival organisers have received more than \u00a334 million from our unprecedented Culture Recovery Fund, with more support on the way. \n\"We will continue to look at what assistance may be required as we move cautiously but irreversibly through the roadmap, including looking at the issue of indemnity cover.\"\nMeanwhile, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has launched the competition to find the place that will be the UK's City of Culture in 2025.\nThe winning city or town will be announced in spring 2022 and will inherit the mantle from Coventry, UK City of Culture 2021.\nThe title, first held by Derry-Londonderry in 2013, is awarded every four years. Up to six places will be longlisted before the winner is revealed.\nMr Dowden said the contest offered successful entrants \"a fantastic showcase\" that would \"drive economic regeneration and boost local pride\".\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "UK economy,Economic effects of Brexit,European Union,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "British exports worth billions of pounds have faced tariffs on trade with the EU since Brexit, according to an analysis of official EU statistics. \nDespite the tariff-free deal agreed with the EU, a study by the University of Sussex found up to \u00a33.5bn of British exports had taxes applied.\nThat accounts for about 10% of British goods exports to the EU.\nSome firms paid due to the complexity of claiming zero tariffs, or said they planned to reclaim the fees later.\nFor exporters, maintaining zero tariffs under the post-Brexit deal is not automatic: it needs to be claimed on customs declarations that from January have had to accompany every export to the European Union. \nAn analysis for the BBC, by the University of Sussex's Trade Policy Observatory, used European customs data from these declarations.\nThe figures indicated that between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a33.5bn of British exports faced a tariff in the first three months of 2021. \nThe European Commission confirmed that according to data collected by its customs authorities, \u20ac2.5bn of eligible UK exports did not use the zero-tariff agreement. \n\"Tariff-free trade is only tariff-free if firms not only meet the rules of origin criteria, but also can deal with the necessary bureaucracy and paperwork,\" said Prof Michael Gasiorek, trade expert at the University of Sussex.\n\"What this analysis shows is that in the first quarter, around 27% of trade that could have entered tariff-free did not do so.\n\"In some sectors and for some firms, this will no doubt improve, but it reflects the reality that leaving the EU has imposed real costs on firms, with long-term implications for trade and production.\"\nThe data covers all British exports to the EU in January and February, and some reporting nations in March.\nIndividual businesses and groups told the BBC of instances where millions of pounds in tariffs had been paid. \nMost put this down to complex arrangements for claiming zero tariffs, difficulties over the re-export to the EU of goods processed in Britain, and an expectation that some of these fees could eventually be recovered. Some of the world's biggest multinationals have paid seven-figure tariff bills. \nA classic car repairer, The Classic Car Mechanic, showed tariff bills of hundreds of pounds for car parts for rare vehicles sent to Hungary, which could not be valued, and so were hit with a tariff by French customs.\n\"We've had to pay a tariff, even though we've got a zero tariff,\" said the boss of the business, Simon Spurrell.\n\"It's the same with all the other shipments, all UK origin parts, but they dispute it and they hold it up. \n\"We feel that we have no fight left in us, we have to then, as a small organisation just say, well, we'll cut our losses, and just pay the duty.\"\nThe Trade Policy Observatory has tried to quantify the effect of extra trade barriers with the EU on different sectors. \nAlthough exports began to recover from a massive drop in January, over the quarter, the Observatory calculated that, of the worst affected sectors, textiles saw exports fall 63%, food suffered a 36% drop, and the automotive industry saw exports down 20%.\nOther advanced manufacturing industries have not been affected, according to the analysis, which seeks to isolate the impact of post-Brexit barriers from the impact of the pandemic.\nA government spokesperson said: \"The vast majority of traders have adjusted well to our new trading relationship with the EU.\n\"HMRC continues to work closely with exporters to ensure they correctly apply rules of origin requirements and are aware of their right to refunds.\n\"The unprecedented zero-tariff zero-quota deal we secured with the EU allows businesses to trade smoothly, while we can now regulate in a way that suits the UK economy and our businesses - doing things in a more innovative and effective way, without being bound by EU rules.\"\nThe analysis also showed that in the early months of the deal, there were some marked differences between EU nations in the extent of use of the free-trade deal for imports of British goods. \nData for what is known as \"preference utilisation\" of British exports to Germany shows rates well below half in January and February at 42% and 44% respectively. The trade deal has been used more, according to the data, for exports to France, reaching 77% in March.\nPreference utilisation rates (PURs) measure the extent to which tariff preferences provided by a particular trade agreement are being used by imports and exports of either side.\nEuropean Commission sources stressed that overall use of the deal was in line with the first months of other free-trade deals and that it would take some time to assess the impact.\nUK government ministers told Parliament last month that they would be releasing their equivalent data for EU exports into Great Britain shortly."

      "text": "High Street banks say they are back to opening accounts for small businesses as normal after pressures amid the pandemic caused problems.\nIn October, start-ups told BBC News how they were being \"stifled\" at birth owing to difficulties in opening a business bank account.\nThe Treasury Committee of MPs demanded answers from the banks, including why potential customers faced long delays.\nThe banks have now told the committee that the situation has improved.\nThe committee's chairman, Mel Stride, said it would \"keep a close eye\" on the issue.\nSome banks were closed to new applications from small firms during the height of the Covid crisis as they concentrated their stretched resources on existing customers.\nThis coincided with an increase in demand for business current accounts, to allow entrepreneurs to take advantage of bounce back loans - one of the government support measures introduced for businesses during the pandemic.\nSome start-ups said their applications had \"disappeared down a black hole\".\nThey included Sophia Murday, who had set up a greengrocer in a previously-empty shop in Glasgow just yards from her flat.\nShe had been a customer of one High Street bank for 20 years, but her application for a business current account was delayed, then rejected. She then realised nearly all of the biggest banks were closed to new business customers.\nUK Finance, which represents the banks, admitted there were delays but encouraged people to shop around for a new account.\nThe saga prompted the Treasury Committee to seek reassurances from six major banks - NatWest, Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays, Metro Bank and Santander - that they were committed to serving small businesses as the country emerged from lockdowns.\nIn their replies, a number of banks said they had seen a rise in complaints, but against a background of rising demand and their own staffing pressures owing to Covid.\n\"It is clear that delivering on bounce back loans at short notice rapidly increased the demand for business bank accounts at the same time as banks faced considerable additional work in delivering this extra support,\" said Mr Stride.\n\"It is good to hear from these banks that the availability of business bank accounts is now returning to pre-pandemic levels.\"\nHe said the committee would \"keep a close eye\" on the issue and on the commitment from banks to support small businesses as the UK started to move out of the pandemic."

      "text": "A man working at Fishmongers' Hall stabbed an attacker with a large decorative spear after deciding \"he had to be hurt\", an inquest has heard.\nLukasz Koczocik described how he grabbed the ornament from a wall and went \"face to face\" with Usman Khan.\nKhan killed Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones and attacked others at a prisoner education event on 29 November 2019.\nAnother witness recalled how the 28-year-old had remained \"expressionless\" as he stabbed her.\nThe inquest jury at London's Guildhall was told how head porter Mr Koczocik sprang into action after a housekeeper ran downstairs, shouting \"someone's got stabbed\".\nThe Polish national said he went upstairs and saw a man with two knives who was being confronted by three men \"holding objects\", including a chair and a sign.\nHe said Khan was \"defending himself from the objects that were hitting him\" and did not stop even when \"they hit this man on the head with the chair\".\nMr Koczocik said he then \"froze for a few seconds\" before he pulled the ornamental spear, known as a boarding pike, from the wall.\n\"The next thing I remember - me going back to the lobby area and being with this man face to face.\n\"I decided he had to be hurt, because I realised what was happening. I tried to stab him,\" he said.\nThe head porter described how he tried to stab Khan in the face but \"he was batting me away\", and when he jabbed at his stomach he said he heard a \"metal clink\".\nKhan then grabbed the pike with one hand and dragged himself \"closer to me\", Mr Koczocik said, cutting at his hand and shoulder.\n\"I dropped the pike because he cut the tendon in my hands,\" he said, adding that he was probably only still alive because other people carrying makeshift weapons crowded Khan.\nButler Jeffrey Stevelman, who witnessed the confrontation between Mr Koczocik and Khan, described the scene as \"absolute chaos\".\nHe told the inquest there had been a \"Mexican standoff\" and Khan had stood there and opened his jacket and started shouting: 'I've got a bomb, call the police, I've got a bomb.'\n\"You stand there and try to process it. It was just unreal,\" he said.\nStephanie Szczotko, who also gave evidence, told the jury how Khan had stabbed her during the attack.\nThe former student had been at the event in central London due to her work with prisoners as part of her criminology degree at Cambridge.\nShe said she first heard screams and shouts, and \"a cluster of people\" had fled past her before \"I saw a man run towards me\".\nMs Szczotko, who suffered wounds to her arms and torso, said Khan had a knife raised above his head and she raised her arm \"instinctively\" as he struck.\n\"For a moment I felt I was just paused in that moment,\" she said. \"I remember looking at him with shock and confusion.\"\nWhen asked about her witness statement, in which she described how her attacker \"didn't seem particularly bothered or psyched up\", she replied that he had been \"expressionless\".\nThe Guildhall also heard from Samy Sadek, an emergency doctor who described how he was met by several \"very distressed\" armed police officers after being called to the attack.\nDescribing what he saw upon entering the hall, the consultant said there were \"numerous police officers, there was a lot of noise by way of shouting - there was lots and lots of blood\".\nDr Sadek said he saw Ms Jones, 23, being given CPR at the foot of a staircase, but felt the extent of her injuries meant \"there was no intervention we were able to provide to save her life\". \nHe described how as he examined other casualties, including 25-year-old Mr Merritt, he was told there was a bomb.\nThe consultant explained that he and his team \"were attempting to establish whether there was an ongoing threat\" but \"no-one was able to tell us if there was one or more assailant\".\nDr Sadek told the Guildhall he and his colleagues began massaging Mr Merritt's heart but \"we were not able to resuscitate Jack\".\nWhen asked whether every effort had been put in to help both victims, Dr Sadek replied: \"Absolutely everything was being done.\"\nSimon Bird, a maintenance electrician working at the hall that day, also gave evidence. He described how he heard Khan shouting for the front doors to be opened.\nHe said: \"I heard a voice from someone I now know to be Usman Khan: 'Open the effing door, open the effing door.'\nMr Bird, who said Khan had a large kitchen knife in his hand, said he then witnessed what he described as \"a river of blood\".\nThe inquest hearing continues."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has said \"we may need to wait\" for the lifting of all Covid restrictions in England, which is currently planned for 21 June. \nThe PM said he saw nothing \"currently in the data\" to suggest the government would have to delay unlocking.\nBut he said there were signs of an increase in the number of cases of the Indian variant.\nIt comes after epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson said the reopening of society is now \"in the balance\".\nOn Thursday, a further 3,542 coronavirus cases and 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK.\nOver the last seven days, cases are up 20.5% compared with the week before. \nOn 21 June, the government hopes to move to the final stage of its roadmap for lifting lockdown.\nStep four would see all legal limits on social contact removed, nightclubs would reopen, and restrictions on large events and performances would be lifted.\nScientists advising the government are currently studying all relevant data since the last set of lockdown relaxations on 17 May.\nSpeaking on a visit to a hospital this morning, Mr Johnson said: \"I think the question people want to answer is to what extent is our vaccine shield now going to be enough to allow us to go ahead with 21 June with the unlocking. \n\"Now, as I've said many times, I don't see anything currently in the data to suggest we have to deviate from the roadmap but we may need to wait.\"\nThe prime minister said it was important to understand to what extent the vaccine programme \"interrupts the link\" between infection, hospitalisation, serious illness and death.\nHowever, he reiterated that vaccines in use in the UK work against the Indian variant, particularly with two doses.\nThere are the early signs infection levels are rising.\nFor the second day in a row the number of new Covid cases has topped 3,000.\nThis comes after cases have been consistently below 3,000 a day since mid-April.\nThis is not unexpected. Government scientists had always made clear that infection levels would increase as restrictions ease. \nAnd allowing indoor mixing was always the move that would have the most upward pressure.\nWhat matters now is how fast and high they rise - and what impact that has on the numbers ending up seriously ill and dying.\nMinisters like to say the vaccination programme has broken the link between cases and hospitalisations.\nBut in truth it is more a case that it will have weakened it. By how much, we don't know. \nThe picture is complicated by the rise of the Indian variant, which is considered to be more infectious. A very rapid rise in infection levels could cause problems. \nThere are, however, plenty of reasons to be hopeful - the vaccination programme is well advanced and infection levels are still among the lowest in Europe. \nBut the last year has shown us we should take nothing for granted with this virus. \nProf Ferguson, whose modelling was crucial to the decision to go into the first lockdown in March 2020, said experts were still concerned about the transmissibility of the so-called Indian variant.\nData seems to show it is easier to catch than the UK's other main variant - the one first identified in Kent - but scientists are still determining by how much. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The key issue as to whether we can go forward is: will the surge caused by the Indian variant... be more than has been already planned into the relaxation measures?\"\nHe added that it had always been expected that relaxing the rules would lead to \"a surge in infections, and to some extent a small third wave of transmission\".\nTwo weeks ago, Mr Johnson said the Indian variant could pose \"serious disruption\" to unlocking if it were found to be significantly more transmissible.\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was too early to say whether restrictions could ease on 21 June.\nHe said the decision on unlocking then would be announced exactly one week ahead of the changes. \n\"We will be both driven by the data, we will be advised on and guided by the science, and we will be fully transparent,\" he told MPs in the House of Commons.\nMr Hancock was answering questions in Parliament following claims from the prime minister's former aide Dominic Cummings that he lied to colleagues about dealing with Covid in care homes.\nThe health secretary dismissed the allegation as \"unsubstantiated\" and \"not true\"."

But in recent days ministers, including Boris Johnson, have warned that could be delayed by an increase in the number of cases of the Indian variant.\nUK Hospitality said that uncertainty was one factor in people not going for restaurant jobs.\n\"The government must restore confidence in the hospitality sector so that it is again seen as a stable employer and provider of fulfilling careers,\" said Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality.\n\"To facilitate this, it must stick to the re-opening roadmap, lifting all restrictions from 21 June. This will restore consumer confidence and give a strong signal to workers that hospitality will bounce back strongly.\"\nMany hospitality businesses have struggled during the pandemic despite extensive government support, including rates holidays and the furlough scheme.\nMany hospitality staff have been laid off during the pandemic.\nBrexit has also contributed to staff shortages, especially in city centre venues, as EU workers returned to their home countries, a UK Hospitality spokesperson said.\nOverseas workers also returned home at the beginning of the pandemic, and many have not returned due to travel restrictions.\nUK Hospitality urged the government to encourage UK-based workers to join the sector.\nIt also asked for the government to renew its list of shortage occupations and consider a visa scheme for workers who would not qualify under the points-based system.\nThe government is working with the sector to understand the impact on job shortages due to Brexit and the Covid pandemic, a government spokesperson said.\nEmployers should focus on training the domestic workforce, the spokesperson said, rather than relying on labour from abroad.\nThe immigration system attracts the \"best and brightest talent\", the government added.\n\"We are doing everything we can to support hospitality to recover following the reopening of indoor venues in England earlier this month.\n\"Our dedicated work coaches are supporting people into work, including in hospitality, and through the Kickstart Scheme we're offering generous incentives to employers to recruit, with hundreds of young people starting work every day.\""

      "tags": "Bolton,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,India,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Coronavirus cases in the UK remain low, but there are signs of a small increase, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggest.\nThe ONS regularly swabs a random sample of the population to estimate levels of the virus, even in people who don't have symptoms or don't get tested.\nAlmost half of the infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the variant first identified in India. \nBut national data suggests it is still confined to a handful of areas. \nAn estimated 60,000 people in the UK were infected with coronavirus in the week leading up to 22 May, an increase of roughly 10% from 54,000 people the previous week.\nThat equates to 0.09% of the population - or one in 1,080 people.\nOn Friday national data showed 4,182 people had tested positive for Covid, 134 were admitted to hospital and 10 died. \nSo there is still not a lot of Covid around compared with the winter peak.\nBut there have been signs of increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the previous fortnight. In Wales, cases remain stable. \nSo far, this rise across the UK is small - but data suggests there are larger rises concentrated in just a few local authorities.\nThe ONS data is not broken down by local authority, since they don't swab enough people in each area to give accurate estimates. So it's good for spotting national trends, but less good at picking up local variation.\nWhile the overall increases are small, this hides big spikes in areas with lots of cases of the Indian variant, including Bolton, Blackburn and Bedford. \nThese national figures might partly be skewed by surge testing in areas of concern, which then picks up more cases.\nPublic Health England and ONS data suggest roughly 40-50% of new cases were the B.1.617.2 variant found in India as of the last week in May. \nThe difference this time - compared with previous waves - is the vaccine, which should be breaking the link between infection and illness. \nAfter two doses, the jabs are roughly as effective against the India variant as they are against the Kent variant. \nIn Bolton - which has the highest case numbers in the UK - the vast majority of hospital patients are not fully vaccinated and most cases are in people who are not, or who only just became eligible to have the jab. \nNationally, the number of patients in hospital has continued falling.\nBut in the North West, which is particularly affected by the B.1.617.2 variant, hospital admissions are starting to go up. \nSince cases in the UK as a whole have only just started to creep up, there may be a bigger rise in admissions to follow - there is always a lag before an infection translates to an illness which is severe enough to send someone to hospital. \nThat's why a five-week gap was left between each step of easing lockdown restrictions, to give enough time for those effects to be fully seen. \nWith this recent rise in cases, the next week or two will be crucial in seeing whether and by how much it pushes up the numbers of hospital admissions and deaths.\nThese figures will be key factors when government ministers decide whether the 21 June relaxations can go ahead. \nGraphics by Daniel Dunford and the Visual and Data Journalism Team"

      "text": "Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster has been awarded \u00a3125,000 in damages after a defamatory tweet by TV presenter Dr Christian Jessen.\nDr Jessen tweeted an unfounded claim that the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader had been having an extra-marital affair on 23 December 2019.\nThe post remained online until Dr Jessen deleted it on 7 January 2020. \nA judge at the High Court in Belfast said it was an \"outrageous libel\" which was \"grossly defamatory\".\nLater, in an interview with the BBC, Mrs Foster called for a change in the law to combat online abuse.\nMr Justice McAlinden said the tweet had attacked Mrs Foster's \"integrity at a most fundamental level\" and involved the \"trashing in a very public fashion\" the relationship which was most important in her life.\nHe told the court the tweet had called into question her suitability to hold the office of first minister at a time when delicate negotiations were continuing on the re-establishment of the Stormont executive after three years of deadlock.\n\"To state that a woman married for 25-and-a-half years and a mother of three children, who is a committed Christian and who is recognised as such, and who has publicly made statements extolling the importance and sanctity of marriage... was an adulterer, a hypocrite and a homophobe is a most serious libel,\" said the judge.\nHe ordered Dr Jessen, who is best known for presenting Channel Four programme Embarrassing Bodies, to pay damages of \u00a3125,000 and Mrs Foster's legal costs.\nThe judge also addressed the fact that Dr Jessen failed to respond to warnings from Mrs Foster's lawyer - which became the subject of mainstream media coverage.\n\"The offending tweet remained on the defendant's Twitter account for two weeks, a Twitter account with 311,000 followers,\" he said.\n\"The tweet was liked approximately 3,500 times and it was retweeted 517 times.\n\"This outrageously bad libel cut [Mrs Foster] to the core, causing her considerable upset, distress, humiliation, embarrassment and hurt.\"\nDuring a previous hearing, Mrs Foster had told the court she was left humiliated by the unfounded rumour which \"trashed\" her 25-year marriage.\nThe court was also told that Dr Jessen did not engage with the legal case for more than 12 months because he believed \"most things including court proceedings\" had been stalled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\nHe said he had taken \"some considerable time off\" work because of ill-health and said he rarely watched television or read newspapers.\nThe former Harley Street doctor was asked why he had not heeded a tweet from Mrs Foster's solicitor Paul Tweed on 24 December 2019, instructing him to remove the tweet or face legal action.\nDr Jessen said he had read the tweet but did not realise Mr Tweed was a lawyer, adding that he would have been \"scrolling through many replies\".\n\"I never imagined and still find it hard to imagine a lawyer would tweet a statement to me over Twitter on Christmas Eve,\" he told the court.\n\"The likelihood of me not taking it seriously, which I didn't, is very high.\"\nBelfast-based lawyer Mr Tweed is one of the world's most high-profile libel lawyers - his client list has included singers Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and the late Michael Jackson, as well as Hollywood stars Harrison Ford, Nicolas Cage and Liam Neeson. \nSpeaking outside court after the ruling on Thursday morning, Mr Tweed described the outcome as a complete vindication for Mrs Foster and a potential \"watershed\" for all women who are attacked on social media.\nReferring to Dr Jessen's \"LOL\" response when learning of potential legal action against him, Mr Tweed said: \"I don't think Dr Jessen will be laughing this morning.\"\nMrs Foster's tenure as DUP leader will end on Friday. She remains as first minister until the end of June.\nShe announced her decision to resign in April after facing a revolt from DUP members.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Newscast podcast on Thursday evening, Mrs Foster said she wants social media companies to require people to divulge their true identities when registering accounts.\nShe said she vowed to make tackling online \"trolls\" part of her life's work, once she leaves front-line politics.\nMrs Foster said she was doing it, \"for\u00a0ordinary\u00a0young people and for women who find themselves attacked just because they're different from how people want them to be\".\nShe said that she was worried that people on Twitter act as if it is the \"wild west\".\n\"Somebody needs to know who owns the Twitter account and who'll be accountable if they decide\u00a0to tweet harmful and abusive and, frankly, libellous comments,\" she said.\nOn her libel case victory, the outgoing DUP leader said: \"[It] turns out actually you can't say what you like on Twitter and get away with it. And I think if the case today sends that message then I'm very happy about that\"."

      "title": "Covid-19: Up to 75% of new UK cases could be Indian variant - Matt Hancock",
      "tags": "Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Up to three quarters of new UK Covid cases could be of the Indian variant, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. \nPublic Health England data shows cases of the variant have risen by 3,535 to 6,959 since last week.\nMr Hancock told a Downing Street briefing that the government had always expected cases to rise as restrictions were eased. \nBut he said it was \"critical\" to monitor the link between cases and hospitalisations. \nOn Thursday, a further 3,542 coronavirus cases and 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK.\nIt is the second day in a row the number of new Covid cases has topped 3,000 - the first time infections have reached this level since mid-April.\nOver the last seven days, cases are up 20.5% compared with the week before. \nMr Hancock told the briefing on Thursday: \"The latest estimates are that more than half and potentially as many as three-quarters of all new cases are now of this variant.\n\"As we set out our roadmap we always expected cases to rise - we must remain vigilant.\"\nMr Hancock said the increase in cases was still focused in hotspots. \nThe PHE data found the worst-affected areas continue to be Bolton, Bedford, and Blackburn with Darwen, which have seen 1,354, 366 and 361 confirmed cases, respectively. \nPHE added, however, that there are small numbers of cases of the variant in most parts of the country.\nBut the health secretary said there were \"early signs\" rates in Bolton are starting to \"cap out\".\nIf surge testing and vaccinations are effective against the Indian variant in Bolton, this could be used as a model to prevent local lockdowns, he said.\nMr Hancock said vaccines were \"severing the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths from coronavirus\".\nBut he urged people to get both doses, saying that of the 49 people in hospital with Covid in Bolton only five had received two vaccinations.\nDr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, told the briefing that many of the outbreaks were centred on \"focal points\", such as community centres, schools or faith buildings.\nShe added: \"The cases actually do look as though they are starting to plateau out but the spill-over into community transmission in local areas is an important one.\"\nShe said it was \"on the cusp at the moment\" over whether rising cases reflected the variant taking off or whether there was a rise because more cases were being hunted for and detected by public health experts.\nIncreasing cases numbers were not \"generally translating into increased cases of hospitalisation and definitely not into deaths,\" she said.\n\"So the key message there is... if we can hold it while the vaccination programme gets rolled out, we stand a much better chance of getting through this session.\"\nThe Indian variant is clearly becoming dominant in the UK, replacing the Kent variant that caused the deadly winter surge.\nThe figures quoted by the health secretary are skewed by the fact that the testing of positive cases for variants is heavily targeted towards areas where the variant is known to be spreading.\nThe bigger question, though, is to what extent the rise of this variant matters.\nOverall, cases are going up - but this was expected at this stage of the easing because of the green light for indoor mixing.\nA more infectious variant - as this one seems to be - will put even more upward pressure on infections.\nSo it comes down to two things - how much more infectious it is, and to what extent the vaccination programme has weakened the link between cases and hospitalisations  - given over half of adults are still waiting for their second dose and a quarter have not had their first.\nA very rapid surge in infections has the potential to cause real problems as it will allow the virus to find those that are still at risk.\nThere are plenty of reasons to hope that will not happen given how well advanced the vaccine programme is, how low infection levels are (we have one of lowest rates in Europe) and the arrival of warmer weather which should mean more time outdoors.\nBut as always with this virus nothing can be taken for granted.\nIt comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England \"may need to wait\" for the lifting of all Covid restrictions, which is currently planned for 21 June.\nThe PM said he saw nothing \"currently in the data\" to suggest the government would have to delay unlocking.\nBut he added there were signs of an increase in the number of cases of the Indian variant.\nMr Johnson said it was important to understand to what extent the vaccine programme \"interrupts the link\" between infection, hospitalisation, serious illness and death.\nGovernment scientists had always made clear that infection levels would increase as restrictions eased, particularly the resumption of indoor mixing. \nBut epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling was crucial to the decision to go into the first lockdown in March 2020, said the Indian variant meant the reopening of society was now \"in the balance\".\nHe told the BBC: \"The key issue as to whether we can go forward is: will the surge caused by the Indian variant... be more than has been already planned into the relaxation measures?\"\nOn 21 June, the government hopes to move to the final stage of its roadmap for lifting lockdown.\nStep four would see all legal limits on social contact removed, nightclubs would reopen, and restrictions on large events and performances would be lifted.\nScientists advising the government are currently studying all relevant data since the last set of lockdown relaxations on 17 May."

      "title": "Friends reunion: BTS, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber censored in China",
      "tags": "China",
      "text": "Something was amiss in China's version of the much-anticipated Friends reunion special: guest stars BTS, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber were nowhere to be seen. \nEagle-eyed fans found the stars were cut on all three Chinese streamers with broadcast rights. LGBTQ references, among other things, were also gone.\nIt is believed that footage of the stars were cut because they are deemed to have insulted China in the past.\nThe US sitcom is hugely popular in China, and the censorship upset fans.\n\"Help! Are we never going to move on and change? This will just make me want to find out more about the cut scenes,\" one person commented on microblogging platform Weibo. \nSome fans have since sourced and shared the deleted clips on social media on their own, while others circulated links to the uncensored, full episode, hosted on piracy sites. \nFriends has a massive following in the country, with many Chinese millennials crediting the show with introducing them to American culture and also teaching them English. \nThe reunion episode had brought all six principal cast members together to talk about their time on the beloved series, along with interviews with celebrities and fans. \nIt is unclear whether the government had issued a censorship directive, or if streaming platforms iQiyi, Youku and Tencent Video had done it themselves to avoid letting \"politically sensitive\" content go through.\nMany fans noticed that the censorship was not consistent across the board- iQiyi's version had the shortest running time, at least six minutes less than the original runtime of 1hr 44min. Tencent Video's version had cut close to five minutes of footage, while Youku censored around four minutes. \nThere were calls to boycott South Korean boy band BTS in China last year over comments a member made about the Korean War. \nIn a speech, band leader RM had mentioned South Korea's shared \"history of pain\" with the US over the 1950-53 conflict, in which the two countries fought together. His remarks angered Chinese social media users, as Beijing backed the North in the war.\nIn the uncut Friends episode, the superstars were part of a 13-second clip speaking about their love for the show, with RM saying that the sitcom had taught him \"the things about life and true friendship.\" \nMeanwhile, American singer-songwriter Lady Gaga is banned from touring in China, following her meeting with the Dalai Lama in 2016. \nBy showing her support for the Tibetan spiritual leader, she had upset Chinese officials who feel he is a figurehead for Tibetan separatism.\nThe cut meant that her appearance in the Friends special - where she sings the iconic Smelly Cat song with the sitcom's star Lisa Kudrow - would not have been seen on official Chinese channels.\nChinese audiences also did not see Justin Bieber's appearance in the episode dressed as Spudnik - the potato and satellite-combination suit that Friends character Ross once wore to a Halloween party. \nThe Canadian pop star is banned from performing in China for \"bad behaviour\". \nIn 2014, he caused upset after posting a photo of himself visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. \nThe shrine, which honours fallen warriors and pays tribute to convicted war criminals, is seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan not being sorry for its empire's past.\nLGBTQ references, as well as seemingly random references to urine, were censored.\nFor example, a testimony by gay German fan Ricardo, who described how the show gave him a sense of belonging, was dropped.\n\"I was a gay man who wanted to be like Jennifer Aniston, so you can imagine how lonely I was,\" he had said in the original clip. \nThe Youku platform censored another scene in which a woman pulls her female partner on camera. \"Like every Chandler, I found my Monica,\" she had said.\nThe streaming platform also censored shots from a scene where Friends star Matt LeBlanc's Joey revealed a picture of Ross stuck to the front of his underwear. \nMeanwhile, iQiyi and Tencent both cut out the iconic scene from the sitcom where Monica talks about how Chandler had helped her with a jellyfish sting by peeing on her leg. \nIt is not uncommon for Chinese broadcasters to censor anything that may be deemed politically or culturally sensitive. \nIn April, for example, Chinese TV stations blurred out Western brand logos in their programmes, in a show of support for China's Xinjiang cotton campaign.\nHip-hop culture, tattoos and cleavage have also been censored in the past.\nIn 2015, popular Chinese TV drama The Empress of China was re-edited to get rid of the plunging necklines featured in the show - provoking a large amount of public outrage."

      "title": "Could Fishmongers' Hall attacker Usman Khan have been stopped?",
      "tags": "London Bridge attack,Stoke,Fishmongers' Hall attack inquests",
      "text": "Three simple facts became crystal clear over the course of the inquests into the Fishmongers' Hall terrorism attack, in which Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones died at the hand of Usman Khan. \nFirstly, Khan, had entered and left prison as one of the most dangerous terrorism offenders of his generation. \nSecondly, while counter-terrorism experts and investigators fully understood the threat he posed, some of the people directly interacting with Khan did not know all of those fears. \nAnd thirdly, by the time Khan had decided to kill, nobody knew whether he was plotting or not - and so his trip went ahead without anyone being sure what risk he posed when he was allowed to travel to London alone. \nUsman Khan came to London on 29 November 2019 to take part in a special event organised by Learning Together, a Cambridge University programme in which its graduates help offenders with their rehabilitation. \nThe scheme began at Grendon Prison, a specialist jail in Buckinghamshire that puts inmates through intensive psychological and behavioural therapy. \nKhan joined when the scheme was later introduced at the maximum security Whitemoor Prison in Cambridgeshire.\nPrior to that, Learning Together had no experience of working with terrorism offenders - who typically think and behave completely differently to other violent criminals. \nIn time, Khan came to be regarded as a success story - and Learning Together's chiefs invited him to the London reunion. \nFrom when he was a teenager, Khan, from Stoke, had been part of Al-Muhajiroun (ALM), the terror recruitment network linked to almost all major plots.\nFrom around 2008, he was under police and MI5 investigation into the intentions of a cell of men from London, Cardiff and Stoke. All of them were arrested in 2010 and later convicted and jailed.  \nSome of the group had an amateurish plan to bomb the London Stock Exchange. \nKhan was more dangerous still. He wanted to create a terror training camp in Pakistan - and his original jail sentence reflected the fact that the judge could not be sure whether he would ever be safe to be released. \nThat sentence was later changed, following an appeal, to a fixed term. This meant that he would be out of jail on a special licence by the end of 2018. \nRight up until he was released on Christmas Eve 2018, Khan had been regarded in prison as a serious threat.\nHe remained at all times a top-tier high-risk offender because of his behaviour and lack of progress towards rehabilitation - one of only 70 prisoners to have this status in England and Wales.\nAnd so most of his adult life was spent alongside some of the UK's most dangerous men, including ringleaders of previous plots whom he sought out and admired. \nSecurity chiefs recorded that he bullied, attacked and tried to radicalise other inmates. \nOn one occasion, he entered a prohibited area of his wing and recited a poem about decapitating unbelievers. \nAnd as his release date approached, two pieces of information fell into the hands of prison authorities and MI5. The intelligence suggested Khan would return to his \"old ways\" and, secondly, that he wanted to carry out an attack. \nPrison psychologists in the UK use tools and programmes to try to challenge the mindset of terrorism prisoners. Khan went through the main prison scheme - but there were no clear signs that it had changed him. \nEight months before his release, an expert brought in to analyse Khan's thinking concluded that the risk that he would return to terrorism could increase after he left jail.\nDr Ieva Cechaviciute warned that Khan sought \"status\" and did not accept he had done anything wrong. She told the inquests she had been very worried about how he could be safely managed.\nWhen Khan was released to live in a monitored bail hostel, he did not know that he was already under MI5 investigation. It had launched a new probe into his intentions, given the intelligence concerns. \nBut in the absence of clear information that he was actively taking steps to carry out an attack, the probe never became one of the security service's highest priorities. \nKhan's new life was overseen by police and probation officers under the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa) system. \nThis is the body that meets to discuss whether serious offenders are sticking to their release licence or presenting danger that would trigger their return to jail.\nMappa held three meetings before Khan was released - and Staffordshire Police officers with no counter-terrorism expertise were put in charge of the day-to-day meetings once he was out. \nKhan was also assigned a senior probation officer overseeing the management of his probation - an officer who, in time, would be expected to draw up deeper reports into his behaviour and prospects.\nBoth the probation and police teams knew of Khan's very troubling prison record - but did not know about the continuing secret MI5 investigation, or its continuing concerns. \nOver the year he was out, Khan failed to find work. He asked for permission to train to operate dumper trucks - but the panel blocked this after police advised that the vehicles could be used as weapons. \nHe began isolating himself - spending more and more time playing computer games alone. He got angry when the police officers looking after him took photographs of the violent games he had bought - and he lied to them and others about his previous offending. \nSo, two months before the attack, the situation was simple: there was no intelligence that Khan was plotting an attack - but neither was there any reassurance that he had changed for the better.\nThe one aspect of his life that seemed to make a difference was his continuing interest in working with the Learning Together programme. \nSo when the programme's directors at Cambridge asked Khan to come to London for the major reunion, he jumped at the chance. \nHe asked his probation officer for permission to go, and the Mappa panel said he could leave his home in Staffordshire - but without knowing the full facts of the unresolved risk he may have posed. \nAnd so he travelled to London unescorted and was not met by police when he arrived. He was never searched. Had he been, his weapons would have been found.  \nThere was a \"secure corridor\" between MI5 and the police and probation officers who dealt directly with Khan. \nThat corridor exists to make sure that a suspect does not accidentally learn anything about what the security service is doing. But it also allows the spies to provide critical information in a way that does not reveal their secret techniques. \nThe inquests heard that MI5 told the counter-terrorism detectives in West Midlands Police that there were unresolved fears that Khan would return to his \"old ways\" and that he might plan an attack. \nThose detectives shared it in turn with Staffordshire Police's Special Branch, the team actively assisting the Mappa panel. \nBut that second piece of information - the possibility of an attack  - never reached any Mappa document or officer. \nThe reason why remains a mystery. The most junior officer in Special Branch did not believe they had the power to pass it on to Mappa without express permission. It seems that no officer higher up the police chain realised the information had not been shared.\nCritically, despite MI5 secretly having officers in some Mappa meetings, nobody from the service flagged to their police colleagues that the intelligence had not yet been shared with that panel. \nMI5's witness told the inquests they had shared everything they had - but it was not clear from the evidence whether the security service's officers even realised the important, albeit unvalidated, intelligence had not got through to the panel."

That particularly pertains to the northern powerhouse rail.\" \nMr Shapps suggested the eastern leg to Leeds originally scheduled for completion between 2035 and 2040 could be brought forward \"quite dramatically\" by building it \"in a smarter way\".\nHe said the government would provide further information on that \"soon\".\nHenri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a lobby group, said the government was doing the right thing.\n\"It's critical to ensuring levelling up is a reality not just rhetoric,\" said Mr Murison, referring to election promises to boost the economy in the north of England.\nMaria Machancoses, chief executive of Midlands Connect, a government-funded regional transport body, said: \"While these verbal commitments are encouraging, we need definitive action, namely the publication of the government's Integrated Rail Plan, to give businesses and investors the confidence they need to make decisions.\n\"The quicker we know government's intentions, the faster we can act, and the sooner we can deliver the benefits local communities,\" she added."

      "text": "Hong Kong pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai has been sentenced to 14 months in prison for participating in an unauthorised assembly in 2019.\nLai, 73, is currently already serving time for participating in other demonstrations that year. \nHe will serve part of his new sentence consecutively, meaning Mr Lai faces a total of 20 months in jail. \nThe verdict comes as mainland China is increasingly cracking down on Hong Kong's rights and freedoms.\nLai is among 10 prominent activists who were sentenced on Friday for participating in an unlawful assembly on 1 October 2019. \nOther activists include Figo Chan, Leung Kwok-hung, known as \"Long Hair\", and Lee Cheuk-yan - who were sentenced to 18 months in jail. Leung and Lee are currently both in jail and will also serve their sentences consecutively. \nAt the sentencing on Friday, Judge Amanda Woodcock said she found claims by some of the defendants that their march on 1 October would be peaceful to be \"na\u00efve and unrealistic\", according to a Reuters report.\nThe protests on China's national day saw major clashes between protesters and police, with the police chief later calling it \"one of Hong Kong's most violent and chaotic days\". \nThe tycoon faces at least two other charges imposed under the country's new national security law, which can carry a maximum term of life in prison. \nLai is one of the most prominent persons to be arrested under the law, which criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. \nIt makes it easier to punish protesters, and reduces Hong Kong's autonomy.\nLai is one of the most prominent supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. \nEstimated to be worth more than $1bn (\u00a3766m), he made his initial fortune in the clothing industry and later ventured into media and founded Next Digital.\nNext Digital publishes Apple Daily, a well-read tabloid which is frequently critical of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese leadership.\nEarlier this month, authorities froze assets belonging to Lai, including his bank accounts and his stake of 71.26% in Next Digital - estimated to be worth $45m (\u00a331m). \nBanking giants HSBC and Citibank were also sent letters by Hong Kong's security chief, who threatened up to seven years' jail for any dealings with Lai's accounts in the city. \nIn his last interview with the BBC before he was sentenced to jail, he said he would not give in to intimidation.\n\"If they can induce fear in you, that's the cheapest way to control you and the most effective way and they know it. The only way to defeat the way of intimidation is to face up to fear and don't let it frighten you,\" he said.\nBritain handed back Hong Kong to China in 1997, and the Basic Law was created under the handover agreement under the \"one country, two systems\" principle.\nThis is supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has.\nBut fears that this model was being eroded led to huge pro-democracy protests in 2019.\nSome protests turned violent and in 2020, China introduced the national security law in the territory.\nBeijing said the law would target \"sedition\" and bring stability. Since the law has been enacted in June, around 100 people have been arrested."

      "text": "Arlene Foster has said she will resign as NI first minister on Tuesday, instead of the end of June, if Edwin Poots changes his ministerial team. \nShe said she worked closely with her team and \"if Edwin decides to change that then I have to go as well\".\n\"I can't stay with a new ministerial team over which I have no authority - that would be wrong,\" she said.\nHowever, the new Democratic Unionist Party leader insisted he was not \"pushing Arlene out\" of the party.\n\"That's my position and that remains my position,\" said Mr Poots.\n\"I'm not going to be rushed into doing anything or pushed into doing anything. Nor am I going to be denied doing something that I'm ready to do. \n\"So we will look at all of these issues and take a decision at a time that's appropriate for us.\" \nOn Thursday, Mr Poots denied the party is divided after tensions flared at a meeting to ratify his leadership.\nThe party endorsed an earlier vote by MLAs and MPs to make Mr Poots leader, but it came amid anger from some quarters about how Arlene Foster was ousted as leader last month.\nMr Poots' rival for the leadership, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said that one of his team had been threatened by someone from loyalist paramilitary group the UDA.\nIt is believed the threat was made online during the leadership campaign.\nPolice said they had \"received a complaint that a number of members of a political party had been threatened during a recent leadership campaign\".\n\"The full circumstances of the incident are still being established and enquiries are continuing at this time.\"\nMr Poots said that \"no member of my team engaged in any activities of intimidation or bullying\". \nOn a visit to Banbridge Academy on Friday, Mrs Foster, who had been due to resign as first minister at the end of June, also confirmed she intends to leave the DUP after she steps down as first minister. \nShe added that the new DUP leadership had shown its \"direction of travel\" and it was time for her to \"move on\". \nShe told reporters on Friday that while she wished Mr Poots well as the new DUP leader, he must realise there is \"work to do in terms of healing the divisions in the party\".\nOn Thursday, Mrs Foster told BBC Newscast her departure was \"even by DUP standards, pretty brutal\".\nIn his speech to members after the party endorsed his leadership on Thursday night, Mr Poots paid tribute to Mrs Foster as \"one of the foremost women in unionist and British politics\".\nLagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson - who ran against Mr Poots for the leadership - Lord Dodds, Economy Minister Diane Dodds and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson did not wait to hear Mr Poots' speech - they left the building.\nA very well-known figure in the DUP told BBC News NI it was the \"worst meeting he had attended in over 40 years as a DUP member\".\nAfter the ratification, Paul Bell, the former chairman of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone association of the DUP, resigned from the party. \nSpeaking on the BBC's Evening Extra programme on Friday, Strangford MP Jim Shannon said he had not attended the meeting but had spoken to party colleagues who were there.\nHe said there had been \"firm and robust exchanges\" of views.\nHe denied party members left in protest before Mr Poots' speech.\n\"They have told me clearly that there was no walk-out last night, that the meeting ended at about 10:15,\" he said.\n\"They had been sitting on their backsides for two and a half hours and we (they) were going home.\n\"People got up to leave to go home and that was the fact of the matter.\"\nMrs Foster has already changed her Twitter handle from @DUPLeader to @ArleneFosterUK, taking all 96,000 followers with her.\nThe twitter handle @DUPLeader was quickly taken by someone else on the social media platform and is now being used as a parody account.\nIn his speech to members, Mr Poots said history will \"ultimately be kind\" to Mrs Foster and he wished her well. \nHe said the party had a leadership contest and will now \"move forward in a united way\".\nThe new DUP leader said preparations for the next election to the Northern Ireland Assembly - due in May 2022 - have now begun. He announced that he will be appointing a director of elections \"quickly\".\nHe said all strands of the party needed to come together.\nSpeaking of his relationship with the Irish government, Mr Poots said it was \"really, really bad\" as a consequence of how issues were dealt with relating to the Irish border during the Brexit talks.\nHe accused it of attempting to \"starve Northern Ireland people of medicines no less, cancer drugs and other materials, such as the food that's on our table\" and took particular aim at Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, the Republic of Ireland's T\u00e1naiste (deputy prime minister) and foreign affairs minister.\nThe new DUP leader said it was \"quite frankly disgraceful\" that the pair \"took photographs of blown up border posts to impose upon Northern Ireland people the harshest form of customs and an internal market that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world\".\nHowever, Mr Poots said he had \"respect\" for Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin.\nAlso speaking outside the meeting, North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said \"leadership transfer hurts\". \n\"If anyone in this party can talk about difficulty, it's me. I saw what happened to my dad, it killed my father,\" he told BBC's The View. \nMr Paisley's late father, Ian, the party founder, had accused his successor, Peter Robinson, and Nigel Dodds of giving him an ultimatum to leave his post.\nIn a statement, the Fermanagh and South Tyrone association of the DUP said the removal of Mrs Foster was \"not done in our name\" and it would support her if she remained as an MLA.\nIt said its members \"met this week to voice their disgust at the manner\" in which Mrs Foster had \"been treated over recent weeks\".\nAfter Mr Poots was ratified, Paul Bell, former chairman of the association and member for 20 years, resigned from the party.\nHe said it will shed tens of thousands of votes under Edwin Poots and he was \"disgusted\" by the treatment of Mrs Foster. \nMr Bell told the BBC's The View programme on Thursday night that Mrs Foster had been \"stabbed in the back\".\n\"If the DUP cannot have respect for their own people, I don't know how they're going to have respect for people who don't agree with them,\" he said. \nIn an interview with BBC Newscast earlier on Thursday, Mrs Foster said the move against her and the manner in which it was carried out was \"not particularly pleasant\".\n\"I think that I said a couple of days after what had happened that politics is brutal, but even by DUP standards it was pretty brutal, in terms of what happened,\" she said.

Why have there been no consequences, why are families still having to fight for the truth? Who is going to be held accountable?\"\nMs Sturgeon replied that \"this is a matter of utmost seriousness\", and said attempts to contact the family would continue.\nShe said: \"I am not disputing that this is an incredibly serious matter - what I am disputing is that the government is not taking this seriously and is not determined to get to the bottom of what happened, from the opening of the hospital right through to now, to make sure families have answers to their questions.\""

      "tags": "Astronomy,Cosmology,Astrophysics",
      "text": "An international team of researchers has created the largest and most detailed map of the distribution of so-called dark matter in the Universe.\nThe results are a surprise because they show that it is slightly smoother and more spread out than the current best theories predict.\nThe observation appears to stray from Einstein's theory of general relativity - posing a conundrum for researchers. \nThe results have been published by the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration.\nDark Matter is an invisible substance that permeates space. It accounts for 80% of the matter in the Universe. \nAstronomers were able to work out where it was because it distorts light from distant stars. The greater the distortion, the greater the concentration of dark matter. \nDr Niall Jeffrey, of \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, in Paris, who pieced the map together, said that the result posed a \"real problem\" for physics.\n\"If this disparity is true then maybe Einstein was wrong,\" he told BBC News. \"You might think that this is a bad thing, that maybe physics is broken. But to a physicist, it is extremely exciting. It means that we can find out something new about the way the Universe really is.\"\nProf Carlos Frenk, of Durham University, who was one of the scientists that built on the work of Albert Einstein and others to develop the current cosmological theory, said he had mixed emotions on hearing the news. \n\"I spent my life working on this theory and my heart tells me I don't want to see it collapse. But my brain tells me that the measurements were correct, and we have to look at the possibility of new physics,\" said Prof Frenk. \n\"Then my stomach cringes, because we have no solid grounds to explore because we have no theory of physics to guide us. It makes me very nervous and fearful, because we are entering a completely unknown domain and who knows what we are going to find.\" \nUsing the Victor M Blanco telescope in Chile, the team behind the new work analysed 100 million galaxies. \nThe map shows how dark matter sprawls across the Universe. The black areas are vast areas of nothingness, called voids, where the laws of physics might be different. The bright areas are where dark matter is concentrated. They are called \"halos\" because right in the centre is where our reality exists. In their midst are galaxies like our own Milky Way, shining brightly like tiny  gems on a vast cosmic web. \nAccording to Dr Jeffrey, who is also part of a department at University College London, the map, clearly shows that galaxies are part of a larger invisible structure. \n\"No one in the history of humanity has been able to look out into space and see where dark matter is to such an extent. Astronomers have been able to build pictures of small patches, but we have unveiled vast new swathes which show much more of its structure. For the first time we can see the Universe in a different way.\"\nBut the new dark matter map is not showing quite what astronomers expected. They have an accurate idea of the distribution of matter 350, 000 years after the Big Bang, from a European Space Agency orbiting observatory called Planck. It measured the radiation still present from that moment, called the cosmic microwave background, or more poetically, the \"afterglow of creation\".\nDrawing on the ideas of Einstein, astronomers, such as Prof Frenk, developed a model to calculate how matter should disperse over the next 13.8bn years to the present day. But the actual observations from the new map are out by a few per cent - it shows that matter is slightly too evenly spread. \nAs a result, Prof Frenk thinks there may be big changes afoot in our understanding of the cosmos.\n\"We may have uncovered something really fundamental about the fabric of the Universe. The current theory rests on very sketchy pillars made of sand. And what we may be seeing is the collapse of one of those pillars.\"\nBut others, such as Prof Ofer Lahav, of University College London, have a more conservative view.\n\"The big question is whether Einstein's theory is perfect. It seems to pass every test but with some deviations here and there. Maybe the astrophysics of the galaxies just needs some tweaks. In the history of cosmology there are examples where  problems went away, but also examples when the thinking shifted. It will be fascinating to see if the current 'tension' in Cosmology will lead to a new paradigm shift,\" he said.\nThe DES collaboration consists of over 400 scientists from 25 institutions in seven countries.\nFollow Pallab on Twitter."

How important this is to us, how much their children matter.\"\nThe jury also thanked emergency services and the \"astonishing individuals\" who put themselves in \"real danger\" to help.\nThe jurors found there had been unacceptable management and a lack of accountability in the oversight of Khan, who had been allowed to travel on his own to London.\nThey concluded there had been failures in the sharing of information between state agencies responsible for monitoring the convicted terrorist.\nIn a separate statement, the family of Ms Jones, from Stratford-upon-Avon, said there remained \"a number of unanswered questions\".\nThey said of Learning Together, which organised the event: \"It could be said that their single-minded view of the rehabilitation of offenders - using Usman Khan, in our view, as a 'poster boy' for their programme - significantly clouded their judgement.\n\"Learning Together declined an opportunity to learn more about Usman Khan and his risk factors. \n\"This may have contributed to a failure to take account of the steps necessary to protect the safety and wellbeing of everyone involved.\n\"Their refusal when giving evidence adequately to review past behaviours within their organisation, and to consider that they may have done things differently, is astounding and insulting to the family.\"\nThe family said they wanted to distance Ms Jones's connection to Learning Together, which is a University of Cambridge programme.\nThe co-founders of Learning Together and the university have pledged to reflect on the lessons of the inquests."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "UUP (Ulster Unionist Party),DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Arlene Foster",
      "text": "The Democratic Unionist Party has ratified Edwin Poots and Paula Bradley as its leader and deputy leader.\nThe party endorsed an earlier vote by MLAs and MPs, but it came amid anger from some quarters about how Arlene Foster was ousted as leader last month.\nMr Poots paid tribute to Mrs Foster as \"one of the foremost women in unionist and British politics\".\nAhead of the meeting, Mrs Foster said her departure was \"even by DUP standards, pretty brutal\".\nLagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson - who ran against Mr Poots for the leadership - Lord Dodds, Economy Minister Diane Dodds and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson did not wait to hear Mr Poots' speech - they left the building.\nA very well-known figure in the DUP told BBC News NI it was the \"worst meeting he had attended in over 40 years as a DUP member\".\nAfter the ratification, Paul Bell, the former chairman of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone association of the DUP, resigned from the party. \nBBC News NI political reporter Jayne McCormack said she is hearing that others may follow in resigning, including some councillors.  \nMrs Foster, who attended the meeting, remains as first minister until the end of June.\nShe has already changed her Twitter handle from @DUPLeader to @ArleneFosterUK, taking all 96,000 followers with her.\nMr Poots was ratified via a show of hands, by 72-28. \nIn his speech to members, Mr Poots said history will \"ultimately be kind\" to Mrs Foster and he wished her well. \nHe said the party had a contest and the party will now \"move forward in a united way\".\nThe new DUP leader said preparations for the next election to the Northern Ireland Assembly - due in May 2022 - have now begun. He announced that he will be appointing a director of elections \"quickly.\"\nHe said all strands of the party needed to come together.\n\"Let us agree to go forward in a spirit of unity of purpose,\" he said. \n\"What lies ahead of us will be the greatest Titanic struggle of an election.\"\nMs Bradley said there were \"better times to come\" for the party. \nMr Poots also paid tribute to leadership rival Sir Jeffrey, saying he had a \"key role\" in the party. \nNorth Antrim MP Ian Paisley said \"leadership transfer hurts\". \n\"If anyone in this party can talk about difficulty, it's me. I saw what happened to my dad, it killed my father,\" he told BBC's The View. \nMr Paisley's late father, Ian, the party founder, had accused his successor, Peter Robinson, and Nigel Dodds of giving him an ultimatum to leave his post.\nEast Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said after the meeting that \"any political party will at times have its divisions\".\n\"A change of leadership always does provoke some very strong views amongst party members,\" he said. \n\"I am sorry that some people have decided that they don't want to remain in the party as a result of the change of leadership. I hope that Edwin will reach out to those people and try and convince them that under his leadership there's a place for them in the party.\"\nMr Poots is remaining as agriculture minister and has opted not to take on the role of first minister.\nIt is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place.\nThe decision on who will take on the role of first minister has yet to be decided. \nBBC News NI understands North Antrim MLA Mervyn Storey has reservations about becoming first minster, having been tipped for the role.\nMr Storey is understood to have concerns about the joint nature of the office and feels he could not be \"true to himself\" in that role.\nThis was not how tonight was supposed to go for Edwin Poots.\nParty members - senior ranking and junior - gathered to rubber stamp his new position but what followed were hours of tough, emotional talking about how bruising the past few weeks have been.\nI think the fact there was a vote on whether or not to have a secret ballot and it was so close - rejected by 56 votes to 47 - shows how much unease there still is within the DUP.\nSome party colleagues including Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Lord Dodds walked out before the new leader addressed members and set out his priorities.\nThat unease is not only about how Edwin Poots was elected to his new role, but also the fact that Arlene Foster clearly had a lot of difficulty in the last few weeks - a bruising few weeks for her as she now leaves the job.\nSir Jeffrey still has a lot of support within the party and Mr Poots is going to have to try to reach out to build support from all of those who don't view him as the leader to take the party forward.\nThe next assembly election is going to be the thing on the minds of most MLAs and unionist voters.\nEarlier, The Irish News reported the party veteran Mervyn Storey, who has previously served as finance minister and social development minister, rejected the role and said he did not want to become \"Edwin's mudguard\".\nOthers who have been tipped for the job include Lagan Valley MLA Paul Givan, who is a close ally of Mr Poots.\nThere has been tension in some quarters at the treatment of Mrs Foster. \nIn a statement, the Fermanagh and South Tyrone association of the DUP said the removal of Mrs Foster was \"not done in our name\" and it would support her if she remained as an MLA.\nIt said its members \"met this week to voice their disgust at the manner\" in which Mrs Foster had \"been treated over recent weeks\".\n\"We appreciate that Arlene has sacrificed so much personally over the years for public service but this association will stand firm by her side,\" it said.\nAfter Mr Poots was ratified, Paul Bell, former chairman of the association and member for 20 years, resigned from the party.\nHe said it will shed tens of thousands of votes under Edwin Poots and he was \"disgusted\" by the treatment of Mrs Foster. \nMr Bell told the BBC's The View programme on Thursday night that Mrs Foster had been \"stabbed in the back\".\n\"If the DUP cannot have respect for their own people, I don't know how they're going to have respect for people who don't agree with them,\" he said. \nMrs Foster told the BBC's Newscast podcast on Thursday that the heave against her and the manner in which it was carried out was \"not particularly pleasant\".\n\"I think that I said a couple of days after what had happened that politics is brutal, but even by DUP standards it was pretty brutal, in terms of what happened,\" she said. \n\"I had absolutely no idea and was telephoned by a close colleague that this was happening on Monday evening and then by Tuesday morning, it was all in the papers. So, no, it wasn't particularly pleasant.\"\nMeanwhile, North Belfast MLA Paula Bradley was elected as the party's new deputy leader after Lord Dodds announced he would not bid for re-election.\nShe beat MP Gregory Campbell by 18 votes to 16 and is the first woman elected to the post."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Glasgow",
      "text": "Glasgow will continue to be the only part of Scotland under level three restrictions for at least another week.\nThere had been speculation that the city would be able to join the rest of the Scottish mainland in level two.\nBut First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was still concern about an outbreak of the Indian variant of the virus in the city.\nShe said the variant was now accounting for at least half of the new Covid cases in Glasgow.\nMs Sturgeon said it was hoped the city would be able to move to level two on Saturday of next week - with a final decision being taken on Tuesday.\nAnd she said there were signs that the situation in Glasgow was beginning to stabilise, with the number of new cases falling in recent days in the postcode areas in the southside of the city which had been at the centre of the outbreak of the Indian variant.\nThe level three restrictions mean people are not allowed to meet in each other's homes, and pubs and restaurants are not able to sell alcohol indoors.\nMany Glasgow business owners say they are struggling to survive after spending 270 days under tough restrictions, and have criticised the Scottish government for not giving them more financial support. \nAnd opposition parties had demanded urgent action to get the city back on a level footing with the rest of the country - where restrictions have eased in recent weeks - as quickly as possible.\nThe rest of mainland Scotland is currently due to join most of the country's island communities in level one on 7 June, before the country moves to level zero - meaning something close to normality - on 28 June. \nMobile testing and vaccination centres have been set up in many parts of Glasgow over the past few weeks.\nAnd there has been no significant increase in the number of people being hospitalised with the virus - which public health experts say suggests that it is mainly younger, unvaccinated people who are contracting it. \nHowever, case numbers have risen by about 30% - from 112 cases per 100,000 to about 136 per 100,000 - over the past week, while the rate of positive tests  has also crept up from about 4% to 4.4%.\nThe R number - effectively the rate at which the virus spreads - for Scotland is now estimated to stand at about 1.3, largely driven by the number of cases in Glasgow. \nLatest figures released shortly after the briefing revealed the Glasgow weekly case rate had dropped to 135.5 per 100,000 people, the first fall in almost a month. \nMeanwhile, drop-in vaccination centres for people aged 40 and over are being opened across the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board.\nThe centres have a set number of appointments on a first-come, first-served basis and will be operational from Saturday.\nAs well as in Glasgow, drop-in vaccinations will also be offered in Paisley, Bearsden, Alexandria, Renfrew, Johnstone, Greenock, Dumbarton, Eastwood, Kirkintilloch, Clydebank and Port Glasgow.\nMs Sturgeon said the decision to keep Scotland's largest city in level three for a further week had been \"very difficult\".\nBut she said the number of new cases continued to be \"uncomfortably high\" despite the signs of progress. \nThe first minister added: \"The view of the National Incident Management Team is that it would be premature to move Glasgow out of level three immediately, while the situation remains so fragile.\"\nHowever, if the situation continues to stabilise, Ms Sturgeon said the management team would support a move to level two at the end of next week.\nResponding to the announcement, the Federation of Small Business said its members in Glasgow had become \"used to these weekly Friday disappointments\" - with this one \"even more galling\" because of the sunny weather that is forecast for the Bank Holiday on Monday.\nIts chairman, Andrew McRae, said: \"The businesses and employees hardest hit by these ongoing restrictions need proper support now. \n\"The Glasgow hospitality industry was given two days to scrap their re-opening plans (earlier this month)  -  but even now, after two weeks, we still don't have adequate financial support measures in place.\"\nThe Scottish government says further funding has been made available to Glasgow City Council to provide additional support for businesses in hospitality and leisure in Glasgow, with grants ranging from \u00a3250 to \u00a3750 per week.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: \"Glasgow has now been under Covid restrictions for 270 days and people were looking to the first minister to give them some hope. \n\"Instead, we saw Nicola Sturgeon keep the whole city under tougher restrictions for another week, despite outbreaks being largely confined to one area.\"\nHe said the government must immediately ramp up the vaccination rollout and testing capacity in the virus hotspots, rather than \"continuing to treat the city as one entity\". \nScottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said the government had to be able to tackle future local outbreaks without \"draconian lockdown measures\" being put in place.\nThe first minister will also give an update next Tuesday on whether, and to what extent, the proposed move to level one for mainland council areas will proceed as planned.\nShe said: \"If we see a significant reduction in the health harms of Covid, even as case numbers rise, then hopefully that will allow us to change our approach.\n\"Because we will be able to rely then on other public health measures, rather than blanket restrictions, to keep the outbreaks under control.\"\nThe number of people in hospital with the virus has increased from 68 three weeks ago to 90 today - but there were more than 2,000 people in hospital at the peak of the second wave in January, and the number of Covid patients in intensive care is currently very low. \nThe first minister said she had considered whether additional restrictions needed to be introduced in three other council areas - Clackmannanshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire - where there are relatively high levels of the virus. \nBut all three areas have relatively low populations and the number of cases is low in absolute terms - with public health teams confident that the outbreaks are able to be controlled using existing measures. \nThere have been 641 new positive cases of the virus recorded across Scotland in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since 25 March.\nThe deaths of a further two people who had previously tested positive for the virus have also been recorded, while the number of people in hospital has risen to 90 - with six patients in intensive care."

      "title": "How rising patient numbers threaten to overwhelm GPs",
      "tags": "Doctors,NHS,Cancer",
      "text": "Rising numbers of patients needing care and a shortage of GPs is threatening to overwhelm the system, doctors and patient groups are warning.\nIt comes after the pandemic has caused severe disruption to GP practices for more than a year.\nAnalysis of NHS England data by the Health Foundation found more than 28 million appointments were booked in March, among the highest recorded.\nDoctors' leaders say what they are being asked to achieve is \"undoable\".\nThe analysis of NHS Digital data in England carried out by the Health Foundation for the BBC also found that that between 2019-20 and 2020-21:\nThe escalating situation has prompted patient groups to call for an urgent review of access to services, amid reports that patients are struggling to get through.\nDoncaster-based GP Dr Dean Eggitt has never seen anything like this: \"We have almost a tsunami of patients coming to us - it feels like the river has flooded the banks. \n\"It just keeps coming and coming and coming in this one massive, endless wave of patients who all are ill and need help and input. \n\"They're sick, they're complex and we've got very few places to send them. I wouldn't want to be my patient right now.\"\nDr Eggitt's experience is not unique. There were 28.4 million appointments in March, once you include those made with practice nurses as well as GPs - that is one of the highest on record.\nBut he says he worries most about the \"hidden wave of patients who don't get through\".\nOne of those is Sharron, who ended up in hospital after she struggled on at home for weeks getting more and more sick. She was eventually diagnosed with colitis and had lost so much blood, she needed four emergency blood transfusions.\nShe says a combination of busy phone lines and not wanting to bother the practice meant she deteriorated at home. \"When I finally got through I knew I was really poorly, I had never felt so ill in my life.\"\nShe was immediately invited in for a consultation and sent to hospital.\nThere could be millions of people in a similar position. There were 279 million appointments made with GP practices in England from April 2020 to March 2021, compared with 310 million the year before. \nThe biggest drops were seen in the Midlands, North East, Yorkshire and East of England, according to the Health Foundation analysis.\nThe data is not collected elsewhere in the UK, but the reports surfacing suggest the problems are similar. That has, the Health Foundation warns, created a huge amount of unmet need. \nThis much can be seen from the drop in urgent referrals where GPs suspect someone has cancer. The numbers sent to hospital for check-ups have dropped by 15% since the pandemic started - that's potentially 367,000 people with symptoms who have not been sent for further investigations.\nSara Bainbridge, from Macmillan Cancer Support, says the disruption to services has had a \"devastating impact\", saying it is leading to fewer diagnoses, and reducing survival chances.\nAnd it's not just cancer patients. Dr Becks Fisher, a GP in Oxford and senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation, says there are people with other serious conditions, such as heart failure and non-Covid respiratory problems, who have stayed away too.\n\"Their health will have deteriorated as they have not been getting the help they need. The people we are seeing now are coming in with really complex problems. And it is those in deprived areas who have been affected the most.\"\nShe says this is being compounded by a significant rise in people seeking help with mental health problems, as well as those \"ricocheting\" back from hospital because their health has worsened while waiting for treatment. \nLatest figures show there are more than 400,000 people who have been waiting over a year for routine treatment, such as knee and hip replacements - up from 1,600 when the pandemic began.\n\"I think we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg at the moment - this is going to get a lot worse in the coming months\" added Dr Fisher.\nOne of the key barriers, some say, is the lack of face-to-face care that is available. Social distancing restrictions and infection control procedures mean GPs have had to rely heavily on remote consultations.\nThe number of face-to-face consultations has dropped significantly - down from 79% of total appointments in 2019-20 to 54% in 2020-21. And even now with restrictions easing, the numbers being brought in are still well short of what they were.\nOne of those who has fallen foul of this is Helen Cowley, 55, from Swindon. She had a telephone consultation for ear pain and was advised to seek private treatment for the build-up of ear wax. When she got to the clinic, they diagnosed an ear infection and she had to phone her practice back.\n\"It was nearly two months before I got the proper treatment - and to be fair I thought it was ear wax too. It was obviously not the most serious problem in the world, but not being able to be seen face-to-face is not ideal. You can see how things can be missed and for some patients that may have huge consequences.\"\nPatient watchdog Healthwatch England is particularly concerned about the lack of face-to-face appointments, and is calling for an urgent review into the situation. \nNational Director Imelda Redmond said while remote consultations suit some patients, there are many who have struggled with the arrangements that have been put in place.\n\"Those affected are often the most vulnerable in our society - older people, disabled people, those affected by homelessness and on low incomes.\"\nThe issue has already prompted action at the highest level. NHS England wrote to GPs in mid-May saying patients must be offered face-to-face appointments if that is their preference, unless there was good reason not to, such as the patient displaying Covid symptoms. Extra funding has been provided too.\nBut the move has been met with some opposition from GP leaders who have raised concerns about the lack of space in GP practice buildings, with the British Medical Association's GPs committee even passing a motion of no confidence in NHS England. \nBMA GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey says doctors were left \"angry, frustrated and disappointed\" by the letter, especially given the \"incredible contribution\" GPs have made to the vaccination programme - around three-quarters of jabs have been given in GP-led settings.\nIn many ways, this is a problem that has been building for a while. There has been a big push in recent years by the government to increase the number of GPs to keep up with rising demand, but once you exclude locums and trainees the number of permanent GPs has actually fallen by nearly 2,000 in the past few years to just under 27,000 full-time GPs.\nProf Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says it means what is being asked of the profession now is simply \"undoable\". \n\"General practice was already facing intense workforce and workload pressures - the pandemic has only exacerbated these. We urgently need more GPs and other members of the practice team.\"\nAdditional reporting by Ruth Clegg\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick\nHave you been able to see your GP?

      "text": "A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has been approved for use in the UK by the medicines regulator.\nThe vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials and has met expected safety standards.\nTwenty million doses have been ordered for the UK and will arrive later this year.\nIt will be the fourth vaccine to be used in the UK to protect against Covid-19.\nMore than 38 million people have now received a first dose of a vaccine in the UK - nearly three-quarters of the adult population.\nThe vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures.\nThe UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) will produce advice on exactly who should receive the Belgian-made jab in due course.\nThe single-dose option has already been authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US and the World Health Organization (WHO).\nNadhim Zahawi, vaccine deployment minister, said the Janssen jab would be \"another weapon in our arsenal to beat this pandemic\".\n\"We are doing everything we can to vaccinate all adults as quickly as possible and I encourage everybody to come forward for a jab as soon as they are eligible.\"\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the approval was \"really good news\" but \"we're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible\", she said.\nOriginally, the UK ordered 30 million doses but reduced its order after the vaccination programme in the UK picked up pace.\nThe vaccine, developed by Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical arm, Janssen, uses the same technology as the Oxford-AstraZeneca one and is likely to be more suitable for older adults than younger people. Under-40s are being offered an alternative to AstraZeneca in the UK because of a potential link to a type of rare blood clot in the brain.\nBoth vaccines use a modified version of a different virus to deliver instructions to the body's cells to fire up the immune system and produce antibodies.\nSince the Janssen jab is given as one single dose, it could speed up rollout to vulnerable people in care homes and those living in remote locations.\nIt has not yet been tested against the variant first detected in India which is spreading fast in the UK, although at low levels.\nThe US, South Africa and the European Union briefly paused the rollout of the Janssen vaccine in April after reports of rare blood clots in very small numbers of people after their jab.\nThe US is now offering the vaccine to people over 18, after concluding that the benefits of using it outweighed any risks of side-effects. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) came to the same conclusion after looking at a potential link between the vaccine and clots.\nThe Janssen jab is currently being tested as part of a UK study to find out whether a third dose could protect against new variants.\nDr June Raine, head of the body which approves vaccines in the UK - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - said information on quality, safety and effectiveness of the Janssen jab had been thoroughly reviewed.\n\"We now have four safe and effective vaccines approved to help protect us from Covid-19,\" she said, adding that their work did not end there.\n\"We are continually monitoring all Covid-19 vaccines in use once they have been approved to ensure that the benefits in protecting people against the disease continue to outweigh any risks. \n\"The safety of the public will always come first - you can be absolutely sure of our commitment to this.\"\nThe MHRA said pregnant or breast-feeding women should decide whether to have the Janssen option in consultation with a healthcare professional after considering the benefits and risks.\nThere have been a further 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus and another 4,182 confirmed cases on Friday."

      "tags": "Companies,Obesity,Department of Health & Social Care,Hospitality industry,Restaurants,Food",
      "text": "Restaurants say plans to display the calorie content of food on menus in England should be delayed while the sector recovers from the pandemic.\nThere are fears that the move will add extra costs to businesses at a time when they are least able to afford it.\nThe new rules will affect restaurants, cafes and takeaways employing more than 250 people and are due to come in from April 2022.\nThe change is part of a drive by the UK government to tackle obesity.\nWith 11 restaurants, Mowgli Street Food's founder Nisha Katona says making the changes by next spring will mean a significant investment. \n\"It's thousands of pounds and weeks of work,\" she says. \"It's a shame for anyone to have to take on another cost right now.\" \nHowever, she supports the idea that people should take a greater interest in how many calories they consume when they eat out, and says her restaurant has already looked into displaying calories on its menus. \nDespite this, she believes it's crucial that ministers stick to the idea of only applying the new rules to larger businesses such as hers.\n\"Personally, I can see the value in it, and it's something my business will manage to do -  but it'll see the end of small restaurants if they're ever compelled to do it,\" she says.\nAnnouncing the plans, Public Health Minister Jo Churchill said they were intended \"to make it as easy as possible for people to make healthier food choices for themselves and their families, both in restaurants and at home\".\nThe government said that it would not affect small, independent businesses, which may find it harder to implement the changes. \nKate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UK Hospitality, says that while the industry shares the government's objectives in improving public health, the timing could prove difficult. \n\"The majority of operators are in survival mode,\" she says. \n\"We urge the government to consider delaying the implementation of any legislation rather than layering on new costs for businesses in a sector that has been hardest hit by the pandemic and risks prolonging their recovery and business' ability to invest and create jobs.\"\nThat's a view echoed by Nick Collins, chief executive of Loungers, who run the Lounge and Cosy Club chain of more than 140 caf\u00e9-bars. \n\"The timing really is dreadful,\" he says. Having only just been able to fully reopen, he says businesses like his are focused on their recovery and their staff - and a change like this will take time to implement. \n\"I support the objective of helping our customers eat more healthily,\" he says, \"but I'd like to see it put back. It's red tape we could really do without.\" \nA spokesperson from the Department for Health acknowledged the impact of Covid-19 on the hospitality sector, and pledged to \"work with businesses and local authorities to ensure the out of home calorie labelling regulations are implemented as smoothly as possible\".  \nSome High Street chains already publish information about the calorie content of their food on their menus, including Wetherspoons pubs and The Real Greek restaurants. \nBut others argue that the nature of their restaurants will make a change like this even more costly. \nRobin Hutson, chairman of The Pig hotels and restaurants, says his business cooks with fresh produce that changes on a daily basis - and thinks the plans show \"a crass lack of understanding from the government\".\nHe has eight venues across the South of England, with about 950 staff. \n\"High Street chains may never change their menus - but ours can change between lunch and dinner,\" he explains.\n\"Are we supposed to employ someone to update our menus all the time? It's just more financial pressure on an already embattled sector.\"\nFurthermore, he doesn't believe it's fundamentally a role restaurants should be talking on.\n\"What people eat and drink is down to them,\" he says. \"We should all be taking responsibility for ourselves.\"\nThe government estimates that overweight and obesity related conditions cost the NHS \u00a36.1bn each year, and data shows that almost two-thirds of adults in England are overweight or obese. \nA spokesperson for the Department of Health also pointed out the disproportionate effect Covid-19 has on people who are overweight, saying, \"it is more important than ever to help people across the country achieve a healthy weight\"."

      "text": "A woman has been found guilty of murdering her millionaire landlord in order to inherit part of his \u00a33.5m estate.\nAnthony Sootheran, 59, relied on care from Lynda Rickard who forged his will before killing him by depriving him of food and medical help.\nThe \"recluse\" died at his farm near South Newington, Oxfordshire, in 2014.\nRickard's husband Wayne, 66, was cleared of murder but found guilty of allowing or causing the death.\nThree of Mrs Rickard's friends were also found guilty of fraudulently signing forged wills. Sentencing will take place at Reading Crown Court on Tuesday.\nThe Rickards, from Banbury, were Mr Sootheran's live-in tenants.\nDuring the trial, the jury heard Mrs Rickard, 62, \"ruthlessly exploited\" Mr Sootheran and his mother, Joy Sootheran, who died in 2012.\nShe forged their wills and used tens of thousands of pounds of their money to satisfy her \"brazen greed\".\nBut half of Ms Sootheran's \u00a31.5m fortune was stopped from going to Mrs Rickard after people \"smelt a rat\".\nMrs Rickard then \"isolated and controlled\" her landlord while her husband failed to intervene.\nDuring the trial, consultant geriatrician Dr Peter Kroker said the millionaire lost a third of his body weight - 26kg (four stone) - in the last 15 months of his life.\nHe said he would have been reliant on other people after a fall in February 2014, but he had not eaten for at least 34 hours before his death.\nHe was found dead by a visiting doctor on 18 March 2014 at High Havens Farm, where he lived with the Rickards.\nA combination of malnutrition and a deep-seated pressure sore on Mr Sootheran's back led to a fatal lung infection, the court was told.\nMr Sootheran was described as a \"popular\" but \"complex\" man who suffered from episodes of poor mental health.\nUnable to cope with the birth of his daughter in 1988, he left the farm - where he lived with his family - for two weeks. Soon afterwards he moved out when the marriage broke down.\nIn 2008, he moved back into the farm along with his mother Joy to live with the Rickards, who had been there as tenants since 2006.\nHis forged will gave Mrs Rickard a third of the estate, which included the farm.\nRobbie Weber, senior crown prosecutor, said: \"Lynda Rickard is an inherently dishonest person. Cruel and ruthless to the extent which I've barely seen in my professional career.\n\"Had Anthony received medical attention in the week before his death, he would have survived.\n\"However, getting Anthony help was the last thing on Lynda Rickard's mind. She needed him to die in order to benefit from his fortune.\n\"This is a landmark case. This is the first time in 100 years that the Crown Prosecution Service has authorised an offence of murder by deliberate starvation, and in this case for financial gain, and therefore we hope that will set a precedent for future consideration of such cases.\"\nThe Rickards were also found guilty of fraudulently using Ms Sootheran's money to buy a Mitsubishi Shogun car.\nThree of Mrs Rickard's friends - Michael Dunkley, 49, from Banbury, Denise Neal, 41, of Lower Tysoe, Warwickshire, and Shanda Robinson, 51, from Banbury - were all found guilty of fraudulently signing forged wills. \nMr Rickard was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice by attempting to pass off a will as genuine, while Robinson was convicted of conspiring to do the same.\nAnother friend, June Alsford, 78, from Aynho, Northamptonshire, admitted fraud."

      "tags": "US gun violence,United States,California",
      "text": "An employee fatally shot nine people at a California train yard before turning the gun on himself as police closed in.\nThe shooting took place at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) site in San Jose.\nThe victims, named early on Thursday, include transit employees. No motive for the attack has been established.\nIt was the California Bay area's deadliest mass shooting since 1993, when eight people and a gunman died in a San Francisco skyscraper.\nAcross the US, there have been 231 mass shootings so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. A mass shooting is defined by the group as a crime in which four or more people are fatally shot.\nLaw enforcement officials told CBS News, the BBC's partner in the US, that the suspected gunman in this latest incident was 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy.\nAt a press conference on Thursday, VTA staff spoke about the victims, and the loss felt by VTA \"family\". \n\"Some of us get training on what to do when there is an active shooter event - but not about the aftermath,\" said  acting VTA CEO Evelynn Tran. \n\"I saw the immense pain of the families and I saw their faces when they got the news,\" she said. \"I felt immensely helpless.\"\nEight victims were initially reported dead on Wednesday afternoon. Mr Fritch, who had been taken to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in critical condition, died late on Wednesday bringing the total killed to nine.\nShots were first fired at around 06:30 local time (14:45 GMT) on Wednesday in the VTA light rail yard. According to a local CBS station, the attack unfolded during an employee meeting.  \nSanta Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez said that VTA employees had received active shooter training \"recently\". This training saved lives on Wednesday the sheriff's office told her. \nA spokesperson for Santa Clara County Sheriff's office told CBS said the shooter was still firing rounds when officers arrived at the scene. They added that sheriffs did not exchange gunfire with the gunman, and it is believed he took his own life as officers closed in on him.\nAmong the victims was Taptejdeep Singh, a light rail operator for the VTA. His cousin, Batta Singh, told the New York Times that Mr Singh was a gregarious man and the kindest person in his family. \nMr Singh had a wife and two young children, his cousin told the newspaper. Family members said that officials told them that Mr Singh tried to save his colleagues when the shooting began, calling out to alert his co-workers and ushering a woman into a secure room, the Times reported. \nMichael Rudometkin was a VTA union member, his family told the Washington Post. He was a \"wonderful son, brother, loving husband, uncle, cousin and friend to many\", his mother, Rose Rudometkin, said to the newspaper. \nPaul Peralez, who identified himself as a friend of \"Mikey\", posted a photo of him on Facebook, writing that he and his father had been planning a golf day with him.\n\"Now that will never happen again,\" Mr Peralez wrote. \"My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.\" \nAuthorities searched the VTA facility after a bomb-sniffing dog detected possible explosives at the site, though none were found.\nJeff Rosen, the county's district attorney, said the shooter used \"multiple guns\" - all of which had been registered.\nCassidy's ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, told the Associated Press news agency that he told her he wanted to kill his colleagues, but she had never believed he would do it.\nDoug Suh, a neighbour of Cassidy, told the Mercury News the gunman was \"lonely\" and \"strange\".\nJust before the shooting, a fire broke out at a home belonging to Cassidy, according to local media. Authorities say they are looking into whether the suspect may have set his home on fire.\nSanta Clara is the largest county in California's Bay Area and is home to Silicon Valley, America's technology industry hub. It encompasses several cities in Northern California including Cupertino, San Jose and Mountain View. \nThe Santa Clara VTA operates three train lines, making up over 40 miles (65km) of rail. It also runs dozens of bus lines.\n\"These folks were heroes during Covid-19... The VTA never stopped running,\" said Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez, according to CBS. \"They just kept at work, and now we're calling on them to be heroes a second time to survive such a terrible, terrible tragedy.\"\nSpeaking from near the crime scene, Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the \"rinse and repeat\" cycle of US mass shootings.\n\"What the hell is wrong with the United States of America?\" the Democrat said. \"When will we put down our arms?\" \nPresident Joe Biden called the attack a \"horrific tragedy\" and ordered flags to be flown at half mast as he again urged Congress to take action on gun control.\n\"Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation,\" he said. \"We can and we must do more.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson has expressed \"full confidence\" in Health Secretary Matt Hancock over claims he lied about protecting care homes from Covid.\nDominic Cummings says Mr Hancock misled the PM in March 2020 by promising that all residents in England discharged from hospital would be tested.\nThe PM's former aide says this led to thousands of needless deaths.\nMr Hancock has denied lying but said he had been clear that it would take time to build testing capacity.\n\"My recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for people going from hospital into care homes when we could do it,\" he told a Downing Street press conference on Thursday.\n\"I then went away and built the testing capacity\u2026 and then delivered on the commitment that I made.\"\nThe BBC understands acute concern was expressed in Downing Street about what was going wrong in care homes - and what was happening with testing - in the first week of May last year. \nIt is understood an urgent meeting was called to get to the bottom of what was going on.\nIn his testimony to a select committee on Wednesday, Mr Cummings said: \"We were told categorically in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We only subsequently found out that that hadn't happened.\n\"The government rhetoric was we put a shield around care homes - it was complete nonsense.\n\"Quite the opposite of putting a shield around them, we sent people with Covid back to the care homes.\"\nGovernment documents show there was no requirement to test patients being discharged from hospital into a care home until 15 April last year.\nAnd guidance dated 2 April said people without negative Covid tests could be discharged to care homes, but recommended they isolate in their own rooms.\nIn total, 127,758 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test for the disease, official figures show.\nOf these more than 42,000 - around a third - have happened in care homes in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nThe head of the National Care Association, Nadra Ahmed, told BBC One's Question Time the government's claim to have put a shield around homes was \"absolute rubbish\".\n\"There was no shield,\" she added. \n\"I think that was an utterance that came about in a form of embarrassment, perhaps, because nothing had been done for social care.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Cummings' testimony could not be \"the last word on this\", adding:  \"We need to get all the available evidence. I don't think the prime minister has made good decisions in this pandemic.\"\nBut a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The PM has full confidence in the health secretary and will continue working with him to protect public health and save lives.\"\nA Public Health England report, commissioned by the Department of Health, has concluded that the evidence suggests \"hospital associated seeding accounted for a small proportion of all care home outbreaks\" in England.\nIt said that, from 30 January to 12 October last year, 43,398 residents - from 5,882 separate outbreaks - had tested positive for Covid.\nSome 1.6% (97) of outbreaks were identified as stemming from hospital discharges.\nA total of 806 (1.2%) care home residents with confirmed infections were associated with these outbreaks, it added.\nMr Cummings left his job as Mr Johnson's chief adviser last autumn following a power struggle within No 10."

      "tags": "Belarus,Russia,Air travel,Air France KLM",
      "text": "Russia's foreign ministry has condemned the EU's call for Europe-based airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace, calling it completely irresponsible.\nSpokeswoman Maria Zakharova, commenting after Russia had denied entry to two airlines that planned to avoid Belarus, said passenger safety was at risk.\nEU leaders had acted after Belarus forced a Ryanair plane to divert and land in the capital, Minsk.\nA Belarusian dissident journalist and his girlfriend were then arrested.\nRoman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, who is a Russian citizen, are both in jail. A court on Friday rejected her appeal against a two-month detention.\nThe EU's 27 leaders met this week and demanded their immediate release, as has the G7 group of nations.\nThe UN's civil aviation agency has said it will launch a \"fact-finding\" investigation into Belarus's actions, and whether there had been any breach of international aviation law.\nNo reason was given for Moscow's decision to refuse access to flights from Air France and Austrian Airlines, but an Air France spokesperson said Russia's requirement of a \"new authorisation\" was linked to the airline bypassing Belarusian airspace.\nOn Friday, Russia's aviation authority allowed entry to several European airlines bypassing Belarus, including Austrian Airlines, although Air France did cancel another Paris-Moscow flight. The aviation agency warned that airlines that changed routes might have to await longer clearance times.\nRussia is Belarus's biggest ally and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko arrived in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Friday for talks with President Vladimir Putin.\nIt is their third meeting this year.\nUp till now Alexander Lukashenko has been masterful at playing on the Kremlin's fears and phobias of the West, presenting himself as Russia's first line of defence against alleged external threats. Claiming - without proof - that Nato, the US, Europe are plotting to gobble up Belarus, and then move on to Russia. \nSo, in the face of Western sanctions, in Sochi he will expect President Putin to back him politically and, crucially, financially. Especially since Russia and Belarus are, on paper at least, part of a union state.\nBut although the two men are political allies, close friends they are not. There have been plenty of squabbles in the past. For years Moscow has been irritated by Mr Lukashenko's attempts to play Russia off against the West. The Kremlin views him as something of a loose cannon. \nAfter the Ryanair jet drama and the arrest of two passengers, it's unclear what message the leader of Russia will be sending to the leader of Belarus. \nThe foreign ministry spokeswoman denounced EU leaders for deciding to \"redraw the routes of hundreds of flights in a single day, creating colossal problems for its citizens\".\nAustria's foreign ministry said Russia's actions against the airline on Thursday had been \"absolutely incomprehensible\".\nOn Friday, the rules were relaxed as Austrian Airlines flight OS601 from Vienna was given permission to land in Moscow,.\nAmong the EU's immediate measures is a ban on Belarusian airlines over the airspace of its 27 member states. Ukraine is also banning Belarus-registered planes from its airspace from Saturday, having halted flights to and from Belarus.\nFurther sanctions are still being assessed on officials in Mr Lukashenko's government and Belarusian economic sectors in particular.\nAfter meeting exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya in The Hague, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it was time to target sectors \"connected to the regime - and that is crucial because we have to hit these people in the wallet\".\nBelarus will lose out on millions of dollars a year in over-flight fees as a result of European airlines avoiding its airspace. \nThe EU measures have also hit Belarus carrier Belavia, which has now cancelled 16 European routes. \nThe BBC's Sarah Rainsford described lengthy queues outside Belavia offices in Minsk on Thursday as Belarusians scrambled to get ticket refunds.\nIn a separate move, the European Broadcasting Union said it was suspending Belarus state TV and radio, blaming suppression of media freedom. The company has two weeks to respond. Belarus was disqualified from this month's Eurovision song contest, organised by the EBU, for lyrics seen as targeting anti-government protesters. \nOn Sunday, Ryanair Flight 4978 was travelling from Athens to Vilnius, when it was forcibly diverted to Minsk. A fighter jet was scrambled to ensure it changed course.\nBelarus authorities said they had received a bomb threat, but according to Swiss secure email provider Proton Mail the emailed message was sent after the plane was diverted.\nAboard were Mr Protasevich, 26, who lives in exile in Lithuania, and his girlfriend, Ms Sapega, 23, an international law student. They were arrested as passengers disembarked the plane.\nMr Protasevich was put on the Belarus terrorist list last year, and faces serious charges.\nOn Thursday, Mr Protasevich was able to see his lawyer, Inesa Alenskaya, for the first time. \"All is well, he is vigorous, positive and cheerful, there is nothing to worry about,\" she was quoted as saying.\nRussia's foreign ministry says Ms Sapega is accused of breaking Belarusian law in August and September of 2020. Her lawyer said he had promised the court not to give details of the criminal case against her.\nVideos were released showing the pair confessing to crimes, but it is likely they were speaking under duress.\nTheir arrests and the forced landing of the plane have prompted international outrage.\n\"We must have measures to ensure that can't happen again,\" the head of the International Air Transport Association, Willie Walsh, told Reuters.\nThe head of Lithuania's criminal police bureau, Rolandas Kiskis, told reporters that the Ryanair crew and 90% of the passengers who had arrived in Vilnius had been questioned about their ordeal. His team were working with other European investigators, he said.\nWhere is Belarus? It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.\nWhy does it matter? Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed \"Europe's last dictator\" - he has been in power for 27 years.\nWhat's going on there? There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile."

But Twitter has declined to confirm her claims.\nThe social media giant told the BBC that increasing \"revenue durability\" is the company's top objective.\nThe firm also plans to continue developing and experimenting with other ways to diversify its revenues beyond advertising this year and further ahead.\nThese plans could also include subscription services and other ways to offer individuals and businesses access to special features on the platform.\nTwitter has also made clear that it will continue to focus on growing its advertising business.\nLast month, the company launched a new \"tip jar\" feature that allowed people to send money to others on the social network.\nTwitter said the feature was \"an easy way to support the incredible voices that make up the conversation\".\nTo begin with, only a select group of people can receive tips - a group Twitter said was made up of \"creators\", journalists, experts, and non-profits.\nThe function adds a small icon to a user's profile - on mobile devices only for now - with a drop-down menu for other payment providers such as PayPal, Venmo, or the Cash App, the latter two of which are popular in the United States.\nBut the announcement was not without controversy. Because the payment is made through those external systems, some Twitter users noticed that tipping a PayPal account lets the recipient know the postal address of the tip sender.\nIn other cases, the recipient's email address could be seen, whether or not any money was sent.\nReporting by Peter Hoskins.\nFacebook and Twitter's chief executives were asked during a US Senate hearing in November if there was evidence of their platforms being addictive."

      "text": "People and businesses in Glasgow are expected to find out later whether the city will remain in level three of Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions.\nGlasgow has been subject to strict measures for 270 days, while the rest of the country has seen restrictions ease in recent weeks. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said there are \"reasons to be optimistic\" about the situation in the city. \nGlasgow business owners say they need clarity on when they can fully reopen.\nAnd opposition parties have called for urgent action to get Glasgow back on a level footing with the rest of the country as quickly as possible.\nThe first minister is expected to announce the result of a review of restrictions in a Covid-19 briefing at 12:15.\nPublic health expert Prof Linda Bauld told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"Things do look like they are stabilising in Glasgow.\n\"I think what makes it different from last year is that it does seem that most of the infections are in younger adults. \n\"It is not translating through yet into high numbers of people in hospital and that is because fewer older people are becoming infected.\"   \nThere continues to be concern about the rate of new infections in Glasgow, which is largely being driven by the variant of the virus that was first detected in India. \nThe city is still under level three restrictions - meaning people cannot travel in or out of the city without a good reason or go into each other's houses, and hospitality businesses are subject to tighter controls.\nEvery other area of Scotland is either in level two or level one.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs on Thursday that she wants to get the city back on track \"as quickly as possible, but that's got to be done responsibly and safely\".\nBut she said she would continue to make \"careful, cautious\" decisions on the path back to normality.\nThe first minister said: \"I know how difficult it is for residents and businesses across Glasgow, but I also know how dangerous it would be if we eased restrictions too quickly and allowed a new variant of this virus, that we know is spreading perhaps even more quickly than the variant at the start of the year, to take a grip again.\n\"That's why there are the public health interventions under way across Glasgow right now. \n\"I said earlier in the week we see cautious signs for optimism that that is working, and we will continue to monitor that very carefully.\"\nOne city bar and restaurant owner - Colin Clydesdale, who is the co-owner of premises including Ubiquitous Chip, Stravaigin and Hanoi Bike Shop - said the upcoming bank holiday weekend was \"essential\" for the hospitality industry.\nHe said many businesses had been \"effectively shut since October\", but said reopening for the long weekend would be \"the wee jolt in the arm\" the sector needs.\nHe said: \"We've got the bank holiday which will bring income, income is exactly what this industry needs so rather than leaving it to the last minute, tell us in advance either way because at the moment we're trying to second-guess the scenario and no-one's got a clue.\n\"If the figures are stacking up and it looks like they're going to allow us to open, then give us as much notice as humanly possible - 17:45 on a Friday is not enough.\"\nJonathan MacDonald, owner of the Ox and Finch and Ka Pao in Glasgow, said he was generally supportive of restrictions, but said some had been \"really arbitrary\".\nHe said: \"We'd like some notice of changes. Ministers have shown a real lack of thought really in not allowing people to plan.\n\"Throughout the whole pandemic we have had to be really nimble. At every stage we have always found out that we are closing in a matter of days or not able to sell alcohol, so we have been massively reliant on furlough.\"\nOn Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon suggested that vaccination could \"break the link\" between rising infections and the number of people seriously ill in hospital.\nShe said this could see a change in strategy from the current efforts to drive case numbers as low as possible with harsh restrictions, to one where outbreaks are controlled with public health measures such as testing and tracing.\nHowever opposition parties have urged her to accelerate plans to ease curbs in the city.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Glasgow firms had been \"struggling to survive\" under the current restrictions, saying the government's approach to business needed a \"complete overhaul\".\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said there needed to be \"urgent action that gives a proper route map, an exit plan, for the city of Glasgow\", warning that trust between public and politicians could break down.\nHe said: \"I think there is a real risk that that level of communication and public trust and confidence is at risk of breaking in terms of what is happening in the city of Glasgow.\""

      "text": "The US has told Russia it will not rejoin an arms control deal that permits unarmed aerial flights over dozens of participating countries.\nThe state department said the Open Skies Treaty \"has been undermined by Russia's violations\" and its failure to return to compliance.\nRussia denies the allegations, and the country is also expected to withdraw from the treaty this year.\nThe accord allows short-notice flights to monitor military activity.\nMore than 30 nations participate in the treaty which came into force in 2002.\n\"The United States regrets that the Treaty on Open Skies has been undermined by Russia's violations,\" the state department said on Thursday. \n\"In concluding its review of the treaty, the United States therefore does not intend to seek to rejoin it, given Russia's failure to take any actions to return to compliance.\nUnder Donald Trump's presidency Washington withdrew from the treaty. As a presidential candidate, Joe Biden called the move short-sighted. \nAmerica's Thursday announcement means only one major arms control treaty between the two nuclear powers remains in place - the New Start treaty. It sets limits on deployments of strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems.\nThe announcement also comes as President Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are preparing for a summit in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 June."

      "tags": "Children,Toys,NHS",
      "text": "An online trend that involves using tiny magnets as fake tongue piercings has led the NHS to call for them to be banned amid people swallowing them.\nIngesting more than one of them can be life-threatening and cause significant damage within hours.\nIn England, 65 children have required urgent surgery after swallowing magnets in the last three years.\nThe NHS issued a patient safety alert earlier this month and is now calling for the small metal balls to be banned.\nIt said the \"neodymium or 'super strong' rare-earth magnets are sold as toys, decorative items and fake piercings, and are becoming increasingly popular\". \nIt added that unlike traditional ones, \"these 'super strong' magnets are small in volume but powerful in magnetism and easily swallowed\".\nThe online trend sees people placing two such magnets on either side of their tongue to create the illusion that the supposed piercing is real.\nBut when accidentally swallowed, the small magnetic ball bearings are forced together in the intestines or bowels, squeezing the tissue so that the blood supply is cut off.\nProf Simon Kenny, paediatric surgeon and national clinical director for children and young people at NHS England, said accidental swallowing of them can cause \"long-term physical problems and internal scarring\".\n\"There is nothing fun for children or their parents about surgery to remove magnets that have been swallowed and become stuck together through different parts of the intestines,\" he said.\n\"I would urge parents to be aware of the dangers associated with magnetic toys but ultimately, the only way we can prevent future incidents is to stop these items being sold altogether.\"\nAccording to the NHS, there has been a rise in hospital admissions among older children as teenagers create videos using the magnets on social media.\nUnlike traditional magnets, the ones used for such tricks are less than 6mm in diameter and can be easily swallowed.\nNatasha Crookes, of the British Toy and Hobby Association, said: \"The BTHA believes the law should change to classify these types of products as toys so they have to meet strict toy safety regulations.\n\"That would mean a change in design to ensure the magnets are covered by a casing too large to swallow.\"\nThe NHS cited the case of 18-month-old twins who both recently ingested magnets that had been bought as toys for their older siblings.\nA scan revealed one of the twins had swallowed 23 of them which closed into a loop in his intestines and required emergency surgery at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.\nThe other child had swallowed four and needed keyhole surgery to remove them.\nBoth boys have since recovered.\nThe NHS has urged people not to wait for symptoms if magnets are swallowed and said they should seek help at A&E immediately."

      "tags": "Black Lives Matter,US race relations",
      "text": "Black Lives Matter's co-founder says she is resigning from its foundation, but not because of what she called right-wing attempts to discredit her.\nPatrisse Cullors said Friday would be her last day at the foundation, which she has led for nearly six years.\nThe 37-year-old activist's finances came under scrutiny last month after it was reported she owned four homes.\nBlack Lives Matter started as a hashtag in 2013 and has since become a global movement.\nMs Cullors said she would step down from the Black Lives Matter Global Network to focus on her forthcoming second book, An Abolitionist's Handbook, and a TV development deal with Warner Bros highlighting black stories.  \nIn a statement, she said: \"With smart, experienced and committed people supporting the organization during this transition, I know that BLMGNF is in good hands. \n\"The foundation's agenda remains the same - eradicate white supremacy and build life-affirming institutions.\"\nMs Cullors told the AP news agency her resignation had been planned for more than a year and was not related to claims that she had misused donations to acquire her property portfolio. There is no evidence to suggest that she had done so. \n\"Those were right-wing attacks that tried to discredit my character, and I don't operate off of what the right thinks about me,\" she said.\nThe BLM Foundation told AP in February that it had raised $90m (\u00a363m) amid last year's racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nThe foundation said it ended 2020 with a balance of more than $60m, after operating expenses, grants to black-led organisations and other expenses.\nLast month the New York Post reported that Ms Cullors - a self-described Marxist - had bought a $1.4m luxury home in Topanga Canyon, near Malibu, and owned three other homes, including a custom ranch in Georgia.\nFacebook banned users from sharing the story, citing privacy concerns, and a black journalist said he was locked out of his Twitter account after he posted the article.\nConservative critics - but also some black activists - called for an investigation into whether Ms Cullors had used the organisation's funds to enrich herself.\nIn April the foundation said that Ms Cullors had received $120,000 between 2013 and 2019 for her work.\nThe Black Lives Matter Foundation said in a statement: \"As a registered 501c3 non-profit organization, [the foundation] cannot and did not commit any organizational resources toward the purchase of personal property by any employee or volunteer. \n\"Any insinuation or assertion to the contrary is categorically false.\"\nMs Cullors appeared to hold back tears as she told the Black News Channel last month that suggestions of financial impropriety against her were \"categorically untrue and incredibly dangerous\".\nThe grieving parents of Michael Brown and Breonna Taylor - two African Americans whose deaths at the hands of white police officers were often cited by Black Lives Matter - last month reportedly complained the organisation had done nothing to help them."

He was told the trial could last three weeks.\nHe will also attend a plea and trial preparation hearing on 23 July.\nThe court was told that the crown was yet to \"particularise the indictment\" in relation to the accusation of controlling and coercive behaviour.\nMr Giggs, who is accused of using violence, isolation, belittling, humiliation, harassment, degradation and abuse, previously issued a statement saying he would \"look forward to clearing my name\".\nHe has also been charged with common assault by beating of Ms Greville's younger sister, Emma Greville, in the alleged same incident, which he also denies.\nHis honour judge Nicholas Dean QC, honorary recorder of Manchester, said there were three weeks available for the trial but added: \"I very much hope that this case will not last that amount of time, but that'll be discussed further on the next occasion this case is listed.\"\nMr Giggs was bailed until his court appearance in July.\nThe Football Association of Wales (FAW) announced caretaker boss Robert Page will manage the country at this summer's European Championship finals."
