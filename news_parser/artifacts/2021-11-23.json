      "text": "A BBC investigation has uncovered a black market in highly polluting greenhouse gases being smuggled into the UK from Eastern Europe.  \nThe gases - hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) - are advertised and sold illegally via social media and the BBC found a trader suggesting smuggling them on coaches.\nHFCs are widely used in fridges, air conditioning and aerosol sprays.\nThe EU and UK are limiting their use and want to eventually phase them out in favour of cleaner alternatives.  \nBut older machinery still runs on the most polluting HFCs - which has led to a black market worth millions.\nUK law states only registered companies can import, sell or use HFCs; and buyers must show an F-Gas (fluorinated gas) certificate, otherwise no sale would be allowed. \nThe BBC's investigation began at the Romania-Ukraine border, where HFCs made in China have been smuggled through in the boots of cars or in lorries.\nWe found scores of online adverts posted by local traders offering the gases for sale and met one trader, called \"George\", who said he could get large quantities of HFCs.\nAfter directing us to a quiet country road near the border crossing, he opened the boot of his car to reveal two canisters containing HFCs.\nHe offered them for roughly \u00a3100 each. They sell on the UK's illicit market for up to \u00a3240.\nTo get the gases into the UK, he suggested smuggling them in the luggage compartments of passenger coaches that leave from the local bus station.\nHe said he previously sent 70 or 80 at a time to Germany using this method - it was just a question of finding the right driver and paying them.\nHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were developed as alternatives to ozone-depleting chemicals, which were banned under a global 1987 agreement known as the Montreal Protocol.\nThe deal banned the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were gradually replaced by HFCs.\nHFCs are man-made, colourless and odourless.\nThey are mainly used in air conditioning, industrial chillers and fridges and can also be found in some aerosol propellants and fire protection fluids.\nBut they are powerful greenhouse gases, with some HFC blends thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide.\nScientists previously discovered HFCs contribute to global warming by trapping heat radiating off the Earth.\nThe UK aims to reduce the use of HFCs by 69% by 2024.\nFin Walravens, a senior campaigner for the Environmental Investigation Agency, which investigates and campaigns against environmental crime, said the illegal HFCs trade was one most people knew nothing about - but the \"huge profits\" on offer made it \"very attractive\" to criminals.\nBottles made and filled with the gases for under \u00a330 in China can sell in the UK for more than \u00a3200.\nMs Walravens urged customs and enforcement agencies to recognise that while HFCs might be invisible gases, they had \"a huge impact on global warming\".\nMihai Stoica, executive director of Romanian environmental campaign group 2Celsius, called for the authorities to work together to urgently stop the trade.\n\"I think this should have happened yesterday, we need to do as much as we can as quickly as possible.\"\nDespite the efforts of the authorities, the illegal HFC bottles are distributed across the EU and into the UK.\nThe BBC found them openly advertised for sale on Facebook marketplace across the country.\nWe contacted one seller in North London. He was not registered to handle the gases and offered them for sale in disposable canisters - which have been outlawed since 2006.\nThe illegal HFCs trade was estimated to make up between 20% and 30% of the whole European market, according to a July report by the EIA.\nRob Parker, European operations director for established supplier A-Gas, said the illegal HFCs trade was sometimes viewed as a \"victimless crime because it looks like nobody gets hurt\".\n\"But the profits from this will almost certainly be going back into organised crime where they'll be used for much darker activities,\" he added.\n\"Ultimately, more global warming can take place because the regulation hasn't been upheld.\"\nA spokeswoman for the UK's Environment Agency (EA) said: \"We are firmly committed to ensuring that businesses comply with regulations to reduce emissions from HFCs, and will take strict enforcement action where necessary.\"\nIn September, the EA fined a company more than \u00a31m for breaching F-gas regulations - exceeding the quotas of what it was allowed to put on the market.\nIt was only the second time the EA had ever imposed fines on a UK company for breaking the regulations."

      "tags": "Eddie Redmayne,Film,LGBT,Transgender people",
      "text": "Actor Eddie Redmayne has said playing a transgender character in 2015 film The Danish Girl was \"a mistake\".\nThe British star was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Lile Elbe, one of the first people in the world to have gender reassignment surgery. \nThe film was praised by some at the time but others felt a trans actor should have been cast in the role.\n\"No, I wouldn't take it on now. I made that film with the best intentions, but I think it was a mistake,\" he said.\n\"The bigger discussion about the frustrations around casting is because many people don't have a chair at the table,\" Redmayne told The Sunday Times.\n\"There must be a levelling, otherwise we are going to carry on having these debates.\"\nThe Danish Girl was released months after Redmayne won the Oscar for best actor for playing Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.\nAt the time, the star admitted there had been \"years of cisgender success on the back of trans stories\" and said he hoped more trans actors could play trans parts in the future.\nBut he added that any actor \"should be able to play any sort of part if one plays it with a sense of integrity and responsibility\".\nThe following year, after being criticised for appearing to suggest that The Danish Girl had helped bring trans issues to mainstream attention, he said it was \"an honour to be part of this conversation in some small way\" and that he was \"an ally of the trans community\".\nIn response to his latest comments, a spokesperson for trans charity Gendered Intelligence said trans representation on screen had \"come on leaps and bounds\" since The Danish Girl was released and \"a consensus is being reached that trans actors for trans roles should be de rigueur\".\nThey said: \"Not only does this help abate the possibility of telling our stories in unnecessarily denigrating ways, but the authenticity of trans actors playing trans parts means stories are being told in a more meaningful way for actors and viewers alike.\n\"We're increasingly hopeful that stories about and for trans people can be told by those actors themselves, with more diverse talent both on screen and behind the camera.\"\nRedmayne, who starred in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, also backed members of the trans community after author JK Rowling posted tweets taking issue with the phrase \"people who menstruate\".\n\"I disagree with Jo's comments. Trans women are women, trans men are men and non-binary identities are valid,\" the actor said in a statement.\nHe also later criticised the \"vitriol\" she faced and acknowledged the abuse aimed towards trans people online was \"equally disgusting\".\nRedmayne is currently starring alongside Jessie Buckley in a new production of Cabaret at London's Playhouse Theatre.\nThe actor's casting as The Emcee, a role that has often been played by LGBTQ+ actors since it first premiered on Broadway in 1966, has also attracted criticism.\n\"Of all the characters I've ever read, this one defies pigeonholing. I would ask people to come and see it before casting judgment,\" Redmayne told The Sunday Times."

Your kindness and decency made all the difference to my family and me. \n\"I implore those people who retweeted the image with the address still visible, even if they did so in condemnation of these people's actions, to delete it.\"\nRowling sparked controversy in June 2020 for posting tweets which took issue with the phrase \"people who menstruate\" - she objected to the avoidance of the use of the word \"women\".\nIn a lengthy blog post, the writer of the Harry Potter books said her interest in trans issues stemmed from being a survivor of abuse and having concerns around single-sex spaces.\nCritics said her views \"diminished the identity\" of trans people, while stars from the Harry Potter films, including Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, distanced themselves from her comments.\nThe author described the actions of the group which posted the picture displaying her address as \"doxxing\" - the malicious act of publishing personal information online.\nRowling said she believed the activists had attempted to \"intimidate\" her out of \"speaking up for women's sex-based rights\". \nShe said: \"They should have reflected on the fact that I've now received so many death threats I could paper the house with them, and I haven't stopped speaking out. \n\"Perhaps - and I'm just throwing this out there - the best way to prove your movement isn't a threat to women, is to stop stalking, harassing and threatening us.\"\nA Police Scotland spokesman said: \"We are aware of this incident and police inquiries are ongoing.\"\nOne of the people who was involved wrote on Facebook: \"Yesterday we posted a picture we took at JK Rowling's house.\"\nThe post, which has now been deleted, added: \"While we stand by the photo, since posting it we have received an overwhelming amount of serious and threatening transphobic messages so have decided to take the photo down.\""

(The first \u00a320,000 of someone's assets is protected under the proposals).\nHowever, someone with a \u00a3500,000 house would be left with \u00a3414,000 after reaching the cap - leaving them about 83% of the value.\nFurther changes to the cap were announced last week. \nThe government said:\nSo, if someone's care costs \u00a3860 a week and they are meeting the cost themselves, it would take 100 weeks to hit the cap.\nHowever, if the same person receives council help it would take longer than 100 weeks.\nThat means poorer people receiving means-tested help will make contributions from their own money for longer.\nSally Warren, director of policy at The King's Fund health charity said \"These changes will mean that the people who need the most protection from catastrophically high care costs - those with low to moderate levels of wealth - will get less protection than wealthier people.\" \nThe government, however, says it wants to ensure people get support but are not unfairly reaching the cap at an artificially faster rate than others. \nThe cap doesn't cover living costs, like rent, food and utility bills. The guidance says people will have to meet these costs \"including after they reach the cap\".\nThe government has confirmed living costs will be up to \u00a3200 a week.\nTen years ago, an independent review by Sir Andrew Dilnot proposed a lifetime cap of \u00a335,000 for social care costs - but this was not introduced.\nSir Andrew said the changes the government was now introducing were \"a significant step forward\".\nBut he said the move would not stop the less well-off facing \"catastrophic costs\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nFront-line NHS workers (with some exceptions) in England must be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job. However, ministers are meeting to decide whether or not to scrap the requirement. Around 77,000 NHS staff are unvaccinated and some argue that going ahead with mandatory vaccinations would lead to a staffing crisis.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "title": "Covid: Can UK avoid a Europe-style return to lockdown?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid infection rates have started rising sharply in parts of Western Europe, prompting the introduction of fresh restrictions and lockdowns.\nIt has triggered fears the UK could follow suit. But there are plenty of reasons to believe Britain will escape the worst of what is being seen on the continent. In fact, the UK may well be in the strongest position of all to weather Covid this winter.\nTo understand why that could be the case, you need to look at the reasons why cases have started to take off in Western Europe.\nUnlike the UK - and England in particular - many parts of Europe kept major restrictions in place for much longer.\nWhereas England fully unlocked in mid-July, parts of Europe did not do this until the autumn, and in many places kept tougher restrictions in place even as they did. \nPart of this was to do with timing. The UK was hit by the more infectious Alpha variant and then Delta sooner, meaning it was in a position to push ahead with unlocking before others.\nBut it was also a conscious choice backed by the government's top scientists, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance.\nThe logic - along with the benefit of ending restrictions that themselves cause harm to health -  was that it was better to have the rebound in infection, the so-called exit wave, in the summer.\nIt was felt the increase in the spread of the virus would be mitigated by the better weather, meaning more time spent outdoors, and would avoid the winter crunch when pressure on the health system increases across the board.\nThe UK has, in effect, already had the wave the rest of Europe is seeing and has managed to avoid being swamped by it.\nThat is mainly because of the amount of immunity built up.\nA combination of good vaccine rollout, particularly among the older more vulnerable groups who are the ones most at risk of serious illness, and natural immunity from infection means there is likely to be a much smaller pool of vulnerable people for the virus to infect.\nResearchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been trying to quantify this by looking at what would happen if everyone was suddenly exposed to the virus in one go.\nThey modelled this for England - although there is nothing to suggest Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be any different - and 18 other European nations.\nIf this hypothetical situation happened, England would have by far the fewest people ending up in hospital - 62 per 100,000 people - because of immunity built up by vaccination and infection. That compares with more than 300 in Germany, largely because of their lower levels of infection to date, and more than 800 in Romania, which has struggled to convince its public to come forward for vaccination.\nThis was the picture at the end of October. If the same analysis was done at the end of November it is likely the situation would be even more favourable for England, says lead researcher Dr Lloyd Chapman.\nThat's because the UK is ploughing ahead faster than other nations with boosters. Again part of this is related to timing. As the UK was quicker off the mark with Covid vaccinations initially, there are greater numbers of people becoming eligible for a booster.\n\"We are giving those boosters to the very people who are most at risk at perhaps the best time - they will have the best protection in winter.\"\nBut Dr Chapman also points out this has come at a price - the high rates of infection have resulted in a greater amount of serious illness and death in recent months than many of our Western European neighbours.\nAnd he adds the research should not be seen as a guarantee we will escape the winter without seeing a surge in cases. \"We may be in the strongest position - but we could still see cases double and that would cause problems.\"\nBut is that likely? What is perhaps most remarkable about the UK is just how stable infection levels have been. Ever since the sharp rise seen in early summer peaked in mid-July, infection rates have bobbled along, small rises being followed by similar drops.\nThere is no other part of Europe that has seen Covid infections held so stable with very few restrictions in place.\nInstead, when other nations have seen cases surge restrictions have tended to be reimposed. This is happening now in parts of Western Europe and follows on from what happened in Eastern Europe early in the autumn.\nRomania, for example, saw a sharp rise in cases in September and October and reacted by introducing a night curfew, sending children home from school and introducing health passes for access to public venues.\nIt is telling that those nations that have had the most problems as winter arrives are the ones identified by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having the greatest pool of vulnerable people. How far this pattern spreads across Europe remains to be seen.\nBut immunity alone does not explain why the UK, and in particular England, has seen such stable rates, says Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the government's infectious disease modelling group.\nProf Medley, speaking in a personal capacity, believes it is more complex than that. \"I think we are seeing the public playing an important role.\"\nHe says a combination of limiting mixing and frequent use of rapid tests, which are more easy to access here than in many other countries, seems to be doing just enough to keep the virus in check.\n\"The government has passed the risk management to the public - and we've been able to do that better than other countries.\" \nThe big question is whether that will last throughout winter - Scotland and Northern Ireland are already talking about the possibility of tightening of restrictions. Prof Medley says it is \"delicately\" balanced, but with every passing week the chances are getting better.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "Pitch invaders versus both New Zealand and South Africa; a boy given \u00a320 after having beer spilled on him in the Fiji match; a young fan vomited over while watching Australia.\nThis season's four Wales rugby autumn internationals have made headlines for the wrong reasons as much as they have for the games themselves. \nIt has led Cardiff's Principality Stadium to be branded \"the world's biggest pub\" by journalist Peter Jackson.\nBut how serious is the drinking issue in rugby? \nLiver specialist Dr Dai Samuel said \"the halo of rugby has well and truly slipped this autumn\", while the Institute of Alcohol Studies (IAS) called for an end to the \"cosy relationship\" between alcohol and rugby.\n\"The normalisation of heavy drinking in relation to sport is at odds with the health benefits of participating in sport,\" said IAS head of research Dr Sadie Boniface.\nFormer Wales second row Ian Gough said most fans just wanted a \"social beer\" at games, and will drink responsibly. But he urged a clampdown on the \"loose cannons\" in groups who went \"over the top\".\nThe latest incident, in Saturday's victory over Australia, saw a six-year-old left \"in floods of tears\" after he was vomited on. \nJoey's mother Sophie Delaney, from Chepstow, Monmouthshire, said the sick was \"all over the back of him, his coat, over me and on the floor\", with the perpetrator too drunk to even acknowledge it.\nThe Welsh Rugby Union said it \"was sorry to hear about the family's experience\".\n\"In excess of 275,000 fans have attended the autumn nations series games and the vast majority of fans enjoy themselves in a responsible and considerate way,\" a spokesman said.\n\"It is policy for our staff to intervene if people are visibly intoxicated - this happens in three main areas: The turnstiles where people can be denied entry, at the point of sale if they try and buy alcohol, and in the stadium bowl.\"\nReports of alcohol-related issues date back a number of years and in autumn 2017, Supt Mark Cleland of British Transport Police, said: \"Always a disappointment to review the post-incident crime and see that yet again rugby fans were worse than football fans in Cardiff this weekend with their post-Wales v New Zealand drunken violent behaviour.\"\nIn football, alcohol cannot be sold within sight of the ground 15 minutes before or after the game. \n\"I wonder why we haven't extended the alcohol ban to all sporting grounds?\" asked IAS policy officer Habib Kadiri.\n\"Perhaps it is because no other sports have attained football's notoriety. But why risk it?\"\nDr Samuel, of the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant, said: \"If we think rugby union fans are above football fans then I think you have to have a hard look at the mirror because people don't behave like this in general any more and if you can't go without a pint for 40 minutes there clearly is something wrong.\"\nDescribing the Principality Stadium as \"unique\", he said its city centre location meant fans could go straight from the pub to their seat and start drinking again.\n\"It's worrying that the whole atmosphere and concept of what an international match means now heavily involves alcohol and very often doesn't involve enjoying a game of rugby,\" he said on BBC Radio Wales.\nIncidents in Cardiff include a disabled fan being abused during the Wales-New Zealand game in November 2017. A year later, the WRU introduced an alcohol-free zone, with 4,200 dry seats. \nGough, who won 64 caps for Wales, said such provisions were important to segregate \"families from the groups of partying lads\", describing Saturday's incident as \"horrific\".\n\"I take my children to games and you don't expect or want that to happen,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\n\"I remember as a 15, 16-year-old going to the East Terrace in the old stadium and being weed on and that wasn't a nice experience.\n\"It's something that does need to be addressed but again it needs to be a balance - if someone is too drunk then they're told they have to leave.\"\nHe wants stronger enforcement against those drinking to excess, saying \"a lot of people would be very opposed\" to not being able to enjoy a match day pint.\nThis season, a man dressed in a New Zealand kit was able to get on to the turf and join the team's line-up for the anthem. \nThen, against South Africa, a spectator was tackled by stewards after running on to the pitch, and was later given a community resolution by police.\nFor the Fiji match, a man described how supporters spilled beer all over his son.\nHowever, as they were leaving, one of their friends gave the youngster \u00a320 as he wanted things \"put right\".\nDr Boniface, of the IAS, said alcohol marketing meant it was \"virtually unavoidable in sport\". \n\"For example, in the 2020 Six Nations, there were alcohol references several times a minute. There is a link between alcohol sponsorship in sports and alcohol consumption, including among children and young people,\" she added.\n\"Some organisations like Scottish women's football are leading the way by no longer accepting sponsorship from alcohol companies.\"\nShe wants similar legislation in the UK to Ireland, which has banned alcohol advertising during sporting events.\nWelsh fans took to Facebook to air their views. One, Chris Thomas, said: \"There was minor disorder just below where I was sitting which needed the security to intervene. There were also some guys squaring up to each other in the toilets which again was broken up by security.\"\nSteven Thomas said \"no true rugby fan gets drunk senseless instead of enjoying the match\", while Jodi Merry asked: \"I've never understood why people pay \u00a360-plus for a ticket and then get so blind drunk they have no clue where they are or what they're doing.\"\nClaire Roberts believed alcohol should be banned during the match and Sandra Gorrigan said: \"It's a social event now. If you want to actually watch the rugby it's best on the television.\"\nHowever, Richard Turner did not believe beer should be banned, adding: \"You should be able to responsibly drink a beer while watching rugby or football. \n\"Anyone displaying signs of being overly drunk should be refused entry, or removed from the stadium if needed. Same as any pub in the UK.\""

      "text": "One-third of musicians were still earning nothing after restrictions on live events were lifted this summer, according to UK charity Help Musicians.\nThe music industry is one of the last sectors to recover from the pandemic, it said, with 83% of professional musicians unable to find regular work.\nThe findings are based on a survey of 929 musicians in August.\nAlmost nine in 10 were earning less than \u00a31,000 per month, and 22% were considering giving up music altogether.\nRestrictions on live music were removed in England and Wales in July, and Scotland in August, after Covid had kept the live music industry shut for most of the pandemic.\n\"A lot of venues were like, 'Well, we'll just stay shut until we can get back to full capacity again',\" Ruth Lyon of folk-rock band Holy Moly and the Crackers told BBC News.\nHer group went from playing 120 shows a year pre-lockdown to almost 18 months off stage. \n\"We had 30 festivals lined up, we had a tour booked at the end of last year and we had shows pretty much every single weekend - and that all just fell apart within a few days.\"\nLyon said her earnings fell by more than 75% in 2020. Her band weren't able to resume shows until last month because she has an immunosuppressant condition that puts her at high risk of infection.\n\"I couldn't be in a position where I could be a guinea pig,\" she explained. \"We had to wait until it was safe for me and I was cleared by my medical team to go back out.\"\nJames Brown, guitarist with Leeds-based rock band Pulled Apart By Horses, said their earnings \"nosedived\" last year - and royalties from streaming services and radio airplay could not make up the shortfall.\n\"It takes time for royalties to come through,\" he explained. \"They can take months, if not years. So the backlog for musicians of being able to earn a good stable salary from music has slowed down to a halt.\"\nUnable to tour, Brown took work as a composer for film and TV soundtracks, but still found himself unable to make ends meet. He ended up asking Help Musicians for support, both financially and for his mental health.\n\"To go from 10 years of performing live to suddenly hitting this brick wall, where you were told it's not happening anymore - it's devastating,\" he said.\nHelp Musicians said it had seen a 60% increase in people getting in contact for mental health support, with one in eight saying they were experiencing a mental health problem that was preventing them from returning to work.\nDuring the pandemic, the charity distributed \u00a318m to 19,000 struggling musicians.\n\"We recognise that for some musicians, it will take a long time to rebuild and the team at Help Musicians will continue to be available to those musicians who find themselves in real crisis over the months ahead,\" chief executive James Ainscough said.\nEven getting back into the swing of playing concerts can be a challenge, as Pulled Apart By Horses discovered this summer.\n\"We did actually play one festival that didn't get cancelled in August, and it was so bizarre,\" said Brown. \n\"After having all that time off not being around people and then being thrown straight in at the deep end, it was just like, 'What is going on?' It was kind of terrifying.\"\nSpeaking about her return to performing, Lyon, said: \"I've loved it, but it's been different.\n\"Usually, I'd get carried off stage and be straight onto the merch stall, hugging people and taking selfies - but I'm still trying to keep my distance a bit, so I've really missed that aspect of it.\"\nEven so, she said getting back on stage had been beneficial to her mental health.\n\"Performance is a huge part of who I am, and it makes me feel quite powerful,\" she said. \"Having that taken away for almost two years was kind of crazy - so getting back to it has been a big boost.\"\nLyon added that, if there's one silver lining to the dire circumstances musicians have faced in the last two years, it's that they're more willing to seek help.\n\"So many of my friends never even thought about getting counselling or going to therapy before this - and now everybody's talking about it. So in a way that's a good thing,\" she said.\n\"Reach out if you need to, don't be ashamed. We're all struggling.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Travel,Department of Health & Social Care,Coronavirus testing,Reality Check,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People who test positive for Covid at home no longer need to take a PCR test to confirm the result.\nMany people are still struggling to get hold of tests due to high demand.\nIf you have no symptoms:\nAcross the UK, if you test positive for Covid with a lateral flow test (LFT), there is no longer any need to book a PCR test to confirm that result. \nYou should report your result online or by calling 119, and self-isolate immediately. You will be contacted by the relevant tracing service so your contacts can be notified.\nYou can leave self-isolation seven days after the date of your first positive test (five full days in England), as long as you have two negative LFT results, 24 hours apart. \nThe guidance that positive LFTs don't need a confirmatory PCR will remain in place while Covid case levels are high. Under these conditions, the vast majority of people with positive LFT results are extremely likely to have coronavirus. \nPeople who are eligible for the \u00a3500 test and trace payment in England will be asked to take a PCR so they can access financial support.\nClinically vulnerable people in Wales and Northern Ireland are also still advised to take a PCR test after a positive LFT.\nIf you have symptoms:\nIf you have Covid symptoms - a cough, a fever or a loss of taste or smell - you should take a PCR test as soon as possible, and self-isolate while you wait for the result. \nYou must then continue to self-isolate if the PCR test is positive, even if you previously had negative LFT results.\nHowever, if you have already tested positive on a LFT, you should self-isolate and do not need to take a follow up PCR.\nAnyone without Covid symptoms can order LFTs online using their NHS login. \nYou can also collect LFTs from pharmacies, vaccination hubs and test centres. \nYou should report your LFT result online or by calling 119. \nYou can order a PCR test kit to be sent to your home or book an appointment at a walk-in or drive-through test site.\nThe main government website still regularly says no LFTs are available for home delivery, and many pharmacies have limited stock. \nPCR test appointments are also sometimes in short supply across much of the UK, although home PCR kits are generally available. \nAnyone who needs a PCR test is advised to keep checking the website, as slots are released throughout the day.\nAnnouncing the reduction in the self-isolation period for England, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs that LFT supplies had risen sharply from pre-Omicron levels, with 400 million available in January, compared to 120 million in November. \nThe testing rules are broadly similar across the UK. \nIf you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or for 10 days after your last contact, if this is earlier). \nThis also applies to people under-18s (18 and four months in Scotland; 18 and six months in England).\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test, but don't need to take a confirmatory PCR test. \nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. In Scotland, they are advised to take one PCR test and continue isolating even if the result is negative. \nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms.\nAnyone who develops Covid symptoms during self-isolation should take a PCR test. \nAcross the UK, NHS and education staff are asked to test twice a week. Secondary pupils should test twice a week during term time (three times a week in Wales). \nThere is separate testing guidance for prisons and hospital patients, as well as care home staff in Scotland. \nThe government has said it will provide 100,000 critical workers in England with free daily LFTs, initially for five weeks.\nCritical workers deliver essential services such as transport and food distribution, and cannot work from home so are at risk of infection.\nIn addition, everyone is asked to test before socialising with those who are at most risk from Covid, or spending time in crowded settings or places with poor ventilation. \nPeople can also provide a recent negative LFT or PCR result instead of proof of vaccination to enter venues that are covered by Covid passport schemes in place in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nYou may also need to test before or after travelling abroad. You must buy private tests for this - you cannot use free NHS tests. \nLFTs and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests do different things:\nBoth tests involve swabbing your nose and/or throat. LFTs can be done at home, and show results in 20-30 minutes. \nPCR test swabs must be sent to a lab for analysis, with results provided in 24-48 hours, although it can take longer to confirm a particular Covid variant.\nBeing vaccinated against Covid cannot cause you to test positive on either an LFT or PCR test.\nWhen LFTs were first introduced, they were criticised for being much less accurate than PCRs.\nHowever, in October UCL researchers found LFTs were more than 80% effective at detecting any level of Covid-19 infection, which was much higher than previously thought.\nLFT results are also more reliable during a period of high Covid cases, because the small number of false positives is much less significant.

      "tags": "Parole Board,Leicester",
      "text": "Double child killer Colin Pitchfork was arrested and recalled to prison because he had been approaching young women, the BBC understands.\nHe was released two months ago after spending 33 years in jail for murdering two teenage girls in the 1980s.\nSince then he is understood to have approached young women on multiple occasions while out on walks from the bail hostel where he was living.\nHe was arrested after probation staff raised concerns about his behaviour.\nBarbara Ashworth, whose daughter Dawn was murdered by Pitchfork in 1986, told the Daily Mail: \"It is worrying that he is approaching young women in this manner. It just goes to show that a leopard never changes its spots.\"\nThere have also been concerns he had been trying to cheat lie detector tests. The BBC's home and legal correspondent Dominic Casciani has been told he was doing this by using breathing techniques.\nPitchfork was jailed in 1988 for raping and murdering 15-year-olds Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth in Leicestershire.\nHe raped and strangled Lynda Mann in 1983 and did the same to Dawn Ashworth in 1986.\nThe Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said Pitchfork has not committed any further offences since being released.\nHowever, the step of recalling him is thought to have been taken as a preventative measure due to a concerning pattern in his behaviour.\nDawn Ashworth's uncle, Philip Musson, told BBC Woman's Hour that releasing Pitchfork had been an \"ill-judged\" experiment.\n\"The wellbeing of children and families [was] being subject to this experiment,\" he said.\n\"I appreciate we can't lock up the vast majority of criminals and throw away the key but there are just one or two who commit such heinous offences against society that they can't be successfully repatriated safely back into society, and he is one of them.\"\nThere was public outcry when the Parole Board deemed Pitchfork to be suitable for release, and even former Justice Secretary Robert Buckland challenged the decision.\nSpeaking to BBC Woman's Hour after Pitchfork was recalled, he said: \"My view bluntly is that he should never have been released, and that's why I raised my concerns back in the summer.\n\"Frankly I very much hope that we don't see this man being released again.\"\nCurrent Justice Secretary Dominic Raab is said to be looking at proposals to overhaul the Parole Board, with the findings of a review anticipated next year.\n\"I think reform is necessary and I think we can do better,\" Mr Buckland said.\n\"This case has thrown up, again, a horrific example of how things can go wrong. We need action soon.\"\nPitchfork was subject to an unusually high number of licence conditions. The MoJ said there were more than 40 - including exclusion zones, curfews and polygraph testing - while murderers are usually only subject to about seven.\nPitchfork's case must now be referred to the Parole Board within 28 days.\nThere will likely be a parole hearing due to the seriousness of the case, rather than considering the circumstances of the recall \"on paper\", meaning by solely reviewing documents.\nThe hearing will determine whether Pitchfork should stay in a closed prison, be transferred to an open prison or be released.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's vaccine passport system will not be extended to more venues, Nicola Sturgeon has announced.\nThe first minister had been considering expanding the scheme to cover cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues.\nBut she told MSPs that it would not be proportionate to do so, with case numbers having fallen slightly.\nPeople will be allowed to present a negative test rather than proof of two jabs to enter venues that are already covered by the scheme from 6 December.\nThese include nightclubs and large events such as some football matches and concerts, and would bring Scotland's system into line with others in countries like Wales. \nMs Sturgeon said taking a lateral flow test before socialising with others over the festive period was a \"vitally important\" step in minimising the spread of the virus.\nA decision on adding more venues to the scheme had been expected for several weeks, with Ms Sturgeon previously telling MSPs that it could help \"get through what will be a challenging winter without having to reintroduce restrictions on trade\".\nThe government published an evidence paper which suggested Scotland faced a choice between either extending the vaccine passport system or closing down venues and limiting the number of people who can meet up.\nHowever, ministers ultimately decided to do neither after studying the latest data at a meeting of Ms Sturgeon's cabinet on Tuesday morning.\nThe first minister said that while Scotland was still in a precarious position, with \"significant and sustained\" pressure on the NHS, the data was actually \"more positive than we might have expected it to be\".\nMs Sturgeon said the spread of the virus had stabilised - with the average number of new cases recorded each day falling by about 3% over the past week.\nShe said that given the \"inevitable impact vaccine certification has on the operation of businesses\", ministers had concluded that extending the scheme would therefore not be proportionate.\nHowever, venues which remain covered by the scheme will be allowed to accept a negative lateral flow test instead of proof of vaccination from 6 December - as already happens in many other countries that have introduced vaccine passports.\nMs Sturgeon said this had originally been left out of the scheme to help drive up vaccination rates, but that high uptake rates meant testing could now be included as an alternative.\nThe first minister also urged people to get vaccinated before socialising over the festive period, saying: \"You could well be saving your own life, and the lives of your loved ones.\n\"You will be helping the NHS, and you will be maximising our chances of getting through this winter without the need for further restrictions.\"\nHospitality bosses had warned that pubs and restaurants could face an \"avalanche of cancellations\" if the certification scheme had been extended over the normally busy Christmas period.\nBusiness group CBI Scotland welcomed the decision not to do so, with director Tracy Black saying it \"strikes the right balance between managing the virus and protecting our economy recovery\".\nShe said: \"Many firms would have faced practical challenges and increased costs to implement measures at a time when bumper trading is needed to claw back lost or diminished revenues.\"\nThe Federation of Small Businesses described the decision as a \"relief\", saying firms \"will now have a weight off their shoulders\".\nAnd the Scottish Retail Consortium said businesses would be \"delighted to see a reprieve from further restrictions\", praising ministers for listening to representations from industry.\nNicola Sturgeon tends to signal well in advance what changes to Covid rules might be coming. Over the last two weeks, she and her deputy have made clear that extending the use of vaccine certification to further venues was a serious prospect.\nA Scottish government evidence paper went as far as to suggest that in order to suppress Covid more, ministers faced a choice between wider use of certification and lockdown-style measures.\nBut today's statement from the first minister has stopped short of taking either option at this stage, taking account of pushback from business and relatively stable case numbers.\nInstead, they are counting on continued use of existing measures like vaccination and mask wearing and an appeal for greater use of home testing to stop the NHS being overwhelmed.\nAccepting lateral flow tests as well as proof of vaccination for entry to venues that already require certification aligns the Scottish scheme more closely with Wales and Northern Ireland. \nOpposition parties - who have questioned whether vaccine passports are effective - said the move amounted to a government u-turn after weeks of speculation about the scheme being expanded.\nScottish Conservative health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane said ministers seemed to be \"making it up as they go along\".\nHe said: \"The uncertainty that this government has left hanging over businesses for the last two weeks has been unnecessary and unacceptable.\"\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the government had been \"determined to be seen to be doing something, rather than doing the right thing\".\nHe added: \"We have spent months pursuing the incorrect priority. The government's own evidence shows there is no real evidence of an increase in uptake of the vaccine, and transmission has not fallen.\n\"I welcome the change to include a negative test from now on but frankly we are in this position because the government couldn't accept it was wrong and move in the right direction.\"\nMs Sturgeon said Mr Sarwar was \"fundamentally wrong\", saying allowing the use of tests in the system earlier would have \"undermined the central primary objective of the scheme\", of driving up the vaccination rate.\nMeanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government's evidence paper was \"mince\", and claimed that ministers had caused \"weeks of uncertainty and panic\" for businesses."

      "text": "The mother of a Welsh soldier killed in Afghanistan has said a veterans commissioner would stop ex-servicemen and women being \"dropped like a sack of hot coal\".\nHazel Hunt's son Richard, from Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, died after his vehicle was caught in an explosion.\nWales is the only UK nation without a veterans commissioner, which the UK government promised to create and fund.\nThe Welsh government has said \"discussions are ongoing\".\nBut Tory MP Fay Jones said the Welsh government was slow to get on board.\nMs Hunt said a veterans commissioner \"would make a difference\" to those former servicemen and women who previously \"haven't had a voice\".\n\"Once you're out of the forces they don't know who to turn to because they help you, whether you are single or married, they help you. Your accommodation is taken care of, your bills are taken care of, so they don't even know how to pay a gas bill,\" she said.\n\"They need to have that continuity of help and they weren't getting it from leaving the forces for whatever reason.\n\"Whether they were discharged through medical reasons or whether they had just come to the end of their time in the forces, they suddenly find that door to whatever forces they were in is firmly shut and then they turn around and think 'well, who do I go to?'.\"\nWales currently has Armed Forces Liaison Officers (AFLOS) who work in different parts of the country helping military personnel and veterans access services.  \nBut Simon Weston, who is one of about 140,000 veterans in Wales, said there needed to be \"a single voice to represent veterans\" throughout the nation.\n\"It adds more gravitas to the debate if you have somebody who has instant access to ministers,\" he said.\nThe former Welsh Guardsman, from Nelson, in Caerphilly county, served in the Falklands War where he was injured on board the RFA Sir Galahad when it came under fire in the 1982 conflict.\nHe said he wanted to see the Welsh government work with the UK government to get the veterans commissioner role up and running as quickly as possible. \nReferring to previous complaints from Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford about a lack of consultation from the UK government, Mr Weston said the creation of the role would be \"one step towards getting greater co-operation\".\nHe said: \"If somebody else is funding this, what would be the issue?\n\"It will look like you're lagging behind because you deliberately want to.\n\"There's an opportunity here. It's about co-ordination, it's about benefiting people,\" he added.\nMs Hunt added there had been a \"huge variation\" in access to help in Wales. \n\"People in west Wales have had to go to England for things like medical support,\" she said. \n\"When you think that Wales provides around a fifth of all the armed forces and there are 210,000 veterans in Wales, that is a huge amount. \n\"These people lose contact with services and easily fall through the gaps.\"\nThe UK government committed to creating the post in March, after campaigning by Brecon and Radnorshire MP Fay Jones. \nMs Jones said ministers in Cardiff need to \"come on board\" to make the role meaningful, because many of the services veterans use are the responsibility of the Welsh government.\n\"Veterans have been waiting a long time for someone to be their champion and it is, I think, wrong that Wales is the only country in the UK not to have a veterans commissioner,\" she said.\n\"I think veterans in Wales are being disadvantaged. I think the Welsh government could pick up the pace.\"\nThe Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said that he would fund the Veterans' Commissioner for Wales post in his October budget.\nEarlier this year the Welsh government announced more than \u00a3500,000 to continue funding seven AFLOS and give more money to NHS Veterans Wales, a dedicated pathway for veterans to get health care support.\nThe Armed Forces charity Help for Heroes said the role would bring \"increased focus and support\" to what was already in place for veterans in Wales.\n\"Having a dedicated Veterans Commissioner in Wales will add an extra string to the bow for the Welsh government as it looks to give the absolute best support it can for our veterans,\" it said.\nIn a statement, the Welsh government said: \"This is a UK government appointment, which it has yet to agree the funding and timescales for.\n\"We continue to discuss this appointment with the Office for Veterans Affairs and the Wales Office to progress this important role and ensure it works effectively with the existing structures in Wales which already deliver extensive support for the Armed Forces community.\"\nThe issue of support for veterans is an emotive one, particularly so in Wales where the numbers of volunteers for the armed forces has traditionally been high.\nThe question of a veterans commissioner for Wales has bubbling away for some time, but has become more pressing with the Chancellor's promise in the October budget that he would fund the role.\nThe Welsh government believes it already offers a good level of support for veterans with regional armed forces liaison officers who facilitate access to services as well as other spending to support health and education initiatives for veterans and their families.\nBut the UK government is pressing for the creation of the role which it says would to help ensure a constituency of provision across the country.

      "text": "At least 46 people, including 12 children, died when a bus crashed and caught fire in western Bulgaria, officials say.\nThe bus was registered in North Macedonia and most of those on board were tourists returning from a trip to Istanbul in Turkey.\nIt rammed a crash barrier on a motorway south-west of the capital Sofia at about 02:00 local time (00:00 GMT).\nSeven people escaped from the bus and were taken to hospital with burns. \nFour-year-old twin boys were among those killed in the crash.\nBulgarian Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov visited the \"terrifying scene\" and said the survivors had been badly burned.\nThe cause of the disaster was not immediately clear. Bulgarian officials described how the bus swerved off the motorway and tore away a 50m (164ft) section of the crash barrier, but it was unclear if that was before or after it caught fire.\nPictures of the aftermath showed a section of the road where the barrier had been shorn off. No other vehicles were involved in the accident.\nThe mayor of the nearby village of Pernik said the motorway was in poor condition on that section and there were often accidents in the area.\nMacedonian Foreign Minister Bujar Osmani told reporters the coach party had been returning to the capital Skopje from a weekend holiday trip to Istanbul.\nBulgarian media said the bus had been travelling as part of a convoy of four buses and had stopped off at a petrol station near Sofia about an hour before the accident. The other buses, which were a few minutes ahead, returned to North Macedonia safely.\nThe victims have not yet been officially named, but officials said they included 12 children, and many young people aged between 20 and 30.\nA young couple who were due to be married were among those killed. Macedonian reports said 27-year old Gazmend Ukali and Albina Beluli, 23, from the north-western town of Tetovo, had gone to Istanbul to celebrate Ukali's birthday.\nAlbania's foreign minister indicated that most, if not all, the passengers were ethnic Albanians from North Macedonia.\nMacedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said he had spoken to one of the survivors, who told him that passengers were asleep when the sound of an explosion woke them.\n\"He and the other six survivors broke the windows of the bus and managed to escape and save themselves,\" Mr Zaev told reporters.\nThe bus belonged to Besa Trans, a travel company that organises trips in Europe. \nWithin hours of the crash, relatives of people who travelled to Turkey with Besa Trans last week gathered outside the firm's office in Skopje, anxiously looking for information.\nDzelal Bakiu told reporters in the Macedonian capital he was concerned for his nephew and had not heard from him since learning of the crash. He tried to contact the travel agency but had not been able to get any information. \nBulgaria's interim Prime Minister Stefan Yanev described the incident as \"an enormous tragedy\". \n\"Let's hope we learn lessons from this tragic incident and we can prevent such incidents in the future,\" he told reporters as he visited the crash site.\nInvestigative service chief Borislav Sarafov said \"human error by the driver or a technical malfunction are the two initial versions for the accident\". \nThe area around the site of Tuesday's incident on the Struma motorway was sealed off and footage from the scene showed the charred vehicle, gutted by the fire.\nMr Sarafov told reporters that it appeared both drivers had been killed in the crash so no-one was able to open the doors.\nHave you have been affected by the issues in this story?

      "text": "Northern Ireland ministers have announced a relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions that were introduced in December due to the Omicron variant.\nTheir decision comes as the number of new coronavirus cases has been falling.\nAlthough they are still well above what they were at the height of the peak last winter, the big difference is that Omicron is affecting people much less severely.\nBBC News NI explains the latest rules on socialising, working, face coverings and other areas.\nProof of Covid status will no longer be legally required for entry to bars, restaurants or cinemas from 12:00 GMT on Wednesday 26 January.\nHowever the Stormont executive has said their continued use will be \"strongly encouraged\".\nMinisters have also agreed to remove rules on table service in hospitality businesses and the so-called \"rule of six\" people per table from midday on Friday 21 January.\nNightclubs - which were forced to closed on 26 December - will be allowed to reopen from 26 January, with dancing and indoor events at which people are not seated being permitted again.\nSo-called Covid passports will remain in use for access to nightclubs, as well as for indoor unseated and partially-seated events with 500 or more people in attendance.\nThe guidance limit of three households allowed to meet indoors in a home is also to be removed from 21 January.\nA maximum number of 30 people permitted to gather will be retained in regulation.\nFrom 21 January, the guidance on working from home will revert to working from home where you can with employers encouraged to facilitate that.\nThe requirement for offices to take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing will be removed from 26 January. \nGuidance will be that risk assessments should be carried out.\nThe executive has been advised by the Department of Health that the minimum self-isolation period for people testing positive for Covid-19 will be reduced to five full days from 21 January.\nThat will be subject to negative lateral flow tests on days five and six of a person's isolation.\nFrom 21 January, the requirement to provide proof of exemption from wearing a mask will be removed and the reasonable excuse of \"severe distress\" will be reintroduced.\nIt means businesses should still be encouraging people to wear face coverings but they should not asking for proof of exemption.\nNo changes have been made to the limits on numbers of people who can attend outdoor events.\nThe executive has previously advised people not to car-share when attending outdoors events, and to wear face coverings and take a lateral flow test before going to the event.\nThere are no plans to close schools.\nThe executive has said its \"absolute priority\" is ensuring schools remain open.\nAll remaining Covid measures will be reviewed by the executive on 10 February.\nThose include:"

      "tags": "UK immigration,Gatwick Airport,Detention centres",
      "text": "A public inquiry into the mistreatment of immigration detainees has heard a BBC Panorama documentary revealed \"shocking\" treatment which had \"no place in a decent and humane\" system.\nThe inquiry into Brook House removal centre, near Gatwick, is examining mistreatment of detainees, as well as the attitudes and culture of staff. \nIt follows a series of investigations triggered by Panorama in 2017.\nAt the time, G4S ran the Sussex centre, but Serco took it over last year.\nAs the inquiry began, detainees told the BBC about conditions at Brook House now.\nIn the past two weeks, the BBC has spoken to half a dozen current and former detainees at Brook House, who are allowed access to phones. There were no allegations of violence, but the handling of Covid was a major concern. \nSeveral described how their wing was moved in with detainees from another area, allowing Covid to spread. \nThis has resulted in what they described as \"lockdowns\" where people on affected wings are not allowed to move freely around the centre and have less time to access its shop, gym and library. \nOne former prisoner, now held at Brook House and expecting to be deported, said there was a \"tense atmosphere\".\n\"Two nights ago everyone refused to go into their cells in protest. There are rumours of people wanting to go on a mass hunger strike,\" he said, claiming there had been at least 14 Covid cases. \nOthers complained about the length of time it took to resolve immigration cases.\nOne current detainee said he was desperate to be sent home. He claimed 20 out of 65 people in one wing would leave the country willingly but the Home Office had not allowed it. \nThe BBC was told Covid outbreaks mean detainees cannot be sent on deportation flights because even those testing negative are blocked from flying by airlines because they are in isolation wings.\nSerco, which now runs the centre, denied there were \"lockdowns\" but confirmed that detainees are allowed to move freely for up to two hours at a time, in rotation, as part of standard government Covid protocols. \nAnother continuing problem centred on the length of time it took to resolve immigration cases.  \nA former detainee and a convicted criminal said: \"If you are in prison you know the judge has given you a length of two or three years. In a detention centre you don't know when you're coming out. You can't handle it.\"\nHe said he had spent as long in three detention centres, including Brook House, as he had in prison.  \n\"I always felt I had to harm myself. I have to take my life away. I was sick in my head,\" he said. \"When I came out it took me one year to recover. Now I can feel that I'm normal.\"\nFive years ago, Callum Tulley, a former Brook House officer and now a BBC journalist, carried out secret filming for Panorama.\nThe programme revealed harsh treatment, widespread drug use and bullying and raised concerns about the mental health care given to detainees.\nCounsel to the inquiry Brian Altman QC said 109 hours of footage had been given to the inquiry and four hours identified as \"key evidence\".\nTen members of G4S staff were dismissed or resigned in the wake of the BBC broadcast.\nOn its first day, the inquiry heard there would be evidence on restraint techniques used and how staff responded to bullying.\nThe G4S contract is also of particular interest, as well as how the Home Office oversaw the operation of the centre.\nG4S was paid about \u00a31m a year by the Home Office, with penalties for poor performance including escapes, or detainees taking their own lives. \nMr Altman said short-staffing was an \"almost daily occurrence\". And the BBC footage captured \"bravado, mockery, macho behaviour and banter, which may have normalised disdain for and even violence towards detained persons\". \nThe centre, which holds foreign nationals who have served prison sentences and people whose asylum claims have been refused, can house more than 500 men and has the same security as a Category B prison.\nThe wider immigration system is not part of the inquiry's remit. \nThe first phase of public hearings began on Tuesday and will continue until early December.\nThe second phase of the inquiry will take place early next year and is expected to conclude by the spring.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "text": "Germany's health minister has issued his starkest warning yet on the importance of getting vaccinated.\n\"By the end of this winter everyone in Germany will either be vaccinated, recovered or dead,\" Jens Spahn told a news conference in Berlin on Monday.\nGermany is in the grip of a fourth wave of coronavirus. Cases are rising rapidly and many hospitals are full.\nIt has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe, with 68% of people fully vaccinated.\nGermany's infection rate is at its highest since the pandemic began, and health experts have warned this wave could be the worst yet. \nIn the past 24 hours, there have been 30,643 new infections - 7,000 more than a week ago. This is among the highest rates in the world.\nTighter restrictions are to be brought in which will see the unvaccinated excluded from certain venues, and some of Germany's famed Christmas markets have been cancelled.\nMr Spahn said he was against making Covid vaccines compulsory, but that it was a \"moral obligation\" to get the jab because it impacts on other people.\n\"Freedom means taking responsibility, and there is a duty to society to get vaccinated,\" he said. \nThe minister said the highly contagious Delta variant is driving the latest wave and that \"anyone who is not vaccinated will, over the next few months, become infected and lack protection\". \nIn the news conference on Monday, Mr Spahn also promoted the US-made Moderna shot, calling it the Rolls Royce of vaccines, as high demand for the German-produced Pfizer/BioNTech jabs risked depleting stocks.\nHe warned that some 16 million Moderna doses could expire in the next few months if they are not used.\nThe country expects the European Union to approve vaccines for children aged five to 11 by the end of the week.\nSince the start of the pandemic, more than 99,000 people in Germany have died, and more than 5.4 million have been infected with Covid-19."

      "title": "Covid-19: Venues 'may have to close doors during Christmas'",
      "text": "There is a possibility that hospitality venues may be asked to close over Christmas if Covid-19 cases continue to increase, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. \nBut he told the Northern Ireland Assembly it was not \"inevitable\".\nStormont ministers have met to discuss plans to help curb the spread of Covid-19 and will meet again on Tuesday.\nOn Thursday, Mr Swann advised anyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year to do so again now.\nHis document also suggested introducing a \"scores on the doors\" Covid compliance rating for businesses.\nMr Swann said on Monday that \"if the current trajectory continues with regard to the increased cases we are seeing, we may once again face the possibility where venues are asked to close their doors during the Christmas season\".\n\"But let me be clear, it is not inevitable and I do not want to have to re-introduce further restrictions unless completely unavoidable,\" he added.\nMr Swann also expressed disappointment that some hospitality venues had not acted responsibly after social distancing rules were relaxed.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill tweeted that Mr Swann had presented a paper to ministers who met on Monday morning to consider it. \nShe said that while the \"meeting was constructive and progress was made, it was agreed more work was needed\".\n\"The executive will meet again in the morning to finalise the approach,\" she added.\nDecisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must first be agreed by the executive.\nHealth officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus.\nOn Monday, three Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland and a further 1,469 new cases. \nNorthern Ireland's infection rate has been climbing over the past week or so.\nIt is currently the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland.\nJustice Minister Naomi Long said on Monday that the executive was \"not planning for Christmas closures\".\n\"We started off in terms of looking at vaccine certification as one means of trying to ensure that we drive down transmission and as those who are in more high-risk environments are less likely to become seriously ill as a result, that's one means of keeping the doors open on businesses,\" she added.\n\"We've been considering the paper today around how we actually try to get the basics right and get people to comply with things like handwashing, wearing masks, trying to voluntarily reduce their number of close contacts, trying to ensure where people can work from home they do work from home.\n\"Our focus at the minute is not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open.\"\nMs O'Neill said on Twitter that it was \"vitally important that all executive ministers work together to get us through this difficult period\".\n\"It's time to redouble our efforts to limit the spread of the virus, protect lives and our hospital system,\" she added.\nI think this was the strongest warning from Robin Swann that unless people do change their ways, it is not inevitable, but a distinct possibility [that venues may be asked to close].\nIf we are talking about carrot and stick, I think that is potentially the stick.\nMr Swann will hope that hits home, because nobody wants that to happen.\nCertainly the people who run these establishments don't want it to happen.\nPeople would like a Christmas, but Robin Swann is saying people have got to change their ways.\nLast week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, then more \"severe\" restrictions could be required before Christmas. \nStormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade.\nThey have already agreed to put in place proof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December. \nThe plan means people will have to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of a negative coronavirus test result to access nightclubs, pubs, cinemas, theatres and restaurants.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted against the proposals but Mr Swann and other Stormont ministers said the use of Covid status certification would save lives.\nDUP ministers had said they wanted to see other measures explored by health officials, which could also help reduce the number of Covid cases.\nAt present, executive advice on working from home is that people should continue to do so where they can.\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland's justice minister has raised concerns about a proposal for her department to \"take the lead\" in managing compliance around face coverings to help combat Covid-19.\nThe health paper suggested Naomi Long should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%.\nShe said the proposal was \"entirely inappropriate\".\nIn Mr Swann's paper to ministers ahead of Monday's meeting, he suggested that a decision taken by the executive on 23 September encouraging employers to \"begin planning a gradual return to the workplace\" for employees should be reversed.\nThe proposal goes on to say that the message should be communicated by stating that if a person worked from home when the pandemic began in March 2020 then \"they should be working from home now\".\nOn Friday, Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride, said research had shown that working from home was \"one of the single most effective interventions\" to control the virus.\nAnother proposal raised by the minister is a \"Covid score\" for businesses based on their compliance with regulations and Covid safety measures.\nMr Swann said while this suggestion was dismissed as an option last year, he believes it should be revisited and has suggested the executive's Covid taskforce take on the development of such a scheme.\nThe document also advises ensuring enforcement against those breaching existing Covid restrictions, including people who do not comply with wearing face coverings where they are legally required.\nMr Swann said that since rules on mandatory face coverings in shops and public transport were introduced in summer 2020, only five fines had been issued to people for failing to follow the law.\nThe minister added that unless enforcement was strengthened, the public would see \"compliance as unimportant and optional\".\nMost of the proposals in the paper are aimed at improving messaging and communication of current coronavirus advice.\nMr Swann is also understood to have said in his paper that communications on public health are \"much more effective when delivered with a united voice by all executive ministers\"."

      "tags": "SpaceX,Nasa,Space,Space exploration,Asteroids",
      "text": "A spacecraft has launched on a mission to test technology that could one day tip a dangerous asteroid off course.\nNasa's Dart mission wants to see how difficult it would be to stop a sizeable space rock from hitting Earth.\nThe spacecraft will crash into an object called Dimorphos to see how much its speed and path can be altered.\nIf a chunk of cosmic debris measuring a few hundred metres across were to collide with our planet, it could unleash continent-wide devastation.\nA Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dart spacecraft blasted off at 06:20 GMT on Wednesday from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\nIt is the first attempt to deflect an asteroid for the purpose of learning how to protect Earth, though this particular asteroid presents no threat.\n\"Dart will only be changing the period of the orbit of Dimorphos by a tiny amount. And really that's all that's needed in the event that an asteroid is discovered well ahead of time,\" said Kelly Fast, from Nasa's planetary defense co-ordination office.\nCommenting on the launch, she said: \"We're not out of the woods yet, we've got to get out to Dimorphos, but this is a huge step along the way.\"\nAsteroids are the left-over building blocks of the Solar System. In the extremely rare event that a space rock's path around the Sun crosses that of Earth so that the two objects intersect at the same time, a collision may occur.\nThe $325m (\u00a3240m) Dart mission will target a pair of asteroids that closely orbit each other - known as a binary. The larger of the two objects, called Didymos, measures around 780m across, while its smaller companion - Dimorphos - is around 160m wide.\nObjects of Dimorphos' size could explode with many times the energy of a typical nuclear bomb, devastating populated areas and causing tens of thousands of casualties. Asteroids with a diameter 300m and larger could cause continent-wide destruction, while those bigger than 1km would produce worldwide effects.\nAfter escaping Earth's gravity, Dart will follow its own orbit around the Sun. It will then intercept the binary as it approaches within 6.7 million miles of Earth in September 2022.\nDart will smash into the \"moonlet\" Dimorphos at a speed of around 15,000mph (6.6 km/s). This should change the speed of the object by a fraction of a millimetre per second - in turn altering its orbit around Didymos. It's a very small shift, but it could be just enough to knock an object off a collision course with Earth.\n\"There are a lot more small asteroids than there are large ones and so the most likely asteroid threat we ever have to face - if we ever have to face one - is probably going to be from an asteroid around this size,\" said Tom Statler, the mission's program scientist at Nasa.\nIn 2005, Congress directed Nasa to discover and track 90% of near-Earth asteroids larger than 140m (460ft). No known asteroids in this category pose an immediate threat to Earth, but only an estimated 40% of those objects have actually been found.\nDart is carrying a camera called Draco that will provide images of both asteroids and help the spacecraft point itself in the correct direction to collide with Dimorphos. \nAbout 10 days before Dart hits its target, the American spacecraft will deploy a small, Italian-built satellite called LiciaCube. The smaller craft will send back images of the impact, the plume of debris kicked up and the resulting crater.\nThe tiny change in Dimorphos' path around Didymos will be measured by telescopes on Earth. Tom Statler commented: \"What we really want to know is: did we really deflect the asteroid and how efficiently did we do it?\"\nA binary is the perfect natural laboratory for such a test. The impact should change Dimorphos' orbit around Didymos by roughly 1%, a change that can be detected by ground telescopes in weeks or months.\nHowever, if Dart were to slam into a lone asteroid, its orbital period around the Sun would change by about 0.000006%, which would take many years to measure.\nThe binary is so small that, to even the most powerful telescopes, it appears as a single point of light. However, Dimorphos blocks some of Didymos' reflected light as it passes in front, while the opposite occurs when the smaller object moves behind its bigger companion.\n\"We can measure the frequency of those dimmings,\" explained Dart's investigation lead Andy Rivkin, adding: \"That's how we know that Dimorphos goes around Didymos with a period of 11 hours, 55 minutes.\"\nAfter the impact, astronomers will take those measurements again. \"They'll happen a little bit more frequently - maybe it'll be two every 11 hours 45 minutes, maybe it'll be 11 hours, 20 minutes,\" said Dr Rivkin, who is based at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL) in Laurel, Maryland. \nThere's a degree of uncertainty over how Dimorphos will respond to the impact, in part because its interior structure isn't known. If Dimorphos is relatively solid inside, rather than full of spaces, it might produce lots of debris - which would give the object an extra push. \nDart's method for dealing with a hazardous asteroid is known as the kinetic impactor technique. However, there are other ideas, including moving the asteroid more slowly over time and even detonating a nuclear bomb - an option familiar from Hollywood movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "text": "Dua Lipa and J Hus will go down in history as the last stars to win best female and male at the Brit Awards.\nThat's because, from next year, the two categories will be combined into a single prize for best British artist, organisers have said.\nArtists like Sam Smith and Will Young had previously called for the change, saying the current system excludes non-binary artists.\nSmith, who is non-binary, missed out on a nomination at this year's awards.\nTheir album, Love Goes, reached number two in the UK chart, but they felt unable to enter the gender-based categories.\nWriting on Instagram at the time, the star called for awards shows to be more \"reflective of the society we live in\".\n\"The Brits have been an important part of my career,\" Smith said in a now-deleted post. \"Music for me has always been about unification not division.\n\"I look forward to a time where awards shows can be reflective of the society we live in. Let's celebrate everybody, regardless of gender, race, age, ability, sexuality and class.\"\nThe Brits have awarded prizes along gender lines since they began in 1977. Organisers promised to review the way the prizes in 2019, but kept the male and female categories intact until now.\n\"If you were starting the awards from scratch today, you'd probably do it on these terms,\" said Gennaro Castaldo, a spokesperson for music industry body the BPI, which runs the awards.\n\"Why shouldn't the likes of Adele and Ed Sheeran be able to go head to head and be judged as artists... assuming they're nominated?\"\nThe shift will also be reflected in the international category, where the best international male and female awards - won by The Weeknd and Billie Eilish this year - will be replaced by a single best international artist prize.\nDua Lipa's manager, Ben Mawson, said he approved of the change.\n\"It's good to see the Brits continuing to make progress to a more inclusive awards show that puts talent first,\" he told the BBC. \"It's a step that we welcome.\"\nWhen the change was first suggested in 2019, there were concerns that it could marginalise female acts. But the experiences of other music awards suggest that should not happen.\nThe MTV Video Music Awards replaced its best male and best female prizes with an overall best artist award in 2017 - since when the winners have been Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello, Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber.\nThe Grammys also merged the male and female categories for best pop vocal, country vocal and R&B vocal performances in 2012. In the 10 years since then, the prizes have been split exactly 50/50 between men and women.\nAt the Brits, the gender-neutral prize for best album has been won by female solo artists 10 times, and by male solo artists on nine occasions.\nBands have won best album 22 times, but only two of those have contained a female member - Fairground Attraction and Stereo MC's.\nDua Lipa would probably have won a combined award if it had been in place this year, and Adele is likely to sweep the board next year.\nThe singer's new album 30, which is on course to have the biggest opening sales week of 2021, will make her a prime contender for both album of the year and the best artist prize.\nMr Castaldo said that if the new system does prioritise male nominees, it would \"shine a spotlight\" on problems the industry needs to address.\n\"As an industry, we have to acknowledge those issues and we have to act on them. Keeping the status quo won't change things in the long term. So to achieve real equality for women and artists of all backgrounds, [this] is a very positive thing.\"\nReducing the number of artist awards has also allowed the Brits to reintroduce genre-based prizes for the first time since 2006.\nCovering pop, rock, dance and rap, the awards will be voted for by fans - a departure for The Brits, which typically distributes prizes based on votes from music industry insiders.\nWhen the prizes were last distributed 15 years ago, the winners included Kaiser Chiefs (best rock), Lemar (best urban act) and James Blunt (best pop).\nThe best dance prize has been absent for even longer - with the last recipient being Basement Jaxx in 2004.\nThe revamps come shortly before voting opens for the Brits, on 10 December.\nThe next ceremony will take place on 8 February 2022 at London's O2 arena, hosted for the first time by comedian Mo Gilligan, who will take over from Jack Whitehall.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Jonathan Ashworth,Social care,Sajid Javid",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion.\nThe Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new \u00a386,000 lifetime limit on costs.\nLabour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change.\nThe PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system.\nThe cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills.\nUnder the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023:\nOn Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246.\nNineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead.\nThe bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. \nDefending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win.\nPushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament.\nThe Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. \nMr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a \"step in the right direction\" and \"an improvement on what we have today\".\nBut he said its plans for calculating the cap were a \"big disappointment\" and \"not as generous as people like me wanted\".\nAfter a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like.\nBut that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place.\nAnd on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable.\nThe vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own.\nRead Laura's blog in full\nUnder the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit.\nThe threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to \u00a3100,000 able to qualify, rather than \u00a323,250 currently.\nThe government announced last week that only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap.\nLocal authorities will meet care costs beyond the \u00a386,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded through a new health and social care tax.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care.\nSally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was \"sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment\".\n\"The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,\" she said.\n\"It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this.\"\nWhen asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: \"I can't predict individual situations.\"\nAfter the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: \"Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care.\n\"Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected.\"\nBut the prime minister said the new system would be \"progressive\" and \"much better\" than the existing one.\n\"Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of \u00a323,000 or more - now you get support if you have \u00a3100,000 or less, so we're helping people,\" Mr Johnson said.\nHe added: \"We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country.\"\nLorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent \"every penny that she ever earned\" on care.\nDespite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of \u00a3140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. \nShe says for her mother, 83, selling her home was \"probably the worst thing ever\".\n\"She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,\" Lorraine adds. \n\"Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances.\"\nHow will you be affected by the cap on social care costs?

      "text": "An arbitrator has ordered Kevin Spacey to pay nearly $31m (\u00a323.2m) to the studio that made the hit Netflix show, House of Cards, for breach of contract following sexual harassment allegations against the US actor.\nThe secret ruling was made last year, but became public on Monday after lawyers for the studio, MRC, filed a court petition to confirm the award.\nThe actor has faced several sexual assault allegations since 2017.\nHe has denied any wrongdoing.\nMr Spacey, 62, lost his starring role as a conniving politician in House of Cards, and has kept a relatively low profile since being accused of creating a \"toxic\" work environment on set by allegedly making crude comments and touching young staffers without their consent.\nHe was one of the first major Hollywood figures to be publicly accused of misconduct in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and as the #MeToo movement was gaining momentum.\nMRC and Netflix fired Mr Spacey from House of Cards and wrote him out of the show. \nAs a result, the studio said it lost millions of dollars because it had already started working on the next season, the arbitration papers say, according to US media.\nMRC filed the lawsuit in January 2019, seeking to recover the costs and arguing that Mr Spacey's behaviour violated the studio's sexual harassment policy.\nLawyers on both sides heard from more than 20 people in an eight-day confidential arbitration hearing in February 2020, Variety reports. It added that the 46-page ruling made five months later remains confidential.\nHowever, the petition made by MRC to the Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday confirms that a ruling was made in the studio's favour. Mr Spacey and his production companies, M Profitt Productions and Trigger Street Productions, were ordered to pay damages, lawyers fees and court costs.\nHe appealed against the decision, but it was denied this month. \nMr Spacey's lawyer has declined to comment to US media.\nPublic allegations of sexual misconduct started to be made against Mr Spacey in October 2017, when actor Anthony Rapp claimed sexual advances were made towards him when Mr Rapp was 14. \nMr Spacey issued a statement saying he did not remember the encounter, but that he owed Mr Rapp \"the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour\". \nIn the statement, Mr Spacey also revealed he would now live as a gay man. He was criticised for linking his apology for alleged predatory behaviour with his homosexuality.\nA string of accusations followed, including that he groped a teenager at a Massachusetts bar in 2016, of which the civil action was eventually dropped, and that he sexually assaulted a massage therapist in Malibu, California. The masseur died in 2019 before his legal action reached court.\nMr Spacey lost several acting jobs as a result of the allegations, but made a return to acting this year, with a small role in a low-budget, independent Italian film directed by Franco Nero."

      "text": "A tiny Scottish town which found fame last year for its \"wonky\" Christmas lights has added two new masterpieces.\nNewburgh in Fife shuns traditional images of bells and snowflakes in favour of decorations designed by local schoolchildren. \nTheir joyful collection boasts a two-legged \"reinduck\", a grumpy penguin and a dancing Christmas tree.\nNow two new illuminations have been added - a festive dinosaur and a pandemic-inspired rainbow.\nImages of the unique spectacle went viral last year when the pandemic threatened to leave the town's high street in darkness over Christmas. \nThe community pulled together and the display did go ahead, but for the first time since 2002 there was no new light to add to the array. \nThis year, boosted by their new-found fame, organisers decided to select two winners from entries from Newburgh Primary School pupils. \n\"We wanted to go for it this year,\" said Newburgh Action Group member Shona Gray. \"We have a winner for 2021 and we wanted to mark 2020 and the historic year it was in some way.\"\nThe result was a winning design by primary seven pupil Lois Murray.\n\"I drew the rainbow part because of Covid and it was a symbol of hope at the time,\" Lois told BBC Scotland.  \n\"I thought it would be nice for the children to remember that strange Christmas in a positive way.\"\nLois couldn't remember what she drew for the light competition and was shocked when she found out last week that she was a winner.\n\"I was shocked because I was standing up in front of the class, thinking 'oh my gosh'. I couldn't remember if it was my design or not it was so long ago. \n\"My best friend nearly started crying.\"\nThe winner for 2021 was primary two artist Arlo Nicol.\nHis big green dinosaur wrapped in fairy lights embodied the festive feeling creeping across the town.  \nThe pair were given the exciting news at school last week and will now see their lights line the street for years to come.\nSusan Ewing, Newburgh Primary's headteacher, said: \"It's a great community project and the children all get very excited designing their entries and finding out who the winners are. \n\"It's a lovely tradition we have in the village, and it certainly makes our village feel extra festive. We're all looking forward to seeing the new designs!\"\nThe light competition means a lot to the town. Previous winners grow up looking for their light every year when they are strung up in November. \nLois's mum Angela said she had quietly hoped for years her daughter might win.\nShe said: \"When you put the competition drawing in every year you think it would be nice. \n\"We are military family so I have lived away for a while and it's lovely to come back and see the new ones. It's part of the community spirit. And the design is lovely. It reminds me of all the lovely arts and crafts we did at home during lockdown. \n\"We made salt dough decorations and Lois still has a rainbow one in her window.\"\nAfter word on the Newburgh children's decorations spread far and wide, the action group has had other communities desperate to start their own traditions.\nShona helped Westminster City Council create a lights display in central London, designed by children from Soho Parish Primary School.\nThe children's 21 creations were unveiled earlier in November and include penguins, reindeer, stars and a Christmas pineapple.\nShona said: \"It was lovely to see another community start their own tradition. I wasn't able to travel to their big switch on but the designs are beautiful.\""

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

If you do not want to know the result of the Great British Bake Off final, please look away now...\nGiuseppe celebrated victory on Tuesday after what judges on the Channel 4 show described as the closest finale yet.\nThe 45-year-old Bristol resident pipped this year's fellow finalists Chigs and Crystelle, who all had to make food for a Mad Hatter's Tea Party.\n\"There are no words, I am speechless for once,\" said the show's first Italian winner.\nIn the final episode, he made dough filled with chocolate and hazelnuts, shaped in the form of a giant mushroom. He also produced mango and passion fruit panna cottas, orange and fig heart-shaped muffins, and asparagus and pea-filled choux pastries shaped like a caterpillar. \nSeries 12 of the show saw a dozen bakers initially enter the Bake Off bubble at the start of the competition in September, before judges Paul Hollywood and Dame Prue Leith turned the heat up on them with a series of knock-out challenges over 10 episodes.\nThey set the final three bakers three tasks: to make carrot cake, produce Belgian buns and recreate a Mad Hatter's Tea Party, while showing four different baking disciplines.\nThe victorious Giuseppe dedicated his win to his parents. \"All I can think of is the reaction from my mum and dad,\" he continued. \n\"The fact is that everything I have done to deserve this comes from his [my dad's] heritage, it's the best thank you note I can possibly send him.\n\"He is going through a very bad time health-wise, so I think this is going to be a great boost.\n\"I don't say often or lightly that I am proud of what I do, but in this case I am really proud of what I have done. It's unbelievable!\"\nGiuseppe's achievement arrives in the same year that his compatriots won Euro 2020 and Eurovision. \"I feel it's been a great year for Italy,\" he noted on the show.\n\"I truly can't believe it or take it in, this has made me so incredibly happy to be a Britalian. Dell'Anno is my surname which translates in English to 'of the year' - and I feel this has certainly been my year.\"\nHollywood said he had \"done an incredible job\". \n\"The first time I walked into the tent and in the first signature I saw his mini rolls, I thought that looks like our winner, you could see the heart and soul going into his baking,\" declared the judge.\nFellow judge, the recently-honoured Dame Prue added: \"He is such a classic beautiful baker and he represents a long tradition of classic Italian baking. He has done it brilliantly all the way through.\n\"I am going home to make much more Italian cakes because they really are good.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's vaccine passport system will not be extended to more venues, Nicola Sturgeon has announced.\nThe first minister had been considering expanding the scheme to cover cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues.\nBut she told MSPs that it would not be proportionate to do so, with case numbers having fallen slightly.\nPeople will be allowed to present a negative test rather than proof of two jabs to enter venues that are already covered by the scheme from 6 December.\nThese include nightclubs and large events such as some football matches and concerts, and would bring Scotland's system into line with others in countries like Wales. \nMs Sturgeon said taking a lateral flow test before socialising with others over the festive period was a \"vitally important\" step in minimising the spread of the virus.\nA decision on adding more venues to the scheme had been expected for several weeks, with Ms Sturgeon previously telling MSPs that it could help \"get through what will be a challenging winter without having to reintroduce restrictions on trade\".\nThe government published an evidence paper which suggested Scotland faced a choice between either extending the vaccine passport system or closing down venues and limiting the number of people who can meet up.\nHowever, ministers ultimately decided to do neither after studying the latest data at a meeting of Ms Sturgeon's cabinet on Tuesday morning.\nThe first minister said that while Scotland was still in a precarious position, with \"significant and sustained\" pressure on the NHS, the data was actually \"more positive than we might have expected it to be\".\nMs Sturgeon said the spread of the virus had stabilised - with the average number of new cases recorded each day falling by about 3% over the past week.\nShe said that given the \"inevitable impact vaccine certification has on the operation of businesses\", ministers had concluded that extending the scheme would therefore not be proportionate.\nHowever, venues which remain covered by the scheme will be allowed to accept a negative lateral flow test instead of proof of vaccination from 6 December - as already happens in many other countries that have introduced vaccine passports.\nMs Sturgeon said this had originally been left out of the scheme to help drive up vaccination rates, but that high uptake rates meant testing could now be included as an alternative.\nThe first minister also urged people to get vaccinated before socialising over the festive period, saying: \"You could well be saving your own life, and the lives of your loved ones.\n\"You will be helping the NHS, and you will be maximising our chances of getting through this winter without the need for further restrictions.\"\nHospitality bosses had warned that pubs and restaurants could face an \"avalanche of cancellations\" if the certification scheme had been extended over the normally busy Christmas period.\nBusiness group CBI Scotland welcomed the decision not to do so, with director Tracy Black saying it \"strikes the right balance between managing the virus and protecting our economy recovery\".\nShe said: \"Many firms would have faced practical challenges and increased costs to implement measures at a time when bumper trading is needed to claw back lost or diminished revenues.\"\nThe Federation of Small Businesses described the decision as a \"relief\", saying firms \"will now have a weight off their shoulders\".\nAnd the Scottish Retail Consortium said businesses would be \"delighted to see a reprieve from further restrictions\", praising ministers for listening to representations from industry.\nNicola Sturgeon tends to signal well in advance what changes to Covid rules might be coming. Over the last two weeks, she and her deputy have made clear that extending the use of vaccine certification to further venues was a serious prospect.\nA Scottish government evidence paper went as far as to suggest that in order to suppress Covid more, ministers faced a choice between wider use of certification and lockdown-style measures.\nBut today's statement from the first minister has stopped short of taking either option at this stage, taking account of pushback from business and relatively stable case numbers.\nInstead, they are counting on continued use of existing measures like vaccination and mask wearing and an appeal for greater use of home testing to stop the NHS being overwhelmed.\nAccepting lateral flow tests as well as proof of vaccination for entry to venues that already require certification aligns the Scottish scheme more closely with Wales and Northern Ireland. \nOpposition parties - who have questioned whether vaccine passports are effective - said the move amounted to a government u-turn after weeks of speculation about the scheme being expanded.\nScottish Conservative health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane said ministers seemed to be \"making it up as they go along\".\nHe said: \"The uncertainty that this government has left hanging over businesses for the last two weeks has been unnecessary and unacceptable.\"\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the government had been \"determined to be seen to be doing something, rather than doing the right thing\".\nHe added: \"We have spent months pursuing the incorrect priority. The government's own evidence shows there is no real evidence of an increase in uptake of the vaccine, and transmission has not fallen.\n\"I welcome the change to include a negative test from now on but frankly we are in this position because the government couldn't accept it was wrong and move in the right direction.\"\nMs Sturgeon said Mr Sarwar was \"fundamentally wrong\", saying allowing the use of tests in the system earlier would have \"undermined the central primary objective of the scheme\", of driving up the vaccination rate.\nMeanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government's evidence paper was \"mince\", and claimed that ministers had caused \"weeks of uncertainty and panic\" for businesses."

      "text": "Bulb Energy, which has 1.7 million customers, has announced that the firm will be put into administration.\nIt is the largest UK energy company to face difficulties following a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices this year.\nBulb will become the first energy company to be placed into \"special administration\", where it is run by the government through the regulator Ofgem.\n\"Customers of Bulb do not need to worry - Bulb will continue to operate as normal,\" Ofgem said.\n\"Customers will see no disruption to their supply and their account and tariff will continue as normal. Bulb staff will still be available to answer calls and queries.\"\nThe special administration measure is only used if Ofgem is unable to find another company to take over an energy firm's customers. The regulator said it was planning to apply to a court to appoint an administrator who will run the company.\nBulb said energy supplies were \"secure and all credit balances are protected\".\nBulb is the UK's seventh biggest energy company and has 1,000 staff. It has been trying to shore up its finances for several weeks.\nOfgem set up the Special Administrator Regime (SAR) for when an energy company goes bust but is too big to have its customers transferred to another firm.\nThe aim of the regime is to stop financial failure spreading across the industry.\nUnder the SAR scheme, the government can make grants and loans to the company while its future is sorted out.\nIt could come in the shape of a takeover by another company, selling parts of its business or customers being transferred to another firm.\nProvision for special administration, owing to the collapse of a major player in the UK energy sector, has been part of the law for 10 years. \nIt had never been needed until now.\nSo, this decision will be a hugely significant moment in this gas crisis. But it is one to which customers of Bulb are being urged to respond by remaining calm and essentially doing nothing.\nIt is written into the rules that a special administrator, unlike an ordinary administrator, has an obligation to consider consumers' interests as well as those of creditors who are owed money by Bulb.\nIt means customers have short-term certainty that their supply, their current tariff, their credit balance and their bills will continue as normal. That means switching now would be a bad, and expensive, idea.\nLonger-term, some of that certainty diminishes as decisions are made about the future sale or wind-up of the company.\nSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that in effect it meant the \"taxpayer is likely to take the strain, so we might all end up paying a price\".\nA host of energy companies have gone bust over the last three months as wholesale gas prices have soared, affecting nearly four million customers. \nOn Monday, Ofgem said British Gas would take on customers from Neon Reef and Social Energy Supply, which went bust last week. The two firms had a combined 35,000 customers.\nThe UK's energy price cap - which limits what providers can charge - has exacerbated the problem, firms say.\nJustina Miltienyte, an energy policy expert at Uswitch, said the failure of Bulb signalled the \"tipping point\" of the UK energy crisis. \n\"Ultimately this demise wasn't caused by a badly run business model. Instead, Bulb was choked off by the way the government decided to structure the current energy market with the price cap.\"\nBut Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said Bulb's fall into administration should \"focus minds on how the market operates\" and \"why so many companies have been allowed to operate so recklessly for so long\".\n\"The government has had to step in to protect customers from a failure of unprecedented size, and it will have to use taxpayers' money to do so,\" he added.\nJohn Arnold, a Bulb customer for several years from Potters Bar in Hertfordshire, told the BBC he was \"not surprised\" by the supplier's struggles given the current market, but added he was \"more than a little disappointed\" they had gone into administration.\n\"In my experience they have been a good company to deal with. I like their green credentials and their tariffs have been very fair,\" the 69-year-old said.\nDeborah Davenport, from Easton on the Hill in the East Midlands, said Bulb's customer service was \"absolutely brilliant\".\nWhile renovating her cottage which involved installing solar panels and a new gas supply, Ms Davenport said there were a few \"hiccups\" with meter readings and bills, but added Bulb solved the problems promptly.\nBulb was \"just really pragmatic\" to deal with, she said, compared to some other energy firms who she believes \"do not care about people\".\n\"I just thought I had a voice with Bulb.\"\nLondon-based Bulb, which caters to 5-6% of the UK energy market, said the gas price crisis meant it was unable to raise the financing it needed from investors to keep on operating. \n\"The rising energy crisis... has concerned investors who can't go ahead while wholesale prices are so high and the price cap - designed to protect customers - currently means suppliers provide energy at a significant loss,\" Bulb said on its website. \nBulb was founded in 2015 to compete with the Big Six energy firms and claimed to offer cheaper and greener electricity than its rivals.  \nIt grew quickly and launched divisions in France, Spain and the US, which will continue to trade. \nAccording to Bulb's latest available accounts, in the year to 31 March 2020 the company made losses of \u00a363m. It also had a \u00a355m loan facility due for repayment on 31 December this year.\nIn September, Bulb appointed investment bank Lazard to look into restructuring options, which reportedly included a joint venture or merger with another firm, and a cash injection from existing shareholders.\nRead more about the next best steps to take here."

      "tags": "NHS Lanarkshire,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Doctors treating Covid patients in Lanarkshire say they expect to see a further rise in hospital admissions after Christmas - but they hope it won't be \"another huge spike\".\nStaff working in the infectious diseases ward at University Hospital Monklands also told BBC Scotland that vaccinations were playing a critical part in stopping the health service being overwhelmed.\nMore than 100 coronavirus patients are currently being treated across NHS Lanarkshire's three acute hospitals, compared to more than 350 during the January peak.\nBut the site at Monklands is working at full capacity and emergency medics admit they are struggling to meet demand.\nFor example, every week since the summer more than a fifth of A&E patients have waited longer than the four-hour target.\nThe latest figures from Public Health Scotland show that 75.6% of patients at Monklands emergency department were seen within four hours in the week up to 14 November.\nThe figure is down from 78.3% the previous week.\nHowever, only three of Scotland's 30 hospitals are currently meeting the target of 95% of patients being admitted, transferred or discharged from A&E within four hours.\nThe figure for the whole of Scotland is 75.2% - an increase on the previous week.\nDr Fiona Hunter, who runs the department, described the workload as relentless.\nShe said: \"It's unprecedented pressure, unprecedented demand.  \n\"We have patients that have to wait in cars. We just don't have the room for them.  \n\"We really are not here for anything and everything, we are here for emergencies and we want to be able to see the sickest patients first and in a timely manner and we can't do that when we are overwhelmed by patients.\"\nDr Hunter also conceded her staff cannot offer the level of care they want to due to the pandemic.\nShe added: \"We used to be a well-performing site in terms of meeting the national figures, and now we are one of the poorer sites, and if you compare that with the number of Covid patients in Lanarkshire, I think you'll find there is a link there and we can't continue to see the amount we are seeing.\"\nAlmost all of the available beds in the hospital are occupied and about 15% of them are currently taken up by virus patients.\nIn the infectious diseases ward, they account for about half of the total. \nLast year the ward saw an endless stream of elderly patients who ultimately deteriorated and died. \nThis winter specialist consultant Dr Nick Kennedy said those being treated are typically younger and responding well to treatment.\nHe added: \"Nevertheless, it is a bit of a wake-up call if you're in your 30s, 40s or 50s because people are still ending up in hospital. \n\"We are still seeing young people becoming critically unwell and even ending up in intensive care.\" \nHe worries that it ultimately compromises patient care elsewhere. \nDr Kennedy said: \"An older hospital like this lacks side rooms, so it's trying to get the right patient into the right bed. \n\"One always manages one way or the other, and one always prioritises the acutely ill patients that come in the front door and they always get seen and they always get care.  \n\"But we want to provide excellent care, never mind good care, and that's the challenge.\"\nHe said that following a spike in hospital admissions in September, case numbers have levelled off for now.\nBut looking ahead, Dr Kennedy warned: \"My personal prediction would be that the next few weeks won't be too bad, but we are very apprehensive about what happens after Christmas and into the new year. \n\"People will be gathering, and there are lots of reasons why we can anticipate that community transmission of Covid will increase and we are anticipating that we will have an increase in the number of hospital admissions in the new year period. \n\"Hopefully not to the extent that we had last year. Hopefully it will be an increase rather than a huge spike.\"\nDr Katie Sykes is another infectious diseases consultant at the hospital. She said the ward has had to remain very flexible as the demand for high-dependency care has risen and then shrunk back.\nShe admitted: \"On a daily basis we don't really know what's coming next.\n\"We're in a difficult situation. Covid is still there and we've got flu that may come later in the winter and we don't know how big the flu epidemic will be this year.\"\nDr Sykes is genuinely worried about what could lie ahead.\nShe said: \"We're approaching this winter in a state where we're already broken. We've been working in crisis mode for nearly two years and there's a limit to how far people can go. They're really having to dig deep now.  \n\"Last winter was terrible but we worked as hard as we could to deliver the highest standard of care we could.  \n\"I think we'll do it again but there will be a cost, and probably that cost will be the wellbeing of staff, our family lives, our relationships and our lives outside work are probably going to suffer, but we will get through the winter.\"\nDr Kennedy said staff feel vaccinations are a critical part of stopping the hospital from being overwhelmed. \nHe continued: \"Although you know quite a number of people who get vaccinated do end up in hospital, what you don't see is all the people who don't end up in hospital. You've got about a 90% protection. \n\"Even if you do end up in hospital, you're unlikely to get as sick and you're unlikely to die and we feel much more positive as clinicians that we're going to have a good outcome if a patient is vaccinated.\"\nHe said even small increases in vaccine coverage of the population would make a difference to the pressures they are facing as they head through the next few months.\nCharge nurse Kerry Reid said they all know there won't be much time to celebrate over the festive season.\nShe recalled last year was \"really hard\" and added: \"Everyone's tired, missing out on family time, everybody's life's been put on hold for a long period. \n\"For nursing staff and medical staff it definitely won't be a normal Christmas.\""

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid-19 vaccine passports were introduced in Northern Ireland on 29 November.\nTheir use sees people providing a passport or proof of a negative Covid test result to access venues like nightclubs, pubs and restaurants.\nThe first two weeks of the scheme saw a grace period implemented to allow time for adjusting, however their use is now enforced.\nBut where do you get one, how do you use it and when do you use it?\nLast month Dr Eddie O'Neill, from the Department of Health, told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme that the majority of the public would accept that the introduction of the passport scheme was \"for a good reason\".\nTo begin an application for a Covid certificate you must first set up an account on the NI Direct website. If you do not already have one, this will require you to verify your identity with photo ID.\nYou must then download the COVIDCertNI app.\nAfter logging in, you will be able to apply for a travel certificate. These have been in operation in Northern Ireland since July.\nOnce your travel certificate has been approved, you will be able to upgrade and activate a domestic certificate. \nWhen activating your domestic certificate, you will be asked to take a selfie which will then be seen alongside the QR code each time you present your pass.\nYou will be provided with the domestic certificate \"within minutes\", according to Dr O'Neill.\nPeople who do not have smartphones will be able to apply for a paper version of the certificate by calling 0300 200 7814 between 08:00 and 20:00 GMT Monday to Sunday.\nAbout 200 staff work on the helpline.\nThose with a paper certificate will be required to show photo ID when presenting it to prove their identity. \nOnce identity checks have been completed, it may take up to 10 working days for the printed certificate to arrive, the NI Direct website says.\nOnce your domestic certificate has been approved, you will have two certificates on your app.\nThe domestic certificate is to be used when visiting any venue in Northern Ireland that requires it. \nThe travel certificate should be used anywhere outside Northern Ireland.\nIt  will apply for access to:\n\"It's basically high-risk venues where [the Northern Ireland Executive] thinks the risk of transmission is higher,\" said Dr O'Neill.\nHospitality venues and other businesses where passes will be required for entry are able to download the COVIDCert Check NI app on smartphones or tablets.\nThe app allows QR codes from both the travel and domestic certificates to be scanned.\nIf the QR code is verified, the display will show a green screen containing a tick.\nIf the QR code is not verified, the display will show a red screen containing a cross.\nOnce they have scanned the QR code, staff using the COVIDCert Check NI app will only see either a green tick or a red cross, depending on whether or not the certificate has been accepted.\nDomestic certificates display the selfie you will have taken when applying for it, which staff will be able to use to verify your identity.\nThe COVIDCert Check NI app accepts EU travel certs, as well as the NHS vaccine certificates used in Scotland, England and Wales.\nPeople using the EU cert will need photo ID to accompany it.\nThe Department of Health has said that as an \"interim measure\" vaccine cards issued to people after their first vaccination can also be accepted as proof.\nCertificates proving that someone has recovered from Covid-19 will also be provided by the Department of Health, according to Dr O'Neill. \nHowever, the announcement about the introduction of both recovery and vaccine certificates has raised questions about fraud and if they could be faked.\nAt one stage Dr O'Neill said that about 30 applications have been made so far presenting fraudulent Covid-19 vaccine cards.\nThe QR code in the CovidCertNI app, along with a number of other measures, has been designed to prevent fraud.\nAs the screen of the smartphone is moved, the shading on the HSC logo will change, allowing staff to see it is not a screenshot.\nThe QR code displayed on the certificates also updates itself once a minute.\n\"If you take a screenshot and try to send it to one of your friends to use, the scanner will detect that it is fake,\" said Dr O'Neill.\nBoth apps released require operating system iOS 9.0 or later to operate on iPhones, iPod Touch and iPads.\nFor Android devices, the apps require operating system 5.0 or later.\nThe apps are available to download for free on Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store.\nThe Department of Health has said that proof of a negative lateral flow test in the previous 48 hours is another way to demonstrate Covid certification.\nEach test has an individual ID number that can be reported online (https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result) or reported via phone by calling 119.\nAfter a reporting a result, a confirmation email or test will be sent to you which can be used as certification.\nMr O'Neill said a solution was being drawn up to check those who have had a positive PCR test in the last 30 to 180 days and wanted to use it as proof of covid status.\n\"We are linking up with the test registry and will be able to get them a certificate which will look the same as those with the vaccine one,\" he said.\nSome people in Northern Ireland will have been vaccinated in a clinical trial, such as that run for the Novavax vaccine, which is currently awaiting final approval for general use. \nUK government guidance is that those who took part in Novavax trial and received two vaccine doses are considered vaccinated and the NHS Covid Pass app can be used by these people.\nHowever the COVIDCertNI app does not certify those jabbed in a trial. \nThe Department of Health says it is working on the issue and that QR codes for the app will be issued to trial participants before certification becomes mandatory on 13 December.\nIt advises that anyone who was vaccinated during a trial register now for an NI Direct account and that the department will issue communications when a date is confirmed.\nIn the meantime, the department says that those affected should have been issued with printed letters for domestic certification use and these can be used as proof of vaccination.\nHigh-level discussions about introducing mandatory Covid passports for domestic use in Northern Ireland have been taking place since late summer.\nAt that stage, few of the political parties supported the idea. In September, the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon proposed the move to other executive colleagues.\nIt was voted down at that stage, with ministers instead opting to put in advice around vaccine certification mitigations but this was not legally enforceable.\nMs Mallon and the Alliance Party's Justice Minister Naomi Long both said they wanted to see compulsory vaccine passports being introduced ahead of the nightclub sector reopening in Northern Ireland on 31 October, when social distancing rules were also scrapped in hospitality venues.\nIn mid-October, Stormont ministers published a contingency plan which referred to the \"potential\" deployment of Covid-19 status certification in \"higher risk settings\" but said it would require agreement from the executive.\nOn 1 November, the Department of Health released the COVIDCert Check NI app to allow businesses to scan vaccine certificates in hospitality and entertainment venues."

      "text": "Ministers are working towards making the unsolicited sending of obscene images via wi-fi or Bluetooth a criminal offence, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said.\nShe told MPs that \"cyber-flashing\" was likely to be \"within the scope\" of the upcoming Online Safety Bill.\nAnd she said that online platforms who failed in their duty of care for users would face criminal sanctions.\nThey must \"change their behaviours now\", Ms Dorries added.\nCyber-flashing involves the sending of obscene pictures using Bluetooth or peer-to-peer wi-fi networks.\nThis often happens while people are in public places, such as on trains or buses.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said last week that cyber-flashing \"should be illegal\" and the Law Society recommended, in July that a specific offence should be created.\nAsked about this when she appeared before the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee for the first time since entering the cabinet, Ms Dorries said: \"My information is that much of that is actually in the scope of the bill and included in the work that we're doing.\"\nCyber-flashing has been a criminal offence for more than a decade in Scotland, but is not yet one in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nQuestioned over whether digital platforms failing to exercise a duty of care for users should face criminal sanctions, Ms Dorries replied:  \"Absolutely, yes.\"\nShe added: \"It is the case that those online platforms can change their behaviours now. They can comply with their own terms and conditions now. They can remove harmful algorithms right now.\n\"They don't need to wait for this bill to come to the floor of the House [of Commons] to change the way they behave.\"\nDuring the two-hour evidence session Ms Dorries denied frequently using the terms \"snowflake\" and \"leftie\"\nAsked what her definition of a \"snowflake leftie\" was, she joked: \"Probably my kids.\"\nAnd then, asked what an \"Islington leftie\" was, she replied: \"Again, one of my kids.\"\nThe culture secretary also denied a recent story that she had threatened to cut the BBC's funding after Today programme presenter Nick Robinson told Prime Minister Boris Johnson to \"stop talking\" during an interview.\nThe Sunday Times had reported that Ms Dorries had told allies: \"Nick Robinson has cost the BBC a lot of money.\"\nBut she told the committee: \"I've never criticised Nick Robinson. I didn't hear the interview that I was supposed to have criticised and I never made the comment. It was attributed to me but nobody can actually say I said it.\"\nMs Dorries also described the decision to remove male and female categories at music's Brit Awards from next year as \"sad\".\nShe added that she was \"concerned in the future that women were not fairly represented in those awards\"."

      "text": "Rudy Guede, convicted of the 2007 murder of UK exchange student Meredith Kercher, has finished his sentence early saying he wants to be forgotten.\nGuede, 34, was the only person jailed over the notorious sexual assault and murder in Perugia, in central Italy.\nMeredith Kercher's American flatmate Amanda Knox and her Italian boyfriend were also initially convicted.\nTheir case ran through the courts for years before they were eventually acquitted on appeal.\nGuede's initial 30-year jail term was cut to 16 years and he has spent the past year doing community service. \nThe Ivorian national was due to be freed in January but magistrates in the city of Viterbo, where he now lives, granted him early release.\nHis lawyer confirmed to the BBC on Tuesday that they had received notification that the jail sentence had been completed.\n\"My initial thoughts are with Meredith Kercher's family who've been confronted by this painful affair,\" the lawyer, Fabrizio Ballarini, told Italian media.\nKercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca said that while Guede had served his time there was a moral issue about the length of the sentence.\n\"From a moral standpoint, of concrete and effective justice, clearly the term he served was very low with respect to the tragic nature of the event,\" he said, quoted by Ansa.\nMs Kercher, from Coulsdon in south London, had been in Perugia for three months on an exchange from Leeds University when she was killed. She was studying modern history, political theories and history of cinema.\nSince her death, her family has campaigned for the truth. Six years ago her sister Stephanie said they were unlikely to ever know what really happened.\nGuede left Perugia and travelled to Germany in the days after Ms Kercher's murder. \nAfter his extradition back to Italy he chose a fast-track trial, held in a closed session without journalists present, and was subsequently convicted of the murder after his bloodstained fingerprints were identified at the scene.\nHowever, he continues to deny murdering Ms Kercher.\nHe was given partial prison release in 2017, and his lawyer told local media after the ruling that his client was \"calm and socially well integrated\".\nOver the last year, Guede has volunteered for the charity Caritas and worked as a librarian at the Viterbo criminological studies centre, Italian media say.\nClaudio Mariani, a teacher at the centre, told Ansa that numerous media outlets had asked Guede for interviews but that he \"wants to be forgotten by the world\".\nMs Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were separately convicted of Ms Kercher's murder in 2009.\nTheir arrests and the guilty verdicts generated international media attention. The pair served four years behind bars before those convictions were overturned.\nAfter a number of appeals and retrials Italy's highest court acquitted them both definitively in March 2015."

      "text": "A Conservative MP has told the BBC she has been \"sent to Coventry by some\" after accusing the prime minister's father of touching her inappropriately.\nLast week, Caroline Nokes told Sky News that in 2003 Stanley Johnson had smacked her \"on the backside about as hard as he could\".\nAsked about the claim, Mr Johnson said he had \"no recollection\" of Ms Nokes.\nMs Nokes told BBC's Woman's Hour she felt \"absolute shame\" about not having spoken out at the time.\nFollowing Ms Nokes' accusation, Ailbhe Rea - a journalist for the New Statesman - also accused Mr Johnson of groping her, at a Conservative Party conference in 2019. \nWriting for the magazine, Ms Rea said: \"I didn't want Nokes to be alone in calling out something I knew hadn't only happened to her.\"\nIn an interview with Sky News, Ms Nokes said the incident took place at a Conservative Party conference in Blackpool when she was the party's candidate for the Romsey and Southampton North constituency.\nThe former minister said she remembered Mr Johnson \"smacking me on the backside about as hard as he could and going, 'Oh, Romsey, you've got a lovely seat'.\"\nMs Nokes told the BBC's Emma Barnett that the reaction to her allegation had been \"good and bad\".\n\"I've had some amazing support from constituents and women in and around Westminster, and I've been sent to Coventry by some.\"\nThe phrase \"sent to Coventry\" refers to giving someone a frosty reception, or simply not talking to them.\nAsked why she hadn't reported the incident at the time, the MP said: \"I should have called it out then and there... it will forever be my regret that I didn't do that.\nShe added that, 20 years ago she wouldn't have known \"how or to whom to call it out... I do now, I have a platform and a voice\".\n\"I don't want other young women entering journalism, politics or any other career to go through what some of my contemporaries went through.\" \nResponding to Ms Nokes' allegations, Mr Johnson told Sky News: \"I have no recollection of Caroline Nokes at all - but there you go. And no reply... Hey ho, good luck and thanks.\"\nMs Nokes described the reaction as \"a bit gaslight-y\" adding: \"It wasn't memorable to him, it was to me.\"\nGaslighting refers to psychological manipulation to make someone question what's true or real.\nDetailing her own allegation, Ms Rea said she met Mr Johnson at a Conservative Party conference in 2019. \n\"I gave him a warm smile - because this was the prime minister's father, a nice older man, and someone I recognised,\" she wrote.\n\"He smiled back, but it became more of a leer. As he walked past, he reached out to put his hand on my back. His hand slid down, and lingered too low and for too long.\"\nShe said she was \"surprised and confused\" and that her parents were \"shocked\" and \"sincerely hurt\" when she mentioned the incident to them \"in passing\".\nShe added that \"what happened to me never seemed important enough to risk saying anything more publicly.\"\nHowever, she says that changed when Ms Nokes recounted her own alleged experience to Sky News.\nIn her article, Ms Rea wrote: \"It was a courageous feminist act and I wanted to match that in the very small way I could. \n\"Caroline Nokes gains nothing from speaking out. I gain nothing from it either, except a marginally more difficult relationship with parts of the Conservative Party, and the discomfort of being a journalist in the story. \n\"But I see this as Stanley Johnson's problem... I have no doubt Stanley Johnson will attend many more receptions at Conservative conference. I just hope that, next time, he keeps his hands to himself. Hey ho.\" \nMr Johnson did not respond to a request for a comment from the BBC.\nAsked about the two women's accusations last week, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"Anyone who commits a criminal act we would not condone, but I'm not getting drawn in to allegations against an individual.\" "

      "text": "People in Northern Ireland are being urged by Stormont ministers to work from home \"where possible\" in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19.\nCurrent advice already states that people should work from home where they can but ministers said they were \"strengthening\" that message.\nIt follows an executive meeting about how to tackle rising infections.\nMinisters are also advising the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings.\nNorthern Ireland's infection rate has been climbing over the past week or so - it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland.\nIn England, since Covid restrictions lifted on 19 July, people have no longer been asked to work at home but businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to staff and customers.\nMost Covid restrictions have also been lifted in Wales, but employers are still encouraged to let people work from home where possible. \nIn Scotland, most restrictions have been lifted, but working from home where possible is advised. The government wants employers to consider long-term \"hybrid\" working models.\n\"Hospital admissions are rising and modelling indicates that admissions will increase further in the coming weeks,\" Stormont executive ministers said.\n\"The clear advice from public health experts is that an intervention is now required.\"\nIn a joint statement after Tuesday's meeting, Northern Ireland ministers said Covid-19 had \"once again taken a firm grip across our society\".\nMinisters said that if more people worked from home it would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace.\nHowever, they stopped short of ordering employers to facilitate home working, saying they \"recognise that this may present challenges in some work areas\".\nInstead, ministers said they were asking employees \"to work from home where they can and advise employers to support this where possible\".\nThe statement followed a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), who had recently said he believed anyone working from home last year when the pandemic began should do so again.\nHe has warned hospitality businesses may have to close over Christmas unless coronavirus transmission rates fall.\nFollowing Tuesday's meeting, ministers urged the public to take up the offer of vaccines and booster jabs, saying statistics were stark.\n\"Unvaccinated adults aged under 50 are almost 11 times more likely to need hospitalisation from Covid-19,\" they said.\n\"Unvaccinated individuals aged 50 and over are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those who are fully vaccinated.\"\nSpeaking after the meeting, First Minister Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was aware that restrictions had been \"acutely\" felt by the hospitality industry.\n\"We have to protect both lives and livelihood so we are working on the basis of having things open and safe,\" he said.\n\"No-one wants to be faced with a situation where business have to close,\" he added.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn F\u00e9in, said following the guidance was \"our best chance to avoid restrictions down the line\".\nShe appealed to those who can work from home to \"please work from home and for employers to facilitate that\".\n\"We want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,\" she added.\nWhat we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. \nWe know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required. \nThere was no mention of a return to lockdown from ministers today, but they also can't rule anything out. \nThe health minister has already warned that if we don't get a grip on Covid in the next two to three weeks, hospitality could again face closure at Christmas.\nThat, it must be said, remains the worst, worst case scenario and ministers will be reluctant to go there.\nThey'll hope the vaccination programme and ramping up of the booster programme in the next few weeks will help. \nMinisters are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year.\nThe executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. \nIn addition to promoting the vaccine message, ministers urged the public to \"make safer choices\" when coming in to contact with other people.\nThis advices includes meeting people outdoors in preference to indoors, wearing face coverings and ensuring good ventilation of indoor settings. \nIt is understood the Stormont executive has asked its Covid taskforce to examine issues around enforcement of wearing face masks.\nThe taskforce will also look at the potential of setting up a scores-on-the-doors type system to rate businesses on their compliance with rules and mitigations.\nMr Givan tweeted that the executive had \"engaged constructively and agreed a number of measures that will step up our collective efforts against the spread of Covid\".\nEarlier, Justice Minister Naomi Long said Stormont ministers may have to reintroduce some Covid-19 restrictions if there are \"no alternatives\".\nShe said the executive was \"looking for ways that we can avoid having to take those drastic measures\" by focusing on measures such as the vaccine booster programme and Covid certification \"to make high-risk venues as safe as possible\".\nMrs Long, the Alliance Party leader, said on Monday that ministers were \"not planning for Christmas closures\".\nOn Tuesday, she told BBC News NI that there was a \"critical period\" ahead and \"we still have it within our gift\" to avoid the need for restrictions.\nHowever, Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster, which represents the hospitality industry, said the \"rhetoric\" coming from Stormont was unhelpful.\n\"I appreciate that planning has to go on behind closed doors,\" he said, but added that politicians were making \"half statements\" with no promise of support if tighter restrictions are imposed.\n\"Those statements say to our workers: 'You might not have a job before Christmas' and it says to customers: 'Stay away'.\"\nThe executive met on Tuesday amid a high number of cases of Covid-19.\nOn Tuesday, four Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland and a further 1,476 new cases.\nLast week ministers voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports being introduced in Northern Ireland.\nThe proof of certification scheme will require people to provide a passport or proof of a negative Covid test result to access venues such as nightclubs, pubs and restaurants.\nBBC News NI understands that a debate on the Covid passport regulations could happen at Stormont on 6 or 7 December. \nThe measure is due to take effect from 29 November.\nBut it will not be enforced until 13 December, as a two-week grace period will take place to allow time for businesses and customers to adjust to the change. \nThe DUP -

      "tags": "Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is to announce whether Scotland's vaccine passport system will be expanded to cover more venues.\nThe government has said that widening existing restrictions could be the only alternative to a new lockdown if Covid-19 cases rise during the winter period.\nBut some business groups and opposition parties have argued against the move.\nThe first minister will agree a decision with her cabinet on Tuesday morning, before announcing it to MSPs at Holyrood in the afternoon.\nIf agreed, the vaccine certification scheme would be extended to cinemas, theatres and other as yet unspecified hospitality venues from 6 December.\nMs Sturgeon previously told MSPs that exactly which businesses could be affected would be decided \"on the basis of the data and the evidence\".\nSince October, people in Scotland have been required to show proof of vaccination to enter nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches.\nThe government is considering extending this to other settings - as well as strengthening rules around the wearing of face coverings and home working - amid concerns about pressure on the health services over winter.\nMinisters published an evidence paper which said Scotland faced a choice between containing the spread of the virus by \"closing venues, limiting group sizes and advising people not to meet\", or by expanding the vaccine passport scheme.\nIt said further use of certification would \"enable people to meet up in a lower risk way\" because it would become less likely that an infectious person would be present in a crowded setting.\nHospitality bosses have warned that pubs and restaurants could face an \"avalanche of cancellations\" if the certification scheme is extended over the normally busy Christmas period.\nScottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron said firms might back an expansion if there was \"clear\" evidence in favour of one, but said: \"We remain unconvinced at this time that the public health benefits outweigh the negatives for individuals, businesses and the economy.\"\nThe government paper conceded that a \"significant number of businesses and organisations\" could be affected and face increased costs - noting that nightclubs had reported \"substantial turnover losses\" since the current rules came into force.\nHowever, it said this would still be preferable to venues having to close entirely due to the return of lockdown restrictions.\nAnd it said requiring certification might convince people who are currently \"indifferent\" about vaccination to get jabbed.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there was no evidence that certification \"actually works\".\nHe told BBC Scotland that it was \"absolutely wrong to be putting this added pressure and burden on to businesses at such short notice\".\nMeanwhile Scottish Labour has urged the government to let people provide a negative test result instead of a vaccine certificate - as is the case in most other countries which have a certification scheme.\nAnd the Liberal Democrats have called for the use of lateral flow tests to replace vaccine passports entirely, citing the example of the COP26 conference in Glasgow as a success of using testing only.\nMinisters are considering including testing in the system, with Ms Sturgeon telling MSPs last week that this was a \"finely-balanced judgement\".\nShe added: \"We want, if possible, businesses to stay fully open over Christmas and through the winter, while keeping Covid under control. \n\"If an expansion of vaccination certification can help us to do that, it would be irresponsible not to consider it.\""

      "title": "Childcare: One in three NI providers 'plans to raise prices'",
      "tags": "NI economy,Childcare",
      "text": "One in three childcare providers in Northern Ireland is planning to put up prices as they struggle with rising costs, a survey has suggested. \nThe survey was carried out by social enterprise Employers For Childcare and received more than 2,200 responses from parents and childcare providers. \nIt found almost a third of childcare providers described their current financial position as \"distressed\".\nSome said that they were facing immediate risk of closure.\nAt the same time, about a quarter of families - 28% - said they were struggling to find and pay for the childcare they need. \nThe research suggested the average cost of a full-time childcare place in Northern Ireland was \u00a3170 per week - the equivalent of 34% of the median weekly household income in Northern Ireland.  \nAoife Hamilton, the enterprise's head of charity services, said: \"Childcare providers are facing unprecedented challenges - in recruiting and retaining staff and meeting salaries, particularly with the increase announced to the National Living Wage, as well as rising food and energy costs and uncertainty over numbers and occupancy levels.\n\"We have been reporting on childcare in Northern Ireland for over a decade and for many years, parents and childcare providers have been telling us about the issues they face, but this is the most worrying picture yet.\" \nThe affect of Covid-19 on the sector means one in two parents (51%) who took part in the survey said the pandemic had changed their childcare requirements. \nIn 2021, families reported using an average of 39 hours of childcare per week, down from 42 hours in 2020. \nAlicia Lappin is among the working parents who are concerned about rising childcare costs.\nThe mother of four from Portadown, County Armagh, would like to return to work full time, but said \"the cost of childcare doesn't allow me to do it\".\n\"Year on year, it seems that my pay packet goes up pennies but the childcare seems to go up pounds... every single year it's a bit more,\" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"It's got to the stage where I've had to make my hours part time in order to be able to cover the cost of childcare - it doesn't financially pay me to be there full time.\"\nHer children are aged nine, seven, four and 15 months.  With the eldest three in school or nursery, she currently pays for day care for her youngest child.\nShe pays about \u00a375 for him for 15 hours a week while she is at work.\nThe centre is run by a social enterprise and Ms Lappin admits it is \"relatively cheap compared to what other people are paying\" but the bill is still a \"huge proportion\" of her part-time wage.\nBy the time she factors in other work-related outgoings such as fuel costs, parking and tax, there is very little left.\n\"I don't work for the money at the minute.  I'm working because I want my foot in the door, I don't want to lose my position and I'm working because I love what I do,\" she said. \nSpeaking on the same programme, childcare provider Diane Koplewsky said her industry was facing rising costs and currently has no choice but to pass them on to customers.\nShe is the co-owner of the Sleepy Hollow Group which is one of Northern Ireland's biggest childcare companies, operating across 18 locations. \n\"As household costs increase, so do business costs,\" she said.\n\"Our PPE, cleaning, hygiene costs have all increased and ironically, so has our insurance even though insurers didn't pay out when we had to close.\n\"So the cost of operating a childcare business has never been higher.\"\nMs Koplewsky called for more government support for her industry so that childcare costs are no longer a barrier to employment for parents.\n\"Childcare needs to be valued as essential element of the economic infrastructure and we need to fund it as such,\" she said.\n\"We aren't seeing any level of investment in childcare here - working parents deserve it, childcare providers deserve it and so do our workforce. \n\"Our workforce need to be valued for their role in care, we need to be valued as early educators.\"\nMs Koplewsky said childcare providers \"do not want to increase fees\" because they know the challenges facing working parents.\nHowever, she said their only source of income at the moment is parents' fees and these may have to rise if there is no government investment.\n\"Nobody wants to increase costs but what else are we to do if we don't get funding from the executive?\"\nMaria McDonagh who owns Adventures Day Nursery in west Belfast said she has been left with no other choice but to increase fees. \nShe said: \"For us to be able to remain in business, we are probably looking at up to a 15% increase - 10% should cover wage increases and increases in the cost of providing food and activities and resources, but the energy costs will be the remaining hike that we have to look at this year.\"\nDad-of-two Liam Mahaffy saw his childcare provider close its doors last month.\nHe said: \"It's very sad for my son, the friends he had made there, they are all going to separate places now so it will be hard to maintain those friendships. It is very upsetting for the staff, they were absolutely brilliant the whole time.\"\nHis partner is currently on maternity leave so while their current bill is significant, it is likely to increase next year.\nHe said: \"It literally is, for us, a second mortgage, and that's just for three days a week. In another seven months' time, there will be a second one going into childcare so hopefully that's not a third mortgage.\n\"When my partner goes back after maternity leave, she might have to reduce her hours. I will be looking after them two days a week. It definitely does impact more, unfortunately, on women's employment prospects.\""

      "tags": "Scottish government,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland is facing a choice between extending the vaccine passport scheme and lockdown-style restrictions, the Scottish government has said. \nA final decision on whether to extend certification will be made on Tuesday.\nBut a new evidence paper claims that to \"suppress the virus further\" there is a choice between limiting social contacts or requiring passports at more hospitality venues. \nAny extension to the scheme would start on 6 December.\nCovid case numbers are currently much lower than during the most recent peak in August, but they have been slowly climbing again in recent weeks. \nThe Scottish government is worried about the impact this could have on the NHS over winter.\nCinemas, theatres and cafes could be among the venues affected by tougher rules which they claim would have a \"devastating impact\" on business.\nThe Scottish government evidence paper on vaccine certification states: \"To suppress the virus further we are now faced with a choice.\n\"This is to limit social contacts and the risk of infection by limiting social contacts by closing venues, limiting group sizes and advising people not to meet each other. \n\"Alternatively we can enable people to meet up in a lower risk way by using certification to reduce the risk that an infectious person will be present in a higher risk setting.\"\nThe Scottish government is also considering whether a negative lateral flow Covid test result could be provided instead of proof of vaccination, as happens in most other countries that have introduced vaccine passports.\nThe paper says this \"has advantages\" but warns these types of tests \"have limitations regarding their sensitivity\". \nIn addition, the paper states a \"significant number of businesses and organisations\" would be affected by any extension of the scheme, primarily through extra costs. \nEmploying and training more staff and supplying hardware to scan the passports were highlighted as potential cost factors, alongside a loss in revenue from cancelled tickets to events and customers choosing to go somewhere a passport is not required.\nBut the report claims the costs incurred would be better than the alternative - which could see the return of restrictions or even closure because of a Covid-induced lockdown.\nThe paper also suggests that research evidence \"indicates including a wider range of settings may increase the usefulness of certification as a measure to reduce infection\".\nIt adds: \"Wider international evidence suggests that expanding the settings included in any certification scheme may encourage older individuals who are not yet vaccinated to take up the vaccine.\n\"While certification is unlikely to convince the most vaccine hesitant to be vaccinated, it may convince those who are currently indifferent.\"\nIntroduced in October, the current passport scheme only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches.\nScottish ministers said at the time of the scheme's launch that its purpose was to drive up vaccination rates among younger people.\nThe Scottish government paper states the current scheme has \"likely contributed to a small rise in vaccinations amongst the younger age group\". \nDeputy First Minister John Swinney said: \"With cases rising gradually and pressures on our NHS, our approach is to keep people safe and get through a challenging winter without having to re-introduce any restrictions.\n\"Our vaccine certification scheme is working well, with venues and events affected continuing to operate and more than 1.5 million downloads of the NHS Covid status app so far.\n\"We want businesses to remain open throughout the Christmas period so it is sensible to consider options available to expand Covid certification.\"\nBut Scottish Conservative Covid recovery spokesman, Murdo Fraser MSP, said: \"John Swinney continues to insists that the SNP's vaccine certification scheme is working well, yet in almost 70 pages of their so-called evidence document, the SNP government have failed to provide concrete proof of the scheme's effectiveness.\n\"In contrast, the devastating impact on businesses is all too clear.\n\"The SNP government has admitted that night-time venues have faced significant trade losses, rising costs and increased abuse of staff as a result of the existing scheme. Yet they are still considering extending the requirements to over 17,000 additional businesses.\"\nBBC Scotland is keen to hear what questions you have about vaccine passports. \nThe Scottish government's scheme came into effect in October, and on Tuesday the first minister will announce whether the scheme is to be expanded.\nAny changes would come into effect on 6 December. It could extend the scheme to indoor cinemas, theatres and some other licensed and hospitality premises.\nUntil now, the scheme has covered nightclubs and large events. \nSo, if there's something you'd like to know about the scheme then fill in the form below to send us your question. \nOur team of experts and journalists will do their best to answer your question.\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "America's three largest pharmacies have been found to be liable for helping fuel a painkiller crisis in two Ohio counties, in a landmark  case.\nA federal court found that actions by Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS, and Walmart helped create an oversupply of addictive opioid pills.\nThe scale of compensation, to be paid to the two Ohio counties, will be decided at a future hearing.\nCVS said it would appeal against the judgement.\nThe other retailers, who all contested the cases, did not immediately comment.\nOver the last two decades, millions of Americans have become addicts through over-prescription and abuse of legal opiate-based painkillers such as Fentanyl and OxyContin.\nNearly 500,000 deaths were attributed to painkiller overdoses between 1999 and 2019.\nLocal and state governments say the painkiller epidemic put huge strain on their resources as they tried to tackle it through social programmes and the legal system.\nThere are around 3,300 other cases being brought in an attempt to recoup some of those costs from firms that profited from the sales of the painkillers.\nAs well as the pharmacy chains, big pharmaceutical companies and medical professionals have been accused of turning a blind eye to the problem. \nLawyers for the two Ohio counties, Lake and Trumbull, said the costs are potentially $1bn for each county, to cover social and legal expenses related to the impact of the opioid epidemic.\n\"The judgement today against Walmart, Walgreens and CVS represents the overdue reckoning for their complicity in creating a public nuisance,\" they said in a joint statement.\nThey argued that the pharmacies created a public nuisance by failing to ensure opioid prescriptions were valid allowing excessive quantities of addictive pain pills to flood their communities.\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, CVS and Walmart denied the allegations, saying they had taken steps to prevent painkillers being diverted from their intended legal use.\nCVS in a statement said it strongly disagreed with the verdict and would appeal.\n\"As plaintiffs' own experts testified, many factors have contributed to the opioid abuse issue, and solving this problem will require involvement from all stakeholders in our healthcare system and all members of our community,\" CVS said.\nOther cases around the country are relying on the \"public nuisance\" argument to target the companies involved in making and distributing the opioid painkillers.\nHowever earlier this month courts in Oklahoma and California rejected it as a legal argument in cases against drugs makers."

      "text": "The conviction of a fourth member of the so-called Stockwell Six, wrongly jailed for allegedly attempting to rob a corrupt policeman, has been quashed. \nTexo Johnson, 67, was one of five young black men arrested after leaving Stockwell station on 18 February 1972.\nThree others had their convictions overturned in July.\nMr Johnson's solicitor Jenny Wiltshire said: \"Texo has lived his entire adult life with this hanging over him and time has not lessened his ordeal.\"\nShe added: \"He has said that the pain of what happened still lingers and that it is something he will take to his grave. This didn't need to be the case.\"\nMr Johnson, who now lives in the US, was not present at the Court of Appeal hearing in the Royal Courts of Justice on Tuesday.\nSir Julian Flaux, sitting with Lord Justice Dingemans and Lady Justice Andrews, said it is \"most unfortunate that it has taken nearly 50 years to rectify the injustice suffered\".\nThe men, all aged between 17 and 20 at the time, were accused of trying to rob British Transport Police (BTP) officer Derek Ridgewell, who was in plain clothes.\nThey were travelling on the London Underground from Stockwell station in south London, when Ridgewell claimed they attempted to rob him, before he fought back and arrested them with a team of undercover officers.\nAlthough each of the six pleaded not guilty, five were convicted and sent to jail or borstal, a youth detention centre, despite telling jurors that police officers had lied and subjected them to violence and threats.\nThe sixth member, Everet Mullins, was acquitted because it was shown that his reading ability was not good enough for him to have read and fully understood his signed statement, which was written for him by Ridgewell.\nCourtney Harriot, Paul Green and Cleveland Davidson, also now in their late 60s, saw their convictions ruled unsafe by the court in July.\nThe Stockwell Six case was the third time Ridgewell's corruption had led to wrongful convictions being overturned by the Court of Appeal.\nRidgewell was involved in a number of high-profile and controversial cases in the early 1970s, culminating in the 1973 acquittals of the \"Tottenham Court Road Two\" - two young Jesuits studying at Oxford University.\nHe was then moved into a department investigating mailbag theft, where he joined up with two criminals with whom he split the profits of stolen mailbags.\nRidgewell was eventually caught and jailed for seven years, dying of a heart attack in prison in 1982 at the age of 37.\nIn December 2019, three members of the \"Oval Four\" - who were arrested at Oval Underground station in 1972 and accused of stealing handbags by Ridgewell's \"mugging squad\" - also had their convictions overturned. \nThe final member was cleared in March 2020 prompting calls for a \"wholesale review\" of all cases linked to Ridgewell.\nMs Wiltshire added: \"The British Transport Police knew about Det Sgt Ridgewell's corruption in 1973 but it took until this year for the force to undertake any review of this officer's cases.\n\"Considering this huge delay - and the potential it created for material to get lost - it is unsurprising that the force's available records have revealed no further mischief to be unravelled.\n\"I sincerely hope that the police's internal review of Det Sgt Ridgwell's actions was as thorough as it could have been and that there aren't other victims who had to yet to achieve the justice they deserve.\" "

      "tags": "Flexible working,Employment,UK economy,Banking,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The online bank Atom Bank has introduced a four-day work week for its 430 staff without cutting their pay. \nEmployees now work 34 hours over four days and get Monday or Friday off, when previously they clocked up 37.5 hours across the whole week.\nBoss Mark Mullen told the BBC it was inspired by the pandemic and would help improve wellbeing and retain staff.\nHowever, employees will have to work longer hours on the days that they are in.\n\"Before Covid, the conventional wisdom was you had to commute in, sit at a desk all day and repeat that process when you commuted home,\" said Mr Mullen, who has led the Durham-based bank since 2014.\n\"Covid showed us that it wasn't necessary\u2026I think doing 9-5, Monday to Friday is a pretty old fashioned way of working.\"\nAtom was one of the UK's first digital challenger banks and had \u00a32.7bn of loans on its books in the last financial year. Its new working arrangements kicked in on 1 November after a review found they would not affect customer service or productivity. \nMr Mullen said the new arrangement was voluntary, but strongly reflected his staff's preferences for more flexible working. \n\"Everyone is expected to stick to it,\" he added. \"I can't be sending my staff emails on a Friday, I can't expect to them to respond to them.\" \nWorking patterns have changed over time. In the 19th Century most British workers worked six day weeks, but in the 1930s Henry Ford in the US and pharmacy chain Boots in the UK popularised the two-day weekend as a way of boosting wellbeing and productivity. \nNow, calls for a four-day work week are growing amid similar claims that it could improve people's lives. \nRecent research found trials of a four-day week among public sector workers in Iceland were an \"overwhelming success\" and helped reduce stress and burnout. \nAnd Microsoft Japan said sales had been boosted by nearly 40% during an experiment in which staff worked a four-day week on full pay back in 2019.\nHowever, some employers believe it's not the right thing to do. \nIn 2019, UK science research foundation the Wellcome Trust scrapped plans to trial a four-day week for its 800 head office staff, saying it would be \"too operationally complex\".\nThe decision followed a three-month study which found compressing work into a Monday to Thursday window could negatively affect the wellbeing of some workers and harm productivity.  \n\"It is undoubtedly a positive move for employers to seek to reduce people's working hours without compromising pay,\" Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, told the BBC.\n\"However, I think the challenge of simply reducing people's working hours without other changes is that you can increase exposure to stress, which is already one of the main causes of working time lost to sickness absence.\"\nAtom is asking its staff to compress their hours into a shorter period, and proportionally their hours have not been cut by a whole day. But Mr Mullen said workers would still get paid the same and enjoy a \"three day weekend in perpetuity\". \nHe also hopes it will help attract talent at time when staff attrition at the bank is \"unusually\" high due to the pandemic. \n\"With Covid-19 causing vast numbers of people to reconsider how they want to live their lives, anything that leads to more productive, healthier, and, crucially, happier colleagues, is a win for everyone,\" he added.

      "tags": "Kuwait",
      "text": "The foreign secretary has admitted that Parliament and the public were misled for decades about a British Airways flight which landed in Kuwait during an Iraqi invasion in 1990.\nThe passengers and crew of BA 149 were taken hostage, with many mistreated. \nNewly released files reveal that the British ambassador in Kuwait warned the Foreign Office about the invasion, but BA was not told.\nThe government kept the warning secret for three decades.\nHowever, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss reiterated earlier denials that the flight was being used for a secret intelligence mission.\nFor 30 years, successive governments have covered up the fact there was a warning Kuwait was being invaded before BA 149 landed in the country and that this was not passed on.\n\"This failure was unacceptable,\" Ms Truss said in a written statement. \"I apologise to the House for this, and I express my deepest sympathy to those who were detained and mistreated.\"\nBA 149 took off from London at 18:04 GMT on 1 August, two hours late, and was due to stop briefly in Kuwait before heading on to Asia. \nBut files released today to the National Archives show the British Ambassador called the resident clerk at the Foreign Office around midnight with reports that an invasion of Kuwait had begun. \nThis was passed to the Foreign Office Middle East department and to Downing Street, as well as MI6, the Cabinet Office and Ministry of Defence. But British Airways was not told. \nThe call was not publicly acknowledged or disclosed until now.\nThe plane landed in the early hours of the morning. Less than an hour later, the airport was closed and the passengers and crew were trapped. Many were taken hostage. \nSome were mistreated, sexually assaulted and kept in near-starvation conditions before they were released that December.\nThere was no formal mechanism for passing on such information to British Airways at the time, but the Foreign Office says there is a procedure to deal with situations and inform the airline industry now.\nA British Airways spokesperson said the records \"confirm British Airways was not warned about the invasion\".\nThe files suggest the British ambassador was unclear whether the Iraqi incursion was limited or large-scale. The invasion also swept through Kuwait far faster than many expected when it first began.\nThe episode has aroused particular controversy because of persistent reports that a team of undercover operatives were on board the plane as part of a mission to be inserted into Kuwait to carry out surveillance. \n\"I am convinced that the military intelligence exploitation of British Airways Flight 149 did take place, despite repeated official denials,\" Anthony Paice, who was serving at the British Embassy at the time and has been previously named as an MI6 officer, said earlier this year.\nClive Earthy, the BA cabin services director on the flight, also told the BBC that he remembers a man in military uniform escorting a group of 10 men off the flight - who were then never seen again.\nHowever, the Foreign Office says the newly released files are \"consistent\" with a statement made in 2007 that the government \"did not attempt in any way to exploit the flight by any means whatever\".\nBarry Manners, a passenger on the flight, said he was disappointed the government had not used the opportunity to acknowledge the \"irrefutable\" evidence that the flight was used for an intelligence mission. \n\"This was a deliberate act by the British government to use a civilian airliner as a military transport into what turned out to be a live-fire war zone,\" he said."

      "text": "New powers to limit the creation of second homes and holiday lets could be given to councils in Wales next year. \nHomeowners might need local authority permission to convert properties, under proposals from the Welsh government.\nMinisters launched a consultation on changing the planning laws following concern about the effects of the number of second homes. \nOther ways of helping people on to the property ladder will be trialled in part of Gwynedd, starting in January.\nDwyfor, which covers the Llyn Peninsula and the area west of Porthmadog, has been chosen as a test area and \u00a31m will be available to buy and refurbish empty homes in the area.\nTwo officials will be appointed to consult people in the areas on what can be done to help the housing market. \nA report last year found more than 10% of homes in Gwynedd could be considered holiday homes.\nThere has long been concern that second homes price people out of the Welsh language's heartlands in north and west Wales. \nOfficials say they need more evidence about the problem and how to respond.  \nBut one second home owner warned that with so many second home owners being from England, Wales' housing policy was heading in a direction \"virtually bordering on racism\".\nThe consultation on changing planning rules will last three months and it could come into effect in the summer, officials say. \nIt could mean planning permission is needed to convert a home to being a second home or short-term holiday let in places where councils think \"they are causing significant difficulties\".\nClimate Change Minister Julie James said: \"We want young people to have a realistic prospect of buying or renting affordable homes in the places they have grown up so they can live and work in their local communities. \n\"High numbers of second and holiday homes in one area can threaten the Welsh language in its heartlands and affect the sustainability of some rural areas.\" \nIn a deal announced on Monday, Labour and Plaid Cymru promised \"immediate and radical action to address the proliferation of second homes\". \nAnother consultation into using the tax system to control the second homes market closed last week and the Welsh government is sifting through the responses before ministers decide what to do. \nIt could result in higher council taxes on second homes, or new restrictions on registering homes as businesses.\nJonathan Martin, who shares his time between his main home in England and a second home on the Llyn Peninsular, said the way Wales is heading on the homes issue is \"virtually bordering on racism\".\n\"The council tax has already doubled on my property in Gwynedd council and my information is that they would like that to go up to 300%,\" he said.\n\"What they want to do is to reduce second homes, not just contain what's going on - they want drastic measures which will probably be to do with taxation. \n\"You can't say this is fair, cannot.. if you're reasonable person. \n\"It's virtually bordering on racism - this is where this policy is bordering now. Eighty-five per cent of second home owners are English - you can't ignore that. \n\"Many members of our group are calling it racist. I'm not calling it racist and I don't think it is that yet, but it is so near and prejudicial. They can't see it and I really regret having to say that.\"\nPeople in Pwllheli said they were concerned about second homes, but some were sceptical about whether this latest initiative would help.\nTomos Coles said: \"I don't think this is going to make much of a difference, to be honest.\n\"It's happened in the past and nothing has solved the issue so I don't see how they're going to solve the issue.\n\"It's very difficult here, there aren't many good paying jobs around here, so it's hard to get on to the ladder here especially when people already have another house.\"\nCarolyn Green said house price had been an issue for decades.\n\"I've lived here for 40 years and I don't know how we can change because the wages aren't high enough - we haven't got industry and people aren't earning enough to pay big mortgages. \n\"But last year Covid came and if your house was for sale - it was gone.\"\nRachael Clear, 26, from Sale in Greater Manchester, holidays in Rhosneigr, Anglesey, every year.\nIt is not part of the test area, but experiences the same housing issues as Gwynedd.\nHer family rents holiday homes in the village every summer, used to own a caravan there and her mum and dad are thinking of buying one again.\n\"Rhosneigr for us is a beautiful place and the reason why we go is because it's so beautiful,\" she said.\n\"We know people there because we go so often but they're all locals there and it just seems so unfair that in most places like that you can't afford to live there.\n\"I think people find somewhere like that, people from England or from wherever, and they find it and they think it's beautiful and then they kind of plague it in some ways.\n\"I kind of feel guilty but the reason why we go every year is because it's kind of tradition from when my grandma used to go when she was younger.\""

      "text": "Online electricals retailer AO World has warned Xbox and Playstation games devices, and iPhones could be in short supply this Christmas.\nA global shortage of computer chips has hit availability of such items.\nAO warned that these shortages as well as supply chain problems in the festive trading period would hit its profits.\nThe retailer saw sales soar during lockdown, but that runaway growth has been halted by higher labour and transport costs.\nAO warned that the key festive trading period would be \"significantly softer\" than anticipated.\nOn Tuesday, the firm posted a half-year pre-tax loss of \u00a310m, down from an \u00a318m profit in the six months last year.\nThat sent AO's share price crashing by about 25% initially on Tuesday, although it had recovered slightly to stand about 15% lower by late morning.\nThe nationwide lorry driver shortage that has hit many companies remains a problem, AO said.\nIt had recruited about 500 new drivers to help beat labour shortages, but said it was still seeing \"meaningful supply chain challenges\", product shortages and higher costs of transport and freight.\n\"At the start of our financial year in April, we planned for continued revenue growth and built up our cost base accordingly,\" AO said.\n\"However, since then, growth in the UK has been impacted by the nationwide shortage of delivery drivers and the ongoing disruption in the global supply chain, and the German online market has seen significantly increased competition.\n\"As we now look to the second half, we continue to see meaningful supply chain challenges with poor availability in certain categories, particularly in our newer products where we have less scale, experience and leverage.\"\nIn addition, shipping costs, the cost of materials and consumer price inflation \"remain challenging uncertainties\", the company said.\nMany companies - from toy, food and clothes retailers to furniture giant Ikea - have warned of labour shortages, higher costs and disruption to supplies.\nAt the weekend, technology retailers warned that they may have insufficient stock to meet Black Friday demand due to delays in the supply chain.\nAO World, which sells a diverse range of electrical goods, including laptops, washing machines, and mobile phones, said the \"all-important\" festive period would be far tougher than it anticipated just a few weeks ago.\nIt expects underlying profits for the year to March of between \u00a310m-\u00a320m compared with a previous forecast of between \u00a335m-\u00a350m issued in October. Profits last year nearly tripled to \u00a364m.\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at online share broker Interactive Investor, called AO's problems a \"white-knuckle ride\".\nIn addition to supply problems and staff shortages in the UK, he pointed to issues overseas. \"The group's foray into the German market is not only in the early stages of establishing the brand, but is also being faced by significantly increased competition,\" he said.\nThe fall in AO's share price, which now stands at about 105p, will prove continuing disappointment for staff, who in 2020 were offered a generous bonus scheme.\nEmployees would share \u00a3140m if the price hit \u00a39.41 by 2025, and \u00a3240m if it went to \u00a312.55. AO's highest closing price is about \u00a34.30, reached in January.\nIn October, the government introduced special temporary work visas to attract more foreign workers to the UK."

She was a kind-hearted, generous woman who was never happier than when with family and friends around her. \n\"She loved her family dearly and we will never be the same. We are heartbroken.\"\nMs Fox-Roberts' body was discovered at about 14:45 GMT on Sunday. \nPolice officers and crime scene investigators remained at the scene on Tuesday, where a large cordon has been placed blocking the entrance to the cul-de-sac. \nPolice have searched woods behind Ms Fox-Roberts' house and entrances to the woodland near Newtown Llantwit Community Centre and on Heol Dowlais have also been taped off. \nOfficers searched the wooded area previously, but the force would not confirm what they were looking for. \nPolice officers also seized a car near the scene on Monday. \nDet Supt Darren George said: \"My thoughts are with June's family at this awful time. This murder has understandably shocked everybody in the village and surrounding areas.\n\"Our visibility in the village has been increased and I hope the community is reassured by that. Our presence will remain while this investigation is ongoing.\"\nPeople in nearby Beddau said there was \"significant police activity\" in and around the Co-Op store late on Tuesday morning.\nJodie Rees said she saw officers carrying what appeared to be evidence bags from a lane next to the shop.\n\"It was about 11:30, I looked out of the window and they were starting to tape up all the lane on both sides.\n\"Then I saw the police coming out with loads of blue evidence bags. There have been sniffer dogs up and down, there were about 12 police.\"\nCouncillor Sam Trask, who represents the Llantwit Fardre ward on Rhondda Cynon Taf council, said: \"June was a very lovely lady.

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Hospitality industry,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year with the aim of enabling events to go ahead despite surging Covid cases and encouraging the uptake of the vaccine in younger people. \nIt covers large outdoor events, which resumed this week, and venues such as nightclubs and those hosting large indoor events, which can reopen from 24 January.\nPeople over the age of 18 must show - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or have proof of a negative rapid lateral flow test (LFD) or PCR within the previous 24 hours, before they are allowed entry to certain venues and events.\nIf it is more than 120 days since your second jab, you are required to have had a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. \nThe scheme applies to:\nFor nightclubs and smaller events, all people entering should be checked. \nOrganisers of large events are being asked to review 50% or 1,000 vaccine passports of attendees, whichever figure is higher, \nAnyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt, as will employees working at the venues, people taking part in vaccine trials and anyone under the age of 18.\nThe government also said there would be no need for a vaccine passport to access public services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services.\nThe vaccine passport has been updated so that its QR code includes evidence of booster vaccinations.\nThe NHS Scotland Covid Status App is available on Apple and Android devices allows people to register, using their passport or driving licence to verify their identity, and then creates a QR code for each vaccination. \nThose who cannot use the app are able to request what the government describes as \"a secure, uneditable\" paper record. It has enhanced security features, such as thermodynamic ink to prevent forgery, as well as a QR code, and will be valid for three months.\nA QR code verifier app was made available to venues, enabling staff to check a customer's QR code.\nThose who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons will be able to show a document confirming that they are exempt. While under-18s are exempt from the scheme, they may need to show proof of age.\nPeople coming from elsewhere in the UK can show their vaccination status with the NHS App (if from England or Wales) or the Covidcert NI app (if from Northern Ireland) - or via paper letters of certification.\nWhile initially there was no clear definition of what constituted a nightclub, the government later provided some clarification.\nThe vaccine certification scheme applies to any venue that meets all four of the criteria:\nPotentially, a 200-capacity nightclub could be asking for a vaccine passport while a pub next door, with a larger capacity and music playing into the early hours of the morning without dancing or a designated dance floor operating, avoids having to ask customers for their vaccine status.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that the rules will be applied in a spirit of pragmatism. As an example, she said a venue required to check vaccine certification at night would not have to check customers coming in for a pub lunch 12 hours earlier.\nThe scheme in England applies to the same venues that are covered in Scotland.\nPeople can only enter if they can show an NHS Covid Pass confirming they have received two doses of an approved vaccine (or a single-dose of Janssen vaccine); a negative PCR or rapid lateral flow test (LFT) result within the last 48 hours; or proof that they have a medical exemption or are taking part in a clinical trial.\nIn Wales, people need to show their NHS Covid Pass or a negative LFT result within the last 24 hours to gain entry to cinemas, theatres and concert halls.\nPrior to the current restrictions, the scheme also applied to nightclubs and comparable venues, unseated indoor live events for more than 500 people, unseated outdoor live events for more than 4,000 people and any event for more than 10,000 people.\nThe Covid passport scheme in Northern Ireland applies to pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres - as well as nightclubs and large events which are currently closed.\nPeople can either show proof of vaccination, proof of a negative lateral flow test taken in the previous 48 hours, or proof of a positive PCR test taken in the previous 30-180 days.\nThe COVIDCert NI app can be used to show proof of vaccination, or a paper version can be requested."

      "text": "Online electricals retailer AO World has warned Xbox and Playstation games devices, and iPhones could be in short supply this Christmas.\nA global shortage of computer chips has hit availability of such items.\nAO warned that these shortages as well as supply chain problems in the festive trading period would hit its profits.\nThe retailer saw sales soar during lockdown, but that runaway growth has been halted by higher labour and transport costs.\nAO warned that the key festive trading period would be \"significantly softer\" than anticipated.\nOn Tuesday, the firm posted a half-year pre-tax loss of \u00a310m, down from an \u00a318m profit in the six months last year.\nThat sent AO's share price crashing by about 25% initially on Tuesday, although it had recovered slightly to stand about 15% lower by late morning.\nThe nationwide lorry driver shortage that has hit many companies remains a problem, AO said.\nIt had recruited about 500 new drivers to help beat labour shortages, but said it was still seeing \"meaningful supply chain challenges\", product shortages and higher costs of transport and freight.\n\"At the start of our financial year in April, we planned for continued revenue growth and built up our cost base accordingly,\" AO said.\n\"However, since then, growth in the UK has been impacted by the nationwide shortage of delivery drivers and the ongoing disruption in the global supply chain, and the German online market has seen significantly increased competition.\n\"As we now look to the second half, we continue to see meaningful supply chain challenges with poor availability in certain categories, particularly in our newer products where we have less scale, experience and leverage.\"\nIn addition, shipping costs, the cost of materials and consumer price inflation \"remain challenging uncertainties\", the company said.\nMany companies - from toy, food and clothes retailers to furniture giant Ikea - have warned of labour shortages, higher costs and disruption to supplies.\nAt the weekend, technology retailers warned that they may have insufficient stock to meet Black Friday demand due to delays in the supply chain.\nAO World, which sells a diverse range of electrical goods, including laptops, washing machines, and mobile phones, said the \"all-important\" festive period would be far tougher than it anticipated just a few weeks ago.\nIt expects underlying profits for the year to March of between \u00a310m-\u00a320m compared with a previous forecast of between \u00a335m-\u00a350m issued in October. Profits last year nearly tripled to \u00a364m.\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at online share broker Interactive Investor, called AO's problems a \"white-knuckle ride\".\nIn addition to supply problems and staff shortages in the UK, he pointed to issues overseas. \"The group's foray into the German market is not only in the early stages of establishing the brand, but is also being faced by significantly increased competition,\" he said.\nThe fall in AO's share price, which now stands at about 105p, will prove continuing disappointment for staff, who in 2020 were offered a generous bonus scheme.\nEmployees would share \u00a3140m if the price hit \u00a39.41 by 2025, and \u00a3240m if it went to \u00a312.55. AO's highest closing price is about \u00a34.30, reached in January.\nIn October, the government introduced special temporary work visas to attract more foreign workers to the UK."

      "title": "Social care: MPs back change to funding cost cap in England",
      "tags": "Jonathan Ashworth,Social care,Sajid Javid",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion.\nThe Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new \u00a386,000 lifetime limit on costs.\nLabour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change.\nThe PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system.\nThe cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills.\nUnder the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023:\nOn Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246.\nNineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead.\nThe bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. \nDefending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win.\nPushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament.\nThe Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. \nMr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a \"step in the right direction\" and \"an improvement on what we have today\".\nBut he said its plans for calculating the cap were a \"big disappointment\" and \"not as generous as people like me wanted\".\nAfter a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like.\nBut that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place.\nAnd on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable.\nThe vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own.\nRead Laura's blog in full\nUnder the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit.\nThe threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to \u00a3100,000 able to qualify, rather than \u00a323,250 currently.\nThe government announced last week that only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap.\nLocal authorities will meet care costs beyond the \u00a386,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded through a new health and social care tax.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care.\nSally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was \"sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment\".\n\"The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,\" she said.\n\"It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this.\"\nWhen asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: \"I can't predict individual situations.\"\nAfter the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: \"Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care.\n\"Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected.\"\nBut the prime minister said the new system would be \"progressive\" and \"much better\" than the existing one.\n\"Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of \u00a323,000 or more - now you get support if you have \u00a3100,000 or less, so we're helping people,\" Mr Johnson said.\nHe added: \"We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country.\"\nLorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent \"every penny that she ever earned\" on care.\nDespite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of \u00a3140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. \nShe says for her mother, 83, selling her home was \"probably the worst thing ever\".\n\"She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,\" Lorraine adds. \n\"Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances.\"\nHow will you be affected by the cap on social care costs?

      "text": "A teenager who was cleared of murder during racial unrest in the US has said his case \"has nothing to do with race\".\n\"It had to do with the right to self-defence,\" Kyle Rittenhouse told Fox News, adding that he supported the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.\nJurors cleared the 18-year-old of killing two men and wounding a third with a military rifle after accepting claims that he had feared for his life. \nA patriot to some and a vigilante to others, his acquittal divided the US.\nMuch US media commentary of the case dwelled on race, although Mr Rittenhouse is white, as were all three men he shot. \n\"No black teenager who kills two people and leaves one seriously injured, would be treated, no matter what the law says about self-defence, like Rittenhouse. He would be dead\", wrote Eddie S. Glaude Jr in the Washington Post. \nCNN commentator Van Jones said the decision sends a message to black citizens that \"there are two Americas\". \nMr Rittenhouse told Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight programme that his case \"never had anything to do with race\". \nHe added: \"I'm not a racist person. I support the BLM movement. I support peacefully demonstrating. I believe there needs to be change.\"\nMr Rittenhouse said the arsonists who razed businesses in Kenosha during last year's riots were \"opportunists taking advantage of the BLM movement\".\n\"I agree with the BLM movement, I agree everybody has the right to protest and assemble.\n\"But I do not agree that people have the right to burn down, I don't appreciate that people are burning down American cities to try to spread their message. I think there's other ways to go around and do that.\"\nMr Rittenhouse also said he thought \"there's a lot of prosecutorial misconduct, not just in my case but in other cases. \n\"It's just amazing to see how much a prosecutor can take advantage of someone.\"\nArmed with an AR-15 rifle, Mr Rittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded 27-year-old Gaige Grosskreutz, testifying that he opened fire in self-defence. \nHe had faced five charges, including intentional homicide. \nTwo nights before he turned up in Kenosha last year, saying he wanted to help protect businesses amid rioting, police had shot an armed black man, Jacob Blake, in the back, leaving him paralysed. \nDuring last year's election campaign, US President Joe Biden tweeted a video that appeared to link Mr Rittenhouse, without any evidence, to white supremacists."

      "title": "Covid: Can UK avoid a Europe-style return to lockdown?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid infection rates have started rising sharply in parts of Western Europe, prompting the introduction of fresh restrictions and lockdowns.\nIt has triggered fears the UK could follow suit. But there are plenty of reasons to believe Britain will escape the worst of what is being seen on the continent. In fact, the UK may well be in the strongest position of all to weather Covid this winter.\nTo understand why that could be the case, you need to look at the reasons why cases have started to take off in Western Europe.\nUnlike the UK - and England in particular - many parts of Europe kept major restrictions in place for much longer.\nWhereas England fully unlocked in mid-July, parts of Europe did not do this until the autumn, and in many places kept tougher restrictions in place even as they did. \nPart of this was to do with timing. The UK was hit by the more infectious Alpha variant and then Delta sooner, meaning it was in a position to push ahead with unlocking before others.\nBut it was also a conscious choice backed by the government's top scientists, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance.\nThe logic - along with the benefit of ending restrictions that themselves cause harm to health -  was that it was better to have the rebound in infection, the so-called exit wave, in the summer.\nIt was felt the increase in the spread of the virus would be mitigated by the better weather, meaning more time spent outdoors, and would avoid the winter crunch when pressure on the health system increases across the board.\nThe UK has, in effect, already had the wave the rest of Europe is seeing and has managed to avoid being swamped by it.\nThat is mainly because of the amount of immunity built up.\nA combination of good vaccine rollout, particularly among the older more vulnerable groups who are the ones most at risk of serious illness, and natural immunity from infection means there is likely to be a much smaller pool of vulnerable people for the virus to infect.\nResearchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been trying to quantify this by looking at what would happen if everyone was suddenly exposed to the virus in one go.\nThey modelled this for England - although there is nothing to suggest Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be any different - and 18 other European nations.\nIf this hypothetical situation happened, England would have by far the fewest people ending up in hospital - 62 per 100,000 people - because of immunity built up by vaccination and infection. That compares with more than 300 in Germany, largely because of their lower levels of infection to date, and more than 800 in Romania, which has struggled to convince its public to come forward for vaccination.\nThis was the picture at the end of October. If the same analysis was done at the end of November it is likely the situation would be even more favourable for England, says lead researcher Dr Lloyd Chapman.\nThat's because the UK is ploughing ahead faster than other nations with boosters. Again part of this is related to timing. As the UK was quicker off the mark with Covid vaccinations initially, there are greater numbers of people becoming eligible for a booster.\n\"We are giving those boosters to the very people who are most at risk at perhaps the best time - they will have the best protection in winter.\"\nBut Dr Chapman also points out this has come at a price - the high rates of infection have resulted in a greater amount of serious illness and death in recent months than many of our Western European neighbours.\nAnd he adds the research should not be seen as a guarantee we will escape the winter without seeing a surge in cases. \"We may be in the strongest position - but we could still see cases double and that would cause problems.\"\nBut is that likely? What is perhaps most remarkable about the UK is just how stable infection levels have been. Ever since the sharp rise seen in early summer peaked in mid-July, infection rates have bobbled along, small rises being followed by similar drops.\nThere is no other part of Europe that has seen Covid infections held so stable with very few restrictions in place.\nInstead, when other nations have seen cases surge restrictions have tended to be reimposed. This is happening now in parts of Western Europe and follows on from what happened in Eastern Europe early in the autumn.\nRomania, for example, saw a sharp rise in cases in September and October and reacted by introducing a night curfew, sending children home from school and introducing health passes for access to public venues.\nIt is telling that those nations that have had the most problems as winter arrives are the ones identified by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having the greatest pool of vulnerable people. How far this pattern spreads across Europe remains to be seen.\nBut immunity alone does not explain why the UK, and in particular England, has seen such stable rates, says Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the government's infectious disease modelling group.\nProf Medley, speaking in a personal capacity, believes it is more complex than that. \"I think we are seeing the public playing an important role.\"\nHe says a combination of limiting mixing and frequent use of rapid tests, which are more easy to access here than in many other countries, seems to be doing just enough to keep the virus in check.\n\"The government has passed the risk management to the public - and we've been able to do that better than other countries.\" \nThe big question is whether that will last throughout winter - Scotland and Northern Ireland are already talking about the possibility of tightening of restrictions. Prof Medley says it is \"delicately\" balanced, but with every passing week the chances are getting better.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "People in England with mild depression should first be offered behavioural therapy or group exercise instead of medication, according to new advice.\nThe clinical watchdog also recommends mindfulness and meditation as possible alternatives to anti-depressants in new guidelines under consultation. \nAnti-depressant use has increased in recent years - with an estimated one in seven people in England taking them.\nMore than 20 million were prescribed in just three months last year.\nThe draft guidelines, which are subject to consultation, say: \"Do not routinely offer antidepressant medication as first-line treatment for less severe depression, unless that is the person's preference.\"\nThey call on doctors to involve patients in conversations about what would suit them best, but say group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could be offered as a first treatment.\nCBT focuses on how thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviour interact, sets goals and teaches better coping skills.\nThe clinical watchdog, Nice, said people could be offered other treatments to choose from as part of a discussion about what may be contributing to their depression, and the person's experience of any prior episodes of depression or treatments.\nIt said the new draft guideline is the first in 12 years to identify, treat and manage depression in adults.\nA similar range of psychological interventions, along with the option of antidepressant medication, is available to those choosing a first-line treatment for more severe depression.\nDr Paul Chrisp, director of the centre for guidelines at Nice, said the new advice was urgently needed and called on the NHS to implement it \"without delay\".\nThe guidance also tells doctors to discuss mental health waiting lists with patients and how long they may need to wait for treatment.\nNav Kapur, professor of psychiatry and population health at the University of Manchester and chair of the guideline committee, said he hoped the new guidance would have a \"real impact\" on those with depression.\nThe guidelines also says medics should discuss what happens if people want to stop taking antidepressants, including that withdrawal may take weeks or months.\nA UK study in September in the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who stay on antidepressants long term are less likely to suffer a relapse than those who come off them.\nFigures from the NHS Business Services Authority show that more than 20 million antidepressants were prescribed between October and December 2020 - a 6% increase compared with the same three months in 2019.\nStephen Buckley, from the mental health charity Mind, welcomed the guidelines, but warned more funding was needed to deal with huge demand for mental health services.\nHe said: \"We are pleased to see a focus on withdrawal from antidepressants and a recognition that coming off medication may take weeks or months to complete successfully. We know for some; the process may take even longer. It's crucial anyone who chooses to stop psychiatric medication can do so safely, gradually, and ideally in collaboration with their GP, pharmacist, psychiatrist, or another health professional they trust.\"\nAlexa Knight, of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: \"Improved guidelines will not, on their own, improve people's experience of care or waiting times. As demand is rising, the range of treatments available and how quickly they can be accessed is ultimately dependent on services being adequately funded and staffed.\""

      "tags": "NI economy,Childcare",
      "text": "One in three childcare providers in Northern Ireland is planning to put up prices as they struggle with rising costs, a survey has suggested. \nThe survey was carried out by social enterprise Employers For Childcare and received more than 2,200 responses from parents and childcare providers. \nIt found almost a third of childcare providers described their current financial position as \"distressed\".\nSome said that they were facing immediate risk of closure.\nAt the same time, about a quarter of families - 28% - said they were struggling to find and pay for the childcare they need. \nThe research suggested the average cost of a full-time childcare place in Northern Ireland was \u00a3170 per week - the equivalent of 34% of the median weekly household income in Northern Ireland.  \nAoife Hamilton, the enterprise's head of charity services, said: \"Childcare providers are facing unprecedented challenges - in recruiting and retaining staff and meeting salaries, particularly with the increase announced to the National Living Wage, as well as rising food and energy costs and uncertainty over numbers and occupancy levels.\n\"We have been reporting on childcare in Northern Ireland for over a decade and for many years, parents and childcare providers have been telling us about the issues they face, but this is the most worrying picture yet.\" \nThe affect of Covid-19 on the sector means one in two parents (51%) who took part in the survey said the pandemic had changed their childcare requirements. \nIn 2021, families reported using an average of 39 hours of childcare per week, down from 42 hours in 2020. \nAlicia Lappin is among the working parents who are concerned about rising childcare costs.\nThe mother of four from Portadown, County Armagh, would like to return to work full time, but said \"the cost of childcare doesn't allow me to do it\".\n\"Year on year, it seems that my pay packet goes up pennies but the childcare seems to go up pounds... every single year it's a bit more,\" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"It's got to the stage where I've had to make my hours part time in order to be able to cover the cost of childcare - it doesn't financially pay me to be there full time.\"\nHer children are aged nine, seven, four and 15 months.  With the eldest three in school or nursery, she currently pays for day care for her youngest child.\nShe pays about \u00a375 for him for 15 hours a week while she is at work.\nThe centre is run by a social enterprise and Ms Lappin admits it is \"relatively cheap compared to what other people are paying\" but the bill is still a \"huge proportion\" of her part-time wage.\nBy the time she factors in other work-related outgoings such as fuel costs, parking and tax, there is very little left.\n\"I don't work for the money at the minute.  I'm working because I want my foot in the door, I don't want to lose my position and I'm working because I love what I do,\" she said. \nSpeaking on the same programme, childcare provider Diane Koplewsky said her industry was facing rising costs and currently has no choice but to pass them on to customers.\nShe is the co-owner of the Sleepy Hollow Group which is one of Northern Ireland's biggest childcare companies, operating across 18 locations. \n\"As household costs increase, so do business costs,\" she said.\n\"Our PPE, cleaning, hygiene costs have all increased and ironically, so has our insurance even though insurers didn't pay out when we had to close.\n\"So the cost of operating a childcare business has never been higher.\"\nMs Koplewsky called for more government support for her industry so that childcare costs are no longer a barrier to employment for parents.\n\"Childcare needs to be valued as essential element of the economic infrastructure and we need to fund it as such,\" she said.\n\"We aren't seeing any level of investment in childcare here - working parents deserve it, childcare providers deserve it and so do our workforce. \n\"Our workforce need to be valued for their role in care, we need to be valued as early educators.\"\nMs Koplewsky said childcare providers \"do not want to increase fees\" because they know the challenges facing working parents.\nHowever, she said their only source of income at the moment is parents' fees and these may have to rise if there is no government investment.\n\"Nobody wants to increase costs but what else are we to do if we don't get funding from the executive?\"\nMaria McDonagh who owns Adventures Day Nursery in west Belfast said she has been left with no other choice but to increase fees. \nShe said: \"For us to be able to remain in business, we are probably looking at up to a 15% increase - 10% should cover wage increases and increases in the cost of providing food and activities and resources, but the energy costs will be the remaining hike that we have to look at this year.\"\nDad-of-two Liam Mahaffy saw his childcare provider close its doors last month.\nHe said: \"It's very sad for my son, the friends he had made there, they are all going to separate places now so it will be hard to maintain those friendships. It is very upsetting for the staff, they were absolutely brilliant the whole time.\"\nHis partner is currently on maternity leave so while their current bill is significant, it is likely to increase next year.\nHe said: \"It literally is, for us, a second mortgage, and that's just for three days a week. In another seven months' time, there will be a second one going into childcare so hopefully that's not a third mortgage.\n\"When my partner goes back after maternity leave, she might have to reduce her hours. I will be looking after them two days a week. It definitely does impact more, unfortunately, on women's employment prospects.\""

The Home Office said 886 people arrived on Saturday, bringing the 2021 total to more than 25,700. The figure for last year was 8,469.\nHowever, increased security and Covid restrictions have made traditional routes less viable for migrants and the overall number of people to have claimed asylum in the UK in the 12 months ending June 2021 was 31,115, a 4% year-on-year fall.\nThe people who cross the Channel come to the UK from the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the world - including Yemen, Eritrea, Chad, Egypt, Sudan and Iraq.\nUnder international law, people have the right to seek asylum in whichever country they arrive, and there is nothing to say they must seek asylum in the first safe country. It is very hard to apply to the UK for asylum unless you are already in the country.\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the government decision to compel councils to take unaccompanied children was \"important\". He said it \"should reduce the unacceptable delays in vulnerable children, who have often experienced great trauma, getting the vital care they need\".\nHowever, local government sources say there are concerns about the funding councils - which are already under financial pressure - will receive.\nThe Conservative leader of the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, Councillor James Jamieson, said: \"These new arrangements must continue to swiftly take into account existing pressures in local areas.\"\nThe home secretary criticised Scottish councils in the Commons on Monday for the numbers of children they had taken.\nKelly Parry, an SNP councillor who speaks for the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, said they were committed to participating on a voluntary basis and were already providing a \"proportionate share\" of placements.\nAdditional reporting by Alex Kleiderman and Dulcie Lee"

      "title": "Will the cap really fix the social care system?",
      "text": "Ministers have announced a hike in national insurance to invest more in health and care.\nAs well as boosting NHS spending, the money will be used to pay for a cap on the costs people face if they need social care which includes help at home or a move into a care home.\nThe plan for England sounds simple - from 2023 no-one will pay more than \u00a386,000 for the care they need for daily tasks such as washing, dressing and eating.\nNo longer will people rack up \"catastrophic\" costs, the government says. \nBut as always the devil is in the detail. Much will depend on your individual circumstances, but there are a number of reasons it's not necessarily the silver bullet it may first appear. \nThe cap on care is just that - a limit on how much you pay for care.\nThere was no mention of it in the 33-page plan published - but the government confirmed to BBC News the daily living costs in a care home - those associated with food, energy bills and the accommodation - will not count towards the cap.\nThe government has not said how much people should be prepared to contribute for these daily living costs - care homes do not usually itemise them.\nBut previous incarnations of the cap - the coalition government first considered it - suggested people's contribution to these living costs should be fixed at \u00a312,000 a year.\nThat would mean when someone hits the cap they could still face \u00a31,000 monthly bills for living costs.\nIn many ways, this is understandable - after all, they would be liable for living costs if they remained in their own home.\nBut it would mean - based on the average care home cost of \u00a336,000 a year - only \u00a324,000 of the spending counting towards the cap once those \u00a312,000 living costs are taken off.\nThat would mean it would take the average care home resident more than three and a half years to hit it.\nBut the problem is not many people live that long once they move into a care home. \nHalf die in little over a year, with three-quarters not making it past three years.\nCare you receive in your own home will count towards the cap. \nBut this tends to cost much less and therefore people would normally need to be in receipt of that care for many, many years to hit the cap.\nWhat is more, spending on care will count towards the cap only for people assessed by the local council as in need enough to be eligible. \nOnly the very frailest qualify.\nAnd more than half requests are turned down - with the County Councils Network predicting this will not change significantly with the changes announced.\nThe only way to widen access would be spending more on services - it has been increasingly squeezed in recent years.\nBut councils worry the money being raised by the National Insurance hike will be largely swallowed up covering the cost of the cap and funding the NHS - a warning that has also been reiterated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its analysis of the tax rise.\nIf these fears are realised, it would mean the system remains on its knees with insufficient staff to provide the care people need, council leaders are warning. \nAnd it is why, according to Natasha Curry, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, the changes risk leaving the public and care system \"short-changed\", despite the eye-catching announcements.\nMinisters may certainly be able to claim they are the first government in more than 20 years not to have dodged the issue - but fixing the problem is another matter.\nFollow Nick on Twitter.\nRead more from Nick.\nDo you or a loved one require social care?

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "title": "Covid-19: Restriction decisions are back but what does the data say?",
      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "This was the week when Northern Ireland's politicians started to again make tough decisions to try to suppress the spread of coronavirus.\nOn Wednesday, the executive opted to introduce vaccine passports in certain circumstances. \nDUP ministers voted against the passports.\nExecutive ministers were also told that further restrictions may be necessary to protect the health service as winter pressures begin to bite harder.\nAnd the health minister, in a paper issued to the executive on Thursday, urged people to start working from home where possible.\nThese moves come in the context of increased case numbers, a relatively steady number of people in hospital with the virus and the highest death rate in the UK or Ireland.\nNorthern Ireland's infection rate has been climbing over the past week or so. \nIt is currently the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales - and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland.\nAccording to the latest official UK government data, these are the infection rates in the UK for the seven days up until 14 November (per 100,000 population):\nThe Republic's rate for the equivalent period was 546.4. It had been higher than Northern Ireland's until the last few days.\nWhile Northern Ireland's is slightly higher, the difference in the rate either side of the border is negligible.\nThe latest data from the Department of Health (DoH) indicates that Northern Ireland's infection rate is continuing to rise. \nThe obvious question is - why?\nThe answer isn't so obvious.\nIn short, it's probably a number of different factors coming together.\nWe have had fewer restrictions for a while now, with social distancing in bars and restaurants scrapped at Halloween.\nThe latest cluster data summary from the Public Health Agency (PHA) looks at the four weeks up to 7 November.\nGiven a time lag of about a week to allow for infections to show up, these figures capture the very start of any possible effects from the reopening.\nThe PHA defines a 'cluster' as two or more cases in a particular (non-residential) setting.\nWhen it's thought that virus transmission may have happened within a cluster - that becomes a potential 'outbreak'.\nThe vast majority of clusters and outbreaks have been in the workplace.\nIt's likely that the PHA's next set of data will better show any clusters or outbreaks in entertainment and hospitality settings.\nThe virus is being spread most notably by young people - 42% of infections over the past week have been in people under the age of 20.\nThis has been an ongoing trend but the numbers of positive cases in this age cohort have been increasing.\nThere is a particularly high proportion of cases occurring in those aged 10-14. \nThis may be down to a combination of a lower rate of vaccination and increased social interaction.\nUndoubtedly, fully vaccinated people are getting and spreading the virus.\nWhile vaccines are known to lessen the likelihood of transmission, they don't eliminate it.\nThat said, the recent increase in case numbers so far has not been replicated in the numbers in hospital with the virus (more on this below).\nThis is an indication of the vaccine doing its job in lessening the effects of the virus for those who do test positive.\nThe fact that we have been testing a lot more people does not, on its own, explain the rising rate.\nIn the past week, almost 94,000 people were tested, with about 11,300 getting a positive result.\nThis equates to a positivity rate of 12% - meaning about one in every eight people tested got a positive result.\nIt's worth noting that the Department of Health (DoH) now includes in its testing figures both LFTs (lateral flow tests - the ones you can do at home and get a very quick result) and PCR tests (the long name is 'Polymerase Chain Reaction' - these are the ones that are sent to a lab).\nBBC News NI asked the DoH about this. We were assured that, for the purposes of the figures, people who get a positive LFT and then a positive PCR would only be counted once.\nThe increase in cases also raises behavioural questions - are we now less likely to stick to the advice of wearing face masks, washing our hands and keeping our distance from others?\nIn terms of areas most affected by the rise in cases, the Mid Ulster council area is out on its own with a rate of 866 per 100,000 population, according to the DoH.\nThe area saw a massive 51% increase in cases - from 852 cases to 1,287 cases in the space of a week.\nOn the other end of the scale is Derry City and Strabane council area. \nThis time last year that council area had one of the highest infection rates in the UK - now the area is usually the lowest in Northern Ireland.\nGiven previous high infection rates - coupled with quite a good vaccine uptake rate - it's possible that the prevalence of antibodies in the area is high.\nThe short-term trend for hospitalisations is one of slowly falling numbers.\nThe long-term trend is one of consistently high numbers.\nLet me explain.\nOver the past two weeks or so, the number of inpatients in hospital has been generally falling, albeit very slowly - from 486 to 410 in that space of time.\nObviously, this is a good and welcome thing.\nBut let's add some context to that - the bed capacity in Northern Ireland's health system is around 3,150. But there are about 100 more people in hospital right now than we have beds to put them.\nIn any case, the fact that we have more than 400 inpatients with Covid means that almost 13% of people in hospital have the virus.\nIn Wales, this figure is 7%.\nNow let's look at the numbers of Covid positive patients in Northern Ireland's hospitals over a longer time scale.\nFor more than three months now, these numbers have roughly been between 400 and 500.\nThat represents a range of between 12.5%-16.6% of Northern Ireland's bed capacity.\nIt's a high rate - and enough to ensure a prolonged pressure on our health system.\nAfter a period in the late summer which saw a higher proportion of younger adults in hospital with the virus, we have reverted to seeing more older people.\nAt the minute, 74% of patients in hospital with Covid are aged 60 or older.\nHospital admission rates have fallen ever so slightly recently.\nIn theory we should see further drops in Covid positive numbers in hospital in the short term.\nLikewise, the numbers of Covid patients requiring intensive care have been falling slowly. \nThere are currently 33 people with the virus in Northern Ireland's intensive care units (ICUs).\nOf these about two thirds are ventilated - requiring help from a machine to breathe. \nAccording to the UK government's latest data on deaths, Northern Ireland currently has the highest death rate in the UK. \nIt's marginally worse than Wales, but considerably worse than Scotland and England.\nDespite increasing case numbers in the Republic, the death rate there remains lower than the UK.\nNorthern Ireland's seven-day rolling average for deaths is six.\nThis represents a fall over the past few weeks. However, there have been a few days when a disproportionately high number of deaths (more than 10) have been reported recently.\nThe silver lining in the fact that hospitalisations and ICU numbers are falling is that deaths should continue to decrease - at least in the short term.\nIn the medium-to-longer term, the death rate could easily be affected adversely by the increase in cases.\nNorthern Ireland has the lowest uptake in vaccinations in the UK - regardless of first, second, third or booster doses.\nInterestingly, there has been a marked increase in the number of first dose vaccinations given out in Northern Ireland over the past few days.\nOver the past week Northern Ireland has given out more first doses than either Scotland or Wales.\nAnd if we look at the few days since the executive announced the planned vaccine passports scheme, Northern Ireland has given out more first doses than Scotland and Wales combined.\nHere are the first dose vaccine uptake figures for people aged 12 and over in the UK:\nVaccine uptake is still lower in younger age groups, but has increased over the past six weeks. About 75% of 18-29 year olds have had at least one dose; in the 30-39 age bracket it's 80%.\nThe booster programme is now seen by health authorities as key to protecting hospitals over the winter.\nAccording to UK government data, Northern Ireland lags some way behind the rest of the UK in its rollout of boosters and third doses.\nThird doses are given to people who are clinically extremely vulnerable. At some stage in the future a decision could be made to give these people a further dose.\nBooster doses are for everyone else who has had a second dose at least six months ago.\nThe following are the uptake figures for third doses and boosters in the UK population aged 12 and over:\nIt's worth inserting a few caveats here.\nThe vast majority of people aged 12-39 are not yet eligible for a booster dose.\nEven if they were, most people in that age group had their last dose less than six months ago.\nAlso, according to the person in charge of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme - Dr Patricia Donnelly - care homes in Northern Ireland were prioritised at the start of the booster rollout.\nThis slowed progress somewhat in others parts of the booster programme but Dr Donnelly has said the booster programme is starting to speed up.\nThe numbers certainly bear that out - over the past four days or so there has been a noticeable increase in speed of delivery of the booster programme and the gap between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been closing.\nThe next few weeks will see a massive effort to close it even further."

      "text": "People in England with mild depression should first be offered behavioural therapy or group exercise instead of medication, according to new advice.\nThe clinical watchdog also recommends mindfulness and meditation as possible alternatives to anti-depressants in new guidelines under consultation. \nAnti-depressant use has increased in recent years - with an estimated one in seven people in England taking them.\nMore than 20 million were prescribed in just three months last year.\nThe draft guidelines, which are subject to consultation, say: \"Do not routinely offer antidepressant medication as first-line treatment for less severe depression, unless that is the person's preference.\"\nThey call on doctors to involve patients in conversations about what would suit them best, but say group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could be offered as a first treatment.\nCBT focuses on how thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviour interact, sets goals and teaches better coping skills.\nThe clinical watchdog, Nice, said people could be offered other treatments to choose from as part of a discussion about what may be contributing to their depression, and the person's experience of any prior episodes of depression or treatments.\nIt said the new draft guideline is the first in 12 years to identify, treat and manage depression in adults.\nA similar range of psychological interventions, along with the option of antidepressant medication, is available to those choosing a first-line treatment for more severe depression.\nDr Paul Chrisp, director of the centre for guidelines at Nice, said the new advice was urgently needed and called on the NHS to implement it \"without delay\".\nThe guidance also tells doctors to discuss mental health waiting lists with patients and how long they may need to wait for treatment.\nNav Kapur, professor of psychiatry and population health at the University of Manchester and chair of the guideline committee, said he hoped the new guidance would have a \"real impact\" on those with depression.\nThe guidelines also says medics should discuss what happens if people want to stop taking antidepressants, including that withdrawal may take weeks or months.\nA UK study in September in the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who stay on antidepressants long term are less likely to suffer a relapse than those who come off them.\nFigures from the NHS Business Services Authority show that more than 20 million antidepressants were prescribed between October and December 2020 - a 6% increase compared with the same three months in 2019.\nStephen Buckley, from the mental health charity Mind, welcomed the guidelines, but warned more funding was needed to deal with huge demand for mental health services.\nHe said: \"We are pleased to see a focus on withdrawal from antidepressants and a recognition that coming off medication may take weeks or months to complete successfully. We know for some; the process may take even longer. It's crucial anyone who chooses to stop psychiatric medication can do so safely, gradually, and ideally in collaboration with their GP, pharmacist, psychiatrist, or another health professional they trust.\"\nAlexa Knight, of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: \"Improved guidelines will not, on their own, improve people's experience of care or waiting times. As demand is rising, the range of treatments available and how quickly they can be accessed is ultimately dependent on services being adequately funded and staffed.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday.\nA plan to expand vaccine passports to cover more venues - including cinemas, theatres and hospitality settings - would be disproportionate and will not go ahead, Scotland's first minister announced. Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood that case numbers had fallen slightly and the data was \"more positive than we might have expected\". Instead, the system - which currently covers nightclubs and big events that cross certain thresholds in terms of audience numbers  - will actually be relaxed slightly from 6 December. People who can show a negative Covid test  - as an alternative to proof of vaccination - will now be allowed into such events.\nAs Northern Ireland grapples with the highest infection rate in the UK, Stormont ministers are urging people to work from home \"where possible\". Existing advice says people should work from home where they can, but ministers said they were \"strengthening\" that guidance.  In a statement, they said Covid had taken a \"firm grip\" across society and intervention was required amid rising hospital admissions. People are being advised to limit their social contacts and to wear face coverings in indoor public settings. \n\"Just get it done\" - that was the message from Stephen Baird after his 27-year-old daughter Rashelle, who was unvaccinated, died last week in hospital with Covid. The mother-of-three from Brechin, near Dundee, was not anti-vaccine but had put off setting an appointment for the jab because she had been so busy with her kids, Mr Baird said. Rashelle - described by her sister as \"kind, bubbly, and always the life and soul of the party\" - was asthmatic and initially thought she had caught a cold. But her symptoms worsened, she was admitted to hospital and died after several days in intensive care.\nDoctors at a hospital in Lanarkshire have told the BBC they are braced for a rise in admissions after Christmas and New Year. Staff at University Hospital Monklands, which is already at capacity, say they have faced \"unprecedented demand\". Consultant Dr Nick Kennedy said people in their 30s, 40s and 50s were being admitted, but they were responding to treatment. He said he was \"very apprehensive\" about the number of admissions after the new year. Dr Katie Sykes, another infectious disease consultant said staff were \"already broken\". \"We've been working in crisis mode for nearly two years and there's a limit to how far people can go,\" she said.\nAstraZeneca's chief executive has suggested its Covid vaccine, developed with Oxford University, may be playing a role in the UK's relatively low rate of hospital admissions, despite a high infection rate. Pascal Soriot told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that unlike much of Europe, the UK had used the AstraZeneca vaccine on many older people. He said his company's vaccine known to stimulate the T-cell part of the immune system to a higher degree in this group. Unlike antibodies, which wane over time, the T-cells are a more durable immune response, although they can take time to react to infection. So Mr Soriot suggests this may explain why the virus is able to circulate without causing as many hospital admissions as in some other European countries.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nYou can read more about how vaccine passports work in Scotland here, and find out about the similar schemes in Wales here and in Northern Ireland here.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Businesses need to \"step up\" and help ensure the use of face coverings in their premises, Justice Minister Naomi Long has said. \nA a health paper has suggested Mrs Long's department should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%. \nThe minister said her department did not have enforcement powers, adding personal responsibility was needed.\nShe said there should be a \"co-ordinated effort\" across departments to encourage greater usage. \nThe Alliance Party leader said the public needed to take \"personal responsibility\" for the wearing of face masks and adhering to other public health messaging such as maintaining hand hygiene and doing regular lateral flow tests.\n\"If we turn this into a just justice issue, then the automatic presumption is that it is for the police to enforce and it isn't that simple,\" the minister told BBC 's Evening Extra programme. \n\"We all have to take personal responsibility. \n\"Businesses need to step up too and say we will not grant admission to our premises, whether it's a retail environment or whether it's a cafe or restaurant, and say we will not grant admission unless you wear a mask and do the things we're asking you to do.\n\"Then if customers are difficult or abusive, that's the time the police can come in and enforce, but we cant reasonably expect the police to be in every shop, in every coffee shop, in every restaurant and in every setting.\"\nSince summer 2020, customers have been required to wear face masks in shops, on public transport and in a number of indoor settings - unless they are exempt.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann circulated a document to executive ministers last week with a range of proposals aimed at reducing transmission of the virus.\nIn it, he suggested that Mrs Long should \"take the lead in pursuing a minimum of 80% adherence to face coverings requirements, to gather evidence of this for the executive and to report of the number of fixed penalty notices issued\". \nMrs Long said she did not \"have a team of enforcers to send out even if I had the authority to do so, so it's not that simple\".\n\"There are a number of bodies that have an enforcement role, for example, the PSNI has a role, local councils have a role, the Health and Safety Executive has a role across the board,\" she added. \nStormont Executive ministers met on Monday to discuss the paper from the Department of Health.\nMrs Long said it was \"not unusual\" for departments to write a paper and then for other departments to give feedback and the paper be amended.\nShe said the issue had become a \"storm in a teacup\".\n\"The difficulty then comes when that paper is leaked and it looks as though there is a row between the ministers,\" she said.\n\"The ministers are all very much agreed that we need to see a step up in terms of personal levels of responsibility that people take.\"\nLast week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, then more \"severe\" restrictions could be required before Christmas. \nHowever, Mrs Long said the executive's focus at the minute is \"not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open\".\nIn a written response to the health minister's paper, the justice minister said she was \"at a loss to understand\" why Mr Swann suggested she take on responsibility for the matter.\nIn the letter to Mr Swann, seen by BBC News NI, she said a number of agencies were involved in overseeing compliance to Covid-19 restrictions including councils and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\n\"The PSNI will also, rightly, only enforce where necessary,\" she added.\nMrs Long warned that the executive had to be aware of the \"wider impact\" of expecting the PSNI to adjust its approach to enforcement.\n\"We have seen public confidence in policing being adversely affected whenever the public believe the PSNI are taking a disproportionate approach.\"\nShe said the police and other enforcement agencies were there to be called on as a \"final measure\", as the duty remained with businesses to encourage compliance. \nShe said: \"The idea that compliance can be solely or even primarily an issue for justice is fundamentally flawed, as recognised by previous decisions of the executive.\"\nMrs Long said she also believed a \"key problem\" in improving compliance was the lack of consistent messaging across the executive.\nShe suggested that ministers needed to agree several \"key messages\" on public health advice at Monday's executive meeting and promote them \"relentlessly\".\nMark Lindsay, chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, told BBC Radio Foyle that compliance can not solely be the responsibility of the PSNI.\n\"Police do have a role to play. It should not be misconstrued that police do not want to have anything to do with this, but it's about where we sit in the chain,\" he said.\nHe said funding a warden scheme could be \"a more effective way... than expecting police to step away from more urgent and risky situations to come and deal with this\".\nMeanwhile, Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, said businesses do not have the power to make people wear face coverings. \nHe told BBC's Radio Ulster's Nolan show: \"It is not our responsibility to police [it].\n\"Retailers and their staff do not have the power of sanction, they do not have the power to legally enforce what they have been doing and they have spent millions and millions on making sure their shops are safe, their staff are trained, their staff are safe, encouraging and reminding customers of their responsibility. \n\"If there is going to be enforcement, it is a matter for the police.\"\nOn Thursday, Mr Swann advised anyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year should do so again now.\nHis document also suggested introducing a \"scores on the doors\" Covid compliance rating for businesses.\nDecisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must be agreed by the executive first.\nHealth officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus.\nStormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade.\nThey have already agreed to put in place proof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December.

      "tags": "Olivia Rodrigo,Lil Nas X,Billie Eilish,BTS,Justin Bieber,Grammy Awards,Music",
      "text": "Olivia Rodrigo has emerged as the front-runner for next year's Grammy Awards, with nominations in all four of the main categories.\nThe 18-year-old is up for best album, best new artist, record of the year and song of the year, for Drivers License.\nShe faces competition from Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X in all of those categories, except best new artist.\nAbba also received their first ever Grammy nomination in the record of the year category.\nThe Swedish band are recognised for their bittersweet comeback single, I Still Have Faith In You, which was released in September.\nTaylor Swift also picks up her second consecutive album of the year nomination, for Evermore. She won the award earlier this year for its companion album, Folklore.\nBritish musicians are relatively thin on the ground, but Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits is up for song of the year; while Arlo Parks and Glass Animals make the shortlist for best new artist.\nColdplay also receive their 36th Grammy nod, for the single Higher Power (best pop group performance) and Paul McCartney is recognised for his lockdown album McCartney III (best rock album) and the track Find My Way (best rock song).\nAlthough relatively unknown in the UK, the jazz keyboardist Jon Batiste leads the nominations, with 11 in total - recognising both his eclectic solo album We Are and the soundtrack to the Pixar film, Soul.\nA member of a New Orleans musical dynasty, the musician says it is \"hard to put into words\" how he feels following the news. \"It's astonishment, shock, awe, gratefulness.\"\nJustin Bieber, Doja Cat and H.E.R. follow Batiste with eight nominations apiece. Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo are close behind with seven.\n\"Many dreams have come true for me this year but this one is probably the most meaningful,\" said Rodrigo on learning of her nomination.\n\"This is unreal!\" added Billie Eilish, who could set a record by winning her third consecutive record of the year award for Happier Than Ever. \n\"Such amazing news to wake up to. I could scream.\"\nMeanwhile, Korean pop sensation BTS miss out on the main categories, receiving a single nomination for pop duo/group performance.\nThe group's monster hit Butter, which spent 10 weeks at number one in the US, is nominated alongside Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga's I Get A Kick Out Of You, Justin Bieber's Lonely, Coldplay's Higher Power and Doja Cat's Kiss Me More.\nThis year's ballot also makes Jay-Z the most-nominated artist in Grammy history. \nHe had been tied with legendary record producer Quincy Jones on 80, but surges ahead with three new nominations, including two in the best rap song category, for collaborations with DMX and Kanye West.\nThe nominees were announced at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles on Tuesday morning, with help from Billie Eilish, H.E.R., Eurovision winners M\u00e5neskin and BTS themselves.\nWith almost 22,000 songs and albums submitted for consideration, the shortlists in the main categories were expanded from eight to 10 nominees for the first time.\n\"We're living in a time of extraordinary growth in music,\" explained Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason, Jr. \"Over 60,000 songs a day are being released. With so much more music available. There's a lot more excellence to recognise and celebrate.\"\nThe Grammys also made sweeping changes to their rules for 2022, after The Weeknd was controversially shut out of this year's awards.\nOrganisers subsequently scrapped dozens of anonymous committees that had the ability to overrule votes in 72 of the 86 categories, allowing rank-and-file voters to choose the shortlists instead. \nVeiled in secrecy, the committees had been accused of vote-rigging, favouritism and racism. Several high profile artists including Drake, Frank Ocean and The Weeknd himself, boycotted recent ceremonies in protest.\nThe change seems to have boosted the chances of artists with broad appeal, such as Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, whose duets album Love For Sale generated six nominations.\nThis time last year, Olivia Rodrigo was best known as the star of the Disney series High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.\nThen, in January, a few weeks before her 18th birthday, she released the lovelorn piano ballad Drivers License - which became an instant, but organic, global hit.\nThe teenager followed it up with Sour, a debut album inspired by the same heartbreak (allegedly her Disney co-star Joshua Bassett).\nShowcasing her piercing, precise lyrics and precociously accomplished songwriting, it saw her hailed as \"pop's newest icon\" and hit number one on both sides of the Atlantic.\nIn its incessantly hooky choruses, Sour embraced Rodrigo's musical inspirations, from Taylor Swift to Paramore. Both artists later received writing credits for their influence, and therefore share her album of the year nomination.\nIf Rodrigo sweeps all of the \"big four\" categories next January, she'll be only the third person in history to do so, after Christopher Cross and Billie Eilish. \nBut she faces stiff competition from Bruno Mars' impeccably-crafted soul band Silk Sonic and, of course, from Swift herself.\nThe so-called \"big four\" are the Grammys' most prestigious prizes. This year's field looks like this.\nAlbum of the year\nSong of the year (recognising the songwriters)\nRecord of the year (recognising the whole recording)\nBest new artist\nRead more: The main nominees for the 2022 Grammy Awards\nThis year, the Grammys are actually recognising a 13-month time period, from 1 September, 2020, to 30 September, 2021.\nEven so, that rules out some of pop's biggest new albums, including Adele's 30, Ed Sheeran's = and Abba's Voyage.\nAlso absent is The Weeknd, who is refusing to participate in the Grammys after being snubbed last year. Ariana Grande and Doja Cat also declined to submit their duets with the star for awards, in an apparent show of solidarity. But Kanye West didn't get the memo: His single Hurricane, which features The Weeknd and Lil Baby, made it onto the best melodic rap song shortlist.\nTaylor Swift also withheld her re-recorded version of Fearless from consideration. The original, released in 2008, is itself an album of the year winner.\nAnd Dua Lipa failed to submit her 4x-platinum chart hit Levitating, apparently to avoid recognising featured rapper DaBaby after he made homophobic comments earlier this year.\nCountry star Morgan Wallen also failed to receive a nomination after being filmed using a racial slur earlier this year.\nThe singer, whose album Dangerous is the biggest-selling country record of 2021, was ruled ineligible at the Academy of Country Music Awards, but had been allowed to enter the Grammys, only for voters to pass him over in favour of acts like Chris Stapleton and Sturgill Simpson.\nThe Grammys are ostensibly decided by the 12,000 voting members of the Recording Academy.\nBut for decades they were overseen by a shadowy group of \"secret committees\", who narrowed down the top 20 finalists in each category to the final shortlist of between five and eight nominees.\nThose committees were accused of corruption and insider dealing, most notably by ousted Recording Academy CEO Deborah Dugan, who said votes had been overruled and artists promoted onto shortlists without merit (the Academy called her allegations \"categorically false\").\nIt came to a head this time last year, when R&B singer The Weeknd was overlooked in the nominations list, despite his single Blinding Lights having become one of the best-selling songs of the century.\n\"The Grammys remain corrupt,\" he tweeted in response. \"You owe me, my fans, and the industry transparency.\"\nIn April, the Grammys announced the committees would be scrapped; with regular voters getting to decide the shortlists in every category - including the \"big four\": Song of the year, record of the year, best new artist and best album.\nEven so, the awards have managed to stir up controversy, thanks to a separate group of committees: The steering committees, who decide which prizes artists are eligible for.\nThe Nashville screening committee decided that Star-Crossed, the latest record by country superstar (and 2018 album of the year winner) Kacey Musgraves was actually a pop album, not country.\nMusgraves responded on Instagram with her middle fingers raised. \"You can take the girl out of the country (genre), but you can't take the country out of the girl,\" she wrote.\nIn the end, the album failed to receive a single nomination in the more competitive pop field. The single Camera Roll, however, sneaked into the best country song shortlist.\nWhat happened at the 2021 Grammys?\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Covid-19: Venues 'may have to close doors during Christmas'",
      "text": "There is a possibility that hospitality venues may be asked to close over Christmas if Covid-19 cases continue to increase, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. \nBut he told the Northern Ireland Assembly it was not \"inevitable\".\nStormont ministers have met to discuss plans to help curb the spread of Covid-19 and will meet again on Tuesday.\nOn Thursday, Mr Swann advised anyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year to do so again now.\nHis document also suggested introducing a \"scores on the doors\" Covid compliance rating for businesses.\nMr Swann said on Monday that \"if the current trajectory continues with regard to the increased cases we are seeing, we may once again face the possibility where venues are asked to close their doors during the Christmas season\".\n\"But let me be clear, it is not inevitable and I do not want to have to re-introduce further restrictions unless completely unavoidable,\" he added.\nMr Swann also expressed disappointment that some hospitality venues had not acted responsibly after social distancing rules were relaxed.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill tweeted that Mr Swann had presented a paper to ministers who met on Monday morning to consider it. \nShe said that while the \"meeting was constructive and progress was made, it was agreed more work was needed\".\n\"The executive will meet again in the morning to finalise the approach,\" she added.\nDecisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must first be agreed by the executive.\nHealth officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus.\nOn Monday, three Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland and a further 1,469 new cases. \nNorthern Ireland's infection rate has been climbing over the past week or so.\nIt is currently the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland.\nJustice Minister Naomi Long said on Monday that the executive was \"not planning for Christmas closures\".\n\"We started off in terms of looking at vaccine certification as one means of trying to ensure that we drive down transmission and as those who are in more high-risk environments are less likely to become seriously ill as a result, that's one means of keeping the doors open on businesses,\" she added.\n\"We've been considering the paper today around how we actually try to get the basics right and get people to comply with things like handwashing, wearing masks, trying to voluntarily reduce their number of close contacts, trying to ensure where people can work from home they do work from home.\n\"Our focus at the minute is not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open.\"\nMs O'Neill said on Twitter that it was \"vitally important that all executive ministers work together to get us through this difficult period\".\n\"It's time to redouble our efforts to limit the spread of the virus, protect lives and our hospital system,\" she added.\nI think this was the strongest warning from Robin Swann that unless people do change their ways, it is not inevitable, but a distinct possibility [that venues may be asked to close].\nIf we are talking about carrot and stick, I think that is potentially the stick.\nMr Swann will hope that hits home, because nobody wants that to happen.\nCertainly the people who run these establishments don't want it to happen.\nPeople would like a Christmas, but Robin Swann is saying people have got to change their ways.\nLast week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, then more \"severe\" restrictions could be required before Christmas. \nStormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade.\nThey have already agreed to put in place proof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December. \nThe plan means people will have to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of a negative coronavirus test result to access nightclubs, pubs, cinemas, theatres and restaurants.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted against the proposals but Mr Swann and other Stormont ministers said the use of Covid status certification would save lives.\nDUP ministers had said they wanted to see other measures explored by health officials, which could also help reduce the number of Covid cases.\nAt present, executive advice on working from home is that people should continue to do so where they can.\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland's justice minister has raised concerns about a proposal for her department to \"take the lead\" in managing compliance around face coverings to help combat Covid-19.\nThe health paper suggested Naomi Long should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%.\nShe said the proposal was \"entirely inappropriate\".\nIn Mr Swann's paper to ministers ahead of Monday's meeting, he suggested that a decision taken by the executive on 23 September encouraging employers to \"begin planning a gradual return to the workplace\" for employees should be reversed.\nThe proposal goes on to say that the message should be communicated by stating that if a person worked from home when the pandemic began in March 2020 then \"they should be working from home now\".\nOn Friday, Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride, said research had shown that working from home was \"one of the single most effective interventions\" to control the virus.\nAnother proposal raised by the minister is a \"Covid score\" for businesses based on their compliance with regulations and Covid safety measures.\nMr Swann said while this suggestion was dismissed as an option last year, he believes it should be revisited and has suggested the executive's Covid taskforce take on the development of such a scheme.\nThe document also advises ensuring enforcement against those breaching existing Covid restrictions, including people who do not comply with wearing face coverings where they are legally required.\nMr Swann said that since rules on mandatory face coverings in shops and public transport were introduced in summer 2020, only five fines had been issued to people for failing to follow the law.\nThe minister added that unless enforcement was strengthened, the public would see \"compliance as unimportant and optional\".\nMost of the proposals in the paper are aimed at improving messaging and communication of current coronavirus advice.\nMr Swann is also understood to have said in his paper that communications on public health are \"much more effective when delivered with a united voice by all executive ministers\"."

      "text": "The Pope has praised Sir David Amess for years of \"devoted public service\" in a message read at the funeral Mass for the late Conservative MP.\nSenior political figures gathered at Westminster Cathedral to pay their respects to Sir David, who was 69.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson joined former prime ministers, the Speaker of the House and the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in London.\nSir David was fatally stabbed during a constituency surgery in October.\nIn the message delivered by Archbishop Claudio Gugerotti, the Apostolic Nuncio to Great Britain, Pope Francis called for mourners' resolve to be strengthened to \"combat evil with good\" and \"build a society of ever greater justice\" following the devout Catholic's death.\n\"His Holiness recalls with gratitude Sir David's years of devoted public service guided by his strong Catholic faith and evidenced in his deep concern for the poor and the disadvantaged, his commitment to the defence of God's gift of life, and his efforts to foster understanding and co-operation with the Holy See in its universal mission,\" the Pope's message said.\n\"Commending Sir David's soul to the loving mercy of Jesus Christ our Saviour, the Holy Father prays that all who honour his memory will be confirmed in the resolve to reject the ways of violence, to combat evil with good, and to help build a society of ever greater justice, fraternity and solidarity.\"\nThose at the service enjoyed a lighter moment as Canon Pat Browne, the Roman Catholic Duty Priest for Parliament, recalled the moment Sir David had a boiled sweet blessed by the Pope.\nLaughter broke through the silence again as Canon Browne told the story of Sir David posing in a suit of armour to celebrate his knighthood.\nThe Southend West MP was attacked at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea on 15 October.\nSir David was first elected for the Essex seat in 1997, and before that he had been MP for Basildon since 1983.\nSpeaking before the funeral, former Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe said: \"He was a very close personal friend.\n\"It still has a great air of unreality about it - I think that's quite inevitable if you lose a friend suddenly in terrible circumstances.\n\"We're all asking ourselves why, I don't think anybody can tell you why.\"\nFollowing the Mass at Westminster, Sir David's body was to be interred during a private service.\nThe cathedral Mass followed Monday's memorial service in Southend.\nAli Harbi Ali, 25, has been charged with the murder of Sir David, and also with preparing acts of terrorism between 1 May 2019 and 28 September this year.\nHe is due to enter pleas in December.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "text": "Rapper KSI and Premier League footballers like Declan Rice and Aaron Ramsdale have all taken part in an impromptu karaoke party hosted by an unemployed 18-year-old from Manchester.\nJacob McLaughlin only invited four friends to his Sing Your Dialect event, hosted on Twitter's new Spaces feature.\nBut the link went viral and more than 150,000 people tuned in across Monday evening, Twitter said.\nJacob told Newsbeat the reception to his event has been \"just crazy\".\nPut simply, a Twitter Space is like a group phone call. \nAnyone can join a Space as long as they have the invite link.\nThere's a host who controls who can speak, which at the moment is limited to 13 people at once. \nTwitter has been trialling the feature with a few users for a while, but started rolling it out more widely earlier this year. In October the social media platform announced that everyone with the app on iOS or Android can now host a Space.\n\"I see it as a celeb versus the people karaoke radio show,\" says Jacob, who lost his job as a kitchen fitter two weeks ago and lives with his mum.\nHe'd been along to a Twitter Space called Sing Your Dialect where the host let people take it in turns to sing a song of their choice. But Jacob decided to create his own version of the event because, he says, he didn't like the way the original host only allowed people to sing if they followed him on Twitter first.\nJacob's event started out with about 1,000 people in it and the first celebrity appearance was from TV presenter Rylan Clark-Neal, who performed a rap.\nAfter that more and more people joined until about 48,000 people were there at the peak on Monday evening.\n\"Basically I united the nation,\" Jacob says, adding that rapper Lethal Bizzle's rendition of Wonderwall was one of the best performances of the night.\nAsked which other celebrities were in the virtual room, Jacob says: \"Who wasn't in there?\" adding that his favourite moment was realising \"Shrewsbury Town were singing Abba while Barack Obama was listening.\"\nTwitter officials haven't confirmed whether or not the former US president was part of the Space, but they did tell Newsbeat attendees included rapper and YouTube star KSI, Premier League footballers Declan Rice and Aaron Ramsdale, and singer Stacey Solomon.\nIf you're getting FOMO because you weren't there last night, don't worry - people screen-recorded some of the best bits.\nJacob gave this solid rendition of Robbie Williams' Angels a 10 out of 10...\nBut he cut the chorus of YouTuber Danny Aarons's attempt at Sweet Caroline short because it wasn't quite what he was expecting...\nDanny joked on his own account that he was \"furious\" about being \"kicked\" mid-performance, but later showed he wasn't really that bothered because he'd been a part of \"the greatest night in Twitter history\".\nAnd it wasn't all football chants, either. Jacob said this take on Shape of my Heart, by Nigerian actress Erica Nlewedim, was a \"belter\" of a performance.\nJacob wants to run the events on Mondays, Thursdays, and Sundays, from 7pm, \"when everyone's had their tea and they're all winding down\".\nBut he's doing a \"bonus\" event on Tuesday where he says West Ham and England star Declan Rice has asked to perform.\nJacob says he's a bit worried about the responsibility of being a host with such a big audience.\n\"When you've got big names, it's all coming down to my credit,\" he tells Newsbeat.\nHe said he had to cut short a few performances from football fans at Tuesday's event when their songs turned into \"derogatory chants\".\nTwitter officials have asked to attend Tuesday's event to help out with any technical issues.\n\"They said they're expecting stupid numbers tonight.\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."

      "text": "A private investigator has apologised for targeting the Duke of Sussex's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy for surveillance when they were dating.\nGavin Burrows told the BBC the press had focused on Prince Harry in the 2000s as \"the new Diana\".\nMr Burrows, a witness in ongoing legal cases against the News of the World and the Sun, said he and the press had been \"ruthless\".\nHis claims are yet to be tested in court and are strongly disputed.\nWatch The Princes and the Press on BBC iPlayer here\nPrince Harry is one of several people pursuing legal action against the publisher of the Sun and the News of the World, News Group Newspapers, as well as the owner of the Daily Mirror, over allegations of phone-hacking and other illegal newsgathering activity. \nThe News of the World was Britain's biggest Sunday newspaper until 2011, when the owners shut it down after a series of damaging reports, including that the paper hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. \nNews Group Newspapers accepts a limited amount of unlawful activity occurred at the News of the World.\nHowever, it denies there was any wrongdoing at the Sun and says it has not accepted liability in any of the phone-hacking cases brought against it.\nThe private investigator's claims feature in a BBC documentary that investigates the relationship between the younger princes and the media. Media editor Amol Rajan speaks to journalists about how they were briefed on stories, including claims about the behaviour of the Duchess of Sussex.\nBuckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace released a joint statement to the BBC which was included in the programme.\nIt said: \"A free, responsible and open press is of vital importance to a healthy democracy.\n\"However, too often it is overblown and unfounded claims from unnamed sources that are presented as facts and it is disappointing when anyone, including the BBC, gives them credibility.\"\nMr Burrows' account sheds new light on the background to an impending conflict over the conduct of the press.\nPrince Harry, who has sharply criticised the media and advocated for reform, has so far declined to settle his phone-hacking claim, raising the prospect of a trial.\nFormer BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the prince battling newspapers in court over allegations of unlawful activity - seemingly driven by \"avenging\" what he sees as unfair treatment of his mother - would be a \"massive\" moment in British public life.\nMr Burrows told the programme there was much greater interest in Prince Harry than in Prince William when he began working for the News of the World in 2000.\n\"As explained to me by a couple of editors, Harry had basically become the new Diana,\" he said.\nEditors had told him putting Prince Harry on the front page sold more copies of newspapers than Prince William, Mr Burrows said.\nThe private investigator said when Prince Harry began dating Ms Davy in 2004, it opened a lucrative new avenue of business as her communications were targeted.\n\"There was a lot of voicemail hacking going on, there was a lot of surveillance work on her phones, on her comms. Chelsy would brag to her friends when she was going to see him,\" he said.\nHe said investigators were interested in her medical records, ex-boyfriends and details of her education.\nMr Burrows apologised, saying he was \"very sorry\" and that he acted this way \"because I was greedy, I was into my cocaine, and I was living in a fake state of grandeur\".\nBut he said there was a \"ruthless\" culture in parts of the media around that time: \"They've got no morals - they absolutely have got no morals.\"\nHe also said he regretted his treatment of Prince Harry. \"I was basically part of a group of people who robbed him of his normal teenage years,\" Mr Burrows said.\nMr Burrows was one of many private investigators employed by UK newspapers during what came to be known as the phone-hacking scandal.\nThe exposure of unethical and sometimes illegal methods of getting information, including accessing voicemails, has prompted a wave of legal cases over the years.\nSolicitor Callum Galbraith, co-ordinating the current legal actions against News Group Newspapers, said the scale of the use of private investigators by the News of the World and other papers was \"absolutely phenomenal\", starting in the early 1990s and continuing to 2011, when police began a new investigation.\nA criminal trial in 2014 heard the News of the World's former royal editor Clive Goodman hacked the messages of Kate Middleton 155 times when she was dating Prince William. He also hacked the phones of both princes, the court heard.\nThe princes felt \"really violated\" and both were initially \"determined\" to resolve their issues with the publisher, said Mr Hunt, the former BBC royal correspondent.\nHe said: \"It's now just one of them who is pursuing it, which is Harry.\"\nWatch the Princes and the Press on BBC iPlayer\nFor more on the story, please subscribe to the podcast Harry, Meghan and the Media."

      "tags": "China,Peng Shuai",
      "text": "China has said the controversy surrounding tennis star Peng Shuai has been \"maliciously hyped up\", in its most direct response to the issue yet. \nMs Peng disappeared from the public eye for almost three weeks after making sexual assault allegations against China's former vice premier, triggering widespread international concern.  \nShe has since re-appeared, but questions remain over her wellbeing. \nOn Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said it was \"not a diplomatic matter\".\n\"I believe you have all seen that she recently attended some public events and had a video call [with the president of the International Olympic Committee],\" spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters. \n\"I think some people should stop deliberately and maliciously hyping [the issue] up, let alone politicise this issue,\" he said. \nMs Peng, 35, is one of China's top tennis players. In a 1,600-word post on Chinese social media platform Weibo earlier this month, she said former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli - who is 75 - had \"forced\" her to have sexual relations with him.\n\"Even if it's just striking a stone with a pebble, or a moth attacking a flame and courting self destruction, I will tell the truth about you,\" she wrote.\nIt was the first time such an allegation had been made against one of China's senior political leaders. Mr Zhang has not responded to the allegations.\nAfter sharing her post on Weibo, the tennis player was not heard or seen publicly for several weeks. Her safety became a matter of international concern, with prominent players including Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka joining calls from governments and tennis officials demanding to know she was safe. \nThe outcry prompted Chinese state media to release a series of photographs and videos that appeared to show all was well.\nOver the weekend, Ms Peng had a video call with the head of the International Olympic Committee, after which a statement from the group said she had appeared safe and well. A state media journalist also posted a video clip he said was from Sunday that showed her smiling and standing with officials at a tennis tournament.\nBut concerns over Ms Peng's safety and wellbeing remain.\nThe Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has said the recent videos \"don't alleviate or address... concern about her wellbeing and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion\".\nHuman Rights Watch criticised the IOC over the video call, saying its \"collaboration\" with Chinese authorities on Ms Peng's reappearance \"undermines its expressed commitment to human rights, including the rights and safety of athletes\". \nThere have also been calls from athletes for a special delegation of international organisations and human rights experts to meet Ms Peng and assess her safety. \nOn Sunday, a rally was staged by a group of Chinese feminists in New York in support of Ms Peng. \nEvent organiser Crystal Chen told the BBC that while the released videos and photos appear to show Ms Peng \"physically unharmed\", she was \"not truly free\"."

      "text": "Wisconsin officials will seek to charge a driver who ploughed into a Christmas parade on Sunday with five counts of intentional homicide.\nIt comes as hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil in Waukesha to remember those who lost their lives. \nDarrell Edward Brooks Jr, 39, killed five people, aged between 52 and 81, and injured 48 others, including young children, in Waukesha.\nPolice say he was fleeing a domestic dispute when he mowed into the crowd.\nWaukesha police also said the incident was not an act of terrorism. Several school children and grandparents were among the victims.\nWarning: This article contains upsetting content.\nThe victims named on Monday were:\nThey include members of the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies, who are a regular fixture in the city's parades.\n\"Our group was doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages,\" the group wrote in a statement on Facebook. \"Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies.\"\nOn Monday night hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil at Waukesha's Cutler Park to remember the victims. Braving freezing conditions, community members listened as an interfaith service read out the names of the victims and volunteers handed out sandwiches, hot chocolate and candles to mourners. \nMayor Shawn Reilly told the crowd that the event was the \"beginning of many nights where we will grieve and mourn for those we lost\".\nDozens of people still remain in hospital. Police said the injured were taken to six area hospitals by first responders as well as other residents who were at the parade.\nEighteen children were admitted after the incident, the Children's Wisconsin paediatric hospital told reporters on Monday.\nCare providers described the incident as one of the state's largest mass casualty events involving children in recent history. Physicians said some children sustained serious head injuries and broken bones. \nThe injured range in age from three to 16 and include three sets of siblings, medical staff said. Ten children required treatment in the intensive care unit. \nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee said one of its priests, multiple parishioners and students at a local Catholic school were also among the injured.\n\"A lone subject intentionally drove his maroon SUV through barricades and into a crowd of people that was celebrating the Waukesha Christmas parade,\" city police chief Dan Thompson told reporters at a news conference on Monday. \nHe added that an officer had fired shots at the vehicle, but had to stop due to the number of people on the street.\nPolice said they were responding to a domestic incident involving Mr Brooks when he fled the scene and mowed through the parade crowd. Earlier media reports suggested he was escaping a knife fight, but police have not confirmed those details.\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper reported Mr Brooks is currently facing at least five other criminal charges - including for domestic abuse and battery - and had been released from jail on bond just two days earlier. BBC News has also reviewed the records belonging to the suspect.\nIn a statement on Monday, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, said the bail recommendation in Mr Brooks' open court case was \"inappropriately low in light of the nature of recent charges and the pending charges\" against him.\nMr Brooks is from the city of Milwaukee, about 24 km (15 miles) east of Waukesha.\nThe parade in Waukesha - a community of about 72,000 located to the west of Milwaukee - is traditionally held every year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, and includes fancy dress, floats, dancers and marching bands. This year's theme was \"comfort and joy\". \nFamilies lined the sides of the road to watch the event, which was returning after a year's absence due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nLocal resident Angelito Tenorio told the Journal Sentinel he had just finished marching in the parade when the SUV \"put the pedal to the metal and just [started] zooming full speed along the parade route\" at about 16:40 (22:40 GMT) on Sunday. \n\"Then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle,\" he said. \nCorey Montiho, whose daughter's dance team was hit by the SUV, told the paper: \"There were pom-poms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere. I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter.\"\nSarah Saldivar, who was at the parade with her two young children, told CBS News she saw \"a red blur\" and then saw \"little girls flying through the air\".\nOne video shared on social media shows the car crashing at high speed through street barriers, while another shows the vehicle driving into what looks like a group of musicians.\nPolice officers ran down the street during the incident, telling people to take shelter in shops. \nMayor Shawn Reilly described the incident as a \"horrible, senseless tragedy\". \n\"I am deeply saddened to know that so many in our community went to a parade but ended up dealing with injury and heartache,\" he said.\nPresident Joe Biden said he was praying for the community and \"monitoring the situation very closely\".\nWisconsin Governor Tony Evers has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff across the state in honour of the victims.\nWaukesha's public schools were closed on Monday, and counselling services were made available to those affected.\nA community fund has been created to help victims of the incident. \nWere you at the parade?

      "title": "Is everything OK for Boris Johnson?",
      "tags": "Social care",
      "text": "Boris Johnson said his speech to the CBI conference had \"gone over well\".\nReally? The prime minister has always played up the characteristics that set him apart from most politicians: gags, gaffes, informality, a shirt that's not quite tucked in. Given where he's ended up, with a historic majority, it hasn't exactly served him badly.\nIndeed for his backers it's precisely that personality that appeals to so many voters - he's not the same as the grey, managerial class of politician which provokes so many cries of \"They're all the same\".\nBut was his rambling appearance at the lectern on Monday any different? The prime minister lost his place in his notes, appeared to be side-tracked about his visit to Peppa Pig World and at one point seemed to compare himself to the Biblical figure of Moses.  It even prompted one reporter to ask Mr Johnson: \"Is everything OK?\"\nEveryone can have a bad day at the office, of course. And on a different occasion the Tories might have been able to laugh off what happened. But being asked how you are is not the kind of question that any prime minister would want to be posed.\nAnd many Conservatives are querying exactly what is going on in Downing Street at the moment.\nAfter a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Mr Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like.\nBut that is really not what panned out. If anything it gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place.\nOn Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable.\nThe vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. There is a tribe of Conservative MPs not angry enough to beat its political masters, but disappointed enough to withhold full support.\nThere is also tangible concern about what is going on in Downing Street. One senior MP and former minister, a friend of Mr Johnson, said there were \"amateurs\" in Number 10 and complained about shortfalls in the operation.\nOthers, even inside Downing Street, are urging cabinet ministers to insist on improvements, saying: \"There is a lot of concern in the building... It's just not working.\" \nMr Johnson's political style does not rely on things always going smoothly, and the idea that the huge commitments this government has made would be pushed through without political disquiet is nonsensical.\nBut the prime minister's list of problems seems only to grow. His party's faith in his power to fix them seems to be going the other way.\nWhat neither his backers or detractors can be sure of is whether this autumn is the beginning of a significant slide or a nasty, and perhaps predictable, case of mid-term blues."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is to announce whether Scotland's vaccine passport system will be expanded to cover more venues.\nThe government has said that widening existing restrictions could be the only alternative to a new lockdown if Covid-19 cases rise during the winter period.\nBut some business groups and opposition parties have argued against the move.\nThe first minister will agree a decision with her cabinet on Tuesday morning, before announcing it to MSPs at Holyrood in the afternoon.\nIf agreed, the vaccine certification scheme would be extended to cinemas, theatres and other as yet unspecified hospitality venues from 6 December.\nMs Sturgeon previously told MSPs that exactly which businesses could be affected would be decided \"on the basis of the data and the evidence\".\nSince October, people in Scotland have been required to show proof of vaccination to enter nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches.\nThe government is considering extending this to other settings - as well as strengthening rules around the wearing of face coverings and home working - amid concerns about pressure on the health services over winter.\nMinisters published an evidence paper which said Scotland faced a choice between containing the spread of the virus by \"closing venues, limiting group sizes and advising people not to meet\", or by expanding the vaccine passport scheme.\nIt said further use of certification would \"enable people to meet up in a lower risk way\" because it would become less likely that an infectious person would be present in a crowded setting.\nHospitality bosses have warned that pubs and restaurants could face an \"avalanche of cancellations\" if the certification scheme is extended over the normally busy Christmas period.\nScottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron said firms might back an expansion if there was \"clear\" evidence in favour of one, but said: \"We remain unconvinced at this time that the public health benefits outweigh the negatives for individuals, businesses and the economy.\"\nThe government paper conceded that a \"significant number of businesses and organisations\" could be affected and face increased costs - noting that nightclubs had reported \"substantial turnover losses\" since the current rules came into force.\nHowever, it said this would still be preferable to venues having to close entirely due to the return of lockdown restrictions.\nAnd it said requiring certification might convince people who are currently \"indifferent\" about vaccination to get jabbed.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there was no evidence that certification \"actually works\".\nHe told BBC Scotland that it was \"absolutely wrong to be putting this added pressure and burden on to businesses at such short notice\".\nMeanwhile Scottish Labour has urged the government to let people provide a negative test result instead of a vaccine certificate - as is the case in most other countries which have a certification scheme.\nAnd the Liberal Democrats have called for the use of lateral flow tests to replace vaccine passports entirely, citing the example of the COP26 conference in Glasgow as a success of using testing only.\nMinisters are considering including testing in the system, with Ms Sturgeon telling MSPs last week that this was a \"finely-balanced judgement\".\nShe added: \"We want, if possible, businesses to stay fully open over Christmas and through the winter, while keeping Covid under control. \n\"If an expansion of vaccination certification can help us to do that, it would be irresponsible not to consider it.\""

      "tags": "HIV & Aids,Cardiff,Welsh government",
      "text": "\"You're disgusting, you deserve to have Aids, you're vile.\" \nThese are just some of the comments Marlon Van Der Mark receives after posting online about living with HIV.  \nThe 24-year-old said it was \"heart-breaking\" to see the stigma \"so alive\" and wants to see better understanding of living with the virus. \nThe Welsh government said tackling HIV stigma and discrimination will be a major part of its HIV action plan published next year. \nDiagnosed at 19, Mr Van Der Mark, of Cardiff, described the following few years as a \"blur\" living in fear of telling people. \n\"It took me nearly four years to even say 'I'm HIV positive' to myself,\" he said.\nEarlier this year, he said he had had enough and posted a video on TikTok talking openly about living with HIV. \n\"Within a few minutes it was blowing up... people were saying how proud they were of me... I could breathe for the first time,\" he said.\nBut as the activist posted about not being ashamed, he found the stigma surrounding HIV still existed. \n\"It's really bad, I never thought it would be after the first video but as videos went on... it was like a whole door unlocked and all these people came flooding in.\"\nHe said comments included people telling him he should be \"put down\" and that he \"didn't deserve to be in this world\".\nMr Van Der Mark believes much of the abuse is based on outdated information from the Aids crisis and shows the need for better education about what it means to live with HIV in 2021. \n\"Once every six months I go for a routine check-up... I take one tablet a day and I live a normal life,\" he said. \nMr Van Der Mark also said there was \"such a fear behind getting tested\" for the virus.\n\"It's just stigmatised, and it shouldn't be,\" he added.\nHIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus - the immunodeficiency is the weakening of the immune system by the virus.\nIf untreated it can lead to late-stage HIV or Aids, the name for a collection of illnesses caused by the virus.\nBut there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live long and healthy lives.\nModern medication reduces the viral load to undetectable levels, meaning someone can't pass on HIV and their health is protected.\nSources: Terrence Higgins Trust and NHS \nElla Meggitt, from Cardiff, said she had to look at her own stigma when her best friend received a HIV diagnosis that later turned out to be false. \n\"I was thinking what were people going to think and internalising that myself... because I knew that people didn't know as much as we did,\" she said.\nThe 22-year-old dance teacher said the experience had made her want to support people living with HIV as well as educating herself and others about it. \nShe said she now regularly gets tested for HIV and posts on social media to show the role everyone can play in getting tested and eradicating new transmissions. \n\"Middle-aged straight people with families don't think it's their issue because they think it's a young gay man's issue and that's what it's been like since the 80s, but that's not the case and in order to erase the stigma and get people tested, we need everyone to talk about it,\" she said.\nBreaking down HIV stigma is one of the aims of Wales HIV testing week running from 22 to 28 November.\nIt is organised by Fast Track Cardiff and Vale, a volunteer group that was set up partly to tackle Wales' higher-than-average rate of late diagnosis compared to the rest of the UK. \nLisa Power, a development worker in the group, said later diagnosis meant \"people are not getting tested and diagnosed until they are actually ill\".\n\"Also, people who don't know they have HIV are probably passing it on,\" she added. \nThe group is part of a global network of more than 300 cities committed to meeting the UNAIDS targets of 90% of all people living with HIV diagnosed, on treatment and having undetectable and untransmissible viral load. \nThe organisation also wants the Welsh government to set clear goals as part of its HIV Action plan published next year. \n\"There are more people living in Wales with HIV than ever... we haven't had a public information campaign for 14 years which is why no-one knows these new things about HIV that make it possible to live with it as chronic lifelong condition,\" Ms Power said. \nA Welsh government spokesperson said it recognised stigma could be \"a major barrier to effective responses to preventing HIV Infection\". \n\"Tackling HIV stigma and discrimination will be a major element of our HIV Action Plan.\" "

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nSharply rising Covid infection rates - prompting fresh restrictions and lockdowns - in parts of Western Europe have triggered fears the UK could follow suit. But our health correspondent Nick Triggle hears from scientists who say there are plenty of reasons to believe Britain will escape the worst of what is being seen on the continent. Here's his analysis.\nNine in every 10 musicians was surviving on less than \u00a31,000 a month, with one-third still earning nothing even after restrictions on live events were lifted this summer, according to UK charity Help Musicians. The music industry is one of the last sectors to recover from the pandemic, it says, with its survey of 929 people in August suggesting 83% of professional musicians were unable to find regular work.\nNorthern Ireland's ministers meet again later to consider ways to curb the spread of Covid-19, with the health minister having warned that hospitality businesses may have to close over Christmas. During a meeting on Monday, ministers were unable to agree on messaging surrounding working from home or dealing with any rule breaches.\nThe number of people leaving the nursing profession is at its highest rate since 2017, with 13,945 quitting between April and September this year, according to the Nursing and Midwifery Council. \"We're all just crashing and burning out,\" says Emily Moorhouse, who quit her job in A&E to go into community nursing. She describes the toll on her mental health and tells us how people's messages of support can help NHS staff cope.\nA blue angel, a two-legged \"reinduck\" and a grumpy penguin are among the Christmas lights in Newburgh, Fife, which lets primary school children design a new display each year. In 2020, Covid lockdowns meant organisers were unable to raise cash to pay for a new feature.

      "text": "MPs have backed a ban on virginity testing in England, after the government called it \"indefensible\".\nAnyone helping girls or women get the tests, which includes an intrusive vaginal examination, could face up to five years in prison.\nHealth Minister Edward Argar told the House of Commons the practice was \"repressive\" and caused \"long-term physical and psychological damage\".\nThe World Health Organisation says it is a violation of human rights.\nIt adds that the tests, thought to occur in at least 20 countries, cannot prove whether a woman or girl has had sex or not, as the hymen can be broken in other ways - such as through tampon use or exercise.\nBut a BBC Newsbeat investigation last year found 21 clinics in the UK offering them, at a cost of between \u00a3150 and \u00a3300.\nAn amendment to the Health and Care Bill banning virginity tests was passed unopposed by the Commons.\nThis would make it a criminal offence to offer someone from England a test, or help them get one in the UK or abroad.\nThe maximum penalty would be a five-year jail sentence or an unlimited fine.\nMr Argar said the ban had been discussed with ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who all wanted to \"ensure the whole of the UK together tackles this abhorrent practice\".\nCreating a criminal offence would \"begin to tackle the harmful misconceptions that surround a woman's sexuality\", he argued.\nMr Argar added: \"This House's commitment to legislate, I believe, is a profoundly important step forward in helping to tackle the damaging myths concerning so-called purity in women's sexuality.\n\"In response to concerns that vulnerable women and girls will be taken abroad and subjected to virginity testing abroad once the offence is banned in the UK, these offences will also carry extra-territorial jurisdiction.\"\nCampaigners have also said they want a ban on hymenoplasty, a practice involving cosmetic surgery to reconstruct the hymen. \nThe government has indicated it wants to outlaw this as well, but it is awaiting the recommendations of an independent panel which is due to report back before Christmas.
