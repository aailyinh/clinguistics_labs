      "text": "A coroner has called for a review of smart motorways after an inquest heard the deaths of two men on a stretch of the M1 could have been avoided. \nJason Mercer, 44, and Alexandru Murgeanu, 22, died when Prezemyslaw Szuba crashed his lorry into their vehicles near Sheffield on 7 June 2019.\nCoroner David Urpeth said smart motorways without a hard shoulder carry \"an ongoing risk of future deaths\". \nHighways England said it was \"addressing many of the points raised\".\nMr Urpeth recorded a verdict of unlawful killing at Sheffield Town Hall. He added he would be writing to Highways England and the transport secretary asking for a review.\nThe inquest heard the deaths of the two men may have been avoided had there had been a hard shoulder. \nMore stories from around Yorkshire\nOn the stretch of the M1 where the crash took place, the hard shoulder has been replaced by an active lane. \nSzuba, 40, from Hull, was jailed last year after admitting causing their deaths by careless driving.\nHe was speaking from prison to the inquest.\nAnswering questions over the phone, Szuba told the hearing he accepted he was driving without paying proper attention. \n\"I have already accepted that at my trial,\" he said, but added: \"If there had been a hard shoulder on this bit of motorway, the collision would have been avoidable.\n\"I would have driven past these two cars as it would be safer and they would have been able to come home safely and I would be able to come back home.\"\nSzuba said he had only three to five seconds to react, and asked if he would have avoided the crash had he been paying attention, he said: \"It's difficult to say after everything now.\"\nSgt Mark Brady, who oversees major collision investigations for South Yorkshire Police, told the hearing: \"Had there been a hard shoulder, had Jason and Alexandru pulled on to the hard shoulder, my opinion is that Mr Szuba would have driven clean past them.\"\nBut he accepted the primary cause of the crash was Szuba's inattention to the road.\nThe crash happened after a collision between a Ford Focus driven by Mr Mercer, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and a Ford Transit driven by Mr Murgeanu, who was living in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, but was originally from Romania.\nWhen Mr Mercer and Mr Murgeanu got out to exchange details they were hit by the lorry, and both died at the scene.\nMr Mercer's wife Claire has campaigned against smart motorways since her husband's death, and was at the hearing on Monday.\nIn a statement, Highways England said it was \"determined\" to do everything it could to make roads as safe as possible and was already addressing many of the points raised by the coroner \"as published in the Government's Smart Motorway Evidence Stocktake and Action Plan of March 2020\". \n\"We will carefully consider any further comments raised by the coroner once we receive the report,\" it added.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "The NHS is being supplied with as many Covid-19 vaccines as it can cope with, according to a leading doctor.\nDr Gill Richardson, chair of Wales' vaccination board, said health boards were receiving doses they asked for.\nOn Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the supply of the Pfizer vaccine was being \"spaced out\" as it had to last until a delivery in February.\nBut opposition parties questioned why supplies were being \"spread out\".\nPaul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was \"important now to get those vaccines out to people\".\nPlaid's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth added it made \"little sense\" to spread out the vaccines, when \"time is of the essence\". \nBut a Welsh Government minister defended the rollout and said the vaccine infrastructure is \"growing\".\n\"We're moving from a situation where we were using 50% of the stock for first vaccine to a situation where we are now using 100%,\" Counsel General Jeremy Miles told the BBC's Politics Wales show.\n\"In order to deliver that, the infrastructure for vaccinating needs to be increased and that infrastructure is being brought forward.\"\nThe Tories have called on the Welsh Government to appoint a vaccination minister like Prime Minister Boris Johnson has done in England.\n\"It would make a huge difference because this minister would be able to focus on the vaccination programme and nothing else,\" said Mr Davies.\nWales was expected to receive 100,000 doses of the second vaccine - the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - this week but about a quarter are delayed after failing the regulator's tests.\nDr Richardson said deliveries of the vaccines have arrived in \"pulses\" and a big consignment of the Pfizer vaccine - around 170,000 doses - arrived in late December.\nHalf the vaccine was initially held back for booster jabs, but they are now being given to people as a first jab in a bid to get as many people vaccinated - and given some protection - as possible.\nDr Richardson said they were only giving health boards what they could cope with as, after coming out of deep-freeze storage, the Pfizer jab has to be used within five days.\n\"We are very conscious that we need to get this out there,\" she told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement.\n\"I know that my colleagues are desperate to immunise our vulnerable people.\n\"We are now able and have been pushing all the vaccine that our health boards can cope with out to them.\"\nThere has been criticism that the rollout of the vaccine has been slower in Wales than in other parts of the UK.\nWales has received about 250,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 50,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine so far.\nThe Welsh Government said it had been assured it would get more Pfizer vaccines by February, despite shipments of it being temporarily slowed because of changes to the company's manufacturing processes.\nDr Richardson said: \"We are going to have a famine, if you like, of Pfizer deliveries at the end of the month.\n\"That hasn't stopped us pushing out as much vaccine as we can to the health boards.\n\"But their clinics will run out of the Pfizer vaccine if more does not come.\"\nThe Welsh Government said one Oxford-AstraZeneca batch out of four had been delayed, affecting 26,000 doses due to be sent to Wales' seven health boards.\nBetsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which manages the health service in north Wales, said it had advised GPs \"may wish to delay appointments early next week\" with the planned supply reduced.\nBBC Wales has contacted the other health boards in Wales to ask if vaccination appointments have been affected, but they have not given details.\nDr Richardson said while it was \"a huge issue for this week, it won't be an issue overall for the programme, we are hoping, because we have been reassured by the UK government that supplies (of the Oxford vaccine) are on their way\".\nAny GPs affected will be prioritised for the next batch of vaccine, she said.\nAsked if he could guarantee supplies to Wales, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart told the programme: \"Yes, I think I can.\"\nHe added: \"There will be the odd occasion when a consignment is rejected or delayed. Nobody should panic about that.\""

      "tags": "China,Mining",
      "text": "Twelve miners trapped underground after an explosion in a Chinese gold mine a week ago are still alive. \nThey sent back a note saying \"don't stop trying to reach us\" when rescuers seeking signs of life lowered down food rations taped to wire cable.\nA telephone connection has now been set up. The fate of another 10 men missing after the blast remains unclear. \nMining accidents in China are not uncommon and are often due to poorly enforced safety regulations.\nThe 22 were trapped at the Hushan mine near Yantai in eastern Shandong province on 10 January after an explosion damaged the exit and the communications system of the mine, which was still under construction. \nRescuers have spent days tapping and waiting for signs of survivors - until finally they felt pulling on ropes they had lowered into the mine.\nAccording to state media, rescuers managed to make contact with some of the miners through a long, thin communication shaft they had drilled from the surface. They later sent food, medicine, paper and pencils into the hole. \nAccording to the handwritten note they retrieved back from the shaft, 12 people are alive in the middle section of the mine.\n\"There are 11 others - one is injured, and the status of the remaining 10 is unclear,\" said the note-writer. In it he asks for pain killers and says they hope for a rescue, before ending with thanks to the rescue team. \nLater on Monday, Chen Fei, the deputy secretary of Shandong's Yantai city, said phone contact had also now been made with the trapped miners, who he said are \"currently very weak\".\n\"After we opened up the third shaft, it had a really excitable effect on the people connected. They were very confident and very hopeful that they would soon be able to get out of the mine,\" he told a news conference. \n\"We established they needed emergency medicines and equipment.\"  \nTwo batches of provisions and one of medicine had been sent down the mine, which Mr Chen said were enough to last those trapped two days. \nAs well as pain killers, the 12 miners had reportedly asked for anti-inflammatory drugs and medical tape for the injured. \nThey also said there were high levels of underground water. \nOne of the rescue workers said they were now racing to get the miners out.\n\"Next step, we'll continue to use life detectors and other equipment to contact those trapped underground. At the same time, we're speeding the clearing of the main shaft and drilling additional rescue holes.\"\nChinese media report there are also several other rescue shafts being drilled in the hope the workers - thought to be about 600m (2,000ft) from the entrance - can be evacuated. \nInitially, it took more than a day for the accident to be reported, meaning rescue teams lost precious time to start their attempt to reach the miners. \nBoth the local Communist Party secretary and mayor have been sacked because of this 30-hour delay.\nMining accidents in China are often linked to poorly-enforced safety regulations.\nIn December last year, 23 miners died after a carbon monoxide leak at a coal mine. \nIn September, 16 workers were killed at another mine on the outskirts of Chongqing when a conveyor belt caught fire, producing high levels of carbon monoxide.\nIn December 2019, an explosion at a coal mine in Guizhou province, south-west China, killed at least 14 people."

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "text": "Wales' health minister has denied Covid-19 vaccines are being held back. \nVaughan Gething was reacting to First Minister Mark Drakeford's comments the supply\u00a0had to last until February\u00a0to prevent \"vaccinators standing around with nothing to do\". \nIn a later tweet, Mr Drakeford said \"nobody is holding back vaccines\",  but the Conservative ex-Welsh secretary said his comments were \"astonishing\". \nMr Gething insists vaccines are being rolled out \"as quickly as possible\".\nAfter Mr Drakeford's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the Welsh Government had said the reason for spacing out vaccine supply was to avoid wastage.\nAsked about those comments, Mr Gething said: \"We're rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as possible.\n\"As the first minister's clarified tonight, we're not holding the vaccine back.\" \nPublic Health Wales said 151,737 people have been vaccinated, after at least 327,000 doses were delivered.\nMr Gething told BBC Wales Today: \"It's as quickly as we build our infrastructure to deliver, as quick as we're able to get the vaccines out to be delivered.\"\nBut former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said Mr Drakeford's comments had been \"astonishing\".\nThe Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales: \"I just find some of the excuses that have been made for why we are so behind in terms of vaccinating the over 80s - it just doesn't wash with our constituents I'm afraid\n\"When people in my constituency watch the television and they hear the first minister say 'this is not a sprint' when so many countries around the world are treating it exactly as that.\n\"The faster you roll out the vaccinations to the most vulnerable, ie the over 80s, the more lives that will be saved.\"\nOf the 327,000 delivered vaccines, 280,000 are the Pfizer-BioNTech type that has to be stored at -70C. \nA total of 4.8% of the population has been vaccinated in Wales, the same as in Scotland. This compares with 6.2% in England and 6.6% in Northern Ireland.\nAt the weekend the chairwoman of Wales' vaccination board Dr Gill Richardson, said the NHS was being supplied with as many vaccines as it could cope with.\nOn Monday, Mr Drakeford told the Today programme the supply of the Pfizer vaccine had to last until February and was not being used all at once.\n\"There will be no point, and certainly it will be logistically very damaging, to try to use all of that in the first week and then to have all our vaccinators standing around with nothing to do for another month,\" he said.\n\"The sensible thing to do is to use the vaccine you've got over the period that you've got it for so that your system can absorb it, they can go on working.\"\nIn a video he later posted on Twitter he said: \"Let me be completely clear, nobody is holding back vaccines. \n\"All our health boards are receiving doses of Pfizer as quickly as they can use it.\" \nThe British Medical Association (BMA) Wales tweeted it was \"extremely concerned\" about \"spacing out the Pfizer vaccine to make it last until the next delivery\". \n\"If Pfizer vaccines are available, second dose must be given to HCWs [health care workers] within the maximum 42-day timeline and all remaining vaccinations for staff must be accelerated,\" it said.\nThe Welsh Government's vaccine strategy pledges everyone will be offered a jab by autumn.\nThe NHS is vaccinating people in order of clinical risk, largely based on age groups from old to young.\nAs the roll-out ramps up, vaccines in Wales will be given in mass vaccination centres, GP surgeries, mobile units - and on Friday, the first pharmacy gave the Covid jab.\nThe Welsh Government said on Monday it was \"on course\" to complete 70% of vaccinations for over 80s and care home residents by the weekend.\nIt also confirmed that all ambulance staff had been offered the vaccine, and the ambulance service said so far more than 60% had had it.\nIn a statement, a government spokesman said: \"The Pfizer vaccine comes in large packs, which cannot be split and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures - at -70C. There are only two centres in Wales where we can keep them at this temperature. \n\"Once removed from storage, the vaccine lasts five days. Every dose wasted is a vaccine which cannot be given to someone in Wales.\n\"We want to ensure a consistent supply of the vaccine to minimise wastage.\"\nAt a coronavirus briefing on Monday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams also said ministers were not holding back on supplies.\n\"We are distributing Pfizer in a careful way to ensure there is infrastructure in Wales to deliver it safely and most efficiently, avoiding wastage because it is such a precious resource,\" she said.\nBut Paul Davies, Conservative group leader in the Senedd, said his inbox had been \"bombarded by people who are very, very angry\" about the pace of the roll-out.\n\"Suggesting that holding back the vaccine for a period of time so vaccinators aren't standing around doing nothing is absolutely preposterous,\" he said. \nWe've heard from two senior government ministers this morning - one of them the first minister - and received different explanations of what the strategy is for vaccine roll-out.\nThe first minister talked about having to make the Pfizer vaccine last until February, otherwise vaccinators would be standing around with nothing to do.\nHis education minister today denied that Welsh Government was doing anything to delay the use of the Pfizer vaccine - she talked about the need to go faster and to build up infrastructure and minimise wastage.\nPeople in vulnerable groups keen to know when they'll be receiving their jab won't be reassured by the lack of a coherent message.\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth MS said: \"Wales appears now to be dramatically behind England in terms of vaccine roll-out, so to see the first minister being relaxed about the slow pace of the vaccine roll-out here is very, very frustrating. Why are we rationing here?\" \nUK government vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi, when asked about the strategy in Wales, said his view for England was to use up supply and ensure it \"doesn't sit on a shelf or in a fridge\". \nThere are currently two approved vaccines being administered in Wales - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nA third vaccine has been approved for use in the UK - made by US company Moderna - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring.\nThere will be 35 mass vaccination centres across Wales but to ensure people - especially the elderly and those with mobility issues - can be inoculated where they live, about 250 GP practices across the country will be able to administer the jab by the end of January.\nMs Williams said that there would be 45 mass vaccination centres delivering the Pfizer jab by the end of the week.\nAs of Monday, the Cardiff and Vale health board said it had vaccinated more than 24,000 people, including nearly 19,000 health, social care and care home staff, nearly 600 care home residents and nearly 3,000 other people aged over 80.   \nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board in south Wales said it had vaccinated nearly 17,000 people as of Friday, and aimed to give all 100,000 people in the top priority groups at least a first dose by mid-February.\nThe Hywel Dda health board serving west Wales said on Monday it had given more than 18,000 vaccinations, including jabs to 42% of healthcare workers, 38% of care home staff, 25% of care home residents and just under 9% of people over 80.\nPowys Teaching health board said letters should arrive by Tuesday to everyone aged over 80 inviting them to get a vaccination, with more than 7,000 people in the priority groups having received their first dose.\nThe Swansea Bay board said it was \"on target\" to vaccinate all care home residents with a first dose by the end of January and that all over-80s would be offered a vaccine \"over the coming weeks\"\nIn north Wales, the Betsi Cadwaladr board said it aimed to vaccinate 90% of the priority groups by the end of January.\nIn south east Wales, the Aneurin Bevan board's most recent update from 11 January said that in its 94 care homes for elderly people all residents had been vaccinated in 34 homes and all staff in 63."

      "text": "Concerns have been raised about employees forced to go into workplaces that are not Covid-compliant during lockdown.\nBetween 6 and 14 January, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received 2,945 complaints about safety issues.\nThe head of the UK's unions called for ministers to crack down on employers \"who break Covid safety rules\".\nThe HSE said it had scaled up its work to check and support firms during the pandemic.\nThe Observer reports that no companies have been prosecuted and fined for breaking workplace coronavirus safety rules since the start of the latest national lockdown in England, although a spokeswoman for the HSE said figures on enforcement action, which can include verbal advice or a written warning, cannot be verified until Monday.\nShe added that its inspectors \"continue to be out and about, putting employers on the spot and checking that they are complying with health and safety law\".\nThe HSE has introduced telephone spot-checks in response to the coronavirus crisis, she said.\n\"We continue to scale up the number of spot check calls and visits we are doing so we can reach as many businesses as possible during the current lockdown period.\"\nTUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"If the government is upping enforcement, ministers should start with employers who break Covid safety rules.\"\nShe also called for an increase in resources for the HSE \"to stop rogue employers getting away with putting staff at risk. Every employer needs to know an inspection could happen any time\".\nThe HSE has carried out more than 32,300 site visits during the pandemic.\nThe government should also make it clear that everyone who can work from home should do so, Ms O'Grady added.\nUnder current lockdown restrictions, people across the UK who can work effectively from home should do so. They should only travel to their workplace if they cannot do their job remotely.\nThis includes healthcare professionals, teachers, childcare providers, transport workers, people who work in construction or manufacturing, funeral directors, and essential retail workers.\nFor workplaces that remain open in England, employers must \"carry out an appropriate Covid-19 risk assessment\" to develop a \"specific\" strategy to stop the virus's spread.\nIn England, guidelines set out strict measures which employers must follow, such as minimising the number of unnecessary visits to the office, frequent cleaning of workspaces and ensuring that staff observe 2m (6ft) social distancing wherever possible.\nThere is similar guidance for employers across a range of sectors in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nRead more from our Explainers team here.\nA spokesperson for the government said: \"The law is clear that people can only leave the home to work if they cannot reasonably work from home.\n\"We have worked with trade unions, businesses and medical experts to produce comprehensive Covid-secure guidance so that businesses permitted to remain open can do so in a way that is as safe as possible for workers and customers. This is kept under review as our understanding of the virus develops.\"\nA recent survey conducted by the Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) also suggests that some staff have faced pressure to return to the workplace despite a recent positive coronavirus test.\nOf 1,172 UK workers surveyed, four in 10 said they had worked within 10 days of a positive result. \nMore than 10% of respondents also said they had been ordered on-site when they could have \"easily\" and \"safely\" worked from home.\nBrian (not his real name), works cleaning portable toilets on construction sites in south-east England. \nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live that he does not feel safe, but feels \"forced to carry on working so I can pay my bills\".\nOn the site he works at most of the time, he hasn't seen a \"vast amount of mask-wearing\" and says that he has been laughed at for wearing his face mask and visor.\n\"It's really demoralising because you're laughed at anyway because of the job you're in.\"\nHe says the situation is \"50% worse\" than when construction sites were closed during England's first national lockdown.\nDue to his and his wife's worries, he asked if he could be furloughed, but his firm said that he would only be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay.\n\"Morale is on the floor,\" he says.\nAlan Lockey, head of the RSA's future work programme, suggested that workers \"feel forced to put themselves and others at risk of the virus\" because of insecure work and pressure from bosses.\nHe also called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to end the \"trade-off between health and putting food on the table\" by allowing self-isolating workers to access the government's furlough scheme and maintaining the \u00a320-per-week uplift in universal credit, which is due to expire in April."

and that's a serious pressure that comes on our system,\" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\n\"We can go up into nearly 200 ICU capacity but that comes at a stretch, that comes with putting our staff under severe pressure in ICU units.\n\"It also comes by having to shift the ICU specialist nurse from a ratio of one-to-one to a ratio of one-to-two or even one-to-three in extreme pressures. \n\"That's not something we want to do,\" he added.\nThe past week saw hospitals across Northern Ireland coming together in order to cope with the strain.\nOn 10 January, the Southern Health Trust was on the cusp of declaring a major incident amid the mounting pressures across the health service.\nThat was avoided as many off-duty staff answered a call to come into work and the health trusts pulled together to provide a regional response to the crisis.\nPatients were diverted to those hospitals which could take them and where infrastructure could cope with supplying additional oxygen to the very ill.\nOver the weekend of 9/10 January the Southern Health Trust - the smallest of the health trusts - was dealing with the highest number of patients who required oxygen.\nIn the past week the Northern and Southern Health Trusts have seen the highest number of patients.\nThat reflects the high rate of community transmission in some areas those trusts cover.\nMeanwhile, no resolution has been reached between Stormont leaders and the Irish Government over the sharing of passenger data.\nLast week, First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill criticised Dublin for failing to share information on travellers arriving there during the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said repeated efforts to access data on passenger locator forms filled out by people arriving in the Republic of Ireland had failed.\nMrs Foster and Ms O'Neill indicated on Thursday that they planned to raise the matter directly with Taoiseach (Irish prime minsiter) Miche\u00e1l Martin.\nMs O'Neill told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday that no resolution has been found yet.\nShe told MLAs the issue had been raised \"on every occasion we have had the opportunity\" and that it was \"regrettable\" that the issue had not been resolved. \nThe travel issue will be discussed at a meeting on Wednesday involving the first minister, the deputy first minister, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney and NI Secretary of State Brandon Lewis.\n\"I hope that perhaps Wednesday's meeting will allow some opportunity for there to be a way forward,\" the deputy first minister added.\nIt was announced on Sunday that all travellers who have returned from Portugal or transited through 16 South American countries in the past 14 days will have to - along with their household - self-isolate for 10 days upon return to Northern Ireland. \nThis includes travellers who entered these countries en route to another destination. All travellers returning home from South America are advised to be tested, whether or not they have symptoms. \nFrom Thursday, all international travellers will be required to present a negative Covid-19 test result before arriving in Northern Ireland.\nThis rule comes into effect in England, Scotland and Wales on Monday.\nOn Monday, the Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland reported eight more coronavirus-related deaths.\nIt brings its death toll to 2,616.\nThe department said 2,121 new cases of the virus had been reported, with a cumulative total of 174,843 infections.\nIt said that as of 14:00 local time on Monday, 1,975 Covid-19 patients are in hospital, of which 200 are in ICU (intensive care units).\nIrish Chief Medical Officer, Dr Tony Holohan, said: \"This third wave of the pandemic has seen higher level of hospitalisations across all age groups. \n\"There are now more sick people in hospital than any time in the course of this pandemic\"."

      "title": "Chris Cramer: Tributes paid after former BBC and CNN journalist dies aged 73",
      "tags": "BBC",
      "text": "Chris Cramer, a major figure in BBC News and later CNN International, has died at the age of 73 after a period of ill health. Former BBC director of news Richard Sambrook looks back at his life.\nChris Cramer's legacy will be the major change in attitudes and support for journalist safety he championed through the BBC and across the wider industry, as well as many achievements in newsgathering and international news. \nHe began his career as a teenager on the Portsmouth Evening News, moving to BBC Radio Solent when it launched in 1970. \nAfter a year's secondment in Brunei he found his way to the BBC TV Newsroom in the 1970s and developed his reputation as a highly competitive and effective news editor and field producer. \nIn 1980 he and a BBC team were in the Iranian Embassy in London collecting visas when it was seized by gunmen opposed to Ayatollah Khomeini. A standoff and siege followed, with Chris among 26 hostages. \nHe managed to feign serious illness and was released by the gunmen allowing him to give vital information to the authorities before the SAS stormed the embassy and rescued the hostages. \nAt a time when no-one understood or spoke of PTSD, it had a marked effect on his life. \nMany journalists and crew subsequently spoke of his care and attention when they had difficult experiences and he went on to drive major changes in understanding and support for journalists' safety. \nWith BBC Safety manager Peter Hunter, Chris introduced the first hostile environment training courses, risk assessments and equipment for those covering conflicts. \nFormer correspondent Martin Bell recalls: \"From Vietnam to Croatia I had covered 10 wars without protection. Then in June 1992 we were shot up crossing the airport runway in Sarajevo in a soft-skinned vehicle. Within two weeks Chris had procured our first armoured Land Rover, the redoubtable 'Miss Piggy', and the body armour to go with it.\"\nHe later introduced the first confidential counselling service for news teams, recognising PTSD, and helped found the International News Safety Institute, which spearheaded safety across the news industry. \nDuring the 1980s he was at the forefront of organising and overseeing major news coverage, including Michael Buerk's reporting from the Ethiopian famine, coverage of the IRA Brighton bomb attack on the British government, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, Kate Adie's reporting from Tiananmen Square, the fall of eastern Europe, the first Gulf War and many more major events. \nHis fierce competitiveness delivered a series of major exclusives and awards for BBC News. \nIn the 1990s he oversaw major investment in BBC Newsgathering and the integration of radio and TV reporting - often against internal resistance. His managerial style could be uncompromising and tough, but he was also bitingly funny, shrewd and his hard exterior hid a warm-hearted and generous core. \nHe was crucial to establishing the integrated News division as it exists today. \nIn 1996 he left the BBC to move to Atlanta as managing director and executive vice-president of CNN International. \nThere he took his passion for news safety and his competitive news edge to develop the network into a greater global force. \nAs his former BBC and CNN colleague Tony Maddox has said: \"Among his many accomplishments Chris was a pioneer and innovator in field safety for journalists. He led the development of guidelines and practices now widely adopted across the industry.\"\nHe was a larger-than-life figure who generated affection and respect in equal measure, often wielding a rapid and disarming wit.\nHe is also remembered for supporting women into senior and executive positions and helping them succeed. \nDirector of BBC News Fran Unsworth recalls: \"He was one of journalism's enormous characters and a legend in the television news industry. But the legend and the reported image always belied the man.  \n\"He was immensely kind, thoughtful and caring underneath that image he sometimes projected.\"\nFormer deputy director general Mark Byford said: \"He was probably the greatest newsgathering executive ever in the broadcast news business and his organisational skills, competitiveness, eye for a story and steel were extraordinary. \n\"He was also, behind the facade, a gentle giant who cared for his people with amazing passion and love.\n\"Many editors, correspondents and presenters in BBC News owe their success to his mentorship - myself included.\"\nAfter 11 years he left CNN and took up roles first with Reuters TV and then the Wall Street Journal, where his experience and expertise were used to develop their digital video services. \nHe leaves his wife, Nina, son Richard and daughter Nicolette and his daughter Hannah by an earlier marriage to Helen, a former BBC producer.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People in England in their 70s, and those listed as clinically extremely vulnerable, will begin receiving offers of a coronavirus vaccine this week.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the move was a \"significant milestone\" in the nation's vaccination programme.\nMore than five million people - from priority groups three and four - will be invited from Monday to have the jab.\nIt comes as 10 further mass vaccination hubs open across England.\nSpeaking from a vaccination centre in Oxford, Mr Johnson said about four million people had received a vaccine so far, adding it was now \"right\" to offer the jab to other priority groups.\nHe said: \"We're getting it out as fast as we can, four million done so far, I think we've done more than half of the over-80s, half of the people in care homes, the elderly residents of care homes.\"\nHe warned there would be no \"Open Sesame\" relaxation of Covid restrictions, adding that any easing was reliant on the vaccine rollout being a success and there being no further concerning variants of the virus.\nHe said the pace of the rollout was \"very encouraging\" but cautioned that any easing of the rules would be \"gradual\", as the situation was \"still pretty precarious\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock will lead a Downing Street news briefing later, No 10 has said.\nThe expansion of the vaccination programme comes after the number of people to receive a first dose rose to 3.8 million across the UK - more than have tested positive (3.4 million) since the pandemic began.\nHowever, people in the top two groups - care home residents, those aged 80 and over, and front-line healthcare workers - should still be prioritised for vaccinations, the Department for Health and Social Care said.\nPeople in their 70s - some 5.6 million people - and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals make up priority groups three and four.\nNadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, defended the decision to offer Covid jabs to the over-70s and clinically vulnerable - before all those in the first two priority groups have had their vaccinations.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the over-80s \"need not worry\" if they had not yet been invited for a jab. \nHe said as it was only areas where the majority of the over-80s had been vaccinated that people aged 70 and over were being invited for jabs. He added that, by today, 50% of care home residents should have been vaccinated.\nAlthough vaccine supply remained \"lumpy\", he said he was \"confident\" the government would meet its target to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February.\nMeanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said the NHS had never been under the level of pressure it is now, in any previous winter.\nProf Powis told BBC Breakfast: \"I don't think the NHS has ever been under such pressure in any winter, but our staff are responding magnificently.\"\nHe added that there were \"signs\" in London that growth and infection rates were \"slowing\" but it would take \"several weeks\" before it had an impact in reducing the number of people in hospital, warning that it would be \"tough\" over the next couple of weeks.\nDr Rupert Pearse, a consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at a London Hospital, said although it appeared that infection levels had peaked in the capital, cases were still rising elsewhere in England, including the North West and Yorkshire, adding there was \"still cause to be concerned\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World At One that hospital admissions tended to \"lag seven to 10 days behind the peak in infections\", with intensive care admissions coming 48 hours after that.\nHe said that hospitals that are very close to the maximum number of beds they can give to Covid patients were \"still very worried about what will happen in the coming days\".\nDr Sarah Burford, a GP in Wellington, Somerset, who has been helping lead vaccine rollout in her region, said it was going \"terribly well\" but that \"a few\" patients had turned up out of the blue looking for a jab.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that her four vaccinators were each giving a jab every seven-and-a-half minutes.\nDr Burford added the over-80s and frontline healthcare workers were being invited for jabs, and her team's \"priority\" for this week and next would be vaccinating care home residents and staff.\nShe said although most people were being patient, fielding calls or walk-in inquiries about when people could expect to be vaccinated was only delaying staff from administering jabs.\nThe seven hubs already in use are in: Etihad Tennis Centre, Manchester; Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey; Robertson House, Stevenage; Centre for Life, Newcastle; Ashton Gate Stadium, Bristol; Millennium Point, Birmingham; ExCel, London.\nMeanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has defended the speed of the vaccine rollout in Wales, insisting the nation was \"on track\" to vaccinate all top four priority groups by mid-February.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Wales's supply of the Pfizer jab is not being used all at once as it has to last until a delivery in February.\nIn Wales, 151,737 people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to Public Health Wales, and  in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that 264,991 people have had a first dose of the jab, with 80% of care home residents having now been vaccinated.\nWhile the prime minster said the UK is making \"huge progress in our fight against the virus\", he also expressed concern about that progress being derailed by new - currently unknown - variants of the virus.\nAs such, he announced on Friday that, from this week, all travel corridors are to be closed.\nThat means that anyone arriving in the UK - with only a small number of exceptions - will have to quarantine. Under current rules, anyone flying into the country from overseas also has to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off.\n Are you due to have a coronavirus vaccine?

      "tags": "Brexit,Fishing industry,Dartmouth",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has pledged \u00a323m to help businesses affected by Brexit delays amid protests by fishing firms.\nDemonstrations took place outside government departments in central London by exporters who are warning their livelihoods are under threat.\nExports of fresh fish and seafood have been severely disrupted by new border controls since the UK's transition period ended earlier this month.\nThe PM said firms would be compensated for delays that were not their fault.\nIndustry associations have complained that extra paperwork has made it difficult to deliver fresh produce to mainland Europe before it goes off.\nThey have warned that if the situation continues, jobs could soon be at risk.\nPressed on what he would do in response, Mr Johnson said the government would step in to support firms which \"through no fault of their own have experienced bureaucratic delays, difficulties getting their goods through, where there is a genuine willing buyer on the other side of the channel\".\n\"There's a \u00a323m compensation fund we've set up and we'll make sure they get help,\" he said.\nDetails of the scheme are expected later this week.\nAfter a day of protests in central London, which saw 20 lorries drive up Whitehall, the Metropolitan Police said 14 people had been reported for Covid-related offences, but no arrests were made.\nMark Moore, manager of the Dartmouth Crab Company, said his business and others were protesting to \"raise awareness\" of the impact of new border checks.\nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live his company had faced delays of up to eight and a half hours when delivering produce into the European Union.\nHe added that the situation was \"especially difficult\" for the shellfish sector, where goods were at risk of going off before reaching customers. \n\"It's not about the increased documentation per se,\" he said. \n\"We have taken that on board, and we ourselves - and I know many others - have had no issues with producing the actual paperwork.\n\"It's the volume required and the timeframe in which to produce it, which doesn't lend itself to live shellfish and fish generally.\"\nJohn McManus, BBC News\nThere are 24 lorries in total, overwhelmingly from seafood exporters in Scotland. Businesses taking part say the Brexit trade deal has left their industry high and dry. \nAnd although one haulier from Aberdeenshire I spoke to was keen to stress that their coordinated protest was peaceful, it is clear that they all feel that direct action is now necessary to make the government sit up and take notice.  \nGood natured though their action was, it did for a time cause serious traffic congestion along Whitehall and Parliament Square. \nHowever, low levels of traffic perhaps caused by the Covid lockdown meant the roads around Whitehall didn't grind to a complete halt. \nAt stake, they believe, is an industry, but also thousands of livelihoods. Exporters say they are backed by fishermen who are struggling to land their catches. \nAnd although the rural Scottish communities which are sustained by fishing might seem like a long way from the streets of SW1, the hauliers certainly made their presence felt this morning. \nHaving left the EU's customs union and the single market, UK exports are subject to new customs and veterinary checks which have caused problems at the border. \nSome Scottish fishermen have been landing their catch in Denmark to avoid the \"bureaucratic system\" involved in exporting to Europe, according to Scotland's rural economy secretary.\nLast week, Boris Johnson told a committee of MPs that fishing firms impacted by disruption would be compensated for \"temporary frustrations\".\nBut the BBC was told that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) did not know about the promise of compensation before it was made by Mr Johnson. \nSpeaking to reporters, the prime minister said he understood the \"frustrations\" of the fishing industry, noting its plight had been \"exacerbated by the Covid pandemic\".\n\"Unfortunately, the demand in restaurants on the continent for UK fish has not been what it was before the pandemic, just because the restaurants have been closed for so long,\" he added. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused ministers of trying to \"blame fishing communities\" for problems \"rather than accepting it's their failure to prepare\".\n\"The government has known there would be a problem with fishing and particularly the sale of fish into the EU for years,\" he told reporters. \nBy Martyn Oates, BBC South West Political Editor \nMuch media attention has been focussed on Scotland as this export crisis has unfolded.\nBut exactly the same problem is rearing its head in the UK's other great fishing stronghold - at the other end of the UK in Devon and Cornwall.\nA virtual Who's Who of South West fishing leaders wrote to the environment secretary back in November warning that the new post-Brexit export requirements would have a \"seriously detrimental effect\" on the industry, claiming this \"could be the final straw for many businesses\".\nHere, too, many fish exports have now ground to a halt and others have encountered obstacles and long delays.\nAnd exporters have reacted angrily to the government's repeated insistence that the issues they've been experiencing over the last two weeks are just \"teething problems\"."

      "text": "More than four million people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures.\nPeople in their 70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable in England are now among those being offered the vaccine.\nHowever, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said UK data showed more people were in hospital with Covid than ever - and urged people to follow lockdown rules.\nHe said: \"Do not blow it now. We are on the route out. We have to stick at it.\"\nSpeaking during a Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said more than half of those over 80 and half of elderly care home residents had been vaccinated.\nHe said that in some parts of the country the \"vast majority\" of people in their 80s had had their first dose - and specifically congratulated Slough for having already vaccinated every single elderly care home resident. \nEarlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey had said people in her constituency in the Suffolk Coastal area had told her some over-80s, and even over-90s, had not been invited for a vaccination while younger people had been.\nWhen Mr Hancock was asked why some areas of the UK were reporting not having enough vaccines, he said \"supply is the rate-limiting factor\".\nHe said the government was now \"prioritising the supply\" to places that needed to vaccinate over-80s - but did not want to stop areas that had progressed well from pressing on with vaccinating their other priority groups.\nThe Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to start with - the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have now been vaccinated.\nIn some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s in for vaccination.\nThe progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination rates globally.\nChallenges remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have an impact.\nWhile the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UK's supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and will mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise.\nMinisters are confident the mid February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine will not be affected - there is already enough vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is such nervousness about supply chains.\nA further 599 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, according to the latest government figures.  Figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend.\nAnother 37,535 positive cases were reported - down from a high of 68,053 reported on 8 January.\nIt comes as 10 further mass vaccination hubs opened across England, adding to seven already in place.\nSpeaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Oxford, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was \"right\" to offer the jab to other priority groups from this week.\n\"I think actually the whole of the UK is going very well. And, overall, the pace of the rollout is very encouraging,\" he said.\nHe warned there would be no \"Open Sesame\" relaxation of Covid restrictions, adding that any easing was reliant on the vaccine rollout being a success and there being no further concerning variants of the virus.\nThe number of people who have received their first dose of the vaccine is now 4,062,501 - which is more than have tested positive (3,433,494) in the UK since the pandemic began.\nThe expansion of the vaccination programme means it now includes priority groups three and four - people in their 70s and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals.\nHowever, people in the top two groups - care home residents, those aged 80 and over, and front-line healthcare workers - should still be prioritised for vaccinations, the Department for Health and Social Care said.\nNadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said that although vaccine supply remained \"lumpy\", he was \"confident\" the government would meet its target to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February.\nMeanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said there was more pressure on the NHS than ever before.\nSpeaking alongside Mr Hancock in the briefing, he said around 15,000 people had been admitted to hospital since Christmas Eve, adding: \"That is well over 20 hospitals worth of patients.\"\nHe said it would be \"some time\" before the vaccination programme begins to reduce pressures on hospitals.\nIn Oxfordshire, hospitals have postponed routine operations because of a high number of coronavirus patients.\nAnd the BBC's Clive Myrie has been to the Royal London Hospital to report on staff struggling to cope.\nThe seven hubs already in use are in: Etihad Tennis Centre, Manchester; Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey; Robertson House, Stevenage; Centre for Life, Newcastle; Ashton Gate Stadium, Bristol; Millennium Point, Birmingham; ExCel, London.\nDr Rupert Pearse, a consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at a London hospital, said although it appeared that infection levels had peaked in the capital, cases were still rising elsewhere in England, including the North West and Yorkshire, adding there was \"still cause to be concerned\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World At One that hospital admissions tended to \"lag seven to 10 days behind the peak in infections\", with intensive care admissions coming 48 hours after that.\nHe said that hospitals that are very close to the maximum number of beds they can give to Covid patients were \"still very worried about what will happen in the coming days\".\nDr Sarah Burford, a GP in Wellington, Somerset, who has been helping lead the vaccine rollout in her region, said it was going \"terribly well\" but that \"a few\" patients had turned up out of the blue looking for a jab.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that her four vaccinators were each giving a jab every seven-and-a-half minutes.\nDr Burford added the over-80s and frontline healthcare workers were being invited for jabs, and her team's \"priority\" for this week and next would be vaccinating care home residents and staff.\nShe said that although most people were being patient, fielding calls or walk-in inquiries about when people could expect to be vaccinated was only delaying staff from administering jabs.\nMeanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has defended the speed of the vaccine rollout in Wales, insisting the nation is \"on track\" to vaccinate all top four priority groups by mid-February.\nHe told Today that Wales's supply of the Pfizer jab was not being used all at once as it has to last until a delivery in February.\nIn Wales, 151,737 people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to Public Health Wales, and  in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that 264,991 people have had a first dose of the jab, with 80% of care home residents having now been vaccinated.\nWhile the prime minster said the UK was making \"huge progress in our fight against the virus\", he also expressed concern about that progress being derailed by new - currently unknown - variants of the virus.\nAs such, he announced on Friday that, from this week, all travel corridors are to be closed.\nThat means that anyone arriving in the UK - with only a small number of exceptions - will have to quarantine.

      "title": "Phil Spector: Pop producer jailed for murder dies at 81",
      "text": "US music producer Phil Spector has died at the age of 81, while serving a prison sentence for murder.\nSpector, who transformed pop with his \"wall of sound\" recordings, worked with the Beatles, the Righteous Brothers and Ike and Tina Turner. \nIn 2009, he was convicted of the 2003 murder of Hollywood actress Lana Clarkson.\nHis death was confirmed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. \n\"California Health Care Facility inmate Phillip Spector was pronounced deceased of natural causes at 6:35 p.m. on Saturday, January 16, 2021, at an outside hospital. His official cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner in the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office,\" it said.\nSpector produced 20 top 40 hits between 1961 and 1965. His production methods influenced major artists including the Beach Boys and Bruce Springsteen.\nHis life was ultimately blighted by drug and alcohol addiction, and he all but retired from the music scene during the 1980s and 1990s.\nIn February 2003, actress Lana Clarkson was found dead at his house in Alhambra, California with a bullet wound to her head. Clarkson, who was known for her work in the sword-and-sorcery genre and starred in films including Barbarian Queen, had met Spector hours earlier at a nightclub.\nSpector claimed the shooting happened when Clarkson \"kissed the gun\" - but his trial heard from four women who claimed Spector had threatened them with guns in the past when they had spurned his advances.\nFollowing an initial mistrial, Spector was convicted of second degree murder and given a sentence of 19 years to life. \nHarvey Phillip Spector was born in New York in 1939, to Russian-Jewish parents. His father killed himself when Spector was a boy, and his mother moved her family to Los Angeles.  \nHe began his career in his teens as a performer, forming a band - the Teddy Bears - with three high school friends. They had a hit single in 1958 with a song that took its title from the wording on his father's gravestone: \"To know him is to love him.\"\nThe record went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100, but the group split the following year.\nSpector founded his own record label, Philles, in 1961. He produced high-profile 1960s girl groups such as Crystals and the Ronettes, including on 1963 hits Be My Baby and Baby I Love You.\nHe also worked on The Righteous Brothers' hits You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' and Unchained Melody.\nHis signature production technique, the \"Wall of Sound,\" involved layering several instruments, including strings, woodwind and brass, to give a lush, orchestral sound.\nIn the early 1970s, Spector collaborated with The Beatles on their final album Let It Be, as well as producing John Lennon's solo album Imagine.\nAs the decade progressed, the much-feted producer became reclusive and disturbing accounts of his behaviour became widespread. Spector is said to have held a gun to singer Leonard Cohen's head during sessions for his album Death of a Ladies' Man.\nRonettes lead singer Veronica \"Ronnie\" Bennett, who became Spector's second wife and divorced him in 1974, wrote in her 1990 autobiography that he subjected her to years of horrific abuse. She said he had threatened to kill her and display her body in a glass-topped coffin he kept in her basement. \n\"I can only say that when I left in the early '70s, I knew that if I didn't leave at that time, I was going to die there,\" Ronnie wrote of the time. \nWriting on Instagram after her ex-husband's death, Ronnie Spector said he had been \"a brilliant producer but a lousy husband\".\n\"When I was working with Phil Spector, watching him create in the recording studio, I knew I was working with the very best,\" she wrote. \"He was in complete control, directing everyone. So much to love about those days.\n\"Meeting him and falling in love was like a fairytale,\" she continued. \"The magical music we were able to make together was inspired by our love. I loved him madly, and gave my heart and soul to him.\n\"Unfortunately Phil was not able to live and function outside of the recording studio. Darkness set in, many lives were damaged.\"\nSinger Darlene Love, who sang on several songs Spector produced, said he \"changed the sound of rock 'n' roll\" but likened their relationship to \"a bad marriage\".\n\"The problem I have with Phil is that he wanted to control Darlene Love's talent,\" she told Variety. \"If he couldn't do that, he was going to do everything in his power to keep my talent from shining.\"\nWeeks before Lana Clarkson was shot dead, Spector gave a rare interview to British broadsheet The Telegraph. \n\"I would say I'm probably relatively insane, to an extent,\" he told the paper, adding that he had \"devils inside that fight me\".    \nResponding to news of the producer's death, Blondie guitarist Chris Stein tweeted: \"When we went to Phil Spector's house in the 70s he came to the door holding a bottle of diet Manischewitz wine in one hand and a presumably loaded 45 automatic in the other. Long story.\n\"I thought he was nuts.\""

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "Last week London exceeded the grim milestone of 10,000 deaths linked to Covid-19. Thousands of people are critically ill in hospital, and as many as 5% of Londoners are thought to have the virus in some parts of the city. As coronavirus continues to circulate silently around the capital, staff at the London Ambulance Service (LAS) are under immense pressure.\nThe service is currently taking up to 8,500 calls a day, compared with a pre-Covid figure of 5,000 to 6,000, according to its chief executive Garrett Emmerson. \nLizzie Cooke is one of the workers at LAS's south London headquarters who are dealing with strangers at what is a distressing time. \nCalmly, the 30-year-old answers the phone and usually asks first if the patient is breathing.\n\"In the first wave we were getting a lot of calls of [people seeking] reassurance,\" Lizzie says. \"But now there are more and more who have symptoms, and family members are really frightened.\"\nIt is a fear that Lizzie knows all too well, having been hospitalised with Covid-19 in March. She spent a week receiving treatment for the virus.\n\"I was at work taking calls and struggling to concentrate,\" the call-handling supervisor says. \"At times I would just have my head on the desk in between calls.\n\"I started to develop chest pains five days later so my parents took me to Royal County Hospital, in Hampshire, and an X-ray showed a lot of fluid in my lungs. It was quite horrible.\n\"Luckily, I wasn't on a ventilator but I had the oxygen hood, and the nurses were so rushed off their feet. I didn't have my phone with me or know my parents' numbers off by heart so for that week I was quite alone and isolated. \n\"It was just a mixture of the unknown and not knowing when it was going to stop that was so daunting.\"\nLizzie's personal battle with coronavirus has helped her to empathise with people who call up with breathing problems.\nIt's something she says she's having to do more and more.\n\"Just before Christmas we were getting a lot of respiratory and cardiac arrest calls,\" she says. \"You could just hear colleagues counting to four [for chest compressions] and it was echoing around the room. It has been tough.\n\"We are getting calls from family members who are really frightened. I covered the London Bridge terror attacks and Grenfell but this is a different scale.\n\"I did get one call for toothache, but that's part of the job.\"\nLizzie, who lives in Hampshire, says that because the coverage of coronavirus is everywhere, it is \"difficult to escape\". \nWhen she's not at work she binge-watches Line of Duty on Netflix, but she says winding down isn't easy.\nLizzie sometimes thinks about the people who aren't following the rules aimed at helping stop the spread of the virus, and those who deny Covid-19 even exists.\n\"It's a kick in the teeth,\" she says. \"It is frustrating on the way to work when you see people not wearing masks or even posting stuff on social media not believing the virus is real. \n\"I just don't know where the disconnect is coming from; there are many people in hospital, many people dying, and I don't know what more needs to be said to make them realise how dangerous the illness is.\"\nSitting a few metres away from Lizzie is 24-year-old Louise Essam, who has been in the job for two years.\n\"Every call we take at the moment is coronavirus,\" she says. \"My record was 108 calls in a day back in March during the first wave.\n\"But easily in the last few weeks I've been taking around 100 a day at times,\" Louise adds.\n\"Sometimes I'll come in for a shift and can just hear colleagues counting one, two, three, four, for the compressions, and you just know what kind of shift it is going to be.\n\"It has been tough and quite frustrating, really. We are trying to help people. We are under so much pressure as there are high waiting times, but we are just doing the best we can.\"\nHelp is at hand though from the LAS workers' fellow emergency services personnel.\nSeventy-five Met Police officers are currently being trained at Wembley Stadium to drive ambulances.\nThey will start work as drivers from 20 January, joining the 200 firefighters who are already helping LAS.\n\"It came as a huge relief when they announced it,\" says 37-year-old paramedic Ben West.\nAs is the case with many frontline workers, Ben says he is concerned about the dangers of exposure to coronavirus.\nHe has lost four colleagues to Covid-19, including Ian Reynolds, a paramedic based in Croydon, and Melonie Mitchell, a member of the NHS 111 team. They both died during the first wave in April.\n\"I wouldn't be a normal person if I said I wasn't scared,\" he says.\n\"I am scared and I do worry but we take every day as it comes, take our precautions and we just see where we go with that. \n\"We know the virus is out there in the community and we are not immune.\""

      "tags": "Swansea Bay University Health Board,Welsh Ambulance Service,NHS Wales,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "After experiencing its most difficult period of the entire Covid-19 pandemic in December, the boss of Welsh Ambulance Service said it was still under \"extreme pressure\".\nAt one stage, 400 staff - 12% of all workers - were sick or self-isolating.\nJason Killens said this was exacerbated by high call numbers and \"significant delays\" handing patients to hospitals. \nOne paramedic described questioning whether he was in the right job after being spat at during the pandemic.\nThe chief executive said it meant \"patients with less serious conditions waited much longer than we would like\".\nParamedic Stan Baxter, describing the pressure he and colleagues were under, said at one point an incident caused him to question whether he wanted to continue working.\n\"During the peak of the pandemic last year, I was assaulted by a member of the public where I was spat at in the face,\" he said.\n\"And that's really the only time that I've stopped and gone: 'Is this for me?'\"\nHowever the \"vast majority of the public\" had been \"absolutely fantastic\", he stressed, adding: \"We've had people waving at us, buying us coffee.\"\nFor his work partner, Luke Robinson, their job made it clear how coronavirus had made a resurgence across the country.\n\"I worked New Year's Eve and I responded to a number of incidents which involved just regular health complaints,\" he said.\n\"But next door or in the adjacent building there's people having parties and you can tell that there's large gatherings going on. And it's really frustrating because it really hammers home that some people aren't listening to the rules.\n\"And it's not surprising that we're seeing a second wave now.\"\nMr Killens said the pressure was now \"palpably less\" compared to last month, but admitted difficult weeks lie ahead.\n\"December was probably the most pressurised period during the whole pandemic for a number of reasons,\" he said.\n\"Staff that were symptomatic or isolating, that's been at its peak in December.\n\"We've seen more work both in the 111 and 999 service, that is patients contacting us with Covid-related symptoms, and of course because of the pressure on the rest of the NHS, we've seen extended handover at some of our emergency departments and what that's meant regrettably is some less serious patients have waited a lot longer in the community than I would have expected.\"\nThe ambulance service has been at its highest level of alert - described as \"extreme pressure\" - since early December.\nIt was so bad at the beginning of the month, the service had to declare a \"critical incident\", because of severe problems in south east Wales in particular - and one man had to wait 19 hours in an ambulance outside a hospital.\nThis strain has been partly blamed for deteriorating ambulance response times, with the situation exacerbated by the fact hospitals are struggling.\nAmbulances spent more than 11,661 hours outside emergency departments waiting to transfer patients in December - an equivalent to a total of more than 485 days. The average delay was one hour and eight minutes.\n\"We would usually see handover delays through winter - but what's unique this time is the overlay of the pandemic,\" Mr Killens added.\n\"There has to be additional distancing, this means less capacity in emergency departments. \n\"Testing also needs to be done before patients are admitted  - the additional complexities mean the process is slower and there's less space for patients to go into.\"\nHe said the impact of implementing Covid precautions is also affecting how quickly crews can respond.\n\"As a result of the virus, we're having to clean vehicles and equipment more frequently and thoroughly than before,\" Mr Killens said.\n\"Also there are levels for personal protective equipment that staff have to wear to protect themselves and others. Level three - the highest in some cases. \n\"And it takes a number of minutes for crews to put that on before staff treat the patients.\"\nTo bolster staffing levels and speed up response times, about 80 soldiers are assisting the Welsh Ambulance Service for the second time since the start of the pandemic - along with smaller number of staff from other services like the fire service.\n\"They are driving emergency ambulances for us... which means an emergency ambulance clinician can look after the patient,\" Mr Killens added.\n\"They'll drive the ambulance from the scene to hospital... it enables us to put more ambulances on the streets to respond to patients more quickly given the levels of absence that we've seen.\"\nAfter facing relentless pressure for close to a year, Mr Killens is worried about the impact on mental health and well-being of ambulance and control centre staff.\nThe service is focused on \"what we can do to keep them fit and well\", he said.\nBut he praised staff for \"stepping up to the plate\" - and insists some of the lessons learnt during the last year will benefit the service during the longer term.\n\"I've been in the ambulance sector for 25 years and this is like dealing with a very long incident,\" said Mr Killens.\n\"So, a major incident an emergency service routinely responds to generally will be over in a couple of hours. But the level of pressure has been sustained now for 12 months.\n\"All of our people have stepped up and done what was necessary and got on with providing the best care in really difficult circumstances.... we will come through it and at the end of the pandemic and will be a stronger organisation for it.\"\nHe believes the service is now \"on the home straight\" in dealing with the pandemic.\n\"We've had two waves of this virus and learnt much along the way, and with a vaccine rollout we have a real opportunity now to see an end to the disruption, the personal impact and the level of death and harm,\" Mr Killens said.\n\"By the time we get to the other side of the spring, probably we will be able to return to some kind of normality whatever that will be 18 months into a pandemic. \n\"There's a couple of difficult weeks to come, but if we can emerge through February and March, provided we all stick to the rules, because it's easy for the virus to grab hold again if we get complacent .... we'll be in a far better position as we come to the spring.\""

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "\"I am paying \u00a39,000 for a university degree that is causing me nothing but anxiety and stress.\"\nFor Morgan Le-Riche, the university experience since the coronavirus pandemic hit has not been worth the fee.\nSome students are calling for reduced tuition fees and more support. \nThe Welsh Government said it provided the most generous student support package in the UK and has appointed a dedicated minister for mental health.\nIn announcing a lockdown earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said students in England would not return to the classroom until mid February, with calls for clarity over what will happen in Wales.\nMorgan, who is studying criminology and criminal justice at the University of South Wales, said \"something needs to be done to help us students\".\nHer Facebook post calling for more help was shared 3,000 times in three days - something that surprised her but also highlighted the depth of feeling.\nThe second year student said: \"I don't think the government is understanding students, instead they are only recognising primary and secondary schools - there's no recognition for university students.\"\nMorgan was given assignments to complete over Christmas, but said her lecturers had turned off their emails so she could not seek guidance when she was finding work difficult.\n\"I feel like the amount of stress I've had has meant I'm not doing a high enough standard of work, that I would normally do, due to the lack of assistance,\" she said. \nShe said more time with tutors and spaces for students to come together to discuss mental health would be beneficial.\nThe University of South Wales said their course teams are committed to providing \"comprehensive support\" and are \"readily available to offer help and guidance for students\".\nA petition calling for the UK government to reduce university student tuition fees from \u00a39,250 to \u00a33,000 has gained more than 400,000 signatures online. \nMorgan thinks she has been \"massively let down\" and there needs to be a \"heavy reduction\" on the amount students are paying for their courses.\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We are the only country in the whole of Europe that provides equivalent up front living costs grants and loans for full and part-time undergraduates, and for post-graduates. \n\"This already covers campus-based and distance learners and will continue throughout the academic year.\"\nJournalism student Danielle Herbert, who also studies at the University of South Wales, said online learning has helped her mental health because otherwise a lot of her face-to-face interactions would be limited. \nDespite \"lecturers trying their best\", students' experiences since March last year have not been \"adequate for a \u00a39,000 fee\".\nThe third-year student from Swindon said the prime minister's announcement of an England-wide lockdown was stressful \"because there was no mention of universities\".\nShe said: \"I was left very unclear and confused as to where I stood on travelling back to Wales. As someone who suffers from anxiety, I rely on concrete facts and that wasn't provided. We have been ignored by the prime minister.\n\"I had just paid my rent for this term - which was \u00a32,300 - and I looked at my mum and dad and said: 'Am I even going to be able to go back to my student flat'?\"\nShe does not believe students have had the same level of support as secondary school pupils, adding: \"We're still expected to produce the same standard of work without protection whilst there's a pandemic going on - it's really unrealistic.\"\nDanielle said having a \"no detriment\" policy in place would help to relieve students' stress. \n\"I think there's a real issue amongst students and students' mental health and it's only grown because of coronavirus. I think we will see the consequences of that if nothing is done.\"\nThe Welsh Government said: \"To support mental health services, we have made an additional \u00a39.9m available, as part of efforts to ensure people can access the right support when they need it.\n\"In October we announced an additional \u00a310m to support mental health services for higher education students in Wales to increase capacity in students' unions and universities to provide support services. \n\"This is in addition to the \u00a327m Higher Education Investment and Recovery Fund announced in the summer.\"\nThe University of South Wales said the safety and wellbeing of students is its priority and students have access to a \"wide range of comprehensive support for their health, mental health and wellbeing\".\n\"Recognising that a number of staff would be on leave over the Christmas and New Year holidays, the course team let students know they were available for help and support right up until the end of term and students were encouraged to ask for support if they needed it,\" said a spokesperson. \n\"We are providing a full and interactive blended learning offer this term, in line with Welsh Government guidance, so that students can receive good experiences and a high-quality education, enabling them to progress and complete their studies on time.\""

      "tags": "Russia,Alexei Navalny",
      "text": "Russia's leading opposition figure has been arrested and detained for 30 days, after returning to Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last year.\nAlexei Navalny said a court ruling held inside a police station was a mockery and called for street protests.\nDozens of his supporters gathered outside the Moscow police station where he was being held and shouted \"disgrace\" and \"Putin resign\".\nMr Navalny was held soon after his flight from Germany arrived on Sunday.\nRussian prosecutors say he violated the parole terms of a suspended sentence for embezzlement. He says the charges are politically motivated.\nLast August, Mr Navalny, 44, was almost killed in a nerve agent attack, which he blamed personally on Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThe Kremlin denies involvement. The opposition politician's allegations have, however, been backed up by reports from investigative journalists.\nOn Sunday, big crowds gathered at Moscow's Vnukovo airport to greet Mr Navalny's flight from Berlin - but in a last-minute decision the authorities re-routed the plane to another airport in the capital.\nA makeshift courtroom was organised on Monday at a police station in Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow, where Mr Navalny had spent the night.\nThe judge ordered Mr Navalny's detention until 15 February for violating his parole. He will have another hearing on 29 January to determine whether his suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years should be replaced with a jail term. \nMr Navalny said his treatment was beyond a \"mockery of justice\" and described the hearing as \"lawlessness of the highest grade\".\n\"Don't be afraid. Take to the streets, not for me, but for yourselves, for your future,\" he said in a video address (in Russian) from the police station.\nA crowd of about 200 Navalny supporters gathered outside the police station in freezing weather, demanding his immediate release.\nMr Navalny was later seen led away by police to one of Moscow's prisons.\nHis lawyer, Vadim Kobzev, said they would appeal against the \"illegal\" court decision, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.\nMeanwhile, more than 70 Navalny supporters and journalists were detained across Russia on Monday, according to the Monitoring group OVD-Info.\nThe US and European Union led calls for Mr Navalny to be freed, but stopped short of threatening any punitive action.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russian authorities were trying to silence their critics, while incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Kremlin's \"attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard\".\nFrance, Italy, Germany and the president of the European Commission were also among those calling for his release. \nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described Mr Navalny's arrest as \"appalling\".\n\"Rather than persecuting Mr Navalny, Russia should explain how a chemical weapon came to be used on Russian soil,\" he said. \nAs Mr Navalny gradually recovered after emergency medical treatment in Germany, he said he intended to return to Russia. \nOn Sunday, he made good on that pledge, boarding a flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. \nThe plane was packed with journalists, including from the BBC. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for \"technical reasons\", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport, where thousands of Navalny supporters had gathered, to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers.\nA number of people were detained by riot police.\nLiza Shuvalova, BBC News\nThere had always been a feeling Flight DP936 from Berlin to Moscow with Alexei Navalny on board would not go according to plan.\nSo when the captain announced that the plane would be diverted to a different airport, Mr Navalny shouted his apology to everyone on board, many of whom were journalists.\nAfter a ride in a bus from the plane to the airport, he told us he was not afraid and was very happy to return home. \nAs he approached passport control with his wife Yulia, he said to the border control officer with a smile: \"You must have been waiting for me for a long time!\" And it was probably true. \nA few moments later, he was asked by policemen to accompany them or they would have to use \"force\". Mr Navalny wanted his lawyer Olga Mikhailova - who was on the same flight - to go with him. But at that point, she had already crossed the border and was not allowed back airside as Mr Navalny was led away.\nRussia's prison service said the opposition leader \"had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period\" related to his suspended sentence for embezzlement.\nSeparately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation.\nMr Navalny accuses Mr Putin of targeting him with spurious cases.\nMr Navalny collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The flight was diverted to the city of Omsk, where he was admitted to hospital. He was airlifted to Germany in an induced coma.\nEuropean experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War.\nLast month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years.\nMr Navalny later said he had duped an FSB agent into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation, which he recorded and posted online. The FSB said the recording was \"fake\".\nPresident Putin has dismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groups that have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as \"a trick\". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales' health minister has denied Covid-19 vaccines are being held back. \nVaughan Gething was reacting to First Minister Mark Drakeford's comments the supply\u00a0had to last until February\u00a0to prevent \"vaccinators standing around with nothing to do\". \nIn a later tweet, Mr Drakeford said \"nobody is holding back vaccines\",  but the Conservative ex-Welsh secretary said his comments were \"astonishing\". \nMr Gething insists vaccines are being rolled out \"as quickly as possible\".\nAfter Mr Drakeford's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the Welsh Government had said the reason for spacing out vaccine supply was to avoid wastage.\nAsked about those comments, Mr Gething said: \"We're rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as possible.\n\"As the first minister's clarified tonight, we're not holding the vaccine back.\" \nPublic Health Wales said 151,737 people have been vaccinated, after at least 327,000 doses were delivered.\nMr Gething told BBC Wales Today: \"It's as quickly as we build our infrastructure to deliver, as quick as we're able to get the vaccines out to be delivered.\"\nBut former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said Mr Drakeford's comments had been \"astonishing\".\nThe Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales: \"I just find some of the excuses that have been made for why we are so behind in terms of vaccinating the over 80s - it just doesn't wash with our constituents I'm afraid\n\"When people in my constituency watch the television and they hear the first minister say 'this is not a sprint' when so many countries around the world are treating it exactly as that.\n\"The faster you roll out the vaccinations to the most vulnerable, ie the over 80s, the more lives that will be saved.\"\nOf the 327,000 delivered vaccines, 280,000 are the Pfizer-BioNTech type that has to be stored at -70C. \nA total of 4.8% of the population has been vaccinated in Wales, the same as in Scotland. This compares with 6.2% in England and 6.6% in Northern Ireland.\nAt the weekend the chairwoman of Wales' vaccination board Dr Gill Richardson, said the NHS was being supplied with as many vaccines as it could cope with.\nOn Monday, Mr Drakeford told the Today programme the supply of the Pfizer vaccine had to last until February and was not being used all at once.\n\"There will be no point, and certainly it will be logistically very damaging, to try to use all of that in the first week and then to have all our vaccinators standing around with nothing to do for another month,\" he said.\n\"The sensible thing to do is to use the vaccine you've got over the period that you've got it for so that your system can absorb it, they can go on working.\"\nIn a video he later posted on Twitter he said: \"Let me be completely clear, nobody is holding back vaccines. \n\"All our health boards are receiving doses of Pfizer as quickly as they can use it.\" \nThe British Medical Association (BMA) Wales tweeted it was \"extremely concerned\" about \"spacing out the Pfizer vaccine to make it last until the next delivery\". \n\"If Pfizer vaccines are available, second dose must be given to HCWs [health care workers] within the maximum 42-day timeline and all remaining vaccinations for staff must be accelerated,\" it said.\nThe Welsh Government's vaccine strategy pledges everyone will be offered a jab by autumn.\nThe NHS is vaccinating people in order of clinical risk, largely based on age groups from old to young.\nAs the roll-out ramps up, vaccines in Wales will be given in mass vaccination centres, GP surgeries, mobile units - and on Friday, the first pharmacy gave the Covid jab.\nThe Welsh Government said on Monday it was \"on course\" to complete 70% of vaccinations for over 80s and care home residents by the weekend.\nIt also confirmed that all ambulance staff had been offered the vaccine, and the ambulance service said so far more than 60% had had it.\nIn a statement, a government spokesman said: \"The Pfizer vaccine comes in large packs, which cannot be split and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures - at -70C. There are only two centres in Wales where we can keep them at this temperature. \n\"Once removed from storage, the vaccine lasts five days. Every dose wasted is a vaccine which cannot be given to someone in Wales.\n\"We want to ensure a consistent supply of the vaccine to minimise wastage.\"\nAt a coronavirus briefing on Monday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams also said ministers were not holding back on supplies.\n\"We are distributing Pfizer in a careful way to ensure there is infrastructure in Wales to deliver it safely and most efficiently, avoiding wastage because it is such a precious resource,\" she said.\nBut Paul Davies, Conservative group leader in the Senedd, said his inbox had been \"bombarded by people who are very, very angry\" about the pace of the roll-out.\n\"Suggesting that holding back the vaccine for a period of time so vaccinators aren't standing around doing nothing is absolutely preposterous,\" he said. \nWe've heard from two senior government ministers this morning - one of them the first minister - and received different explanations of what the strategy is for vaccine roll-out.\nThe first minister talked about having to make the Pfizer vaccine last until February, otherwise vaccinators would be standing around with nothing to do.\nHis education minister today denied that Welsh Government was doing anything to delay the use of the Pfizer vaccine - she talked about the need to go faster and to build up infrastructure and minimise wastage.\nPeople in vulnerable groups keen to know when they'll be receiving their jab won't be reassured by the lack of a coherent message.\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth MS said: \"Wales appears now to be dramatically behind England in terms of vaccine roll-out, so to see the first minister being relaxed about the slow pace of the vaccine roll-out here is very, very frustrating. Why are we rationing here?\" \nUK government vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi, when asked about the strategy in Wales, said his view for England was to use up supply and ensure it \"doesn't sit on a shelf or in a fridge\". \nThere are currently two approved vaccines being administered in Wales - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nA third vaccine has been approved for use in the UK - made by US company Moderna - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring.\nThere will be 35 mass vaccination centres across Wales but to ensure people - especially the elderly and those with mobility issues - can be inoculated where they live, about 250 GP practices across the country will be able to administer the jab by the end of January.\nMs Williams said that there would be 45 mass vaccination centres delivering the Pfizer jab by the end of the week.\nAs of Monday, the Cardiff and Vale health board said it had vaccinated more than 24,000 people, including nearly 19,000 health, social care and care home staff, nearly 600 care home residents and nearly 3,000 other people aged over 80.   \nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board in south Wales said it had vaccinated nearly 17,000 people as of Friday, and aimed to give all 100,000 people in the top priority groups at least a first dose by mid-February.\nThe Hywel Dda health board serving west Wales said on Monday it had given more than 18,000 vaccinations, including jabs to 42% of healthcare workers, 38% of care home staff, 25% of care home residents and just under 9% of people over 80.\nPowys Teaching health board said letters should arrive by Tuesday to everyone aged over 80 inviting them to get a vaccination, with more than 7,000 people in the priority groups having received their first dose.\nThe Swansea Bay board said it was \"on target\" to vaccinate all care home residents with a first dose by the end of January and that all over-80s would be offered a vaccine \"over the coming weeks\"\nIn north Wales, the Betsi Cadwaladr board said it aimed to vaccinate 90% of the priority groups by the end of January.\nIn south east Wales, the Aneurin Bevan board's most recent update from 11 January said that in its 94 care homes for elderly people all residents had been vaccinated in 34 homes and all staff in 63."

I want to understand you correctly,\" she said to the prosecutor who outlined the allegations on Sunday.\nMr Singh lives in a suburb of Los Angeles and does not have a criminal background, according to Assistant Public Defender Courtney Smallwood. It is not clear why he was in Chicago. \nHe has been charged with felony criminal trespass to a restricted area of an airport and misdemeanour theft. He has been barred from entering the airport if he is able to post the $1,000 (\u00a3738) for bail.\n\"The court finds these facts and circumstances quite shocking for the alleged period of time that this occurred,\" Judge Ortiz said.\n\"Based upon the need for airports to be absolutely secure so that people feel safe to travel, I do find those alleged actions do make him a danger to the community.\"\nThe Chicago Department of Aviation, which oversees the city's airports, said in a statement: \"While this incident remains under investigation, we have been able to determine that this gentleman did not pose a security risk to the airport or to the travelling public.\""

      "text": "The BBC has apologised for the original headline in its reporting of the death of the convicted murderer Phil Spector.\nThe former music producer died on Saturday at the age of 81, while serving a prison sentence for the murder of Lana Clarkson in 2003.\nThe first version on the breaking news story on the BBC News website carried the headline: \"Talented but flawed producer Phil Spector dies aged 81\".\nThe BBC said the headline \"did not meet our editorial standards\".\nThe text was quickly changed to: \"Pop producer jailed for murder dies at 81.\"\n\"This was changed within minutes and we also deleted a tweet that had gone out automatically with the original headline,\" a statement issued by the BBC read.\n\"We apologise for this error.\"\n\"Our coverage of the story across BBC News has been clear that Phil Spector was convicted of the murder of Lana Clarkson and had a long history of violence and abuse,\" it continued.\nSpector was convicted of murdering Clarkson, an actress, in 2009.\nHis death was confirmed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\nReacting to the original version of the BBC's story, pop star Lily Allen tweeted: \"Rolling eyes at all the journos deliberately downplaying Phil Spector being a murderer in their headlines, so everyone points this out while linking to their articles resulting in lots of clicks.\"\n\"He murdered Lana Clarkson\" posted Labour MP Apsana Begum. \"Unforgivable reporting.\"\n\"How about 'Murderer, Phil Spector dies aged 81'?\" offered author and historian Hallie Rubenhold.\nThe headline was also discussed on TV and radio programmes on Monday, including Loose Women and Radio 4's Woman's Hour, and prompted an article in the Guardian.\nThe phrasing of the BBC's article - and others like it -  were \"a reflection of how a man's 'genius' is often viewed as more important than a woman's humanity,\" said columnist Arwa Mahdawi.\nSpector, who transformed pop with his \"wall of sound\" recordings, worked with The Beatles, The Righteous Brothers and Tina Turner.\nBut after the commercial failure of Tina Turner's River Deep, Mountain High, he largely withdrew from public life, and entered a long decline, marked by erratic behaviour, heavy drinking, and a fondness for guns.\nHis turbulent marriage to Ronettes singer Veronica Bennett, known as Ronnie Spector, ended in divorce.\n\"Unfortunately Phil was not able to live and function outside of the recording studio,\" she wrote after his death was announced. \"Darkness set in, many lives were damaged.\"\nSinger Darlene Love, who sang on several songs Spector produced, said he \"changed the sound of rock 'n' roll\" but likened their relationship to \"a bad marriage\".\n\"The problem I have with Phil is that he wanted to control Darlene Love's talent,\" she told Variety. \"If he couldn't do that, he was going to do everything in his power to keep my talent from shining.\"\nWeeks before Lana Clarkson was shot dead, Spector gave a rare interview to British broadsheet The Telegraph.\n\"I would say I'm probably relatively insane, to an extent,\" he told the paper, adding that he had \"devils inside that fight me\".\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It was over,\" she wrote. \n\"Sadly, for many this isn't the case.

Businesses taking part say the Brexit trade deal has left their industry high and dry. \nAnd although one haulier from Aberdeenshire I spoke to was keen to stress that their coordinated protest was peaceful, it is clear that they all feel that direct action is now necessary to make the government sit up and take notice.  \nGood natured though their action was, it did for a time cause serious traffic congestion along Whitehall and Parliament Square. \nHowever, low levels of traffic perhaps caused by the Covid lockdown meant the roads around Whitehall didn't grind to a complete halt. \nAt stake, they believe, is an industry, but also thousands of livelihoods. Exporters say they are backed by fishermen who are struggling to land their catches. \nAnd although the rural Scottish communities which are sustained by fishing might seem like a long way from the streets of SW1, the hauliers certainly made their presence felt this morning. \nHaving left the EU's customs union and the single market, UK exports are subject to new customs and veterinary checks which have caused problems at the border. \nSome Scottish fishermen have been landing their catch in Denmark to avoid the \"bureaucratic system\" involved in exporting to Europe, according to Scotland's rural economy secretary.\nLast week, Boris Johnson told a committee of MPs that fishing firms impacted by disruption would be compensated for \"temporary frustrations\".\nBut the BBC was told that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) did not know about the promise of compensation before it was made by Mr Johnson. \nSpeaking to reporters, the prime minister said he understood the \"frustrations\" of the fishing industry, noting its plight had been \"exacerbated by the Covid pandemic\".\n\"Unfortunately, the demand in restaurants on the continent for UK fish has not been what it was before the pandemic, just because the restaurants have been closed for so long,\" he added. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused ministers of trying to \"blame fishing communities\" for problems \"rather than accepting it's their failure to prepare\".\n\"The government has known there would be a problem with fishing and particularly the sale of fish into the EU for years,\" he told reporters. \nBy Martyn Oates, BBC South West Political Editor \nMuch media attention has been focussed on Scotland as this export crisis has unfolded.\nBut exactly the same problem is rearing its head in the UK's other great fishing stronghold - at the other end of the UK in Devon and Cornwall.\nA virtual Who's Who of South West fishing leaders wrote to the environment secretary back in November warning that the new post-Brexit export requirements would have a \"seriously detrimental effect\" on the industry, claiming this \"could be the final straw for many businesses\".\nHere, too, many fish exports have now ground to a halt and others have encountered obstacles and long delays.\nAnd exporters have reacted angrily to the government's repeated insistence that the issues they've been experiencing over the last two weeks are just \"teething problems\"."

      "text": "Ten hospital trusts across England consistently reported having no spare adult critical care beds in the most recent figures.\nIt comes as hospital waiting times, coronavirus admissions and patients requiring intensive care are rising.\nEngland's 140 acute trusts had 5,503 adult critical care beds on 10 January, with 4,632 in use.\nNHS bosses have warned hospitals could \"hit the limit\" of their capacity this week.\n\"I think, this next week, we will be at the limit of what we probably have the physical space and the people to safely do,\" Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said.\n\"And, of course, this is the week when we expect also the highest rate of admissions, the highest demand for the care that we're providing.\"\nThe latest figures from NHS England show the number of trusts that were, on average, at full capacity in adult critical care across an entire week rose from four to 10 in the week to 10 January.\nThis was the highest number in the last 10 weeks for which data was available.\nThe increase comes despite trusts adding an additional 50% \"surge\" capacity across the summer and autumn to cope with winter pressures, according to NHS England.\nOverall, 30 acute hospital trusts in England had no spare adult critical care beds on 10 January alone. But daily admissions figures can vary from day-to-day as patients move in and out of intensive care.\nSpeaking on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said nine critical care patients had recently been transferred to other parts of the country because of no beds being available in their local area.\nSpeaking about all admissions, Sir Simon said hospitals in England had seen an increase of 15,000 inpatients since Christmas Day.\n\"That's the equivalent of filling 30 hospitals full of coronavirus patients and staggeringly every 30 seconds across England another patient is being admitted to hospital with coronavirus,\" he added.\nHelen Buckingham, from Health think-tank The Nuffield Trust, said the NHS was facing a winter \"like no other\" and, on top of rising coronavirus hospital admissions, critical care beds were also required for non-Covid patients.\n\"The NHS has pulled out all the stops to create more beds this year, and hospitals are working together so that patients who need critical care can be moved to other hospitals as necessary - but without more fully trained critical care staff there isn't much further the service can go,\" she said.  \nThe figures only tell part of the story. The creation of extra beds to cope with rising numbers of Covid patients has come at a price.\nCritical care beds have been set up in overspill areas including departments usually reserved for operations. What is more, there is no extra staff to look after these extra patients - so specialist intensive care nurses have been stretched across more patients than normal. Instead of providing one-to-one care for the most sick, some areas are seeing  nurses looking after three or four patients.\nStaff from other areas have had to be redeployed into critical care departments too.\nThat of course comes at a cost to non-Covid services and is part of the reason we have seen planned surgery and even cancer care being cut back on.\nA leaked email recently revealed about 200 doctors would be redeployed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham amid fears its intensive care unit could be \"overwhelmed\".\nUniversity Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust said it had \"significantly\" more patients in hospital with Covid-19 than in April last year. \nThe trust had 147 critical care beds available across its hospitals as of 10 January, all of which were full as of the latest figures.\nA spokesman said the trust would continue to extend its intensive care teams \"so they are able to treat the rising number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery, including cancer operations\".\nAiredale NHS Foundation Trust, despite having nine critical care beds overall, said it did not normally experience full occupancy at this time in the year and the ward had both Covid and non-Covid patients.\n\"We are experiencing normal winter pressures across the trust, combined with an increasing number of Covid-19 patients, particularly over the last week,\" a spokeswoman said. \n\"Every bed in ICU that is occupied by a Covid-19 patient is one less available for people who need that level of care for other reasons.\"\nSir Simon said the current number of patients in critical care was a \"clear indication of the huge pressure on the NHS\", including ambulance and mental health services as well as hospitals.\n\"The likelihood is, even with a stabilising of infections in some parts of the country, we're still seeing increases in infections among the over-60s in many parts of the country,\" he added.\n\"The forecasts are the pressure on hospitals will only get more intense over the next several weeks.\"\nNHS England said critical care services were under \"unprecedented pressure\".\nA spokeswoman added that hospitals had \"tried and tested plans in place\" to manage pressure from increased Covid-19 and non-Covid patients, including mutual aid practices where hospitals work together to manage admissions.\nAdditional analysis by Ben Butcher"

      "text": "The Capitol complex in Washington DC was briefly locked down after a security alert, two days before Joe Biden is inaugurated as US president.\nPolice say they acted out of an abundance of caution after witnesses reported smoke rising nearby. The fire was several blocks away.\nIt came amid preparations for a rehearsal for Mr Biden's inauguration. \nFive people died after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, which is home to the US Congress, on 6 January.\nThousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed at the Capitol and around central Washington DC. \nThere was no threat to the public, officials said after Monday's lockdown. Congress is currently in recess. \nSecurity is tight after the rioters overran the Capitol earlier this month.\nThe National Mall - the landscaped park around the complex - has been closed, along with many major roads. Fences have been put up around the White House. \nThe inauguration rehearsal scheduled for Monday has already been postponed once on security grounds. \nAll 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC) are on alert for possible violent protests.\nThe FBI has warned of possible armed marches by pro-Trump supporters across state capitols.\nOnce he is sworn in, Mr Biden will issue executive orders to reverse President Trump's travel bans and re-join the Paris climate accord.\nThe president-elect is also expected to focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border, and to issue mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing.\nMr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will take the oath of office in front of the Capitol building, overlooking the National Mall. \nNormally a crowd of hundreds of thousands would be there to witness a significant moment in American national life. \nHowever, between the coronavirus pandemic and security concerns, the size of the crowd is being severely restricted this year. \nOnce sworn in, Mr Biden will give an inaugural address, setting the agenda for his term in office. \nThe ceremonies include a poetry reading, the Pledge of Allegiance and a benediction. Lady Gaga will sing the national anthem, and there will be a musical performance by Jennifer Lopez. \nOne prominent figure will be conspicuous by his absence: Mr Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration. \nOn Monday, outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to \"lead by example\" in caring for others. \nNormally the first lady hands over to her successor by inviting her for a walk-through of the private quarters in the White House. \nHowever, Mrs Trump is set to defy tradition, snubbing the president-elect's wife, Jill Biden, CNN reports. \nTom Hanks will host an event on prime-time TV on the night of the 20th, with performances by Justin Timberlake and Bon Jovi. \nMr Biden's inauguration planning team has designated the day before the swearing-in as a nationwide memorial to lives lost through Covid-19.

      "tags": "Manchester Arena attack inquest,Manchester Arena attack,Manchester",
      "text": "The youngest victim of the Manchester Arena attack might have survived if she had received better first aid, a report commissioned by her family suggests.\nEight-year-old Saffie-Rose Roussos died as a result of losing too much blood from injuries to her legs. \nIt has emerged that no-one used simple tourniquets or splints to apply pressure and reduce the bleeding. \nPreviously, experts commissioned by the Manchester Arena Inquiry found that Saffie's injuries were not survivable.  \nThis new information has come to light because lawyers representing the Roussos family commissioned different experts to look into the circumstances of her death. They believe that Saffie might have survived.\nFor the past three years, Saffie's parents have believed that she was killed instantly in the explosion. They say they drew comfort from thinking that she had not suffered. Now they have been told that their daughter lived for over an hour, and that opportunities were missed to help her.\nThe family has also discovered that Saffie asked a paramedic, \"am I going to die?\" as she was being taken to hospital by ambulance.\nSaffie's father, Andrew Roussos, told the BBC: \"She could have been saved.\"  \nHe added: \"How do we carry on living with this information? How can we carry on breathing with this information?  \n\"I can't look at Saffie's picture. Since I've read this report, I can't look at her.\"\nThe new report is based on evidence that includes witness statements, as well as CCTV footage and body-worn cameras from the emergency services.\nPreviously, the family thought that Saffie died on the floor of the Manchester Arena foyer, where the bomb exploded on 22 May 2017.\nNow they have learned that she was not knocked unconscious. \nThe report has found that, moments after the blast, Saffie lifted her head and tried to push herself up with her arms. She is said to have been given water, and to have asked for her mum.\nSeveral people tried to help Saffie but though she was bleeding heavily from serious leg injuries, nobody used a tourniquet, or splint to apply pressure and reduce the bleeding. \nSaffie was lifted on to an advertising hoarding and some railings, which were used as a makeshift stretcher. \nShe was the first person to be carried out of the foyer, but there was no ambulance outside, and one had to be flagged down. \nThe report commends the actions of the people who tried to get her to hospital as quickly as possible.\nBut it has found that the ambulance did not have all the necessary equipment on board. \nDistressing detail has emerged about Saffie's time inside the ambulance. \nShe is said to have been agitated, and pulling at her oxygen mask. She was able to speak and asked whether she was going to die.\nMr Roussos says: \"Medically trained people were with her. And she was asking for help. She knew what was happening. And she bled to death.\n\"Eight year olds don't ask those questions. Doesn't matter how hurt they are, they want their mum. They want to be treated, they want to be out of pain.  Not to be in the sound mind to ask the paramedic whether she's going to die.\"\nThe report has found that the ambulance crew did not use tourniquets or splints on Saffie's injuries, and neither did the medical team at hospital, when Saffie arrived at A&E. \nIt also says that it is unclear why the trauma team at the hospital didn't begin a surgical procedure called a \"thoracotomy\" to stop the bleeding.\nSaffie was pronounced dead at the hospital at 11.40pm, more than an hour after the attack. The report says that because the bleeding was left unchecked, it resulted in a critical level of blood loss to the point at which the heart was no longer able to beat, and it could not be restarted.\nMr Roussos says: \"Our medical experts have suggested that there were procedures that Saffie could have had and she didn't. She was losing that much blood. And there wasn't a successful procedure in place to get that blood into Saffie - even in A&E. Why?\"\nThe Roussos family say that they cannot understand why two sets of experts have reached different opinions about Saffie's survivability.\nThe Manchester Arena Inquiry is about to begin its phase of hearing evidence about the emergency response to the attack, in which 22 people died when a suicide bomb exploded. \nIn the months ahead, Saffie's parents will hear evidence from the people who were with their daughter in her last moments. \nThey have told the BBC that they want the public inquiry to get to the full truth about what happened to their little girl.\nSaffie, from Leyland, Lancashire, was at an Ariana Grande concert with her mother, Lisa, and sister, Ashlee Bromwich, when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb in a large foyer filling with people after it ended on 22 May 2017.\nThe inquiry is looking at whether the attack could have been prevented, what happened on that night, the security arrangements around the arena, the emergency response to the bombing and the radicalisation of bomber Abedi.\nLast year the inquiry, which began in September, heard how each of the 22 individual victims died as well as personal evidence about them from their families.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "China's economy grew at the slowest pace in more than four decades last year, official figures show, but remains on course to be the only major economy to have expanded in 2020.\nThe economy grew 2.3% last year, despite Covid-19 shutdowns causing output to slump in early 2020.\nStrict virus containment measures and emergency relief for businesses helped the economy recover.\nGrowth in the final three months of the year picked up to 6.5%.\n\"The GDP data shows the economy has almost normalised. This momentum will continue, although the current Covid-19 outbreak in a couple of provinces in northern China might temporarily cause fluctuation,\" said Yue Su, principal economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit.\nChina's mainland share markets as well as Hong Kong's Hang Seng posted modest gains on the latest figures, which exceeded economists' expectations, according to a Reuters poll. \nHowever, Covid-19 was still a major drain on growth in 2020, with nationwide shutdowns of factories and manufacturing plants forcing economic growth down to its slowest rate for four decades. \nChina's manufacturing sector appears to have recovered, with Monday's data showing a 7.3% increase in industrial output.  \nExports have also led the way. Data last week showed Chinese exports grew by more than expected in December, as coronavirus disruptions around the world fuelled demand for Chinese goods. \nThat is despite a stronger yuan, which makes Chinese exports more expensive for overseas buyers.\nChina's economy has seen a strong rebound, while the rest of the world struggles with anaemic demand, millions of job losses, and businesses shutting down.\nChina's economic engine roared back to life after a brutal lockdown that saw the Chinese economy contract by a historic 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020. \nWe should always be circumspect about Chinese data - with the usual caveat that the trajectory of the data rather than the figures themselves are a useful guide to how China's economy is growing.\nWhat these numbers show is that China's strategy of locking down cities hard and quickly has worked. \nA combination of government-led investment and global demand for Chinese goods also helped to power a rapid recovery, and boost exports. \nStill - this is the lowest rate of annual growth in more than 40 years for the economic giant. Worries over a resurgence of the virus are also clouding China's growth outlook, with consumer demand still weak. \nAnd Beijing is trying to navigate a prickly trade relationship with the US, with the incoming administration unlikely to be softer on China than President Donald Trump. \nAll of these challenges will no doubt weigh on Chinese growth in 2021 - but they seem to be in a better place than the rest of the world's major economies.\nIt was not all good news from the latest figures.\nLi Wei, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said pandemic-related exports and credit-fuelled car and housing sales accounted for much of the growth, while domestic demand lagged behind. \n\"Domestic household consumption of food, clothing, furniture and utilities remains below pre-pandemic levels, while the hospitality and transportation sectors continue to face capacity and travel restrictions,\" he told Reuters. \nAlthough retail sales grew by 4.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020, they fell by 3.9% for the year.    \nMany analysts are tipping growth to accelerate in 2021, but the China Bureau of Statistics has warned of a \"grave and complex environment both at home and abroad\", with the pandemic having a \"huge impact\".\nChina still faces many challenges, including continuing trade tensions with the US and how they might play out under the administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office later this week.

They are urging owners to keep dogs on leads.\nSeparately, on Sunday, a 10-year-old child was injured by a herd of deer being chased by a dog in Bushy Park.\nPolice said the incident in the park in Richmond-upon-Thames, which left the child needing hospital treatment, underlined the need for people to keep their dogs on a lead if they are unsure how they will react to deer.\nOn Friday, Franck Hiribarne, 44, from Kingston in south-west London, admitted causing or permitting an animal he was in charge of to injure another animal, in relation to the Richmond Park attack.\nWimbledon magistrates heard the doe suffered deep wounds, then received a broken leg when it was hit by a car as it tried to flee from the dog. Witnesses described the attack as \"relentless\".\nThe deer had to be put down by a gamekeeper after the attack in October. \nMr Hiribarne, who reported the matter himself to the Royal Parks Office, said he usually walked his red setter Alfie on a lead until he was well away from any grazing deer, and that the dog had been responding well to \"off-lead\" commands.\nThe dog owner, who was fined \u00a3600, said in a statement: \"I was genuinely shocked and sorry for what had happened and since then I have refrained completely from letting Alfie off the leash in any park.\n\"I have also taken a special dog trainer specialised in gundogs to control more accurately any of his hunting instincts. He has made great progress.\"\nFour deer have died from dog attacks in the royal parks since March 2020, while there have been 58 incidents of dogs chasing the herds - a big increase on previous years - according to the manager of Richmond Park.\nPart of the increase is thought to be down to new dog owners who are unfamiliar with the best conduct around wildlife."

      "text": "Tributes have been paid to the actor Andy Gray who has died at the age of 61.\nThe Perth-born star was a well known face on TV and the stage for more than 40 years. \nAmong his best known on-screen roles were \"Chancer\" in the 1980s comedy City Lights and more recently \"Pete Galloway\" in BBC soap River City.\nHis River City co-star Gayle Telfer Stevens said Gray was a \"national treasure\".\nShe added: \"Not only was he an exceptional actor and entertainer who brought so much joy to so many people, he was an extraordinary man. \n\"When you were in his presence you could feel it was of greatness. The most kind, clever, funny beyond measure, beautiful man.\"\nSteve Carson, director of BBC Scotland, said: \"We are deeply saddened by the news that one of Scotland's much loved comedy actors and close friend to many at BBC Scotland, Andy Gray has passed away. \n\"On screen and in person he could always make you laugh and was one of the kindest people to have around on any production. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.\"\nMartin McCardie, executive producer at BBC Scotland Studios, added: \"When Andy joined River City in 2016 he had an extremely successful stage, TV and film career behind him, but the character of Pete Galloway turned out to be one of the most popular ever to pass through Shieldinch. \n\"Andy took ill in 2018 and he had to leave the show and he had a difficult time. His ongoing recovery was borne with humour and gratitude for what he had. He had unfinished business on River City and we were looking forward to welcoming him back to film with us before the end of the current series.\"\nAndy Gray was genuinely one of the nicest people in the world of showbusiness.\nWhether you were an actor, or a journalist, or just someone who'd seen him in panto, he was always ready to have a chat.\nWhen he dropped out of his Fringe show in 2018, after being diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia, he was inundated with good wishes, but said he wanted privacy to deal with his illness. \nHe retreated to his home in Perthshire and took the time to recover.\nWhen he returned to the stage of the Kings Theatre in Edinburgh for their 2019 panto, it was an emotional milestone.\nWrapped in his Batman dressing gown backstage (he was a huge fan with a shed full of film paraphernalia) he admitted it could be overwhelming. Sometimes the whoops and cheers of the audience at his arrival in the midst of a glitzy song and dance routine would go on for several minutes. \nHis co-stars Grant Stott and Allan Stewart watched from the wings and said it had restored the balance of their long established trio. The Kings is one of the only theatres to have a tradition of a pantette - where the cast sit in the auditorium and watch the front of house staff performing the show. Andy wasn't spared the merciless send up, nor would he have wanted to.\nDaughter Claire was also in the show - as one of the three bears - and her baby daughter was in Andy's arms for the curtain call. But whether his actual family, or his panto family, or the generations of people who've seen him onstage or screen, it was a moment of hope, as well as joy, that someone who'd brought so much laughter and entertainment to Scotland was back. \nThat's why his sudden death at 61 is such a cruel blow.\nHe had been campaigning to keep the Kings afloat, and was involved in online performances. He and Allan Stewart had hoped to appear in one of the few surviving pantomimes in Milton Keynes but that too was cancelled.\nFriends and colleagues knew he'd been admitted to hospital in the last few days, and feared the worst. Those who simply knew him as someone who made them laugh, on stage or screen, are no less bereft. \nTonight the world of Scottish entertainment is in mourning for a gifted comic actor, writer and genuinely nice man."

      "text": "Sir Richard Branson's rocket company Virgin Orbit has succeeded in putting its first satellites in space. \nTen payloads in total were lofted on the same rocket, which was launched from under the wing of one of the entrepreneur's old 747 jumbos. \nSir Richard is hoping to tap into what is a growing market for small, lower-cost satellites. \nBy using a jet plane as the launch platform, he can theoretically send up spacecraft from anywhere in the world.\u00a0\nIn reality, of course, his Virgin Orbit system has to be licensed in the locality where it is used, which at the moment is solely California. But there are well-advanced plans to bring the 747 and its rockets to Cornwall in south-west England, for example.\nSunday's success was a big fillip for Sir Richard's team who had tried and failed to launch a rocket in May last year. That effort was thwarted by a breached propellant line feeding liquid oxygen to the booster's first-stage Newton-3 engine.\nNo such problems occurred this time.\nThe modified 747, named Cosmic Girl, left its base in California's Mojave desert at 10:50 PST (18:50 UTC) to fly out over the Pacific Ocean. \nA little under 60 minutes later, and cruising at 35,000ft (10,500m), the jet banked hard to the right, dropping as it did so the 21m-long rocket that had been clamped to its underside. \nWithin seconds this booster, called LauncherOne, had ignited its engine and was climbing to space. \nCorrect deployment of the various spacecraft onboard at an altitude of roughly 500km was confirmed a couple of hours later.\n\"A new gateway to space has just sprung open,\" said Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart. \"That LauncherOne was able to successfully reach orbit today is a testament to this team's talent, precision, drive, and ingenuity.\"\nSir Richard has been trying to find the right solution to get into the satellite launch business since 2009. His concrete proposal was first put before the public at the Farnborough International Air Show three years later.\nThere is an emerging market for small, lower-cost spacecraft, whose developers are seeking more flexible and affordable ways of getting their assets above the Earth.\nVirgin Orbit is one of a number of companies now racing to meet this demand. Other contenders include the Rocket Lab outfit, which sends up its vehicles from a ground launch pad in New Zealand. But there are tens of other small rocket start-ups at various stages of maturation, and some of these plan to operate from the UK as well.\n\"Virgin Orbit has achieved something many thought impossible. It was so inspiring to see our specially adapted Virgin Atlantic 747, Cosmic Girl, send the LauncherOne rocket soaring into orbit,\" Sir Richard said.  \n\"This magnificent flight is the culmination of many years of hard work and will also unleash a whole new generation of innovators on the path to orbit. I can't wait to see the incredible missions Dan and the team will launch to change the world for good.\" \nWill Whitehorn is the president of UKSpace, the trade body representing the space industry in Britain. He's also a former president of Virgin Galactic, Sir Richard's other space company which hopes soon to start flying fare-paying passengers above the atmosphere in a rocket plane.\nHe said Virgin Orbit's success on Sunday was hugely significant.\n\"This is a momentous day for the small satellite world, as we will be able to launch satellites responsively; and for the UK this event promises sovereign launch capability very soon,\" he told BBC News.\n\"I plan to push hard for a launch from Cornwall to coincide with the G7 meeting this year if at all possible!\""

      "text": "Mental health targets have been missed thousands of times at Northern Ireland's emergency departments (ED) - with some people in crisis waiting more than eight hours for an assessment. \nHealth trusts aim to assess such patients at ED within two hours, but miss that target 20% of the time.\nHealth officials said access to mental health services is a key priority. \nBut they accepted availability of those services has been hit by extra pressures caused by the pandemic.\n\"Covid-19 has undoubtedly impacted on the availability of services and led to pressures across the HSC, including mental health,\" said NI's Director of Social Care and Children, Marie Roulston.\nThe two-hour waiting time was set by the Health and Social Care Board to try to ensure that those who were in need of an urgent mental health assessment did not have lengthy waits in emergency departments. \nWhile the number of people using emergency departments dropped in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, the percentage of those waiting more than two hours for mental health assessment remained largely the same. \nPeople were identified as needing a referral for a specialist mental health assessment at Northern Ireland emergency departments more than 42,000 times between January 2017 and September 2020. \nOn more than 8,000 of these occasions, the patients had to wait for more than two hours before being seen.  \nThe findings were obtained by BBC News NI through a series of Freedom of Information requests to health trusts. \nThe Belfast Trust had the highest percentage of those not seen within two hours, with more than a third of patients waiting longer than two hours for a mental health assessment.  \nMore than 70 of those patients waited for longer than eight hours, while some had to wait as long as 12 hours.  \nThe Belfast Trust said it aimed to see individuals presenting to ED \"within the target timescale, however, at times demand outstrips our capacity to meet this\".\nAidan McMeekin is 18 and lives in Belfast. \nHis mental health suffered after he was expelled from school. \nHe said: \"It got to the point where I was actually begging to my mum: 'I don't want to be here anymore, please just let me go.'\"\nSoon after, Aidan was taken to the emergency department of Belfast's Mater Hospital, where, he said, he waited for eight hours before receiving a mental health assessment.   \nAn investigation by BBC News NI has also found that mental health targets have been missed thousands of times at Northern Ireland's emergency departments (ED) - with people like Aidan waiting eight hours and over for for an assessment. \nAfter losing one of his close friends to suicide, Aidan's attitude changed. \n\"I saw first-hand how it has destroyed their families and I want to make sure that me or no-one I know goes down that route.\"  \nHe added: \"I could have been just a statistic. People say you're forever young, but you're also forever dead.\"  \nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article, there are a  list of organisations that may be able to help at BBC Action Line. \nAidan has been working with Quakers NI to share his story and raise awareness of mental health issues among young people in Northern Ireland.  \nAlthough the Belfast and Western Trust had the highest percentage of patients waiting for at least two hours, both these trusts also had smaller number of patients attending ED for mental health assessments.\nIn recent years, new pilot community crisis intervention services have been rolled out in Londonderry and Belfast, which can be used by patients within these trust catchment areas.\nAll five trusts told BBC News NI that while they were working hard to meet targets, this was not always possible. \nA spokesperson for the South Eastern Trust said: \"This can be challenging at times due to the overall growth in demand for mental health assessments, including an increase in referrals from our emergency departments. \n\"In addition, the region's long-standing workforce pressures impact on our capacity to respond to referrals within target, although we are continuously working with commissioners to further develop our mental health early liaison provision.\" \nIn recent years, some emergency departments have appointed mental health liaison officials, while the department of health has also approved funding for a new perinatal mental health service.\nHealth officials say delays to ED mental health assessments can be caused by a number of factors, including:\nIn December 2020, Health Minister Robin Swann launched a public consultation on a 10-year Mental Health Strategy for Northern Ireland.  \nIt called for investment in a regional mental health crisis service to help reduce waiting times at emergency departments for mental health patients.  \nWhile Northern Ireland's suicide rate may be lower than previously thought after a review found some drug-related deaths, originally recorded as suicide, were accidental, the region's mental health champion said that behind the statistics were individuals \"in their darkest hours, facing devastating waits\".   \nSiobhan O'Neill said: \"Emergency departments can be chaotic and staff are doing their best, but it's far from the ideal environment for someone in a mental health crisis.\n\"There are some excellent specialist mental health crisis services that have been piloted in Derry and Belfast, but the reality is A&E is still going to be the point of access for many people in crisis.\"  \nShe added: \"When people face lengthy waits they can be made feel like a burden, so we need to find a longer-term solution to ensure those with suicidal thoughts are not waiting hours for help.\"  \nA regional review of mental health crisis services in Northern Ireland is due to conclude in April. It is expected to call for a regionally-consistent response to people suffering a mental health crisis. \nThe Health and Social Care Board said: \"We will continue to work on improving services in mental health to ensure that those who experience a mental health crisis will receive the help and support they need in the setting which is most conducive to recovery.\" \nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article, there are a  list of organisations that may be able to help at BBC Action Line"

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

It comes as England is to begin giving the coronavirus vaccine to millions more people - those aged over 70 and the clinically extremely vulnerable. Meanwhile, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has been accused of a \"go-slow\" vaccination strategy after he defended the speed of the Covid jab roll-out. Find out when you will be eligible for the vaccine here.\nTen hospital trusts across England consistently reported having no spare adult critical care beds in the most recent figures. England's 140 acute trusts had 5,503 adult critical care beds on 10 January, with 4,632 in use. NHS bosses have warned hospitals could \"hit the limit\" of their capacity this week. At Monday's Downing Street Press briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the number of people in UK hospitals with the virus was at its highest level yet - at 37,435.\nThe London Ambulance Service is currently taking up to 8,500 calls a day, compared with a pre-Covid figure of 5,000 to 6,000, according to its chief executive Garrett Emmerson. \"It has been tough,\" says Lizzie Cooke, who works at the service's London headquarters. \"We are getting calls from family members who are really frightened.\" Meanwhile, paramedic Stan Baxter, of the Welsh Ambulance Service, has also described the pressure he and colleagues have been under, saying he questioned his job after he was spat at.\nSeventy-two tennis players who have arrived in Melbourne for next month's Australian Open are confined to their hotel rooms for 14 days. They were on flights where passengers later tested positive for coronavirus. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews says they will get \"no special treatment\" after some complained the harder 14-day quarantine was unnecessary.

It is a \"load of rubbish\", says 23-year-old Sophie Edwards, who thinks labelling one day a year can be damaging for people dealing with their mental health issues.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The coronavirus vaccination campaign is now well under way in Scotland, and we have a good idea of how plans to deploy the vaccine are shaping up. \nThe Scottish government has said the first two priority groups - including care home staff and residents, frontline health workers and over-80s in the community - would have had their first jab by 5 February. \nThose aged 70 and over will be vaccinated by mid-February.\nPeople aged over 65 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be vaccinated by early March.\nThis covers the first five of the nine priority groups, which is just over 1.4 million people.\nThree vaccines have now been approved by UK regulators - those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna. \nThey have been purchased by the UK government and Scotland will get a share of them, based on its population. \nCurrent modelling indicates that Scotland will have the capacity to deliver about 400,000 vaccinations a week from the end of February.  \nGP practices, health centres and local clinics have already been delivering vaccinations.\nFrom Monday 1 February, mass vaccination centres, including Edinburgh International Conference Centre (EICC) and Aberdeen's P&J LIVE at TECA, will be in operation. \nThe Scottish government said the EICC will have capacity to vaccinate more than 21,000 people a week at 45 stations. \nThe centre in Aberdeen will start with 20 booths, vaccinating around 6000 people weekly. \nThe NHS Louisa Jordan mass vaccination centre in Glasgow has been operating since 8 December, carrying out 1,000 to 5,000 vaccinations daily. The facility has the capacity to move to 10,000 per day.\nOther large centres will operate at Ravenscraig Sports Facility in Motherwell and Queen Margaret University in Musselburgh - as well as at leisure centres and town halls. \nCentres were planning initially to be opened seven days from 08:00 to 22:00, but that could be extended.\nIt won't be practical for everyone in Scotland to travel to receive their vaccine. \nSo, in some remote communities, a mobile vaccination unit will be set up to offer immunisations. \nIn this case, public health officials say they will likely make one trip to the area and vaccinate everyone in the priority group at once - which might mean someone lower down the priority list will get vaccinated earlier than they would had they lived in an urban area.  \nOne plan public health officials are looking at is using mobile libraries to deliver vaccines in remote communities. \nThe hope is to have people aged 50 and over vaccinated by the start of May.\nThe number of injections vaccinators will administer will be dependent on supply - so there might not be a smooth increase in how many people have received their immunisation. \nQuite quickly it's expected the number of injections given to begin increasing. \nThat's because initially things were very focused on getting those in care homes vaccinated first. \nBecause the vaccine had to be taken to the homes, it has taken a longer time to get through than if the same number of people had been able to turn up at a mass vaccination site. \nBy the autumn everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 should have been offered one of the Covid vaccinations. That's 4.4 million people. \nBut this will depend entirely on supplies - and just now, public health experts say they only know how many doses they can expect until June. \nFrom March, a second stream of second doses of the vaccinations will also be getting under way as the latest guidance is that the second jab should be received up to 12 weeks after the first. \nThere are no plans to make vaccinations mandatory.\nThe UK government is ordering vaccines on behalf of the four nations, and the supply is then be divided up between Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland on the basis of population. \nScotland's share of the UK's vaccine supply equates to its 8.2% share of the UK population.\nThe UK government has secured early access to more than 400 million doses of experimental vaccines.\nThere are more than enough supplies of approved vaccines to give every adult in the UK both doses. \nData suggests that whilst the efficacy of both vaccines is optimised when a second dose is administered, they offer considerable protection after a single dose, at least in the short term.  \nSo the new plan is for more people to be given a first dose, rather than holding back stock to administer down the line as second doses. \nEveryone should still receive a second dose within 12 weeks of the first. \nTrials of the Oxford vaccine, which was developed by British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca and Oxford University, show it stops an average of 70% of people developing Covid symptoms.\nNobody who was given the vaccine in the trial developed severe disease or needed hospital treatment. \nThere is also data that suggests adjusting the dose could increase protection up to 90%. \nThis vaccine takes a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees and genetically modifies it to resemble coronavirus to try to provoke an immune response.\nThe manufacturers of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine say the jab could prevent 95% of people from becoming ill with Covid-19.\nIt is what's known as an RNA vaccine - a new type of technology. It involves injecting part of the virus' genetic code into the body to train the immune system.\nAntibodies and T-cells are then made by the body to fight the coronavirus.\nThere were fears that the requirement for it to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures would pose problems in getting it to care homes or to remote communities. \nHowever, it has since transpired that the vaccine can be moved around in an unfrozen state for up to 12 hours and can be stored undiluted for up to five days.\nThe Moderna vaccine is an RNA vaccine, like Pfizer's, which uses part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response.\nIt requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer.\nSeveral other vaccines are in the final testing stage, and more results from other teams working on advanced trials are also expected in the coming weeks and months.\nThe JCVI has said it does not have a preference for one vaccine above the other, but it's unlikely you'll get to choose which you get. \nThat depends on a number of factors - what is available, where you are being vaccinated, and what we know about how the vaccines work by the time you are being vaccinated. \nThe Scottish government has said that it will be distributing supplies so that they can offer the most \"extensive and timely\" coverage possible, so for that reason \"one vaccine may be offered in certain settings over another\".\nAnd scientists will be studying the efficacy of the injections as people are given them, and it may well turn out that different vaccines suit different parts of the population. \nSo, it may be that what vaccine you get is dependent on your age or where you live, for example. But it is early days - we'll learn more in the months ahead. \nPublic health officials said when the Pfizer jab was approved that pregnant and breastfeeding women should not be given the injection, due to the limited amount of data available on its use within that group.\nHowever, the regulator has since updated its advice to say that when the potential benefits outweigh the risks, the decision can be made for the woman to be vaccinated. \nFor the Oxford vaccine, the advice is the same - it can be administered when the potential benefits outweigh the risk. \nMost children aged 18 and under will not get the Pfizer vaccine. This is because not enough research on using this vaccine on children has been carried out yet. \nAnd, so far, the Oxford vaccine has only been approved for those over 18.  \nRegulators initially said that people with a history of significant allergic reactions should not have the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab. \nBut they have now said they have received further assurances, and that those with allergies to food or other medicines or vaccines can have this injection. \nHowever, anyone with a history of allergic reaction to this vaccine or any of its ingredients should not receive this injection. \nThe Oxford vaccine can also be given to those with allergies to other medicines or food. \nAgain, it's only those with a known history of reacting to any of its ingredients who should not have it. \nAnyone who has previously reacted to a vaccine should speak to their doctor first.

      "text": "A group of US-bound Central American migrants has been met with truncheons and tear gas in Guatemala, where security forces blocked their path.\nThousands of people were intercepted on a road near the border with Honduras on Sunday. The government said it would not accept \"illegal mass movements\".\nAn estimated 7,000 migrants, mostly from Honduras, have entered in recent days, fleeing poverty and violence.\nThey hope to travel on to Mexico, and then the US border.\nEvery year, tens of thousands of Central American migrants attempt this perilous journey to try and reach the US, often on foot, in groups known as \"caravans\".\nPresident-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, has vowed to end the strict immigration policies of his predecessor, Donald Trump, a Republican.\nBut the Biden administration, which will take office on Wednesday, has warned migrants not to make the journey, as immigration policies will not change overnight.\nAs the migrants trekked across Guatemala towards its border with Mexico, they were slowed down by security forces near the south-eastern village of Vado Hondo.\nA group of soldiers and police officers blockaded a road, stopping many of them from advancing. Some people still attempted to force their way through, prompting security forces to push them back. Several people were injured.\nMany migrants retreated, with some waiting nearby to make a new attempt later. Others fled into nearby mountains.\n\"Fortunately the security forces established a contingency plan... and contained this battle,\" said Guillermo D\u00edaz, head of Guatemala's migration agency.\nA statement from the Guatemalan president's office said: \"Guatemala's message is loud and clear: These types of illegal mass movements will not be accepted, that's why we are working together with the neighbouring nations to address this as a regional issue.\"\nThe government later said 21 migrants who had sought medical assistance tested positive for Covid-19.\nThe migrants say persecution, violence and poverty are a daily reality in their home countries. Conditions have been made worse by the devastation wrought by two huge hurricanes that battered Central America last November.\n\"There is still mud everywhere there, everything got knocked down, we lost everything,\" Ismael Eliazar told the Associated Press news agency.\nSo, in search of a better life, they want to reach the US in the hope of finding work and safety.\nDania Hinestrosa, a 23-year-old travelling with her daughter, told the AFP news agency: \"We have no work, nor food, so I decided to go to the United States.\"\nThe promise of new immigration policies under Mr Biden's administration is also thought to have spurred some migrants to make an attempt to reach the US border.\nMembers of Mr Biden's team have warned Central American migrants not to make dangerous journeys to the border.\nSpeaking to NBC News, an unnamed senior Biden administration official said migrants attempting to claim asylum in the US \"need to understand they're not going to be able to come into the United States immediately\".\nThe Biden administration will prioritise undocumented immigrants already living in the US, not those heading to the country now, the official said.\n\"Processing capacity at the border is not like a light that you can just switch on and off,\" Susan Rice, one of Mr Biden's policy advisers, told the Spanish language news agency Efe in December.\n\"Migrants and asylum seekers should absolutely not believe those in the region selling the idea that the border will suddenly be fully open to process everyone on day one. It will not.\"\nMark Morgan, acting commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, last week urged would-be migrants at the southern border not to \"waste your time and money\".\nThe US commitment to the \"rule of law and public health\" is not affected by the change in administration, he said in a statement.\nMore than a dozen of similar groups, some with thousands of migrants, have set off from Central America in recent years. One of the largest came from Honduras in October 2018, provoking President Trump to brand it \"an invasion\".\nBut all have run up against resistance under Mr Trump, who put pressure on Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to crack down on illegal north-bound migration."

      "tags": "Tourism,Travel,Coronavirus testing,Travel & leisure industry,Self-isolation,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All UK travel corridors, which allow arrivals from some countries to avoid having to quarantine, have now closed.\nTravellers arriving in the UK, whether by boat, train or plane, also have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry.\nThe test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to \u00a3500.\nAll passengers will still be required to quarantine for up to 10 days.\nThe isolation period can be cut short with a negative test after five days in England, but it does not apply in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.\nThe government has said the travel corridor closure will be in force until at least 15 February.\nUnder the new rules, travellers arriving from the Falklands, St Helena and Ascension Islands are exempt. \nThose arriving from some Caribbean islands are exempt until 04:00 GMT on Thursday 21 January.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC'S Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Public Health England would be stepping up checks on travellers who must self-isolate.\nHe said enforcement checks at borders would also be \"ramped up\" and added that asking all arrivals to self-isolate in hotels was a \"potential measure\" the government was keeping under review.\nPassengers arriving into London's Heathrow airport on Monday said they had been met with \"substantial\" queues at passport control and one couple complained they had \"felt unsafe\" due to what they described as poor social distancing.\nAndy Hart, from London, who had arrived into the UK from Nairobi, said: \"We felt that even though everyone was masked they were far too close together.\n\"It took an hour and 10 minutes. I've been flying 30 times a year for 20 years. I mean, once or twice have I ever seen it [airport queues] like this. How can this happen during Covid times?\"\nMeanwhile on Sunday, the government announced that a financial support scheme for airports in England would open this month in response to the new travel curbs.\nAviation minister Robert Courts said the aim was to provide grants of up to \u00a38m per applicant by the end of this financial year. The scheme was first announced in November but without a start date.\nIndustry groups have warned there was only so long airports could \"run on fumes\", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules.\nEasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the closure of the travel corridors will not have a \"significant impact\" on his airline in the short term as flight numbers were already limited due to the pandemic.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the minimum number of days arrivals must wait to take a negative test releasing them from quarantine could be reduced from five days to three days.\nKaren Dee, chief executive of trade body the Airport Operators Association, said she supported the decision to close the travel corridors but stressed the need for \"a clear pathway out\".\nA ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde also came into force on Friday, having been imposed over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil.\nNew variants causing concern have previously been identified in the UK and South Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations.\nScientists fear the variants seen in South Africa and Brazil may interfere with the effectiveness of vaccines and evade parts of the immune system.\nThe travel industry has said closing the travel corridors was understandable due to the health emergency, but warned it would deepen the crisis for the sector.\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said the system had been \"a lifeline for the industry\" last summer but \"things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency\". He said he assumed the government would remove the latest restrictions as soon as it was safe.\n\"We've had no revenue now effectively for 12 months, give or take a few months in the summer last year. If we're going to have an aviation sector coming out of this we need to open up in the summer,\" he told the BBC.\nThe Department for Transport has said it is supporting the travel industry with an extension to the furlough scheme until the end of April, business rates relief and tax deferrals.\nWith all parts of the UK under strict virus rules amid high levels of infection, only essential travel is permitted.\nOn Sunday, another 671 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported in the UK, and a further 38,598 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus.\nAre you due to travel back to the UK from overseas?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Doctors,Coronavirus pandemic,GP",
      "text": "Doctors leaders say the \"patchy supply\" of vaccine to GP surgeries across Scotland is hampering the speed of delivery to patients.\nMinisters have pledged a first dose of the vaccine to 1.4 million of the most vulnerable Scots by mid-February.\nBut the British Medical Association in Scotland said inconsistencies in supply made it difficult to plan patient appointments to receive the vaccine.\nThey also said some GP surgeries had yet to receive any vaccine at all.\nThe Scottish government said it was working with health boards to resolve the issues.\nCurrently, about 16,000 vaccinations a day are being carried out in Scotland. However, that is expected to rise significantly as efforts to deliver the vaccine are scaled up.\nOn Sunday, 1,341 new cases of Covid-19 were reported - the lowest daily figure since 28 December. However, the numbers being admitted to hospital have continued to rise, reaching 1,918.\nNo new deaths were registered.\nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman has pledged that the workforce and infrastructure will be in place to vaccinate 400,000 people each week by the end of February.\nThe government has already announced plans for large vaccination centres in Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh.\nIt comes after more than 5,000 front-line health and care staff were vaccinated at the NHS Louisa Jordan in Glasgow on Saturday.\nGP practices across Scotland are currently providing vaccination services to those aged over 80.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Politics Scotland programme, Dr Andrew Buist, who chairs the British Medical Association's (BMA) GP committee in Scotland, said there was inconsistencies across the GP network.\nHe said the vaccine deployment plan was \"ambitious\" and so far \"good progress\" had been made in giving it to priority groups such as care homes residents and front-line health staff.\nHowever, he told the programme: \"The current problem lies with the next priority group, which is the 80-plus group, which GPs in Scotland are set to vaccinate because the supply of the vaccine so far has been quite patchy.\n\"Some practices have a good supply, some have had none so far.\"\nHe said his practice had received 100 doses of the vaccine for 600 patients over the age of 80, who all needed to be vaccinated by 5 February.\nHe added: \"I then have to do another 1,200 patients in the 70-plus group and the extremely clinically vulnerable by the middle of February, so we need to do 1,700 vaccines in the next four weeks.\n\"Now we can do that. We are used to providing large number of flu vaccinations and it is possible, we have our workforce in place, but we need the vaccine, otherwise we can't do it.\"\nWhen asked if his practice was running out of vaccine at the end of each day, Dr Buist said: \"Yes - we can't plan, that's the key thing. We can't send out appointments to patients until we're sure we have the vaccine in our fridge.\n\"We were given 100 doses on Monday. We used that all up by Friday. We don't want to send out appointments to patients until we know that we can definitively vaccinate them otherwise patients get very upset.\"\nDr Buist said vaccinators were regularly managing to extract higher numbers of doses from vaccine vials despite claims that some doses were being wasted.\nHe said there was widespread experience of six doses being extracted from Pfizer vaccine vials, which were marketed as having five doses, while 11 doses were regularly being taken from AstraZeneca vials.\nBut Dr Buist criticised issues around the red tape some retired health professional had faced when volunteering to become vaccinators.\n\"I have reports that arrangement to get doctors and nurses back into the system have been quite bureaucratic and I think it's something we need to look at.\"\nThe Scottish government acknowledged that there had been delays in vaccine supplies reaching some GP surgeries.\nA spokeswoman said: \"GPs have a significant role to play in delivering the vaccine - and we thank them for their hard work and patience as we roll out more vaccines to those in the communities. \n\"We know there have been some initial delays in supply reaching some practices and are working with health boards to resolve this. Vaccines are being manufactured as quickly as possible and we will continue to explore all options available to increase supply.\"\nThe government said health boards were providing order information for their GP practices to National Procurement who in turn advised the distribution partner. \nThe spokeswoman added: \"Once stock is released for ordering, the distribution partner inputs the GP orders on to their ordering system. Once the order has been placed, GP practices will receive an automated email providing an indication of the delivery day.\n\"We too want to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible and are continually working hard to see if distribution can be made faster in any respect.\""

      "text": "Medical staff are expected to \"face pressures unlike any other they have faced before\" as NI approaches its toughest week so far in the pandemic.\nThe British Medical Association has said while its doctors are \"coping\", many feel they are unable to give care to the \"standard they would want\".  \nThe peak in intensive care is predicted to happen next weekend.\nThe head of the BMA in NI, Dr Tom Black has been critical of the way this wave of the pandemic has been managed.  \nHe said: \"Staff will do their best in a very difficult situation, where many decisions in this pandemic were made too late.\"\nWhile it is expected the number of hospital admissions will peak sometime over the next eight to 10 days, the number requiring intensive care treatment is likely to continue increasing for at least another fortnight.\nDr Black said he was concerned for both patients and staff.\nHe said: \"It is likely that over the next few weeks doctors will be asked to work in a new location or provide support to areas that are already overstretched.\n\"Many have already had planned annual leave cancelled.\"\nThere were a further 19 virus-related deaths and 640 more Covid-19 cases reported in Northern Ireland on Monday. \nThe latest figures from the Department of Health bring the total number of deaths to 1,625, while 96,001 people have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began.\nSome 65 patients are in ICU, down two from the last report, and 51 patients are being ventilated.\nSince the vaccine rollout began in NI, 146,733 people have been vaccinated, according to the Department of Health.\nOf that number, 125,717 were first doses and 21,016 were second jabs.\nA total of 31,393 people from the over-80 age group have been vaccinated.\nEarlier the BMA told BBC News NI that more than 90,000 doses the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had arrived in Northern Ireland but the Department of Health has said it is anticipated separate deliveries will arrive by this weekend. \nDr Black said many staff members had reported feeling \"exhausted and demoralised\" and he warned that when it came to reviewing how the pandemic was handled \"this phase will stand out as one where we could have planned better\". \nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the next seven days is \"when we will see that real intense pressure coming on our inpatients and intensive care units\".\n\"Our worst case scenario has modelling up to 1,200 inpatients - and that's a serious pressure that comes on our system,\" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\n\"We can go up into nearly 200 ICU capacity but that comes at a stretch, that comes with putting our staff under severe pressure in ICU units.\n\"It also comes by having to shift the ICU specialist nurse from a ratio of one-to-one to a ratio of one-to-two or even one-to-three in extreme pressures. \n\"That's not something we want to do,\" he added.\nThe past week saw hospitals across Northern Ireland coming together in order to cope with the strain.\nOn 10 January, the Southern Health Trust was on the cusp of declaring a major incident amid the mounting pressures across the health service.\nThat was avoided as many off-duty staff answered a call to come into work and the health trusts pulled together to provide a regional response to the crisis.\nPatients were diverted to those hospitals which could take them and where infrastructure could cope with supplying additional oxygen to the very ill.\nOver the weekend of 9/10 January the Southern Health Trust - the smallest of the health trusts - was dealing with the highest number of patients who required oxygen.\nIn the past week the Northern and Southern Health Trusts have seen the highest number of patients.\nThat reflects the high rate of community transmission in some areas those trusts cover.\nMeanwhile, no resolution has been reached between Stormont leaders and the Irish Government over the sharing of passenger data.\nLast week, First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill criticised Dublin for failing to share information on travellers arriving there during the pandemic.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said repeated efforts to access data on passenger locator forms filled out by people arriving in the Republic of Ireland had failed.\nMrs Foster and Ms O'Neill indicated on Thursday that they planned to raise the matter directly with Taoiseach (Irish prime minsiter) Miche\u00e1l Martin.\nMs O'Neill told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday that no resolution has been found yet.\nShe told MLAs the issue had been raised \"on every occasion we have had the opportunity\" and that it was \"regrettable\" that the issue had not been resolved. \nThe travel issue will be discussed at a meeting on Wednesday involving the first minister, the deputy first minister, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney and NI Secretary of State Brandon Lewis.\n\"I hope that perhaps Wednesday's meeting will allow some opportunity for there to be a way forward,\" the deputy first minister added.\nIt was announced on Sunday that all travellers who have returned from Portugal or transited through 16 South American countries in the past 14 days will have to - along with their household - self-isolate for 10 days upon return to Northern Ireland. \nThis includes travellers who entered these countries en route to another destination. All travellers returning home from South America are advised to be tested, whether or not they have symptoms. \nFrom Thursday, all international travellers will be required to present a negative Covid-19 test result before arriving in Northern Ireland.\nThis rule comes into effect in England, Scotland and Wales on Monday.\nOn Monday, the Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland reported eight more coronavirus-related deaths.\nIt brings its death toll to 2,616.\nThe department said 2,121 new cases of the virus had been reported, with a cumulative total of 174,843 infections.\nIt said that as of 14:00 local time on Monday, 1,975 Covid-19 patients are in hospital, of which 200 are in ICU (intensive care units).\nIrish Chief Medical Officer, Dr Tony Holohan, said: \"This third wave of the pandemic has seen higher level of hospitalisations across all age groups. \n\"There are now more sick people in hospital than any time in the course of this pandemic\"."

      "text": "After experiencing its most difficult period of the entire Covid-19 pandemic in December, the boss of Welsh Ambulance Service said it was still under \"extreme pressure\".\nAt one stage, 400 staff - 12% of all workers - were sick or self-isolating.\nJason Killens said this was exacerbated by high call numbers and \"significant delays\" handing patients to hospitals. \nOne paramedic described questioning whether he was in the right job after being spat at during the pandemic.\nThe chief executive said it meant \"patients with less serious conditions waited much longer than we would like\".\nParamedic Stan Baxter, describing the pressure he and colleagues were under, said at one point an incident caused him to question whether he wanted to continue working.\n\"During the peak of the pandemic last year, I was assaulted by a member of the public where I was spat at in the face,\" he said.\n\"And that's really the only time that I've stopped and gone: 'Is this for me?'\"\nHowever the \"vast majority of the public\" had been \"absolutely fantastic\", he stressed, adding: \"We've had people waving at us, buying us coffee.\"\nFor his work partner, Luke Robinson, their job made it clear how coronavirus had made a resurgence across the country.\n\"I worked New Year's Eve and I responded to a number of incidents which involved just regular health complaints,\" he said.\n\"But next door or in the adjacent building there's people having parties and you can tell that there's large gatherings going on. And it's really frustrating because it really hammers home that some people aren't listening to the rules.\n\"And it's not surprising that we're seeing a second wave now.\"\nMr Killens said the pressure was now \"palpably less\" compared to last month, but admitted difficult weeks lie ahead.\n\"December was probably the most pressurised period during the whole pandemic for a number of reasons,\" he said.\n\"Staff that were symptomatic or isolating, that's been at its peak in December.\n\"We've seen more work both in the 111 and 999 service, that is patients contacting us with Covid-related symptoms, and of course because of the pressure on the rest of the NHS, we've seen extended handover at some of our emergency departments and what that's meant regrettably is some less serious patients have waited a lot longer in the community than I would have expected.\"\nThe ambulance service has been at its highest level of alert - described as \"extreme pressure\" - since early December.\nIt was so bad at the beginning of the month, the service had to declare a \"critical incident\", because of severe problems in south east Wales in particular - and one man had to wait 19 hours in an ambulance outside a hospital.\nThis strain has been partly blamed for deteriorating ambulance response times, with the situation exacerbated by the fact hospitals are struggling.\nAmbulances spent more than 11,661 hours outside emergency departments waiting to transfer patients in December - an equivalent to a total of more than 485 days. The average delay was one hour and eight minutes.\n\"We would usually see handover delays through winter - but what's unique this time is the overlay of the pandemic,\" Mr Killens added.\n\"There has to be additional distancing, this means less capacity in emergency departments. \n\"Testing also needs to be done before patients are admitted  - the additional complexities mean the process is slower and there's less space for patients to go into.\"\nHe said the impact of implementing Covid precautions is also affecting how quickly crews can respond.\n\"As a result of the virus, we're having to clean vehicles and equipment more frequently and thoroughly than before,\" Mr Killens said.\n\"Also there are levels for personal protective equipment that staff have to wear to protect themselves and others. Level three - the highest in some cases. \n\"And it takes a number of minutes for crews to put that on before staff treat the patients.\"\nTo bolster staffing levels and speed up response times, about 80 soldiers are assisting the Welsh Ambulance Service for the second time since the start of the pandemic - along with smaller number of staff from other services like the fire service.\n\"They are driving emergency ambulances for us... which means an emergency ambulance clinician can look after the patient,\" Mr Killens added.\n\"They'll drive the ambulance from the scene to hospital... it enables us to put more ambulances on the streets to respond to patients more quickly given the levels of absence that we've seen.\"\nAfter facing relentless pressure for close to a year, Mr Killens is worried about the impact on mental health and well-being of ambulance and control centre staff.\nThe service is focused on \"what we can do to keep them fit and well\", he said.\nBut he praised staff for \"stepping up to the plate\" - and insists some of the lessons learnt during the last year will benefit the service during the longer term.\n\"I've been in the ambulance sector for 25 years and this is like dealing with a very long incident,\" said Mr Killens.\n\"So, a major incident an emergency service routinely responds to generally will be over in a couple of hours. But the level of pressure has been sustained now for 12 months.\n\"All of our people have stepped up and done what was necessary and got on with providing the best care in really difficult circumstances.... we will come through it and at the end of the pandemic and will be a stronger organisation for it.\"\nHe believes the service is now \"on the home straight\" in dealing with the pandemic.\n\"We've had two waves of this virus and learnt much along the way, and with a vaccine rollout we have a real opportunity now to see an end to the disruption, the personal impact and the level of death and harm,\" Mr Killens said.\n\"By the time we get to the other side of the spring, probably we will be able to return to some kind of normality whatever that will be 18 months into a pandemic. \n\"There's a couple of difficult weeks to come, but if we can emerge through February and March, provided we all stick to the rules, because it's easy for the virus to grab hold again if we get complacent .... we'll be in a far better position as we come to the spring.\""

Unlike some airlines, it has not been eligible for government-backed loans.\n\"If this viable business is allowed to fall between the cracks of support - neither an airline, nor a domestic railway - our recovery could be damaged,\" it says.\nCo-signed by 28 leaders, including the vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, the chief executive of West End property company Shaftesbury, as well as the boss of the ExCeL conference centre, the letter points out that the company currently employs 1,200 people in the UK.\nThe firm is 55% owned by French state rail firm SNCF. The UK government sold its stake in the business to private companies for \u00a3757m in 2015.\nThe letter also credits Eurostar with reducing carbon emissions. Since it launched in 1994, it has transported more than 190 million passengers between Britain and mainland Europe.\nA spokesman for Eurostar said: \"Without additional funding from government there is a real risk to the survival of Eurostar, the green gateway to Europe.\nHe described the current situation as \"very serious\".\nA spokesman for the Department for Transport said: \"We recognise the significant financial challenges facing Eurostar as a result of Covid-19 and the unprecedented circumstances currently faced by the international travel industry.\"\nHe added the government had been in contact with Eurostar \"on a regular basis\" since the start of the coronavirus crisis and would continue to work closely with the firm."

      "text": "Details are emerging of a raft of executive orders planned by US president-elect Joe Biden as soon as he takes office this week.\nMr Biden will issue decrees to reverse President Trump's travel bans and re-join the Paris climate accord on his first day, US media report.\nThe president-elect is also expected to focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border, and to issue mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. \nHe will be inaugurated on Wednesday. \nAll 50 US states are on high alert for possible violence in the run-up to the inauguration ceremony, with National Guard troops deployed in their thousands to guard Washington DC.\nIn the hours after Mr Biden sets foot in the White House, he will embark on a blitz of executive actions designed to signal a clean break from his predecessor's administration, according to a memo seen by US media.\nAmong the orders planned soon after taking office are:\nThe executive orders are just one part of his ambitious plan for his first 10 days in office, according the memo.\nThe President-elect is also expected to send a major new immigration bill to Congress, as well as focusing on passing a $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) stimulus plan to help the country's economy recover from coronavirus. \nMr Biden has also said his administration will aim to deliver 100 million Covid-19 jabs in his first 100 days in office - describing the rollout so far as a \"dismal failure\". \n\"President-elect Biden will take action - not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration - but also to start moving our country forward,\" incoming White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain wrote in the memo.\nThe president-elect is taking over a country in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. Daily deaths from Covid-19 are in their thousands and almost 400,000 have lost their lives.  \nOn top of the virus raging, the country is reeling from recent political violence. \nThe theme for Mr Biden's inauguration will be \"America United\", with the president-elect focusing on healing political divisions. Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to attend the ceremony, though Mr Trump has said he will not. \nMr Biden will be sworn in exactly two weeks after the violent riots at the US Capitol on 6 January which aimed to thwart his election victory.\nEven by inauguration standards, the security presence in Washington DC for Wednesday's ceremony is extraordinary.\nMiles of streets have been blocked off with concrete barriers and metal fences, and more than 20,000 National Guard troops are expected to deploy. The FBI has warned of possible violence and armed marches planned by pro-Trump supporters. \nThe tough security measures follow a week in which Donald Trump became the first US president to be impeached twice. Mr Trump will now face a Senate trial on a charge of \"incitement of insurrection\" for the US Capitol violence. \nThe earliest the Senate can receive the charges will be Tuesday - the day before he leaves office - but the timings for the trial remain unclear.\nThere is some suggestion that the House of Representatives, which voted to impeach Mr Trump last week, could delay sending the articles to the Senate to let Mr Biden push on with his legislative agenda and have his cabinet picks approved first. \nDemocrats and Republicans are also reportedly discussing plans for a \"dual track\" agenda which would allow the Senate to split time between impeachment proceedings and Biden administration business. \nThe 100-seat Senate is now tied between Republicans and Democrats. A two-thirds majority is needed for an impeachment conviction - so 17 Republicans would need to vote against Mr Trump to convict him. \nSome Republicans have warned the impeachment will further inflame and divide Americans at a time when the nation needs to heal - but Democrats want to push on to convict Mr Trump then block him running from office again.\nTen Republicans voted to impeach the president in the House and most Republican senators, including leader Mitch McConnell, have not said publicly what their voting intentions in a trial are yet. \nA president has never been tried after he leaves office. Because the situation is unprecedented, some have even suggested it could be unconstitutional. \nOfficials on both sides are preparing for a trial, though the outgoing president is yet to confirm his legal team.\nMr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, told ABC News on Sunday that he was working on the impeachment defence, but a spokesman for the president later said he had not decided on his representation.

      "text": "Australia is unlikely to fully open its borders in 2021 even if most of its population gets vaccinated this year as planned, says a senior health official.\nThe comments dampen hopes raised by airlines that travel to and from the country could resume as early as July.\nDepartment of Health Secretary Brendan Murphy made the prediction after being asked about the coronavirus' escalation in other nations.\nDr Murphy spearheaded Australia's early action to close its borders last March.\n\"I think that we'll go most of this year with still substantial border restrictions,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday.\n\"Even if we have a lot of the population vaccinated, we don't know whether that will prevent transmission of the virus,\" he said, adding that he believed quarantine requirements for travellers would continue \"for some time\".\nCitizens, permanent residents and those with exemptions are allowed to enter Australia if they complete a 14-day hotel quarantine at their own expense.\nQantas - Australia's national carrier - reopened bookings earlier this month, after saying it expected international travel to \"begin to restart from July 2021.\"\nHowever, it added this depended on the Australian government's deciding to reopen borders.\nThe country opened a travel bubble with neighbouring New Zealand late last year, but currently it only operates one-way with inbound flights to Australia.\nAustralia has also discussed the option of travel bubbles with other low-risk places such as Taiwan, Japan and Singapore.\nA vaccination scheme is due to begin in Australia in late February. Local authorities have resisted calls to speed up the process, giving more time for regulatory approvals.\nAustralia has so far reported 909 deaths and about 22,000 cases, far fewer than many nations. It reported zero locally transmitted infections on Monday.\nExperts have attributed much of Australia's success to its swift border lockdown - which affected travellers from China as early as February - and a hotel quarantine system for people entering the country.\nLocal outbreaks have been caused by hotel quarantine breaches, including a second wave in Melbourne. The city's residents endured a stringent four-month lockdown last year to successfully suppress the virus.\nOther outbreaks - including one in Sydney which has infected about 200 people - prompted internal border closures between states, and other restrictions around Christmas time. \nThe state of Victoria said on Monday it would again allow entry to Sydney residents outside of designated \"hotspots\", following a decline in cases.\nWhile the measures have been praised, many have also criticised them for separating families across state borders and damaging businesses.\nDr Murphy said overall Australia's virus response had been \"pretty good\" but he believed the nation could have introduced face masks earlier and improved its protections in aged care homes.\nIn recent days, Australia has granted entry to about 1,200 tennis players, staff and officials for the Australian Open. The contingent - which has recorded at least nine infections - is under quarantine."

It used to cost about \u00a3650 to haul a container from the port of Felixstowe to the company's site in mid-Wales, Mr Owen says. \nThe cost is now up to \u00a31,800 per container \"if you can get the haulier to take it,\" he says.\nWhether people will pay the premium for a new outdoor toy is \"a good question,\" he said.\nIt emerged over the weekend that Irish hauliers are bypassing Welsh ports to avoid Brexit bureaucracy.\nSo-called \"teething problems\" with new export rules are causing \"enormous strain on staff\", according to one haulage company.\nBut others warn of a longer-term shift by truck firms from using Holyhead, Fishguard and Pembroke Dock."

      "text": "British Army soldiers are helping to establish 80 new Covid vaccine centres across Scotland.\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) said 98 soldiers were being deployed to identify suitable sites and aid deliveries of the vaccine.\nMore than 200,000 people in Scotland have already received their first dose.\nThe UK's vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said the Army would be setting up the sites before conducting a \"smooth handover\" to NHS Scotland.\nThe soldiers are from the Royal Army Medical Corps and Leuchars-based Royal Scots Dragoon Guards.\nThe Scottish government has said it wanted to vaccinate the over-80s, care home residents and staff, front-line health workers and social care workers by the beginning of February - about 560,000 people.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said people in the over-70 age group would start getting invitations for appointments \"literally over the coming days\".\nA total of 264,991 people have now been given a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in Scotland.\nMs Sturgeon said 80% of care home residents had now been vaccinated, with the programme for all those over 80 now \"picking up pace\".\nShe said Scotland was working to the same targets as the rest of the UK nations, and was \"on track\" to hit them.\nAt the weekend the British Medical Association said there had been issues for some GPs receiving supplies of the vaccine in Scotland.\nThe first minister said she had taken part in a call with manufacturer AstraZeneca last week, and said that while manufacturing and supply were \"a bit bumpy\" at the moment \"they expect them to level out and become much more sustainable at a certain level\".\nShe said the aim was to get all adults vaccinated \"absolutely as quickly as we can\".\nMembers of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards have already been used to run mobile Covid testing centres in Scotland.\nThe deployment of soldiers to help with the continued vaccine rollout is part of the \"largest peacetime resilience operation\" ever undertaken by the UK Armed Forces, the MoD said.\nOrganised into 11 teams spread across Scotland, they will be supporting NHS Scotland for the next 28 days.\nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman said it was the largest mass vaccination programme Scotland had ever undertaken and said she was very grateful for the support of the armed forces.\n\"This deployment will see 11, eight-person multi-disciplinary teams providing fast and assured site preparation over a four-week period, identifying and operationalising vaccine sites before handing them over to NHS Scotland staff,\" she said.\n\"Vaccination is a vital tool in our work to suppress the virus to the lowest possible level in Scotland, but other measures including testing remain absolutely vital, which it is why it is so essential people continue to follow the restrictions currently in place while vaccine delivery is rolled out across the country.\"\nThe MOD said the soldiers would be using their \"logistical, organisational and clinical expertise\" to establish the vaccine centres, before handing them over to NHS Scotland to deliver the vaccination programme.   \nThe military teams will organise car parking and traffic flow, as well as setting up patient recording methods.\nThey will also help with vaccine delivery to each of the 80 sites as well as helping to prepare storage for medicine and equipment.\nThree vaccines have now been approved by UK regulators, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna.\nThey have been purchased by the UK government, with Scotland being given a share based on its population size.\nDoses of the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines are currently being given, with supplies of the Moderna vaccine expected from early April.\nThe soldiers helping with the vaccine effort will be controlled by Joint Military Command staff in Stirling.\nThere are a further 32 UK military planners working in support of the Scottish government team in St Andrews House, Edinburgh, and across Scotland's 14 health boards. \nThe military has already been used for medical evacuations of patients sick with Covid from Shetland, Orkney and Arran.\nMs Sturgeon thanked the military for their help with logistical matters, noting they had also been involved in distributing PPE supplies and setting up the NHS Louisa Jordan hospital in Glasgow."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Poverty,Jack Monroe,Universal Credit",
      "text": "MPs have urged Boris Johnson to extend benefit increases worth \u00a320 a week. \nA non-binding Labour motion calling for the universal credit top-up to be kept in place beyond 31 March passed by 278 votes to none after a Commons debate.\nSix Tory MPs defied party orders to abstain and voted with Labour, adding to the pressure on the PM on the issue.\nThe prime minister said the government had provided \u00a3280bn worth of support during the pandemic but all measures would be kept under \"constant review\".\nThe motion, which will not automatically lead to a change in policy, was put forward by Labour as a way to put additional pressure on the government to continue the increase, worth \u00a31,000 a year. \nFormer Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb was among six Conservative MPs to rebel, along with Peter Aldous, Robert Halfon, Jason McCartney, Anne Marie Morris and Matthew Offord.\nAhead of the vote, Mr Crabb told the BBC that although there were \"difficult pressures on the chancellor\" extending the increase for 12 months was \"the right thing to do\". \nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there were dozens of Conservative MPs who were \"deeply uneasy\" about ending the \u00a320 weekly increase to universal credit. \nShe added that it was also understood the cabinet minister with responsibility for benefits, Therese Coffey, was arguing that the uplift should not be dropped in April. \nCharities and anti-poverty campaigners are pleading with the government to keep the support in place, describing it as a lifeline for more than 5.5 million families who receive the standard universal credit allowance.\nFood poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe told the BBC that the \u00a320 increase \"has been a lifeline\" for millions of people who have needed to top up their income or rely on universal credit payments in order to get by.\nSir Keir said the increase was a vital safety net for those who had lost their jobs, seen their working hours slashed or who were not eligible for the government's wage subsidy furlough scheme.\n\"If we don't give a helping hand to families through this pandemic, then we are going to slow our economic recovery as we come out it.\n\"We urge Boris Johnson to change course and give families certainty today that their incomes will be protected.\"\nAnalysis by chief political correspondent Adam Fleming\nSix billion pounds of the benefits bill - the difference between poverty or not for 1.2 million families, according to a think tank. \nThe \u00a31,040 a year increase to universal credit is a very emotive issue. \nThere's even a battle over what to call it. \nTo the government, its introduction was a one-off boost to cope with a crisis. For Labour, taking it away is a cut.\nMinisters would prefer we looked at the overall level of support they've provided for workers and businesses during the pandemic. The opposition say the \u00a320 a week boost is a powerful symbol of the state's willingness to help. \nEven the act of debating it today is disputed. Labour say they've got the right occasionally to set the agenda in Parliament. Boris Johnson said his MPs risk abuse from campaigners and protestors if they engage. \nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation has suggested about 16 million people will be directly affected if the \u00a320 is rolled back.\nIt says 500,000 more people will be driven into poverty, including 200,000 children, while a further 500,000 of those already in poverty will find themselves in even worse hardship. \nHowever, free market think tank the Institute for Economic Affairs has argued that \"across-the-board benefit increases are a wasteful use of taxpayers' money\" at a time when the government is borrowing \"a hair-raising amount of money\". \nUniversal credit is a single payment replacing old benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits.\nYou can claim universal credit if you are on a low income or are out of work. \nThe standard allowance varies from around \u00a3340 to just under \u00a3600 a month, depending on your age or whether you are single. \nYou may be eligible to receive more money on top of the standard allowance if, for example, you have children or a health condition. \nSpeaking on behalf of the Northern Research Group, Conservative MP John Stevenson said the \u00a31,000 increase had been \"a real life-saver for people throughout this pandemic\".\n\"To end it now would be devastating for the 6 million individuals and families who are already struggling to stay afloat,\" he added.\nWhile the vote is not binding, and will not lead to a change in policy, it will increase pressure on the government to keep the increase or come up with an alternative.\nLabour said the Conservatives' decision to abstain created \"unnecessary uncertainty\" but minister Nadhim Zahawi described the vote as \"a political stunt\".\nThe government says it has strengthened the welfare system with an extra \u00a37bn of funding during the pandemic while families struggling with food and household bills can get help through the \u00a3170m Winter Grant Scheme. \nMinisters also point to extra support for housing costs, through an increase in local housing allowance for those on housing benefits and hardship payments worth \u00a3670m next year for those unable to pay their council tax bills."

It's what people used to do with their weekends before the pandemic. \nKevin Rooney, Alex Lacey, Jamie Phillips and Connor Humpage from Birmingham and Coventry, had no idea their night out would still be trending two years later.\nA picture, taken by a stranger, has become a hugely popular meme in the last twelve months.\nThe lads came in for a lot of stick, mostly for wearing skinny jeans or trousers - and people making assumptions about what sort of people they are.\nBut the picture's latest resurfacing, where it was added to a sea-shanty trend, has seen the tide turn and the boys receive more positive comments online.\nAt first, when Connor, 28, uploaded the photo to his Instagram, nothing out of the ordinary happened, until a few days later someone made a meme out of the picture.\n\"Basically it was just mocking skinny jeans,\" Connor tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\"At first it was funny, but then it all got a bit carried away. We started getting a lot of grief for it. \n\"We were just getting loads of stick just for our outfits and it was getting personal. It's a good job we're quite thick skinned because at first it did get to us.\"\n\"Everyone was just judging us and thinking we're all stereotypical lads and we've got nothing else about us other than wearing skinny jeans.\" \nAfter its initial wave of popularity the picture, as many memes do, eventually died off.\nBut some clever TikTok trickery gave the lads a new lease of life - and a new talent. \nSo what does Connor make to his new-found singing ability?\n\"It's just killed me! It's hilarious,\" he says. \n\"It took me so off guard. You think it's all over then someone animates our faces and it actually looks like we're singing. \n\"What can we do now? We've just got to embrace it.

We didn't ask for any of this,\" he says.\n\"I think people forget about the people they're trolling behind their phones or keyboards. We actually are real people and it does affect you. \n\"It gets to a stage where you don't even read the comments anymore. You feel sorry for the people trying to ridicule someone just on how they look.\" \nConnor decided he wanted to try and use some of the accidental attention to help him promote a new tattoo business.\n\"I'm actually in the midst of getting my own tattoo shop which I'm working hard for. \n\"So if anything, it's come at a good time where it's positive for me to be able use this for something I'm working towards. \nAnd the final, probably most important question for Connor. Are the skinny jeans staying?\n\"Of course!\" Connor laughs. \n\"Why change now? We're way too far in to stop!\"\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube."

      "text": "BT is facing a class action lawsuit over claims it failed to compensate elderly customers who were overcharged for landlines for years.\nIn 2017, Ofcom said people who only had a landline telephone were \"getting poor value for money in a market that is not serving them well enough\".\nAs a result, BT reduced the price of its landlines by \u00a37 a month.\nBut campaigners are unhappy that \"loyal customers\" have still not been compensated for previous overcharging.\n\"Ofcom made it very clear that BT had spent years overcharging landline customers, but did not order it to repay the money it made from this,\" said Justin Le Patourel, founder of consumer group Collective Action on Landlines (CALL) and a telecoms consultant who worked for Ofcom for 13 years. \n\"We think millions of BT's most loyal landline customers could be entitled to compensation of up to \u00a3500 each, and the filing of this claim starts that process.\"\nBT said it \"strongly disagrees\" with the claim that it had engaged in anti-competitive behaviour and intends to defend itself \"vigorously\" in court.\nA spokesman for BT said: \"We take our responsibilities to older and more vulnerable customers very seriously and will defend ourselves against any claim that suggests otherwise.\n\"For many years we've offered discounted landline and broadband packages in what is a competitive market with competing options available, and we take pride in our work with elderly and vulnerable groups, as well as our work on the Customer Fairness agenda.\"\nLaw firm Mishcon de Reya has filed a claim with the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) worth \u00a3600m. The claim could result in payments of up to \u00a3500 each for 2.3 million BT customers, should it be successful. \nThe case represents customers who purchased a BT landline contract, but did not also take BT broadband or pay TV packages. \nSince 2009, the wholesale costs of providing landlines to consumers have been falling by at least 25%. \nBut in October 2017, Ofcom found that all major landline providers in the UK had increased the line rental charges by 28-41%.\nOfcom strongly criticised market leader BT for raising prices, saying that customers were being given \"poor value\" for money.\nIt added that many of the affected customers had \"been with BT for decades\" and were more likely to be old, on low incomes and vulnerable. \nBT announced that it would slash its landline prices by \u00a384 a year.\nBT's argument is that Ofcom's final statement did not explicitly accuse it of engaging in anti-competitive behaviour.\nBut independent telecoms analyst Ian Grant says that the telecoms giant \"has a history of abusing its position\".\n\"Earlier in 2017, Ofcom fined BT \u00a342m because it was late providing high-speed Ethernet lines, and forced BT to make good the losses of firms like Vodafone and TalkTalk,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Ofcom, which has a statutory duty to stop consumer abuses, could have done the same for these customers. Instead, it allowed BT to get away with a 37% price cut, at a time when the difference between its costs and what it charged customers had risen between 50-74%.\"\nMr Grant added: \"It is especially poor that BT was overcharging customers who were mostly over 65, more than three-quarters of whom had never used a different provider, and for whom the telephone was their only communications link.\" "

No clashes were reported.\nThe FBI has warned of armed protests ahead of Wednesday's inauguration.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden will take office two weeks after pro-Trump protesters stormed the US Capitol in Washington DC on 6 January, leaving five dead, including a police officer.\nMore than 25,000 National Guard troops are being deployed to secure Washington. In a sign of just how worried officials are about potential unrest, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told the Associated Press on Sunday that all Guard members were being vetted because of fears of an insider threat.\nAlso on Sunday, a county official from New Mexico was arrested in Washington in connection with the riots at the US Capitol on 6 January.\nCouy Griffin, the founder of a group called Cowboys for Trump, had vowed to return on inauguration day with firearms to \"embrace my Second Amendment\".\nMany cities had prepared for potentially violent protests over the weekend, erecting barriers and deploying thousands of National Guard troops.\nPosts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks had called for armed demonstrations on Sunday in particular, but some militias told their followers not to attend, citing heavy security or claiming the planned events were police traps.\nSmall crowds of protesters numbering in the dozens gathered in only some cities, leaving the streets surrounding many statehouses largely empty.\nThe New York Times reported about 25 members of the Boogaloo Bois movement were among heavily-armed protesters who gathered at the statehouse in Columbus, Ohio. But the men - who are part of a loosely organised extremist group that wants to overthrow the US government - said they were there for a long-planned gun rights rally.\nMeanwhile in Michigan, about two dozen people - some carrying rifles - protested outside the statehouse in Lansing, as police watched on.\n\"I am not here to be violent and I hope no one shows up to be violent,\" one protester told Reuters news agency.\nA similarly small group of about a dozen protesters, a few armed with rifles, stood outside the Texas Capitol in Austin.\nOutside Pennsylvania's capitol in Harrisburg, one Trump supporter noted the poor turn-out, telling Reuters: \"There's nothing going on.\"\nMore protests are expected on Wednesday, when Mr Biden will officially be sworn into office, replacing Mr Trump as president.\nMr Biden will issue executive orders to reverse President Trump's travel bans and re-join the Paris climate accord on his first day in the White House.\nThe president-elect is also expected to focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border, and to issue mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. \nMuch of Washington DC has been locked down ahead of the inauguration. The National Mall, which is usually thronged with thousands of people for inaugurations, has been shut at the request of the Secret Service.\nThe Biden team had already asked Americans to avoid travelling to the nation's capital for the inauguration because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Local officials said people should watch the event remotely."

      "text": "A nurse has received Brazil's first Covid-19 vaccine dose after regulators gave emergency approval to two jabs.\nRegulator Anvisa gave the green light to vaccines from Oxford-AstraZeneca and China's Sinovac, doses of which will be distributed among all 27 states.\nBrazil has the world's second-highest death toll from Covid-19 and cases are rising again across the country.\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro has been heavily criticised for his handling of the pandemic.\nThe far-right leader has played down the pandemic from the beginning, promoted an unproven treatment for the disease and gone against measures including mask-wearing and social distancing.\nThe president, who caught Covid-19 last year and recovered, has said he will not take a vaccine.\nAuthorities reported 551 new fatalities on Sunday, the first time in six days that it had fallen short of 1,000 although this could reflect a delay in the reporting of numbers over the weekend.\nIn all, more than 209,000 Covid-related deaths have been recorded in Brazil, a raw total figure only exceeded by the US.\nOver 8.4 million infections have been confirmed since the start of the pandemic - the third-highest tally in the world.\nHealth Minister Eduardo Pazuello told reporters that the national vaccination programme in the country of 211 million people would begin in earnest in the coming days. Two Brazilian biomedical centres which have been given approval to produce the jabs will be heavily involved.\nAbout six million doses of the Sinovac-developed CoronaVac have already been produced in Brazil, while the government is waiting for shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine from a laboratory in India.\nShortly after Anvisa's board gave emergency approval, Monica Calazans, a 54-year-old nurse in S\u00e3o Paulo, became the first person to be inoculated with CoronaVac.\nHer vaccination was organised by the S\u00e3o Paulo state government, which is led by Mr Bolsonaro's main political rival, Jo\u00e3o Doria.\nThis has been a rare piece of good news today for Brazilians who are grappling with a devastating second wave.\nFrom where I am, the city of Manaus, the vaccine does not feel real. People here are trying to recover a collapsed health system and doing what they can to keep their sick relatives alive.\nThe pandemic has become deeply political in Brazil. President Bolsonaro continues to present himself as a vaccine sceptic and he was notably absent as the vaccines were approved. Instead, Monday's newspapers will no doubt have S\u00e3o Paulo Governor Doria slapped on their front pages.\nHe is expected to run in next year's presidential elections and has backed the Sinovac vaccine from the very start. He was once a Bolsonaro ally and is now his nemesis - but there is no doubt who is leading the way in trying to get the population vaccinated. \nEarlier this week researchers said the Chinese vaccine had been found to be 50.4% effective in Brazilian clinical trials. This, results showed, was significantly less effective than previous data suggested - barely over the 50% needed for regulatory approval.\nCoronaVac is also being used in China, Indonesia and Turkey.\nThe news comes after revelations that a new coronavirus variant has emerged in Brazil. Several cases were traced back to the Amazonas state, where a state of emergency is in place.\nManaus, the state capital, has been hit especially hard, with beds and life-saving oxygen running low. Refrigerated containers have also been brought to hospitals to help store bodies.\nNeighbouring Venezuela said it had sent a convoy of trucks with oxygen supplies to help Amazonas.\nPresident Bolsonaro has faced mounting criticism for his handling of Brazil's outbreak, and several anti-government protests were held last week.\nAn opponent of lockdowns, he has previously blamed state governors and mayors for the Covid crisis, saying the federal government has provided all the resources needed to tackle the virus."

      "text": "Two police officers involved in the death of a black man they were restraining may have provided false statements, the BBC can reveal.\nThey said Sheku Bayoh carried out a stamping attack on a female PC before he was brought to the ground and restrained by up to six officers. \nBut now an eyewitness has spoken publicly for the first time about the 2015 incident.\nHe told a Panorama investigation that the stamping attack \"never happened\".  \nThe Scottish Police Federation said its officers had cooperated truthfully with investigators.\nMr Bayoh, a 31-year-old father of two, died in the incident in the Fife town of Kirkcaldy in 2015.\nA public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death has recently got under way. One of its tasks is to examine whether his race was a factor. \nOn the night of 2 May 2015, Sheku Bayoh had taken drugs, which friends said dramatically altered his behaviour. \nPolice were called early the following morning after he was spotted behaving erratically with a knife in the streets of his home town. \nAccording to police statements, by the time the officers arrived at the scene Mr Bayoh no longer had the knife but he failed to obey instructions to get down on the ground. \nEach of the officers used force on Mr Bayoh within seconds of encountering him, including CS Spray and batons.\nHe then punched PC Nicole Short, who went to the ground. \nTwo officers, PCs Craig Walker and Ashley Tomlinson, would later tell investigators that Mr Bayoh then carried out a violent stamping attack on PC Short while she lay on the ground, a claim reported widely in the media. \nPC Walker told investigators: \"I had a clear view of him\u2026 he had his arms raised up at right angles to his body and brought his right foot down in a full-force stamp on to her lower back.\"\nPC Tomlinson said: \"I thought he had killed her. He stomped on her back again.\"\nNow, evidence obtained by Panorama suggests these accounts may be false. \nMr Bayoh was restrained on the ground for five minutes before falling unconscious. He was pronounced dead at hospital a short time later.\nA post-mortem examination report revealed 23 separate injuries to Mr Bayoh's body, including a broken rib and gashes to his head. The cause of death was recorded as \"sudden death in a man intoxicated [with drugs] whilst under restraint\".  \nIn 2018, the Crown Office in Scotland decided there would be no prosecutions against any officers involved. \nKevin Nelson was in a nearby house and saw events unfold over a garden hedge.\nHe gave his account to investigators from Pirc (Police Investigations and Review Commissioner), which investigates deaths in custody, two days after the incident. \nSpeaking publicly for the first time, Mr Nelson told Panorama he saw Mr Bayoh attempt to walk away from the officers, ignoring their commands, before being sprayed with CS spray. He said Mr Bayoh retaliated and punched PC Short. \nAsked if there had been any further contact with PC Short, he said, \"No. He was running off\u2026 after the punch, there was no more attack on her at all.\"\nMr Nelson said Mr Bayoh ran off from where PC Short went down and was quickly intercepted by the other officers.  \nAsked about PC Walker's claim that Mr Bayoh had \"his arms raised up\u2026 and brought his right foot down in a full force stamp\", Mr Nelson said: \"That never happened. I didn't see him stamping at all or, other than the punch, any raised arms.\n\"After the punch, that was it. There was no more attack on her at all. That's not right.\"\nThe officers provided their accounts to investigators 32 days after Mr Bayoh's death. \nMr Nelson said no-one from Pirc returned to ask about the discrepancy between their account and his.\nThe eyewitness said he decided to speak out because it was unfair on Mr Bayoh's family that the officers had \"made the incident worse than it actually was to justify what had happened and\u2026 that's not right\".\nMr Nelson's account is supported by CCTV footage of the incident, obtained by the BBC. \nIt is poor quality but appears to show that once PC Short is knocked down by Mr Bayoh, the action moves away from her, and he is brought down within five seconds.\nPC Short did not mention in her statement she had been stamped on. Now retired, she later said she was unsure if she was conscious, and only learned about the alleged stamping attack when her colleagues told her about it afterwards. \nIn the CCTV, PC Short appears to get to her feet a few seconds after Mr Bayoh is brought down. \nMike Franklin, former commissioner for the body which investigated police complaints in England and Wales, looked at Panorama's evidence. \nHe said: \"I think there's nothing more serious than a police officer who gives false information in an investigation where somebody has died. So without accusing them of lying, I simply say that there's a big conflict.\n\"Two officers who were there say that it did happen. The person to whom it happened didn't mention it. And an eyewitness says it didn't happen.\n\"I would've been reluctant to sign off the investigation as complete, without resolving those\u2026 conflicts of evidence.\"\nMr Bayoh's sister, Kadi Johnson, told Panorama the new allegations had made her \"really angry\". \nShe said the way her brother was \"painted\" by the accounts given after his death was not who he was.\nA spokesman for the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said serving officers were unable to comment on matters \"to which they may be called upon to give sworn evidence\" but that they had \"co-operated fully and truthfully with the investigations that have taken place\".\nIt added it had seen \"compelling material that Mr Bayoh did violently stamp on the back of a policewoman as she lay unconscious\".\nThe BBC asked for this material to be produced but was told the inquiry was the \"proper forum\" for such matters. \nThe Crown Office, which directed the Pirc Inquiry, told Panorama it had examined \"eye-witness accounts of police and civilian witnesses\" and instructed \"appropriate investigation\".\nIt said after careful consideration it was decided there should be no prosecutions but reserved the right to prosecute should evidence become available.\nPirc told Panorama its investigation was \"detailed and extensive\" but could not comment further because of the public inquiry. \nPolice Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone expressed his condolences to the Bayoh family and said the force would \"participate fully\" in the inquiry.\nPanorama's \"I Can't Breathe: Black and Dead in Custody\" also investigates the case of Kevin Clarke, 35, who died in 2018 after being restrained in London by up to nine officers. \nAn inquest into his death resulted in a damning verdict on the police and ambulance services. \nMr Clarke's sister Tellecia told the programme that if the officers \"hadn't used excessive force he would still be here today\u2026 treat him like a human being, and not just see him as a big scary black man\".\nMetropolitan Police Commander Bas Javid apologised to Mr Clarke's family and accepted the restraint had not been appropriate. \nPanorama: I Can't breathe: Black and Dead in Custody on BBC One on Monday 18 January at 19:35."

      "text": "Students in Wales want partial refunds for university accommodation because they are not spending as much time there due to the coronavirus pandemic. \nThe National Union of Students Wales (NUS Wales) said students \"shouldn't be penalised financially\" for following Welsh Government guidelines. \nTwo Welsh universities have offered students refunds.\nThe Welsh Government said universities should have staggered returns and students only return when asked to.\nStaggered returns are being introduced in order to \"help stop the spread of the virus in student accommodation\" according to the Welsh Government.\nIt accepted this could mean some students need to stay home longer than anticipated, with online learning used at the start of term.\nBut some students feel they should not be paying for student accommodation when they are not there.\nMirain Iwerydd, a first year student at Aberystwyth University - which has told students not to come back - said: \"I think if there are students who've missed out, and haven't had what they've paid for, then as a matter of principle universities should be paying them back, because the students have paid for something they haven't received.\n\"I think it would help with day-to-day living costs because, when you think about it, students haven't been able to go out and earn a living working in cafes, for example, during their studies.\"\nBBC Wales asked Wales' universities if they would offer refunds and four of the six who responded said no.\nCardiff Metropolitan University said students living in university-operated halls would be given rebates for the weeks where all of their lectures and seminars had been held online.\nThey said they had told students on 4 January they would be offered the refunds.\nBangor University is offering eligible students a 10% discount.\nTegwen Bruce-Deans is in her second year at Bangor and said the reduction was \"fair\".\n\"I've spent less time in this room that I've paid for, compared with a year where coronavirus wasn't here,\" she said.\n\"If they are encouraging their students to leave earlier and return later then it's fair to say 'because you've been good and followed the advice given you can have some money back'.\"\nHowever, those living in private accommodation may find it harder to get refunds from landlords.\nSioned Bowen, who is in her third year at Aberystwyth University, said landlords should consider reduced rent, which some do during a normal summer break.\n\"It isn't fair if we have to stay at home and we can't even see the house in Aberystwyth, yet are still expected to pay full rent,\" she added.\nMeanwhile a group of students living in halls at Cardiff University said they were planning to stop their direct debits and hold a \"rent payment strike\" unless their rent is reduced while they are living at home.\nUnite Students, who provide private rental accommodation for students in Cardiff, said it was offering those unable to move back in a 50% discount from 18 January until 14 February.\nStudents living in the private accommodation will also be offered a four-week extension to their tenancy for free, to allow them to finish their studies, work part time or carry on living in the city after term ends.\nNUS Wales president Becky Ricketts said she had raised this issue with Education Minister Kirsty Williams.\n\"Students should not be paying for rooms that they are not able to stay in,\" she said. \n\"Students should not be financially penalised for essentially following the guidance from the Welsh Government, from their universities. \n\"It doesn't seem fair, it doesn't seem right and we completely support students who are looking for those rent rebates.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"As autonomous bodies, rental agreements are a matter for individual institutions or landlords. We are providing an extra \u00a340m this financial year to universities.\n\"The education minister has met regularly with NUS Wales throughout the pandemic, and the support we are providing includes \u00a310m for student hardship, mental health provision and student union funding.\"\nSwansea University said it was still in discussions about a way forward, while Wrexham Glyndwr, Cardiff and the University of South Wales all said they had no plans to refund students.\nAberystwyth University said it was actively considering the implications of new Welsh Government advice.\nA spokesman said: \"We have told our students not to travel unless absolutely necessary and will be contacting them again over the coming days with further information. \n\"Our priority continues to be the safety of our students, staff and the wider community.\"  \nUniversity of Wales Trinity Saint David said: \"The university is considering the implications of new Welsh Government advice.\""

      "text": "The mother of a 15-year-old girl found dead in a Malaysian jungle says she believes her daughter's body was placed by somebody in the spot she was found.\nN\u00f3ra Quoirin, from Balham in south London, vanished from her room at the Dusun rainforest resort in August 2019.\nHer body was found near the resort nine days after she went missing. A coroner recorded her death was by misadventure.\nMeabh Quoirin, who thinks Nora was abducted, said the family would \"never give up their fight for justice\".\nN\u00f3ra was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder that affects brain development, and her parents have always believed that wandering off from the resort - which is about 40 miles from Kuala Lumpur - was not something their daughter would have done.\nA post-mortem examination found N\u00f3ra had died three days before her body was found, due to gastrointestinal bleeding from hunger and stress endured over a prolonged period.\nBut Mrs Quoirin points out that the jungle had been searched on four occasions in the seven days leading up to her death, with police suggesting the teenager been \"alive and moving\" during the first stages of the search.\n\"The fact that search teams were there, along with many hundreds of volunteers in that particular area so close to her death, makes us feel that she was placed there at a later point,\" Mrs Quoirin told the BBC.\nThe teenager's mother pointed out that the inquest had not explained how her daughter ended up in the jungle, where her unclothed body was eventually found by a group of volunteers.\n\"I suppose the easiest one to dwell on was the fact there was an open window [in the family's chalet],\" said Mrs Quoirin, who is originally from Belfast.\n\"Someone opened that window, it wasn't any of us. That is totally unexplained.\"\nMalaysian police have always treated N\u00f3ra's disappearance as a missing person case. They maintain there was no suggestion of abduction, kidnap or foul play.\n\"N\u00f3ra always looked to someone else for reassurance on what she should do next so the idea that she would have climbed out a window - even found a window or seen a window in the pitch black - is in our view crazy,\" Mrs Quorin said.\n\"If she had somehow mistaken which door was for the bathroom and had gone out the front door for instance... she was barefoot, she would have instantly felt pain and she would have been absolutely petrified.\"\nN\u00f3ra's parents have asked for a revision of the inquest verdict as \"so many questions have been left unanswered\". \n\"I think it will be impossible to ever have all the answers to questions that inevitably we will agonise over for the rest of our lives,\" Mrs Quoirin said.\n\"We can do more justice by at least recognising who this child was and that she wouldn't have - couldn't have - done the things that have been ruled through this verdict of misadventure.\n\"It's our duty to Nora to stand up for that, to really recognise who she was and stand up in the name of all children with special needs, to recognise who these children are, what they represent in our society.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Poverty,Jack Monroe,Universal Credit",
      "text": "MPs have urged Boris Johnson to extend benefit increases worth \u00a320 a week. \nA non-binding Labour motion calling for the universal credit top-up to be kept in place beyond 31 March passed by 278 votes to none after a Commons debate.\nSix Tory MPs defied party orders to abstain and voted with Labour, adding to the pressure on the PM on the issue.\nThe prime minister said the government had provided \u00a3280bn worth of support during the pandemic but all measures would be kept under \"constant review\".\nThe motion, which will not automatically lead to a change in policy, was put forward by Labour as a way to put additional pressure on the government to continue the increase, worth \u00a31,000 a year. \nFormer Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb was among six Conservative MPs to rebel, along with Peter Aldous, Robert Halfon, Jason McCartney, Anne Marie Morris and Matthew Offord.\nAhead of the vote, Mr Crabb told the BBC that although there were \"difficult pressures on the chancellor\" extending the increase for 12 months was \"the right thing to do\". \nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there were dozens of Conservative MPs who were \"deeply uneasy\" about ending the \u00a320 weekly increase to universal credit. \nShe added that it was also understood the cabinet minister with responsibility for benefits, Therese Coffey, was arguing that the uplift should not be dropped in April. \nCharities and anti-poverty campaigners are pleading with the government to keep the support in place, describing it as a lifeline for more than 5.5 million families who receive the standard universal credit allowance.\nFood poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe told the BBC that the \u00a320 increase \"has been a lifeline\" for millions of people who have needed to top up their income or rely on universal credit payments in order to get by.\nSir Keir said the increase was a vital safety net for those who had lost their jobs, seen their working hours slashed or who were not eligible for the government's wage subsidy furlough scheme.\n\"If we don't give a helping hand to families through this pandemic, then we are going to slow our economic recovery as we come out it.\n\"We urge Boris Johnson to change course and give families certainty today that their incomes will be protected.\"\nAnalysis by chief political correspondent Adam Fleming\nSix billion pounds of the benefits bill - the difference between poverty or not for 1.2 million families, according to a think tank. \nThe \u00a31,040 a year increase to universal credit is a very emotive issue. \nThere's even a battle over what to call it. \nTo the government, its introduction was a one-off boost to cope with a crisis. For Labour, taking it away is a cut.\nMinisters would prefer we looked at the overall level of support they've provided for workers and businesses during the pandemic. The opposition say the \u00a320 a week boost is a powerful symbol of the state's willingness to help. \nEven the act of debating it today is disputed. Labour say they've got the right occasionally to set the agenda in Parliament. Boris Johnson said his MPs risk abuse from campaigners and protestors if they engage. \nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation has suggested about 16 million people will be directly affected if the \u00a320 is rolled back.\nIt says 500,000 more people will be driven into poverty, including 200,000 children, while a further 500,000 of those already in poverty will find themselves in even worse hardship. \nHowever, free market think tank the Institute for Economic Affairs has argued that \"across-the-board benefit increases are a wasteful use of taxpayers' money\" at a time when the government is borrowing \"a hair-raising amount of money\". \nUniversal credit is a single payment replacing old benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits.\nYou can claim universal credit if you are on a low income or are out of work. \nThe standard allowance varies from around \u00a3340 to just under \u00a3600 a month, depending on your age or whether you are single. \nYou may be eligible to receive more money on top of the standard allowance if, for example, you have children or a health condition. \nSpeaking on behalf of the Northern Research Group, Conservative MP John Stevenson said the \u00a31,000 increase had been \"a real life-saver for people throughout this pandemic\".\n\"To end it now would be devastating for the 6 million individuals and families who are already struggling to stay afloat,\" he added.\nWhile the vote is not binding, and will not lead to a change in policy, it will increase pressure on the government to keep the increase or come up with an alternative.\nLabour said the Conservatives' decision to abstain created \"unnecessary uncertainty\" but minister Nadhim Zahawi described the vote as \"a political stunt\".\nThe government says it has strengthened the welfare system with an extra \u00a37bn of funding during the pandemic while families struggling with food and household bills can get help through the \u00a3170m Winter Grant Scheme. \nMinisters also point to extra support for housing costs, through an increase in local housing allowance for those on housing benefits and hardship payments worth \u00a3670m next year for those unable to pay their council tax bills."

      "text": "Analysis of Covid-19 deaths in the first wave of the pandemic in Wales has showed how the virus took a grip at very local levels of the country.\nExperts found not all deaths could be explained by factors such as economic deprivation, age and ethnicity.\nClusters in some parts of rural Wales persisted, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) research,\nIt suggests more work is needed to look at factors like travel and high risk occupations.\nThe research tracked nearly 2,000 deaths from the virus in Wales, broken down across more than 400 local areas up to the end of August.\nBecause there was little testing on-demand in the early weeks of the pandemic, hospital figures and deaths are the only real measure of the infection's spread up to the autumn of 2020.\nThis study looked to isolate known risk factors - such as poverty, age and ethnic background - and found \"substantial variation remains unexplained\". \nWhile there was higher mortality in historically more deprived areas like the south Wales valleys, consistently higher mortality was also found in smaller, rural areas within Powys, Gwynedd and Anglesey. \nAlthough not large in numbers, they were higher rates than might expect to be found.\n\"We ended up with these areas where there were more deaths than we would have expected, even after taking into account factors such as economic deprivation, age, ethnicity,\" said Myer Glickman, one of the study's authors.\nAnalysis suggests some of the factors at play are around travel, occupations, living and working in working in different areas and movement patterns between urban and rural areas.\nThe research found some rural parts of Wales, deaths from Covid carried on over a longer period, beyond spikes in the first wave.\nClusters identified later in the pandemic - up to early June - included communities in north Wales.\n\"We found mainly low rates in the rural clusters throughout the bulk of the first wave,\" added study co-author Jordan Parker.\n\"Deaths were not much higher than expected but were still around for a longer time from March and into May and June. Just the fact they were there, was slightly surprising.\"\nThe study looked at the very start of the pandemic in Wales, where we know already there were concerning hotspots around Caerphilly, Newport and the Gwent valleys.\nBut by the peak of the first wave in mid April, these \"unexpected\" local areas of Wales with higher Covid deaths were more widespread - and included communities in Powys, as well as urban centres like Cardiff and Swansea.\nThe ONS has produced an interactive map - which shows each community, such as Llandyrnog and Llanarmon-yn-Ial in Denbighshire or Abergwili, Llanegwad and Carmel in Carmarthenshire, among those which have \"high persistence and rates\".\nOther areas like Tywyn and Llangelynnin had in Gwynedd have higher rates but only showing at fewer times during the pandemic.\nBobby Feeley, a Denbighshire councillor in Ruthin, said compared with the first wave people had more knowledge about Covid - and it was not just about numbers but \"real people\" and very few had not been touched by it in some way.\n\"In the first wave, I think we were all in shock, we didn't really know what had hit us,\" she said. \n\"People are now probably looking into finer details of what's gone on and things will come to light. Wherever it happens, whether rural or urban, it's everywhere, so we all need to take care.\"\nRuthin was identified as being close to a cluster of higher rate communities but not having higher mortality itself most of the time.\n\"In rural areas, houses and people are more spaced apart, in many rural areas there are few shops and the pubs are shut, you would think they would have less chance of picking up Covid,\" added Ms Feeley.\n\"If they have done, have people travelled somewhere, formed bubbles with friends and family? I would've assumed rural areas would have less Covid.\"   \nThe study recommends more research - including into the routes of infection in and around the country but also into specific groups of occupations or types of household associated with high infection risk.\nLarger scale testing of people with symptoms since the autumn means that Public Health Wales - and statisticians - can track far more easily how infection is spreading and where hotspots of positive tests show up in local communities.\nWrexham communities have been reporting Wales' high infection rates in recent weeks, while the local hospital has reported a \"rapid increase\" in seriously ill people in the last few days.  and the health board has more people in critical care with Covid than at any time in the pandemic.\nThe ONS said it will be analysing closely local mortality data to see how it correlates with case figures during this second wave."

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nAlmost four million people have had their first Covid-19 jab in the UK - and that number should accelerate this week when people aged 70 and over, and the clinically extremely vulnerable of any age, begin receiving the vaccine in England. The over 70s and clinically vulnerable were fourth in the UK's priority list, after care home residents and carers, the over 80s and health care workers, and the over 75s. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it a \"significant milestone\". However, the news doesn't mean vaccination of the first three groups is complete - and the government said the top two groups should still be prioritised. Meanwhile, 10 new mass vaccination centres will open in England, including at Blackburn Cathedral in Lancashire, and Taunton racecourse in Somerset. \nAs of 04:00 GMT on Monday, all arrivals must have proof of a negative test before being allowed into the UK. Almost all must quarantine for 10 days - although this can be reduced to five if they test negative again for Covid-19 within those five days. The closure of the so-called \"travel corridors\", which allowed quarantine-free travel, will be in place until at least 15 February.  \nAustralia is unlikely to fully open its borders in 2021 - even if most of its population gets vaccinated this year, says a senior health official. Department of Health Secretary Brendan Murphy made the prediction after being asked about the virus in other nations. \"I think that we'll go most of this year with still substantial border restrictions,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday.\n\"My heart races, I get really hot and start sweating, I start shaking, all the noise in the shop seems to get louder and the lights seem to get brighter.\" That's how it feels when Georgina Spray puts on a face covering. The 21-year-old has autism and is exempt from wearing one. But she's so worried about being confronted, she chooses to put one on anyway.\nBBC China Correspondent Stephen McDonell has taken a road trip back to the Chinese city of Wuhan - as it nears the anniversary on 23 January of the world's first Covid-19 lockdown.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Ten hospital trusts across England consistently reported having no spare adult critical care beds in the most recent figures.\nIt comes as hospital waiting times, coronavirus admissions and patients requiring intensive care are rising.\nEngland's 140 acute trusts had 5,503 adult critical care beds on 10 January, with 4,632 in use.\nNHS bosses have warned hospitals could \"hit the limit\" of their capacity this week.\n\"I think, this next week, we will be at the limit of what we probably have the physical space and the people to safely do,\" Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said.\n\"And, of course, this is the week when we expect also the highest rate of admissions, the highest demand for the care that we're providing.\"\nThe latest figures from NHS England show the number of trusts that were, on average, at full capacity in adult critical care across an entire week rose from four to 10 in the week to 10 January.\nThis was the highest number in the last 10 weeks for which data was available.\nThe increase comes despite trusts adding an additional 50% \"surge\" capacity across the summer and autumn to cope with winter pressures, according to NHS England.\nOverall, 30 acute hospital trusts in England had no spare adult critical care beds on 10 January alone. But daily admissions figures can vary from day-to-day as patients move in and out of intensive care.\nSpeaking on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said nine critical care patients had recently been transferred to other parts of the country because of no beds being available in their local area.\nSpeaking about all admissions, Sir Simon said hospitals in England had seen an increase of 15,000 inpatients since Christmas Day.\n\"That's the equivalent of filling 30 hospitals full of coronavirus patients and staggeringly every 30 seconds across England another patient is being admitted to hospital with coronavirus,\" he added.\nHelen Buckingham, from Health think-tank The Nuffield Trust, said the NHS was facing a winter \"like no other\" and, on top of rising coronavirus hospital admissions, critical care beds were also required for non-Covid patients.\n\"The NHS has pulled out all the stops to create more beds this year, and hospitals are working together so that patients who need critical care can be moved to other hospitals as necessary - but without more fully trained critical care staff there isn't much further the service can go,\" she said.  \nThe figures only tell part of the story. The creation of extra beds to cope with rising numbers of Covid patients has come at a price.\nCritical care beds have been set up in overspill areas including departments usually reserved for operations. What is more, there is no extra staff to look after these extra patients - so specialist intensive care nurses have been stretched across more patients than normal. Instead of providing one-to-one care for the most sick, some areas are seeing  nurses looking after three or four patients.\nStaff from other areas have had to be redeployed into critical care departments too.\nThat of course comes at a cost to non-Covid services and is part of the reason we have seen planned surgery and even cancer care being cut back on.\nA leaked email recently revealed about 200 doctors would be redeployed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham amid fears its intensive care unit could be \"overwhelmed\".\nUniversity Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust said it had \"significantly\" more patients in hospital with Covid-19 than in April last year. \nThe trust had 147 critical care beds available across its hospitals as of 10 January, all of which were full as of the latest figures.\nA spokesman said the trust would continue to extend its intensive care teams \"so they are able to treat the rising number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery, including cancer operations\".\nAiredale NHS Foundation Trust, despite having nine critical care beds overall, said it did not normally experience full occupancy at this time in the year and the ward had both Covid and non-Covid patients.\n\"We are experiencing normal winter pressures across the trust, combined with an increasing number of Covid-19 patients, particularly over the last week,\" a spokeswoman said. \n\"Every bed in ICU that is occupied by a Covid-19 patient is one less available for people who need that level of care for other reasons.\"\nSir Simon said the current number of patients in critical care was a \"clear indication of the huge pressure on the NHS\", including ambulance and mental health services as well as hospitals.\n\"The likelihood is, even with a stabilising of infections in some parts of the country, we're still seeing increases in infections among the over-60s in many parts of the country,\" he added.\n\"The forecasts are the pressure on hospitals will only get more intense over the next several weeks.\"\nNHS England said critical care services were under \"unprecedented pressure\".\nA spokeswoman added that hospitals had \"tried and tested plans in place\" to manage pressure from increased Covid-19 and non-Covid patients, including mutual aid practices where hospitals work together to manage admissions.\nAdditional analysis by Ben Butcher"

      "tags": "Russia,Alexei Navalny,Moscow,Vladimir Putin",
      "text": "Putin critic Alexei Navalny has been detained after flying back to Moscow from Germany, five months after he was nearly killed by a nerve agent attack.\nThe activist, 44, was led away by police at passport control at Sheremetyevo airport.\nThousands had gathered at a different Moscow airport to greet his flight from Berlin, but the plane was diverted.\nMr Navalny blames Russian authorities for the attempt on his life last year. The Kremlin denies any role.\nThe opposition politician's allegations have however been backed up by reports from investigative journalists.\nNews of Mr Navalny's detention prompted condemnation from the European Union, France and Italy, which called for his immediate release.\nUS President-elect Joe Biden's incoming national security adviser echoed the call. \"The Kremlin's attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard,\" Jake Sullivan said.\nWhen Mr Navalny was poisoned last August and collapsed on an internal flight in Siberia, he was flown to Germany for emergency medical treatment. As he recovered, he said he intended to return to Russia. \nOn Sunday he made good on that pledge, boarding a Pobeda Airlines flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. \nThe plane was packed with journalists, including Andrey Kozenko of the BBC Russian Service. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for \"technical reasons\", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers.\n\"I know that I'm right. I fear nothing,\" Mr Navalny told supporters and the media upon landing, just minutes before he was detained. \"Have you been waiting for me long?\" he asked border guards.\nHe kissed his wife Yulia - who had flown with him from Germany - after police officers warned they would use physical force if he disobeyed their orders to come with them. Despite pleas, Mr Navalny's lawyer was not allowed to accompany him.\nThe activist is being held at a police station in Moscow.\nEarlier on Sunday, extra riot police were deployed and metal barriers erected inside Vnukovo airport, where the plane was originally scheduled to land.\nRussian media reported that a number of activists - including key Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol - had been detained.\nIn a statement late on Sunday, Russia's prison service said the opposition leader \"had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period\". It added that he would remain in custody until a court decision.\nThe authorities accuse him of violating conditions imposed after a conviction for embezzlement, for which he received a suspended sentence. He has always said the case was politically motivated.\nSeparately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation.\nThe activist earlier argued that Mr Putin was doing all he could to stop him from returning to Russia by fabricating new cases against him.\nThe Russian authorities often make out that Alexei Navalny isn't popular with the Russian people, that he's no threat to President Putin. \nBut his return home five months after being poisoned sparked a major police operation on Sunday.\nIn chaotic scenes, riot police pushed Mr Navalny's supporters out of the arrivals hall of Vnukovo airport, before the flight was rerouted.\nLast summer, Russia's most prominent opposition figure was attacked in Siberia allegedly by an undercover hit squad of Russian security agents.\nHis decision to return home is a direct challenge to Vladimir Putin - and creates a dilemma for the Kremlin.\nIt risks turning him into a political martyr, a Nelson Mandela-like figure, and sparking more Western sanctions. \nDo nothing and the Kremlin's fiercest critic will almost certainly be a thorn in its side in an important election year.\nIn August, he collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The pilot diverted the flight to the city of Omsk, where Mr Navalny was admitted to hospital. Two days later, Russian officials allowed him to be airlifted to Germany in an induced coma for specialised treatment. \nEuropean experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War.\nHe was released from a hospital in Berlin in September to continue his recuperation. \nMr Navalny said recently he was able to do push-ups and squat exercises, and therefore had probably almost fully recovered. \nLast month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years.\nMr Navalny then duped an FSB agent named Konstantin Kudryavtsev into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation which he recorded and posted online.\nThe agent told him that the Novichok used to poison him had been placed in his underpants. \nPresident Putin has dismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groups that have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as \"a trick\". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services."

      "text": "Four men have been found guilty of murdering a boy stabbed more than 40 times in a \"well-planned execution\".\nKeelan Wilson, 15, was fatally injured on Langley Road in Merry Hill, Wolverhampton, on 29 May, 2018.\nThe four murderers acted \"like a pack of animals\" amid rising gang violence in the city, police said.\nKeelan's mother Kelly Ellitts said the convictions meant justice for her son, but added \"nothing would bring Keelan back\".\nIt emerged a few days after the murder that when an ambulance was called for the wounded boy, his final words included \"tell my mum I love her\". \nThe trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how the night time attack - carried out by Brian Sasa and Nehemie Tampwo, each aged 20, along with Tyrique King and Zenay Pennant-Phillips, both 19 - was \"not in any way spontaneous\".\nDet Sgt Nick Barnes from the West Midlands force said Keelan had the \"single worst set of injuries\" he had seen on a victim in more than six years investigating homicide.\nThere had been increasing acts of violence between opposing gangs leading up to the murder, including disorder earlier that day, police said. \nThat included weapons being brandished in Wolverhampton city centre, and in another incident, Keelan and two others being shot at by a group of youngsters on bikes. No one was hurt.\nBut later on, the court heard, the group of four killers ran towards Keelan as he sat in a taxi close to his home, then pulled open the rear door and \"set about him with weapons\", inflicting more than 40 knife wounds.\nMichael Duck QC, prosecuting, said the killing \"was not in any way a spontaneous act of violence\".\nHe said: \"This was a well-planned, targeted group attack by a number of youths armed with knives, and that was with the plan to execute another young man.\"\nDuring the 13-week trial, jurors heard there was evidence to suggest the victim had \"become embroiled in gang culture\", with his killers believing he had switched factions.\nDet Sgt Barnes said it was \"difficult\" to pinpoint a motive \"because Keelan wasn't on the police radar particularly for any such activity\". \nKeelan was wounded just metres from his home, receiving 43 stab wounds in total, according to police.\nHe had been driving with a friend - with whom he met up after the shooting incident - when their car broke down, which led to a taxi being called.\nA spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said while Keelan was attacked on boarding the vehicle, his friend was \"left unscathed\" and fled, making it \"evident\" to authorities that \"Keelan was the only target\".\nThe taxi driver sustained a minor cut. \nMs Ellitts said she lived with the shock of her son's death daily.\n\"This isn't something that you think of every now and again, this is a daily thing that you have to live with.\n\"It's terrible my daughters won't know who he is.\"\nSasa, of Long Ley, Heath Town, Wolverhampton; King, of Chelwood Gardens, Wolverhampton; Tampwo of Fern Grove in Bletchley, Milton Keynes; and Pennant-Phillips, whose address cannot be published for legal reasons, had all denied murder. \n\"Keelan was a child who had his whole life ahead of him,\" Det Sgt Barnes said. \nThe convictions, he added, came after a \"very difficult and long investigation,\" with more than 2,000 lines of inquiry having to be examined. \nSome lines of investigation had been met with a \"wall of silence,\" he said.\nJudge Michael Chambers said: \"It is an utter tragedy that a 15-year-old child lost his life at the hands of others who are barely older than he.\"\nSentencing is set to take place at Wolverhampton Crown Court on 19 March. \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

We have now dropped below that slightly.\"\nThe chief executive said the hospitals were \"coping but at great cost\", with many urgent surgeries cancelled.\n\"Emergency surgery is being done but we are not being able to do any other in the Antrim Area site.\n\"We have been able to deliver some red flag cancer surgery at Causeway but we would like to do more.\"\nDespite these emergency measures already in place, the worst of the current surge is only expected to arrive this week.\nShe added: \"We are not going to get out of this quickly. It's going to be a challenge for us as a system.\n\"It's been building from October.\"\n\"We're not yet at the peak of intensive care admissions and we expect that this week.\n\"Antrim has doubled its intensive care beds from seven to 14 in anticipation of the coming surge - 11 are already being used.\n\"All hospitals have doubled their ICU footprint. There are more than 160 inpatients in Antrim Area Hospital.\""

We're kind of being told very last minute at the moment.\"\nAs a drama student, she said it was very difficult to study online, without face-to-face teaching.\n\"It's such a practical course and I signed up to be face-to-face, so I get it's unpredictable times but it's difficult because we have to act online and things are kind of different to what you think it would be,\" she said.\n\"That's not what I thought I would get out of the degree. I feel like we can't show our full potential and get what we need out of it because we're kind of stuck.\n\"It's such an unpredictable time we're in so I can't really be overly disappointed, but it's a lot to deal with because we're paying so much money to be there for it.\n\"It's \u00a39,000 we're going to have to pay back one day for something we're not having the full experience of, so there is slight resentment because we're kind of on the back foot right now.\"\nEbony Banks, president of Wrexham Glyndwr Students' Union, said: \"Obviously the \u00a340m is a huge relief to not only institutions but students' unions as well.\"\nShe said as soon as more details on the money allocation were announced, the union would be \"working very closely with the institution to make sure that it goes into the best possible pockets and to ensure that the money goes where the students need it\".\n\"I think it's enough. It's definitely advantageous to students,\" she added.\nThe National Union of Students welcomed the refunds for tens of thousands of students but added it was \"vital\" funding reached those living in private accommodation. \n\"The pandemic has exposed the fragility of the private rental market for students,\" NUS Wales president Becky Ricketts said.\n\"I will keep the pressure on the Welsh Government to strengthen protections for student renters longer term, such as more flexible notice periods.\"\nSpeaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said students had suffered a huge amount of disruption this year \"especially as the effects of the pandemic has increased as we've moved into the winter months\".\n\"Despite the tremendous work of our universities, their staff, students, and volunteers, with additional testing and plans in place to make learning as safe as possible, the new Covid strain has unfortunately made it necessary to ask the majority of students to study at home for the time being,\" she said.\n\"This means that tens of thousands of students are now helping to keep Wales safe by staying away from campus.\n\"Many of our students have needed to pay for their term-time accommodation, while, for very important public health reasons, not being able to actually live there.\"\nShe added \"a large proportion of students are also unable to access the part-time jobs that they would normally rely on\" and so the new funding should be used to support \"students facing financial hardship, helping the students most affected by the pandemic\".\nThe funding comes on top of \u00a310m already allocated to help students facing financial hardship or needing mental health support during the pandemic.\nAlso during the briefing, Ms Williams said she was \"deeply disappointed\" by the UK Government's decision to withdraw access to the EU's Erasmus university scheme, which helps students study in other countries.\nShe said the UK alternative Turing scheme was a \"poor replacement\" and she would work with counterparts in the other devolved administrations to see if there was a way to rejoin Erasmus. \nShe added Wales had provided \"the most generous student support package in Europe\" during the pandemic\nSix of the seven universities in Wales have broadly welcomed the announcement, though were awaiting further information from Welsh Government.\nCardiff University said the details of the funding were still being worked through and it would be able to update students once it received further information. \nUniversities Wales, the group that represents Wales' universities, said lecturers and university staff had worked \"tirelessly to deliver a rewarding learning experience while also providing important pastoral and well-being support for students\". \n\"This additional funding will further support this work and make a real difference to students across Wales,\" chairwoman Prof Julie Lydon said.\nBethan Sayed, Plaid Cymru spokeswoman for post-16 education, who had previously called for rent rebates, welcomed the extra funding.\nShe said: \"I would expect some clarity from the Welsh Government, however, on the small print of this support, and who is eligible to receive funds, and ensure that those who are in private rented accommodation can be supported also.\"\nTory education spokeswoman Suzy Davies welcomed the funding but said it should be \"ringfenced\" for those in hardship. \nShe added: \"Online learning cannot replace in-person teaching, with students unable to use the full resources that a university offers.\n\"The Welsh Government needs to ensure that universities can offer a partial refund for the current academic year, as well as ensuring that students can afford to continue to afford their courses in September.\"\nThe Welsh Government said universities and student unions would be able to provide students with information about how to access support during the pandemic."

      "text": "Samsung heir Lee Jae Yong has been sentenced to two years and six months in prison by a high court in South Korea.  \nThe bribery case is a retrial of an earlier one involving the country's former President Park Geun-hye, who was also jailed for bribery and corruption.\nLee has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since 2014.\nThe ruling is likely to have ramifications for the future of his role at the tech giant. \nNews of the sentence sent Samsung electronics shares more than 4% lower before they began to claw back some ground.    \nLee's jail term will at least temporarily side-line him from decision making at the conglomerate. \nExperts say the sentence could create a leadership vacuum and hamper Samsung's decision-making on future large-scale investments.\n\"It's really a huge blow and a big crisis for Samsung,\" Kim Dae-jong, a business professor at Sejong University, told news agency AFP.\nLee assumed leadership of the company when his father Lee Kun-hee was hospitalised following a heart attack in 2014. \nThe elder Lee died last year, leading to speculation that there would be a shake-up at Samsung as his heirs could be forced into asset sales or dividend payments to cover a massive inheritance tax bill.  \nAccording to the court's verdict, Lee \"actively provided bribes and implicitly asked the president to use her power to help his smooth succession\" at the head of Samsung. \n\"It is very unfortunate that Samsung, the country's top company and proud global innovator, is repeatedly involved in crimes whenever there is a change in political power.\"\nThe court found Lee guilty of bribery, embezzlement and concealment of criminal proceeds worth about 8.6 billion won ($7.8m; \u00a35.75m), and said the independent compliance committee Samsung set up early last year has yet to become fully effective.\nLee's defence team expressed disappointment with the decision. \n\"The nature of this case is the former president's abuse of power violating corporate freedom and property rights. Given that nature, the court's decision is regrettable,\" Lee's lawyer, Lee In-jae, told reporters.\nLee has already served time in detention which is expected to count toward the sentence - leaving 18 months to be served.\nLee faced legal troubles even as he stood on the cusp of becoming the leader of the global tech giant.\nHe was first arrested in February 2017 over his alleged role in a political and corporate scandal linked to South Korea's then-president, Park Geun-hye.\nSamsung was accused of paying 43bn won ($37.7m; \u00a326.7m) to two non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Park's, in exchange for political support - alleged to include backing for a controversial Samsung merger which paved the way for Lee to become eventual head of the conglomerate. The deal needed support from the government-run national pension fund. \nCharges against Lee included bribery, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and perjury - all of which he denied, saying Samsung did not want anything in return. \nBut in August 2017 a court convicted him of the charges and sent him to prison for five years. \nIn February 2018, that sentence was halved, and the Seoul High Court decided to suspend the jail term, meaning he was free to go.\nThe Supreme Court then sent the case back to the Seoul High Court, which issued Monday's ruling."

      "text": "The world faces a \"catastrophic moral failure\" because of unequal Covid vaccine policies, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was not fair for younger, healthy people in richer nations to get injections before vulnerable people in poorer states.\nHe said over 39 million vaccine doses had been given in 49 richer states - but one poor nation had only 25 doses. \nMeanwhile, both the WHO and China were criticised for their Covid response.\nAn independent panel commissioned by the WHO said the UN public health body should have declared an international emergency earlier, and also rapped China for not taking public health measures sooner.\nSo far, China, India, Russia, the UK and the US have all developed Covid vaccines, with others being made by multinational teams - like the American-German Pfizer vaccine.\nAlmost all of these nations have prioritised distribution to their own populations.\nSpeaking at a WHO executive board session on Monday, Dr Tedros said, \"I need to be blunt: the world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries.\"\nDr Tedros said a \"me-first\" approach would be self-defeating because it would push up prices and encourage hoarding. \n\"Ultimately, these actions will only prolong the pandemic, the restrictions needed to contain it, and human and economic suffering,\" he added.\nAnd the WHO head called for a full commitment to the global vaccine-sharing scheme Covax, which is due to start rolling out next month. \n\"My challenge to all member states is to ensure that by the time World Health Day arrives on 7 April, Covid-19 vaccines are being administered in every country, as a symbol of hope for overcoming both the pandemic and the inequalities that lie at the root of so many global health challenges,\" Dr Tedros said.\nSo far, more than 180 countries have signed up to the Covax initiative, which is supported by the WHO and a group of international vaccine advocacy groups. Its aim is to unite countries into one bloc so they have more power to negotiate with drug companies.\nNinety-two countries - all of them low or middle-income - will have their vaccines paid for by a fund sponsored by donors. \n\"We have secured two billion doses from five producers, with options of more than one billion more doses, and we aim to start deliveries in February,\" Dr Tedros said.\nReacting to Dr Tedros' warning, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"The UK is the world's biggest supporter, financial supporter, of the global programme to ensure access to vaccines in all countries in the world.\"\nMr Hancock said the UK had \"put the most financial support in these international efforts to ensure everybody has access to vaccines\".\nThe UK government has provided \u00a3548m ($734m) to the Covax programme.\nMore than four million people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures.\nPeople in their 70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable in England are now among those being offered the jab.\nLast month, the People's Vaccine Alliance coalition of campaigning bodies said that rich countries were hoarding doses of Covid vaccines and people living in poor countries were set to miss out.\nIt said that nearly 70 lower-income countries would only be able to vaccinate one in 10 people.\nCanada, in particular, came in for criticism, with the coalition saying the North American nation had ordered enough vaccine doses to protect each Canadian five times.\nIn December, Karina Gould, Canada's minister of international development, denied allegations the country was hoarding vaccines, saying any discussion of a surplus was \"hypothetical\" as the doses had not been delivered. \nShe said Canada was providing C$485 million ($380 million; \u00a3280 million) to help developing countries cope with Covid-19.\nIn their interim report, the panel of independent experts said both China and the WHO should have acted faster during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe document said that Beijing should have acted more forcefully to localise the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan first detected in late 2019.\nThe experts also criticised the WHO for only declaring a global emergency on 30 January 2020.\n \"The global pandemic alert system is not fit for purpose,\" the report said. \"The World Health Organization has been underpowered to do the job.\"\nThe panel of experts was led by former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf."
