      "title": "In pictures: Tartan Army's rollercoaster ride ends in heartache",
      "text": "Scotland fans were ready to embrace history, but ultimately their return to major competition ended in familiar heartache.\nA victory at Hampden Park in Glasgow would have seen the men's team qualify for the knockout stages of a major championship for the first time.\nBut for the 12,000-strong Tartan Army inside the national stadium, and millions more watching across the country, a sobering 3-1 defeat by Croatia ended their hopes of progress in numbing fashion. \nIt was all in stark contrast to the pre-match optimism as supporters swarmed into Glasgow and those with tickets for the game belted out a lusty rendition of Flower of Scotland with anticipation at fever pitch.\nOnce the action got under way, Scotland fans inside Hampden - as well as in pubs and the Glasgow Green fan zone - were on their feet inside the first 10 seconds when their side won a corner. \nThey rose in anticipation again as the hosts carved out a couple of tantalising early chances for striker Che Adams.\nFans' early optimism was swiftly punctured when Nikola Vlasic put Croatia ahead after 16 minutes at Hampden and a familiar fatalism descended on the Tartan Army.\nBut with a few minutesto go before half-time, elation!  Midfielder Callum McGregor rifled home a shot into the corner for - miracle of miracles - his first goal for Scotland, and their first at a major men's tournament since Craig Burley's strike against Norway at the 1998 World Cup. \nBut it didn't last. After a brief glimmer of hope when John McGinn came close to putting Scotland in front, disaster struck.\nCroatia maestro Luka Modric burst the Tartan Army's balloon after 61 minutes, and any lingering hope of a comeback disappeared when Ivan Perisic headed home a third goal for Croatia.\nIt took 23 years for Scotland's men to reach another major tournament.  But they are leaving the Euros party after just 12 days. \nAll pictures are copyrighted."

      "text": "A victim of sexual abuse has said she cannot heal with her attacker now living back in her community.\nDespite being told she would not see the man when he left prison because he was housebound due to his poor health, Leah Walker was \"devastated\" when she bumped into him at a supermarket.\n\"I was reassured I wouldn't see my abuser - then I saw him in Sainsbury's and it shook me to my core,\" she said.\nThe Probation Service has apologised and said it has taken immediate action.\nLeah, 32, was sexually abused from the age of seven through to adulthood. Her abuser was jailed in 2017 for 25 counts of indecent and sexual assault. \nShe was finally starting to heal when he was released into the community having served half of his six-year sentence.\n\"They reassured me that he's of such ill health that he won't be out of his home. But he's still really close to me - I was absolutely devastated,\" said Leah, who has waived her right to anonymity.\nWithin a few months, she bumped into him while food shopping. \n\"I feel like back when I was a child and I wasn't listened to, it was brushed under the carpet - this is how I'm feeling again.  \n\"I've voiced my concerns and let them know that I'm really not happy and I'm not comfortable with him being there and they reassured me that I won't see him - but I did.\"\nLeah also said a relative saw her abuser at a nearby takeaway on the weekend and she has raised it again with probation.\nShe explained the resultant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression could leave her with flashbacks. \n\"Whilst he was in prison you start to build yourself up. I told myself: 'I'm a stronger person. I went to court. I got justice,' and my life was on a better track.\n\"But then you get knocked back and everything just seemed to unravel. \n\"For me to be able to heal in the way that I should - and the way that I deserve to - he shouldn't be in an area that I am. I feel my needs should be listened to and heard.\" \nThe victims' commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird QC, said victims should always be considered by the Probation Service when releasing offenders to avoid such \"shock or distress\".\n\"Victims who are in the government's Victim Contact Scheme are offered the opportunity to request licence conditions, such as exclusion zones or no contact, so as to provide them with the peace of mind they will not meet the offender by chance close to where they live or work,\" she said.\n\"Victims sometimes attach great importance to these conditions, not least as it gives them a sense of control - something they did not have when the crimes against them were committed.\"\nThe Probation Service said it has taken immediate action to reinforce the offender's conditions.\n\"Prisoners released under supervision face strict conditions and if they pose an increased risk we don't hesitate to return them to custody,\" a spokesperson said.\nFor Leah, it took years - and a global movement - to have the courage to speak up again.\nAged seven, she disclosed what was happening, but was not taken seriously.  \nIt was only years later that the #MeToo movement gave her the confidence to seek justice. \n\"I started to think 'OK, so I'm not on my own. This has happened to other women and they seem like they're coping, so maybe I can have the courage to speak out as well.'\n\"Seeing things in the media helped me come to my decision to take it to court and I think it's really, really important that other people going through the same thing see a face out there that's been through it.  \n\"And even though I'm still struggling - there is light at the end of the tunnel.\" \nIf you have been affected by sexual abuse or violence, help and support is available at BBC Action Line."

      "tags": "NHS,Matthew Hancock",
      "text": "NHS patients in England will get greater control over their health and social care data under plans set out by the government, Matt Hancock says. \nIt means people will be able to access their medical records from different parts of the NHS through various apps.\nHowever critics are worried that data could be misused and the system has not been properly explained to patients.\nIn defending the plan, the health secretary said more effective use of data would deliver better patient care.\nThe new strategy, called Data Saves Lives, will give patients confidence that health and care staff have up-to-date information enabling them to make quicker, more informed decisions, the government said.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that improving data collection would mean staff spent less time looking for information and more time treating patients.\nPatients will be able to manage appointments, refill medications and speak with health staff when needed via apps, it said.\nMore than two million people use the NHS app, which includes a person's Covid vaccination status and gives access to some services.\n\"The pandemic has taught us we must be bold and the great strides we have made on vaccines and treatments during this time have been made possible by the way we use data,\" Matt Hancock said.\nMr Hancock said the use of dexamethasone to treat Covid had been discovered thanks to the use of data within the NHS and had gone on to save \"over a million lives\" around the world.\n\"The goal here and what I am determined to do, is to have trusted research environments which protect people's privacy whilst also allowing for us to get insights out of the data which saves lives,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nBy Chris Vallance, BBC technology reporter\nThe first three words of the new draft data strategy are \"Data Saves Lives\" - three words we are likely to hear repeated as ministers promote these plans.\nData, we are told, was a vital resource in tackling the pandemic, and now there is an opportunity to build on that momentum.\nFrom the use of algorithms to predict who might be at greater risk from coronavirus, to the use of artificial intelligence to help analyse the brain scans of acute stroke patients, the document lists plenty of examples of what we might gain.  \nThe data resources of the NHS are potentially of huge value to research. But they also paint a rich and comprehensive picture of our lives.\nAnd privacy campaigners are already concerned about what may be buried in the small print.\nAs part of the strategy the DHSC says it will introduce legislation to \"enable the proportionate sharing of data\".\nBut Cori Crider, co-founder of Foxglove, which campaigns to stop abuse of digital technology, said the government took a \"collect it all first and ask questions later\" approach when it came to GP data and said the strategy included potential commercial uses of information.\nShe told the Today programme that GP data was \"possibly the most valuable\" set of health information in the world and called for the DHSC to send a consent form to individuals offering them the chance to opt out.\nMs Crider said that, while there were some positives in the strategy, people should be offered the option to opt out of specific uses of their data while allowing others.\nMr Hancock said he thought consent should be at the heart of the strategy and believed the vast majority of people would be willing to share their data if there was a \"strong mission and purpose\" behind the use of data.\nPhil Booth, of advocacy group MedConfidential, said the draft strategy had not \"changed much\" and many of the ideas were similar to the scrapped Care.data plan from 2014. \nHe said: \"The biggest single issue is trust and unless the government gets this right they are going to collapse trust again.\"\nMr Booth said the doctor-patient relationship was vital and confidentiality was an important part of that. He said if people thought their data was being sold to commercial entities they may not want to tell their doctor some things.\nHe said the government had become \"drunk on data\" during the pandemic - with people more willing to allow their information to be used for medical research. \nBut he suggested two factors which made people less keen to share their data were if it was taken without their permission or if a commercial entity was involved.\nEarlier this month, the creation of a central digital database using GP records in England was pushed back, amid concerns that patients needed more time to understand the system.\nMatthew Gould, chief executive of NHSX - the unit responsible for setting policy for the use of data and technology in the NHS - said patients needed to \"own their data\", have access to it and have confidence on how the NHS was handling it on their behalf.\nThe proposals also include using data to analyse trends in the health of the nation, which the DHSC said could help improve commissioning and planning of services.\nThe DHSC said that the NHS was committed to using data lawfully and holding it securely.\nThe strategy has been published in draft form ahead of engagement with the sector over the summer, the DHSC said."

      "text": "Friends star James Michael Tyler, who played Central Perk waiter Gunther, has said he has stage four prostate cancer.\nIn an interview with NBC's Today show, the 59-year-old revealed he was diagnosed in September 2018 after a routine physical examination.\nThe cancer has since spread to the actor's bones and he can no longer walk. He is undergoing chemotherapy.\n\"Eventually, you know, it's gonna probably get me,\" he told host Craig Melvin.\nSpeaking about his diagnosis, he said: \"I was 56 years old at the time, and they screen for PSA, which is prostate-specific antigen.\n\"That came back at an extraordinarily high number... so I knew immediately when I went online and I saw the results of my blood test and blood work that there was obviously something quite wrong there.\n\"Nearly immediately, my doctor called me and said, 'Hey, I need you to come in tomorrow because I suspect that you may have quite a serious problem with your prostate.'\"\nAfter he missed another test during the pandemic, the cancer spread to his bones, he revealed, and is now at stage four. \"Late stage cancer,\" he confirmed. \"So eventually, you know, it's gonna probably get me.\"\nHe took the opportunity to urge other men to get themselves checked out at their next doctor's appointment. \"There are other options available to men if they catch it before me,\" he said.\nWhile he didn't command the same amount of screen time as the six main Friends characters, Gunther was and remains a popular figure among fans.\nGunther worked as a waiter and manager in the coffee house, Central Perk, and had a crush on Jennifer Anniston's character Rachel throughout the series, who also worked there as a waitress in the show's early seasons.\nHe made a brief appearance on the Friends reunion special last month via Zoom. \"It was the most memorable 10 years of my life, honestly,\" he said of the show.\n\"I could not have imagined just a better experience. All these guys were fantastic and just a joy to work with. It felt very, very special.\"\nSpeaking about not revealing his diagnosis during the reunion, he said: \"I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, and by the way, Gunther has cancer'.\"\nHe added the other cast members knew of his diagnosis. \"David Schwimmer [who played Ross] has corresponded with me via Instagram. The producers are aware, they've been aware for a long time.\"\nTyler appeared on the show throughout its 10-year run and became a viewer favourite thanks to his deadpan delivery.\nHe was reunited with his Friends co-star Matt LeBlanc in 2012 in an episode of the BBC sitcom Episodes, playing an ice hockey coach.\nHis film appearances include in The Disturbance at Dinner, Foreign Correspondents, Motel Blue, and Jason's Big Problem.\nThe Today show displayed photos of Tyler's home life as they interviewed him, including him using a wheelchair, and the actor became emotional as he spoke.\nAsked by the host if he wished he had done anything differently, Tyler replied: \"I would have listened to my wonderful wife - who has been my absolute strength throughout all of this.\n\"I would've gone in earlier and it would've been hopefully caught earlier.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "University of Oxford,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "University of Oxford scientists are trialling giving Ivermectin to people with Covid symptoms to see if it can keep them out of hospital.\nThe Principle study will compare those given the drug to patients receiving the usual NHS care. \nThe drug has become controversial after being promoted for use across Latin America and in South Africa, despite being so far unproven.\nPrevious studies of Ivermectin have generally been small or low quality.\nMost commonly used to treat parasitic infections such as river blindness, spread by flies, Ivermectin has also been shown to kill viruses in petri dishes in the lab - although, at much higher doses than would usually be prescribed to people.\nDr Aurora Baluja, an anaesthesiologist and critical care doctor, said Ivermectin was often being given in parts of the world where there are high incidences of parasitic infections.\nCovid patients who are also fighting a parasitic disease at the same time would be likely to fare worse and that might explains some of its seemingly positive effect.\nThough there have been some early \"promising\" results from small and observational studies, Principle joint chief investigator Prof Richard Hobbs said it would be \"premature\" to recommend Ivermectin for Covid.\nObservational studies look at people already taking the drug, rather than giving it to a group representative of the population. \nSo they fail to account for differences in the types of people who might choose that treatment, and other factors that might have been influencing the spread of the virus at the time.\n'Gold standard'\nAn observational study previously suggested antibiotic Azithromycin might be helping Covid patients - but the Principle study later showed the drug was ineffective.\nTrials such as Principle are seen as the \"gold standard\" because they can be much more sure they are measuring the effects of the drug and not that of other factors.\nDespite the lack of good evidence so far, Ivermectin has been taken up by doctors or by individuals self-medicating in countries including Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, South Africa and the US. \nIn the US, provider SingleCare said 817 prescriptions had been filled for Ivermectin (which can also be used to treat skin conditions such as rosacea) in January and February 2021, compared with 92 in the same period last year.\nDr Stephen Griffin at the University of Leeds said, \"much like hydroxychloroquine before, there has been a considerable amount of off-label use of this drug,\" based mainly on studies of the virus in the lab, not in people. \n\"The danger with such off-label use is that...the use of the drug becomes driven by specific interest group or proponents of non-conventional treatments and becomes politicised,\" he said, adding this trial should provide a \"final answer\" to whether or not Ivermectin should be used to treat coronavirus.\nThe Oxford team said they had selected Ivermectin to be included in the trial because it was \"readily available globally\" and known to be relatively safe (although, like most things, it can be toxic at very high doses). \nOf the six other drugs in the Principle study of Covid treatments to be taken at home, only one - inhaled steroid budesonide - has so far proved effective. \nAlthough, sister project the Recovery trial, of treatments for hospital patients, also discovered another steroid, dexamethasone, could treat Covid, which has been credited with saving more than 20,000 lives in the UK.\nPeople aged 18-64 with an underlying health condition or experiencing breathlessness, and anyone aged 65 or over, can sign up to the Principle study within 14 days of having Covid symptoms or receiving a positive test.

Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "tags": "Sexual health,Women's health",
      "text": "Having a coil fitted should not be traumatic or very painful, say experts.\nTheir comments came after BBC Radio 5 Live's Naga Munchetty shared her experience, prompting many to recount their own stories of painful coil fittings.\nMost people encounter no problems, and no-one should be put off considering this safe and effective contraceptive, medics say. \nBut they say pain relief should be \"part of the discussion\". \nOptions available include a fast-acting anaesthetic spray.\nMunchetty said she felt violated and angry about her fitting a few years ago, which caused her \"excruciating pain\". \nIt resonated with other women who have contacted the BBC with similar stories. \nNaomi (not her real name) is 26 and from London. She went for a coil, or intrauterine device (IUD), fitting a couple of months ago but had to stop the procedure when it became too painful. \n\"I didn't have the coil fitted in the end. \n\"My doctor was very kind and understanding and told me at the beginning we could stop at any point so when the pain became so bad I did ask to stop. However, if she hadn't said that to me before I don't know if I would have felt comfortable asking her to stop.\n\"The clinic had explained the procedure to me and I had taken some paracetamol to help with any discomfort. But I feel like the pain was massively downplayed to me beforehand.\n\"For me, it was quite a big deal and quite traumatising.\"\nShe says it helps knowing that her experience isn't unique. \"I'm very glad to hear that other women have had similar experiences to this because I felt a bit pathetic and a failure afterwards since I couldn't go through with it.\"\nSome women who got in touch described feeling \"shocked\" or \"in agony\" during their IUD fitting, but others said they had had a good experience. \nAnd there was concern that discussing the issue could put women off using what is a very effective, and for many, convenient contraceptive. \nBut\nContraception: Which is most effective?\nWhich method of contraception suits me?\nDr Louise Massey, of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, who also runs a clinic helping women for whom it can be difficult to fit a coil, said: \"There is, understandably going to be some discomfort with the procedure, but it should not be overwhelming. \n\"I ask people to rate their discomfort on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst pain they could ever have. \n\"Most give it a two or three on that scale.\"\nSome people will experience cramping similar or sometimes more intense than menstrual pain. \nDr Massey says the procedure can always be stopped if there is too much pain, discomfort or distress. \n\"It is always an option to abandon it. \n\"It can even be done under general anaesthetic if necessary and appropriate.\"\nDr Hannat Akintomide is a specialty doctor in sexual reproductive health with the Newcastle Upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust. She says for the vast majority of women, getting a coil is not painful or traumatic.\nAnd while offering pain relief or analgesia used to be somewhat hit and miss, the situation has massively improved in recent years, she says. \nShe conducted a study nearly a decade ago with 129 healthcare professionals to raise awareness about the issue. \nAt that time, one-quarter of the practitioners said they routinely used local anaesthetic for IUD insertion. Another quarter said they never, or rarely, offered it. The rest said they did sometimes. \nDr Akintomide said: \"I felt it was appalling that we were not doing something so simple that could improve their experience.\"\nShe says women should discuss any fears and concerns about the procedure with their healthcare provider, who can provide appropriate pain relief or analgesia. \n\"The options available are expanding.\"\nThat includes: \nDr Akintomide says it should be down to personal choice: \"Injectable local anaesthetic, the sound of it for many women, you know, is repulsive. They wouldn't imaging having an injection down below. \n\"But now we also have the local anaesthetic spray and the advantage is it doesn't involve a needle, it's quick acting - for many people it's immediate and, at most, three to five minutes to take effect - so you do have those options.\"\nThe Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health says what clinics offer can vary - some recommend anaesthetic for the procedure while others may not. \nWomen are often advised to take painkillers beforehand.\nFaculty guidelines say medication may ease the process, although there is \"no evidence\" from clinical trials to support the use of topical anaesthetic gels.\n\"Local anaesthetic block administered by cervical injection is not routinely required,\" they say.\nIt should be offered for difficult IUD insertions or removals, the guidelines say.\nLou Brack, head of nursing at Brook, the sexual health and wellbeing service for young people, said: \"It's all about listening and responding to everyone's individual needs. Many people who have an IUD procedure find they don't require pain relief, but we make sure it is available for those who do, so that they can benefit from an IUD without any unnecessary pain and distress.\""

      "text": "Taliban fighters have seized dozens of districts in Afghanistan as they step up attacks during the final withdrawal by foreign troops, the UN has warned.\nThe insurgents have taken more than 50 of 370 districts since May, UN special envoy Deborah Lyons told the Security Council, warning of \"dire scenarios\".\nShe said increased conflict \"means increased insecurity for many other countries, near and far\".\nThe US and Nato are still aiming for a complete troop pullout by 11 September.\nHowever, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the situation remained \"dynamic\" and, although the Taliban gains had not changed the withdrawal, there was still the flexibility to alter its \"pace and scope\".\nThe hardline Islamist group's recent advances were the result of an \"intensified military campaign\", Ms Lyons told the the 15-member UN Security Council in New York.\n\"Those districts that have been taken surround provincial capitals, suggesting that the Taliban are positioning themselves to try and take these capitals once foreign forces are fully withdrawn.\"\nThe Taliban also captured Afghanistan's main border crossing with Tajikistan on Tuesday, officials said. The crossing stands in the northern province of Kunduz, where fighting has escalated in recent days. \nTaliban fighters say they have control of the whole province, with only the provincial capital - also named Kunduz - retained by the government. But the defence ministry in Kabul said Afghan forces had recaptured some districts and operations were ongoing.\nKunduz city is strategically significant, and briefly fell to the insurgents in 2015 and again a year later, before being retaken both times by Nato-backed government forces. \nLocal media report that the Taliban have also seized large quantities of military equipment, and killed, wounded or captured dozens of troops. The group's own casualty figures are unclear. \nAfghan security forces said they would launch a massive offensive shortly to reclaim lost territory.\n\"You will soon witness our advances across the country,\" said spokesman Gen Ajmal Shinwari. \nUS-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in October 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US. \nUS President Joe Biden says the American pullout is now justified as US forces have made sure Afghanistan cannot again become a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West.\nA senior United Nations official warned last year, however, that al-Qaeda was still \"heavily embedded\" within Taliban militants in Afghanistan.\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani says government forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but many believe the withdrawal could cast Afghanistan back into the grip of the Taliban.  \nMr Biden has pledged that the US will continue to support Afghanistan after pulling troops out, but not \"militarily\".  \nWriting in the Washington Post on Tuesday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said his country was willing to be a \"partner for peace in Afghanistan\" with the US, but would not host US bases. \nHe said Pakistan had previously made mistakes by choosing between warring parties in neighbouring Afghanistan, and pledged to work with anyone who enjoyed the confidence of the Afghan people. \nAfghan leaders have long accused Pakistan of supporting the Taliban. The country's co-operation is seen as critical to US withdrawal goals.\nMr Khan said recently that he would \"absolutely not\" allow the CIA into Pakistan to conduct cross-border counter-terrorism missions against al-Qaeda, the Islamic State group or the Taliban."

      "text": "Battered and bruised, the DUP has just stepped out of the ring not sure what just happened.\nThe political heavyweight has staggered through the past seven weeks, taking punches from within and not sure how to hit back.\nFrom the first blow to the last, the party was exposed like never before, and the man who will take the blame threw in the towel last night after a verbal punch-up with party officers.\nEdwin Poots masterminded the plot which brutally removed Arlene Foster but he never recovered from the fallout.\nHe had a plan to oust the leader but not to deal with the aftermath.\nFrom day one, his leadership was unravelling. \nHe was on the back foot scrambling to get a grip of the party he helped fracture.\nHe backed down over Arlene Foster's departure date, insisting first it was a matter for the party then allowing his predecessor to set her own timeline.\nHer long goodbye left him a leader in limbo.\nMrs Foster only left the political stage on Monday and her successor just lasted three days free from her shadow.\nHe spent his three weeks as leader looking over his shoulder, lurching from one internal crisis to another.\nFrom stormy party meetings, councillor resignations, a U-turn on north south meetings, allegations of bullying and the Paisley/Morrison anti-Swann stage show. \nBut the fatal blow to his leadership was self inflicted. \nHe promised to be a listening leader, unlike Arlene Foster he said he would never leave his colleagues without a say in big calls. \nThat pledge disappeared on Thursday as he marched out of the DUP meeting with his colleagues pleading with him to change course. \nHe ignored those voices and missed the damning vote, which sealed his fate. \nAs he stood in the assembly chamber nominating his good friend Paul Givan for first minister, others were busy plotting the final push.\nEdwin Poots had run out of \"critical friends\".\nThose including deputy leader Paula Bradley and minister Michelle McIlveen had switched to the other side. \nThe soft support he relied on to get elected leader was gone.\nSo was he, after a four-hour session of hard talking with party officers. \nNo vote of confidence was needed - Edwin Poots had no way back.\nTeam Poots will say that, unlike Arlene Foster, he was removed without a true democratic process, without a vote of no confidence in his leadership. \nSo now the 21 day Poots' reign is over, what next ?\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson is in the wings waiting to take over. \nIt is likely to be a coronation this time, the party can't risk more blood-letting in a contest.\nThe process will run over the next few weeks and already the wagons have been circled.\nThe DUP mobiles, which were so active in the briefings and counter briefings, are no longer being answered.\nThe party is nursing too many wounds which will need some time to heal.\nThat is why Paul Givan will remain as first minister if, as expected, Sir Jeffrey becomes his new boss.\nIt will be his first act of bridge-building but more importantly it will shore up political stability. \nBut long-term, Sir Jeffrey has already indicated that he plans to lead the party from Stormont and may take the job as first minister. \nReshuffling the other Edwin Poots appointed ministers is much easier and less disruptive but don't expect change to happen quickly.\nParty direction didn't change under Edwin Poots.\nHe wasn't there long enough and his leadership take over was all about personalities and not policies. \nBut his short legacy will help his successor. \nLegislating for Irish language at Stormont is now a battle the next leader will not have to fight.\nIt will go through Westminster in the autumn and although the political noise about that prospect will stay with us, the battle is over. \nBut there are many other challenges waiting for the next DUP leader.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol remains top of the in-tray.\nChanging the protocol and renaming it appears to be the party strategy as outlined by Edwin Poots before his departure. \nHis successor may keep to the same path.\nBut dealing with the Irish Sea border will be the easy part for the new DUP leader.\nTackling the border, which runs so deep down the middle of the DUP, might be harder to scrap."

      "tags": "DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Sir Jeffrey Donaldson",
      "text": "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has appointed its second new leader in just two months.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson was ratified as party leader on 30 June.\nIt comes after Edwin Poots was forced to resign following an internal revolt after just 21 days in the job.\nThat followed the ousting of former First Minister Arlene Foster following an internal revolt.\nBBC News NI explains what the recent developments with the DUP could mean for the future of power-sharing at Stormont.\nThere are several key reasons behind his political downfall.\nMr Poots was elected to lead the party following a contest on 14 May, after he narrowly beat the DUP's Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson by two votes.\nHe was criticised for not mentioning Sir Jeffrey in his acceptance speech and for his role in helping to oust Mrs Foster just weeks earlier.\nAt the ratification of his leadership on 27 May, divisions within the party were publicly and painfully exposed.\nClaims of bullying and intimidation saw some members, opposed to Mr Poots' brand of leadership, resign.\nBut it was not until 17 June that Mr Poots lost his short-lived grip on the party.\nHaving backed an agreement that same day with the government and the DUP's power-sharing partner Sinn F\u00e9in to allow Westminster to pass Irish language legislation in October if Stormont has failed to do so by then, Mr Poots wanted to nominate Paul Givan as the new first minister.\nHowever, most of his assembly team and MPs were hesitant to do so and urged Mr Poots to delay the process.\nAfter a tense meeting of MLAs and MPs, the DUP leader nominated Mr Givan anyway, but he overwhelmingly lost a subsequent vote that would prove the fatal blow to his authority after only 21 days in office.\nA meeting of party officers later that evening confirmed Mr Poots would resign but remain in post until his successor was found.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson is the DUP's fifth leader in its 50-year history.\nSir Jeffrey was ratified as party leader at a meeting of the DUP's central executive committee on 30 June after he was endorsed at a meeting of the electoral college on Saturday 26 June.\nOnly MPs and MLAs form the college and the 130-strong executive is made up of MPs, MLAs, peers and representatives from the party's 17 constituency associations and university groups.\nSir Jeffrey was the only person to submit a nomination paper this time round. \nJust a month since the DUP's first-ever leadership election took place, second time around it was a coronation rather than a contest.\nThe Lagan Valley MP, who shares a constituency office with Mr Poots, had also thrown his hat into the ring during the first leadership campaign.\nParty officers were trying fast-track the process in a bid to bring stability to the DUP.\nSir Jeffrey faced his first challenge just hours after his ratification when North Down DUP MLA Alex Easton announced he was quitting the party after 21 years as a member.\nHe said he was at the \"end of his tether\" and saw no \"respect, discipline or decency\" in the recent behaviour within the DUP.\nInstead of all the attention being focused on his first major speech as DUP leader Sir Jeffrey fielded questions about the one who got away.\nHe has pledged to heal division, for which he accepts some responsibility but there is some distance to go.\nFor now, Paul Givan remains in post.\nHowever, he has been informed by party officers that he will have to resign once a new party leader is in place. It is not clear precisely when that will happen.\nA close friend of Mr Poots, Mr Givan is Northern Ireland's youngest first minister and could become the shortest-serving leader to hold the post.\nIn the first election contest, Sir Jeffrey said that if he became leader he would want to become first minister as well.\nHowever, only MLAs can be first minister and therefore that presents a challenge for Sir Jeffrey, who is an MP.\nNot only would he need a way to return to Stormont through a co-option process, which allows a party to replace an MLA without a by-election, but stepping down from Westminster would trigger a by-election in the Lagan Valley constituency.\nHe has held that seat since 1997 but in 2019's general election the Alliance Party's Sorcha Eastwood narrowed the DUP's majority and some in the party are concerned that it could be difficult to retain this time.\nThen there is the added complication that when Mr Givan resigns it would lead to Michelle O'Neill's removal as deputy first minister and the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in would then have seven days to fill the roles.\nThe posts are a joint office which must have the support of both parties.\nIf they don't nominate within seven days, the Northern Ireland secretary is legally bound to set a date for a fresh assembly election.\nNothing is predictable in Northern Ireland politics right now.\nAhead of Mr Givan being installed as first minister, there was concern that the institutions risked collapse.\nThat led to negotiations between the DUP, Sinn F\u00e9in and the government over Irish language laws, as Sinn F\u00e9in said it would not support Mr Givan's nomination without progress on that.\nSinn Fein's Chris Hazzard previously said his party would not make any new demands during the process to nominate a first and deputy first minister.\nHowever, before Sir Jeffrey's appointment, the Sunday Life reported that he would not nominate a first minister unless there was \"significant change in the plans to bring in Irish language laws\".\nThe new DUP leader will face pressure not to be viewed as having gone into government without making any gains for the party.\nThat could lead to another potential standoff, which would also affect day-to-day governance at Stormont.\nFor example, the power-sharing executive can only meet to take decisions on coronavirus restrictions when a first and deputy first minister are in place.\nFaced with the prospect of fresh instability during a pandemic, events are expected to move at pace.\nIf the past two months are anything to go by, trying to determine how they will play out remains an impossible guessing game."

      "tags": "UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Government borrowing fell in May compared with the same month last year, with the economy in recovery mode after lockdown measures eased.\nBorrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was \u00a324.3bn, official figures show, which was \u00a319.4bn lower than May last year.\nHowever, the figure was the second-highest for May since records began.\nBorrowing has been hitting record levels, with billions being spent on measures such as furlough payments.\nThe huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed government debt up to nearly \u00a32.2 trillion, or about 99.2% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) now estimates that the government borrowed a total of \u00a3299.2bn in the financial year to March. \nWhile that was down by \u00a31.1bn from its previous estimate, it remains the highest level since the end of World War Two.\nThe ONS said the cost of measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic meant that day-to-day spending by the government rose by \u00a3204.2bn to \u00a3942.6bn last year.\nThese figures show how rapidly borrowing can fall, even as the government spends more, not less - and keeps taxes down to help boost the recovery. Because restrictions in May were lighter than the same month a year before, the amount of tax coming in jumped by 15% and central government spending dropped by 12%. \nSo far this financial year, the government is estimated to have spent \u00a353bn more than its income from taxes. While that has meant the second-highest borrowing on record, it's \u00a338bn less than in the same period last year and less than most economists expected. \nThe latest revisions for the year to March 2021 confirm what we already knew - that the government spent more than it has before in peacetime. It is now estimated to have had to borrow \u00a3299bn to plug the gap between its income and its spending in the pandemic's worst year. But it's also worth noting that this is \u00a328bn less than was officially forecast in the Budget. \nWhile debt is high at \u00a32.2 trillion, that's slightly less than the size of the economy (compared to more than twice the size of the economy in World War Two). And the cost of interest on central government debt - \u00a34.3bn in May - is comfortably manageable. As the pandemic restrictions have eased, so too has the pressure on the public finances. \nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said public borrowing was continuing to decline more rapidly than had been expected by the spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\n\"The stronger-than-expected economy meant that central government receipts came in at \u00a356.9bn in May, above the OBR's \u00a355.2bn forecast,\" he pointed out.\n\"Public borrowing will continue to undershoot the OBR's Budget forecast, given that GDP in 2021 likely will be about 3% higher than it expected this year,\" he added.\n\"That windfall will be offset only partially by higher-than-expected interest payments, due to rising RPI inflation, and the likelihood that the government will extend Covid-19 related health spending into next winter.\"\nThomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, agreed that a strong economic recovery was starting to feed through into lower government borrowing.\n\"The trend in tax receipts should continue to improve over the rest of the year, as stronger GDP growth than anticipated by the OBR boosts the public coffers,\" he said.\n\"That means the Chancellor [Rishi Sunak] may be spared having to implement his proposed tax hikes/spending cuts before the 2024 general election.\"\nIn a statement, Mr Sunak said the government was \"continuing to support people and businesses to get back on their feet\" as the country emerged from the pandemic.\nHowever, he added that it was \"also important over the medium term to get the public finances on a sustainable footing\"."

      "text": "Britain is to start negotiations to join a free trade area which could grant businesses access to \"some of the biggest economies of the present and future\", the government has said.\nThe Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is made up of 11 nations, including Australia, Canada and Japan.\nMembership would reduce tariffs on exports such as cars and whisky.\nThe trade area covers a market of around 500 million people.\nNew Zealand, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam are also founder members of the trade agreement, which was established in 2018. The UK applied to join the bloc in January following Brexit.\nInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the trade area was the \"part of the world where Britain's greatest opportunities lie\".\nBeing granted membership would be a \"glittering post-Brexit prize that I want us to seize\", she said.\nMs Truss said membership would help \"farmers, makers and innovators sell to some of the biggest economies of the present and future, but without ceding control over our laws, borders or money\".\nHowever, there has already been a political backlash against the UK's recently agreed free trade deal with Australia. UK farmers say imports from Australia could undercut them on price and undermine welfare standards.\nThe UK is the first non-founding country to apply to join the CPTPP and would be its second biggest economy after Japan, if negotiations succeed.\nThe free trade agreement aims to reduce trade tariffs - a form of border tax - between member countries and includes a promise to eliminate or reduce 95% of charges on traded goods.\nIn return, countries must cooperate on regulations, such as food standards. However, these standards and regulations do not have to be identical, and member countries can strike their own trade deals.\nLiz Truss will start the (virtual) talks on Tuesday to join the 11-strong trans-Pacific trading club, and she'll do so from the very room where Winston Churchill oversaw the War effort. The aim is to showcase post-Brexit ambitions. \nBut it is more about strategy than scale. With deals already in place with eight of the CPTPP members, joining may add as little as 0.1% to the size of the UK economy, and it's not clear yet what the UK will have to concede to get the deal, nor how quickly it will happen.\nThe real boost will come if others sign up to this pact. So far, America under President Joe Biden hasn't expressed an interest to do so - nor, as the trade secretary admitted to me, has it set a date to resume talks on a UK-US bilateral deal, paused earlier this year. \nAs trading partners go, the US is twice as important to the UK as all the CPTPP nations put together.\nMeanwhile, some economists have flagged up that trade with the EU may have been dampened to the tune of several billions of pounds by the new trading arrangements with that bloc, with fresh food particularly hard hit. \nThe Department for International Trade (DFIT) said exports to countries in the Asia-Pacific bloc were set to increase by 65%, around \u00a337bn, between now and 2030.\n\"Joining would boost this growth and support British jobs. These benefits would increase over time, with the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea all having expressed interest in joining,\" a DFIT statement said. "

      "text": "All new road-building projects in Wales are being frozen while the Welsh government conducts a review.\nIt means plans for the Deeside \"Red Route\", the Llandeilo bypass, and a third Anglesey crossing will be put on hold.\nMinisters say it is a necessary part of Wales' effort to reduce carbon emissions.\nBut the Conservatives warned the decision was a \"significant blow\" for the economic recovery.\nMeanwhile Plaid Cymru said the review cannot mean communities \"are left behind\".\nDeputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters announced the review in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday afternoon.\nProjects that already have diggers in the ground, such as the Heads of the Valleys Road, will continue.\nAs part of the plans the Welsh government wants to shift money from new roads to maintaining existing routes and investing in public transport.\nWales is aiming to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. \nBut to get there, Mr Waters said Wales needs to increase emissions cuts in the next decade to double what has been cut in the last 30 years.\nHe told BBC Wales: \"Transport generates something like 17% of all our emissions, so it has to play its part.\n\"If we can hit these climate change targets, that's got to change. That means redirecting investment.\n\"If we carry on going as we're going, we're not going to hit net zero until 2090. At the very latest scientists tell us we have until 2050 to stop this running out of control.\"\nThere was concern about the announcement from business people in Llandeilo, where the bypass had had already been delayed to 2025. \nIt was promised by Welsh Labour ministers as part of a deal with Plaid Cymru to get the 2017-18 budget passed, and would have directed traffic away from the busy main road through the Carmarthenshire town.\nEllen Plowman, who runs Maryellens coffee shop in the town, said: \"The volume of traffic that's coming through Llandeilo at the moment is far too much for the town, it's having an impact on people feeling safe walking through the town.\n\"If the bypass doesn't happen then I think they really should look at changing the weight of the lorries and the size of the noise coming through.\"\nJeweller Mari Thomas said she understood the need for the review \"but I think Llandeilo specifically has a problem with traffic and congestion, and... pollution\".\nShe said it was dangerous for pedestrians.\n\"Public transport will help a lot but I don't think it will solve my problems here,\" she said, saying large lorries should be prevented \"from coming through such a small town when you've got narrow streets\".\nThe Welsh government picked a preferred route for a new Menai crossing in 2018, although a government minister later said the scrapping of the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power plant scheme had weakened its case.\nPlans for the red route dual carriageway in Deeside - which would see the A548 upgraded and a new link built with the A55 to tackle congestion - have sparked opposition for cutting through ancient woodland.\nThe review will be conducted by a yet-to-be-announced external panel.\nBusiness lobby group the CBI warned that commuters were currently preferring private transport over alternatives.\n\"Public transport use in Flintshire is down 47% and down 33% in Carmarthenshire,\" said the CBI's Ian Price. \"This could spell trouble for the local communities of Deeside and Llandeilo if there is no plan to respond to these trends.\n\"The government review should consider what viable alternatives exist for Deeside and Llandeilo that can meet short and long-term pressures.\" \nThe announcement was criticised by Natasha Asghar, transport spokesperson for the Welsh Conservatives: \"At such a delicate economic time, this decision could prove a significant blow for our recovery.  \n\"Many roads across Wales are not fit for purpose and have had a damaging impact on our economic fortunes, environment and public safety. Regular traffic jams deter investment and have contributed to Wales having some of the worst air quality in the UK. \n\"Welsh workers and businesses urgently require more information about the scope of the review and the Welsh Labour Government's long-term intentions for our transport infrastructure.\"\nThere was a mixed response from Plaid Cymru's climate change spokesperson Delyth Jewell.\nShe added: \"This move from the Welsh government, whilst a welcome indication that they are serious about tackling carbon emissions, cannot mean that communities that are long overdue infrastructure investment are left behind. \n\"Communities like Llandeilo, who are understandably angry that this has been announced without consultation, have seen air pollution levels in their town centre rise to higher than the national standards and would benefit from the kind of infrastructure investment that has been promised but continuously delayed for the last six years.\"\nTransport is Wales' third-largest source of the gases driving climate change, according to advisers at the independent Climate Change Committee. \nIn a December 2020 report, the committee said transport emissions fell by 2% between 2016 and 2018 but overall emissions \"have remained virtually flat since 1990\".\nThe Welsh government's new transport strategy - Llwybr Newydd - said Wales' transport emissions \"must be roughly halved between 2020 and 2030 from six to three million tonnes\" of carbon dioxide. \nIt adds: \"Whilst electric vehicles may provide the biggest emissions savings, this is unlikely to be the main source of savings until the late 2020s and possibly later.\"\nNew cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and diesel will not be sold in the UK from 2030. \nSeperately the deputy climate change minister said it would be \"inevitable at some point we're going to have some level of road charging. \n\"As people move to electric cars, they won't be paying tax on fuel,\" Lee Waters said.\n\"So the whole model of how we fund, transport and general taxation is changing and it'll have to be changes to reflect that you pay per mile, rather than just a flat rate as we currently do.\"\nThe Welsh government's strategy says other measures will also be needed, including a target of 30% of the workforce working remotely and an increase in people using public transport, walking and cycling.\nAround 32% of all journeys are currently made by public transport, walking and cycling - the government's target is to increase that share to 45% by 2040.\nWales has seen a huge drop in public transport journeys as a result of the pandemic.\nIn the year to March 2021, 24 million bus journeys were made in Wales - a 73% drop compared to the previous year. \nTransport for Wales also saw an 84% drop in rail passenger journeys in the past financial year - down from 31.8 million in 2019/20 to 5 million in 2020/21.\nFriends of the Earth Cymru has called for a ban on new roads in Wales.\nAsked on the BBC Politics Wales programme recently whether there should be a ban, Climate Change Minister Julie James said: \"It's tempting, isn't it, to say, 'of course we won't build new roads'.\n\"But there are really complex issues here around air quality, what traffic routes people take, how many cars on the road and so on.\""

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Dominic Cummings tried to bypass the usual awarding process and fast-track a \u00a3530,000 government grant at the start of the pandemic, leaked emails suggest.\nIn an email, the PM's ex-top aide told civil servants to \"immediately\" issue the cash with \"no procurement, no lawyers, no meetings, no delay\".\nFurther emails show civil servants had concerns about the timeframe and whether it was in line with the rules.\nThe government said due diligence was followed in awarding the grant.\n\"We take these checks extremely seriously to ensure our contracts deliver results and value for money,\" the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said.\nThe grant was eventually issued to the project Our World in Data, a research project run by a charitable organisation with academics at Oxford University, in four instalments from summer 2020.\nIn response, Mr Cummings wrote on Wednesday on his blog: \"I sent that email because I wanted the problem solved instantly without distracting key people from other aspects of the emergency.\"\n\"I do not regard it as 'damaging' that I tried to throw 'due process' out the window - sticking with 'due process' was killing people,\" he said.\nMr Cummings left his role in Downing Street in November 2020.\nA series of emails detailing discussions of the grant requested by Our World in Data were leaked to the BBC's File on 4, the Guardian and Source Material.\nThey begin with an email sent by the founder of the project, Max Roser, to William Warr, the prime minister's health adviser, who had requested details on the funding it needed.\nThe organisation said it had to retain key members of staff who were generating data on the pandemic. It also wanted to hire extra contractors and needed financial support for the rising costs of servers and technical infrastructure. \nThe request was passed to Health Secretary Matt Hancock and a minute after he received the email he emailed Matthew Gould, the CEO of NHSX - the unit tasked with the NHS' digital transformation - saying he supported the grant.\nAn email from Mr Cummings to Mr Gould followed a couple of hours later, saying: \"Someone please ensure that they have the 530k within 24 hours from now and report back to me it's been sent.\n\"No procurement, no lawyers, no meetings, no delay please - just send immediately.\"\nFurther emails suggested this caused disquiet among the civil servants because of the request to pay out the grant money much faster than was normal.\nThe DHSC's internal guidance, seen by the BBC, says that directly awarding grants without any form of competition is discouraged. But ministers - such as Mr Hancock - have wide-ranging powers to do so.\nThe guidance is also clear that all grants should be subject to a series of timely checks and criteria. It says in some instances grants of more than \u00a3100,000 should be referred to an advice panel in the Cabinet Office.\nThese safeguards are in place to ensure value for money for taxpayers and to guard against corruption.\nThe following day, Mr Gould said his team could meet the request through the DHSC \"and have the money in place by tomorrow\", but it would mean \"waiving the normal grant-giving process\".\n\"I don't want to do anything untoward, but given the secretary of state's and Dom Cumming's strong steer I'd really welcome your help/advice/green light,\" he wrote to a colleague. \nA more junior civil servant responded saying the team needed to make the appropriate checks \"to avoid leaving the accounting officer overly exposed\".\nThen, more than 24 hours later, the same civil servant suggested possible solutions, setting out the minimum criteria that needed to be met if the grant was to be paid.\nBut he wrote: \"Matthew [Gould], I need your help please to progress this to a point where there is enough air cover to justify a decision to proceed.\"\nPeter Smith, a former government commercial director and former senior adviser to the National Audit Office, said the \"air cover\" reference \"means you're doing something that... is going to go down badly with the media or the public so you need to have some backup, some explanation\".\nThe civil servant's final email said: \"I'm sorry I couldn't just 'make this happen', but I share your concern about doing anything untoward.\"\nIn fact, the organisation that had been looking for the money then put the brakes on the application. Our World in Data asked for more time to understand the implications of accepting government money and to consult its trustees.  \nIt went on to receive the grant in instalments and the project said it complied with its own procedures.\nMax Roser, the founder and director of the project, told the BBC a full grant application was submitted on 25 March 2020 and this was followed by an agreement dated 30 April 2020.\n\"I have no way to know the internal processes inside the government,\" he said.\nThe project said its work had added value in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, with its testing and vaccination data web pages receiving about 65 million visitors.\nA Whitehall source told the BBC they had been instructed not to share information about the grant discussion.\n\"In my view that's because it is so damaging to the NHSX: Dominic Cummings, Matt Hancock\u2026 everyone is just being very blatant that due process, and procedures, are being thrown out the window,\" the source said.\nSpeaking after being shown the leaked emails, Mr Smith said it was \"quite clear that processes weren't followed\", saying: \"The attempt was to do it so quickly, clearly there was no time to do a proper due diligence.\"\nHe said senior people had put colleagues in the DHSC \"into a very difficult position\".\n\"So I think it was unethical, immoral, really, and yes, it was an abuse of power.\"\nJolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project, said: \"The government guidance talks about extra safeguards for sums above \u00a3100,000. This was well above \u00a3100,000.\n\"There was no process that I can see before the decision was made to award this very substantial sum.\"\nThe DHSC said: \"Officials carried out due diligence and followed appropriate processes before this grant was awarded.\n\"Every contract agreed by the government with partners has proper due diligence carried out on it.\"\nMr Warr has been contacted for comment.\nReporting by Anna Meisel, Paul Connolly and Emma Harrison"

      "text": "A senior firefighter got lost on a \"nightmare journey\" to a meeting point he had suggested after the Manchester Arena attack, an inquiry has heard.\nAbout 10 minutes after the bombing, Andy Berry chose to meet colleagues at Philips Park Fire Station, three miles away from the arena.\nHis decision meant crews based in the city centre moved away from the arena.\nFirefighters eventually took more than two hours to attend the bombing in May 2017, the public inquiry heard.\nThe drive from Mr Berry's home in the Wigan area to Philips Park would normally take 35 minutes with blue lights on but he was \"significantly hampered\" by a number of roadworks and the trip instead lasted 56 minutes.\nHe arrived at the same time as the final living casualty was being evacuated from the City Room foyer, where Salman Abedi detonated his bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.\nMr Berry agreed when counsel to the inquiry Paul Greaney QC asked him: \"The satnav took you along a number of winding country roads?\"\nMr Greaney also asked: \"You didn't really have the faintest idea where you were?\"\nThe witness said: \"I didn't.\"\nThe barrister went on: \"And you just had to trust in your satnav?\"\nMr Berry said: \"I did.\"\nThe firefighter agreed the circumstances were not \"likely to aid dynamic decision-making\".\nMr Berry was performing the tactical role of duty national inter-agency liaison officer on the night, with responsibilities including giving advice to his commanders and other agencies.\nThe inquiry heard during his journey, he repeatedly tried without success to contact Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) force duty officer, the initial commander of the incident, and also took calls from colleagues as he told them about his \"nightmare journey\".\nMr Greaney said North West Fire Control rang Mr Berry at 22:57 BST, by which time it had been informed that GMP officers were on the scene, along with an ambulance service commander, and that the injuries looked like shrapnel wounds rather than from gunshots, but the information was not passed on to him.\nAsked what he would done then if he had that information, Mr Berry said: \"Well, we would have quite clearly deployed probably straight to the arena, proceeding with caution.\"\nMr Berry also agreed that had he remained at home, where he had access to work logs on his computer, he would have gained earlier situational awareness and again deployed to the scene earlier.\nThe inquiry was told that updates from the scene at about 23:00 from the British Transport Police and the first paramedic to enter the City Room also did not reach Mr Berry.\nMr Greaney put it to Mr Berry that an \"extraordinary feature\" of what went wrong on the night was that he and senior colleagues lacked situational awareness but firefighters waiting on the ground at Philips Park knew what was happening.\nHe said: \"Is it fair to say this is an extraordinary state of affairs that the troops on the ground have situational awareness, that's why they are so desperate to get there, and the bosses don't?\"\nMr Berry replied: \"We were all desperate to get there and all frustrated on the night. That information was never shared with me.\" \nThe inquiry continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Cardboard boxes being stored in people's garages is continuing to cause shortages of the material, the boss of a major packaging company has said.\nMiles Roberts, chief executive of DS Smith, said the firm was working with local councils to improve supplies of cardboard to recycle into new boxes.\nDS Smith, whose largest UK customer is Amazon, used to get bulk supplies from High Street shops and restaurants.\nBut lockdown and a surge in online home delivery has changed the supply chain.\nMr Roberts said: \"We've found that, frankly, all those old cardboard boxes that we need, all that old newspaper that we need to recycle, has actually been stored in people's garages and in their refuse bins.\"\nHe told the BBC's Today programme: \"We've really been working on a local authority by local authority basis to say 'How can we improve the return of that material?' so we can make it into new packaging, get it back out into the supply chain.\"\nCardboard has been in short supply for retailers across the UK since January.\nBefore lockdown, cardboard and other material used by shops could often been seen at the roadside and at storage facilities ready for collection by recycling firms. It meant, said Mr Roberts, that cardboard quickly returned to the supply chain.\nSupermarkets have also experienced shortages of cardboard packing with Asda, Lidl and the Co-op finding they had to switch to, for example, plastic boxes for their eggs. That sparked criticism on social media about their green credentials.\nAsda said there was a \"shortage of the pulp used to make the cardboard boxes\" that was \"affecting all retailers\". It added, though, that its plastic boxes were 100% recyclable.\nWholesale popcorn business Popcorn Shed has had cardboard supply problems since January.\nDirector Sam Feller said the company was not able to get brand-printed corrugated boxes from \"any of its UK suppliers\".\nBefore Covid and Brexit, branded boxes would arrive three or four weeks after the initial order, but now \"delivery dates bear no resemblance to when the order turns up\" Mr Feller said.\nOften the delays have come with a price hike because cardboard box manufacturers say they cannot get the usual material.\n\"We've switched to plain brown stock boxes and are larger too which means more pollution and wastage as a result,\" Mr Feller said.\nRead more on shortages here"

      "tags": "Turkmenistan,Cost of living",
      "text": "The capital of Turkmenistan in Central Asia has been named as the world's most expensive city for foreign workers.\nAshgabat, a city of about one million people, topped a 2021 cost-of-living survey by consultancy firm Mercer.\nThe ranking puts Ashgabat above last year's priciest city, Hong Kong, which was placed second, followed by Beirut in Lebanon and Tokyo in Japan.\nThe annual report ranks 209 cities based on the cost of expenses such as housing, transport and food.\nMercer said it evaluated more than 200 goods and services for the report, which is designed to help companies and governments around the world determine how much they should pay expatriate employees.\nExpatriates, or expats, are people who live or work outside their native countries.\nMost of the cities in Mercer's top 10 are business hubs where economic growth has led to a hike in the price of housing and other living costs.\nBut Ashgabat owes its high ranking to economic woes rather than prosperity, making it an outlier.\nJean-Philippe Sarra of Mercer told AFP news agency that \"high local inflation\" explained Ashgabat's rise to first from second in last year's survey. Inflation is the rate of increase in prices for goods and services over time.\nKnown for its autocratic government and large gas reserves, Turkmenistan has been grappling with a long-running economic crisis that has plunged many citizens into poverty.\nFormerly part of the Soviet Union, the country is highly dependent on natural gas exports to Russia. Given this, Turkmenistan's economic turmoil has been driven, in part, by low gas prices.\nA global slump in energy prices in 2014 pushed up inflation and food prices.\nIn September last year, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the Covid-19 pandemic had \"drastically exacerbated Turkmenistan's pre-existing food crisis\".\n\"Shortages of subsidised food, accelerating since 2016, have worsened, with people waiting hours in line to try to buy more affordable food products, often being turned away empty-handed,\" the report said.\nDespite this, Turkmenistan's government started a major expansion of Ashgabat in May. Long-time President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov pledged to turn the capital into \"one of the most prosperous cities in the world\".\nBy Abdujalil Abdurasulov, BBC News\nThe report is just another illustration of the stark inequalities in Turkmenistan.\nMany citizens in Ashgabat struggle to afford even basic things such as food. It is common for people to queue for hours outside of shops to get hold of bread or flour as food shortages still grip the country.\nBut there is also another Ashgabat - a glitzy capital full of marble buildings. This is the image that state propaganda tries to project in order to convince everyone that Turkmenistan is one of the most prosperous nations in the world.\nMeanwhile, foreign companies have to boost this image if they want to enter the market. For energy giants, they are attracted by one of the largest gas reserves in the world. \nTo access it, some are prepared to follow written and unwritten rules on how to do business in Turkmenistan. This means their staff pay high prices for almost everything - from renting a house to buying food.\nLebanon's capital, Beirut, was a big riser, jumping from 45th a year earlier to 3rd in the 2021 survey.\nMercer attributed this to a number of factors, including the \"political turmoil\" of recent years and the \"severe and extensive economic depression\".\n\"The Covid-19 pandemic and the Port of Beirut explosion [in 2020] have all amplified the economic effects, causing record-high inflation,\" Mercer said.\nThree Swiss cities were in the top 10, including Zurich, which dropped to fifth. \nOf the priciest Chinese cities included, Shanghai climbed one spot to number six while the capital, Beijing, rose to ninth.\nSingapore, an island city-state known for its flourishing financial sector, took seventh place.\nIn the UK, London was placed 18th, edging up by one place from number 19 last year, while Birmingham was ranked at 121, moving up by eight places from 129 in 2020.\nAt the bottom of the list, Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek was ranked as the least expensive city for foreign employees by the survey."

      "text": "For the second time in two months, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson had put his name forward for the DUP leadership but this time he was unopposed.\nThe process has been fast-tracked and, before the end of the month, Sir Jeffrey will become the DUPs fifth leader.\nThat is if all goes according to plan, and nothing about the DUP has been predictable or planned in the past seven weeks.\nWith that in mind, let's explore some potential plotlines safe in the knowledge they may never make it into the final script.\nFast forward to when Sir Jeffrey takes charge of the DUP.\nExpect lots of talk of healing and bridge-building, but also some party reshuffling.\nSir Jeffrey has made it clear he wants to lead the party from Stormont as first minister.\nBut without a planned election before May next year, how might he make that move from Westminster?\nCo-option is the only option - he just needs a vacancy.\nCould that gap open up in Fermanagh if, as expected, Arlene Foster calls time on her Stormont career? Or could we see another departure elsewhere to allow the new leader in?\nWhatever the route, we know the final destination - the first minister's office.\nThat means Paul Givan is now effectively working out his notice in the dream job he only landed last week.\nThat is if he follows the order to resign.\nIf he does, he will go down in history as Northern Ireland's youngest and shortest-serving first minister so far.\nSitting on the same page as the shortest-serving political leader is his good friend Edwin Poots.\nAs for the other ministerial Poots appointees, expect some change but also some reaching out.\nThere are lots of questions to be answered.\nWill Mr Poots be part of that bridge-building and keep his job as agriculture minister?\nWill Paul Frew, as economy minister, be asked to step aside for a Sir Jeffrey loyalist?\nCould we see a return to the executive for ex-Junior Minister Gordon Lyons?\nAs the only declared Sir Jeffrey supporter in the Poots executive team, Junior Minister Gary Middleton could survive the cull.\nMichelle McIlveen may also have strengthened her grip as education minister, having lined up against Mr Poots in Thursday's vote.\nBut the reshuffling won't just be confined to the front bench at Stormont.\nThere will be a space to fill on the green benches at Westminster after the Donaldson departure.\nA by-election in Lagan Valley throws up lots of interesting questions.\nWho will stand for the DUP? Mr Poots or Mr Givan now that their Stormont careers appear to have peaked?\nCould Mrs Foster abandon her plan to quit the party and seek a seat in the House of Commons?\nShe has already declared an interest in a move to Westminster and her popularity is on the rise.\nA plotline too far, maybe.\nBut a by-election in the most divided DUP constituency in Northern Ireland will bring some challenges.\nLagan Valley is home to Team Poots and Team Donaldson.\nThe key players all share the same office building in Lisburn.\nDefending a seat with such deep divisions will not be easy but it will put the respective calls for unity from both camps to the test.\nThe growing challenge from the Alliance Party in Lagan Valley and Ulster Unionists under new management may help to focus DUP minds.\nThat is likely to be Sir Jeffrey's first big electoral test as leader but a more pressing challenge will be uniting a deeply fractured party.\nHe firstly needs to convince the 19 MLAs and MPs who rejected him in the leadership contest that he can heal the wounds and steer the party out of this crisis.\nNo doubt he has his script ready and will be hoping this plot has no more twists and turns.\nBut who really knows how this saga will end?\nWe may have to wait for the box set."

      "text": "US Republicans have torpedoed a Democratic bid to implement nationwide election rules, a cherished priority of President Joe Biden's party.\nThe huge bill - which sought to make it easier for Americans to vote - ended up deadlocked 50-50 along party lines.\nMr Biden said the issue was the \"fight of his presidency\", but some Democrats accuse him of not fighting hard enough.\nAdvocates say the bill would have been the most far-reaching election measure since the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nIt comes as Republican-led states advance proposals - which Mr Biden has depicted as racially discriminatory - to tighten election laws, and as former President Donald Trump, a Republican, continues to peddle unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\nThe Democrats' For the People Act passed the House of Representatives in March in a near party-line vote, with one Democrat joining all Republicans in opposing the bill. \nBut 60 votes are needed in the 100-member Senate to advance most legislation, and the upper chamber is evenly split 50-50 between the two parties.\nVice-President Kamala Harris, who has been assigned by the White House to push election reform, was presiding over the chamber as the bill failed.\n\"The fight's not over,\" she said after the vote.\nThe legislation would have introduced 15 days of early voting, made election day a public holiday, and guaranteed automatic voter registration for anyone with a driver's licence.\nDemocrats said the legislation would have also ensured more transparency for certain campaign contributions and limited partisan influence over the drawing of congressional districts.\nThe president's party argued the nearly 900-page proposal was critical to democracy, and would safeguard voting access for black voters. \nThere was never much doubt that the comprehensive voting rights bill was dead in the Senate. \nA growing number of liberals wanted Joe Biden and his administration to try a little harder to promote the legislation, however.\nEven if the president had made a stronger effort to use the \"bully pulpit\" to tout the benefits of the bill - and Biden did give several speeches on the subject - the chances of shifting any Republican votes was slim. \nWhat the liberals hoped for, however, was that an intensive, ultimately unsuccessful lobbying effort would pave the way for reforming the Senate rules. Then, a simple majority could pass the voting reforms that many Democrats view as essential to blocking Republican state-level efforts to limit voting access.\nWhether that was ever a possibility is debatable. But if it becomes received wisdom for those on Mr Biden's left, it could cause growing dissent in a party that will need unity to accomplish anything substantive in the days ahead.\n\"Are we going to let reactionary state legislatures drag us back into the muck of voter suppression?\" said Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer before the vote. \"Are we going to let the most dishonest president in history continue to poison our democracy from the inside?\" \nBut Republicans said the package was a federal power grab against the authority of individual US states to ensure the integrity of their own elections, designed purely to benefit Democrats.\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said of the Democrats' proposal: \"It's always been a plan to rewrite the ground rules of American politics.\"\nSome Democrats accused Mr Biden of not campaigning for the bill energetically enough.\n\"He's not absent, but he needs to be a lot more vocal and a lot more out front,\" said Jamaal Bowman, a New York congressman, on CNN.\nThe bill's legislative difficulties have reinvigorated Democratic calls for the Senate to take the radical step of eliminating a tactic known as the filibuster, thereby allowing legislation to pass with a simple majority of 51 votes. Democrats themselves used the filibuster to block Republican bills during Mr Trump's presidency.\nBut at least two Democratic senators - Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona - have so far held firm in opposing efforts to do away with the Senate rule. \nIf the filibuster remains intact, a question mark hangs over much of Mr Biden's political agenda.\n\"Abolish the filibuster so we can do the people's work,\" tweeted left-wing Democratic congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusetts, before the vote.

      "text": "Services like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ could face tighter regulation in the UK under government proposals.\nTraditional broadcasters like the BBC and ITV have to comply with regulator Ofcom's code covering issues like harm, offence, accuracy and impartiality. But most streaming platforms do not.\nThe government has announced a review into whether to strengthen the rules.\nMeanwhile, ministers have also confirmed a consultation into whether to privatise Channel 4.\nThe broadcaster is currently funded by adverts but is publicly-owned.\nThe only streaming platform that must currently adhere to Ofcom's broadcasting code is the BBC iPlayer. The regulator can issue fines and suspend licences if the rules are broken.\nSeparate rules regulating incitement to hatred and other \"harmful material\" apply to streaming services with head and editorial offices in the UK - which include Amazon Prime and Disney+, but not Netflix.\nCurrently, the Ofcom website contains a statement explaining that \"Netflix is based in the Netherlands and therefore not within Ofcom's jurisdiction\".\nHowever, some services have introduced their own voluntary procedures - such as Netflix's age ratings partnership with the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). \nIn Wednesday's announcement, the government said there was currently an \"inconsistent, ad-hoc and potentially harmful gap in regulation\".\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the proposed regulation would prevent traditional broadcasters like the BBC from having to \"compete with one hand behind their backs\".\nWriting in The Times, Mr Dowden said UK broadcasters were \"holding their own\", but added: \"Our broadcasters can't do it alone and they certainly can't compete in a digital world while operating under analogue rules.\n\"This summer we will consult on whether it's time to set the same basic rules for video-on-demand services as we do for traditional broadcasters.\" He added that the government hoped to \"level the playing field\".\nLast year, Netflix faced criticism from Mr Dowden over scenes in its hit drama series The Crown which contained historical inaccuracies.\nAccording to Ofcom's latest figures, viewers watched subscription streaming services for one hour 11 minutes per day in April 2020 - double the previous year.\nIn 2019, two in five viewers of streaming services told the Ofcom they could imagine watching no broadcast TV at all in five years' time.\nNetflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ have not commented on the government review, but a Netflix source said the company supported the intentions behind it.\nChanges to streaming regulation and Channel 4's ownership could both be included in a new media law that is expected to be unveiled in a white paper this autumn.\nOn Tuesday, Channel 4 executives warned that privatisation could make it less likely to make shows that are not commercially appealing, whereas the current priority for its programmes is \"not about the bottom line\".\nChief executive Alex Mahon told a committee of MPs: \"We are always, in all the decisions we make, able to put public service before profit.\n\"When you run commercial businesses, by necessity, your priorities change. They have to. And therefore you have to make decisions differently. You have to think about shareholder returns.\"\nSir David Attenborough is among those backing a campaign calling for \"an open and transparent debate\" on the future of public service broadcasting.\nThe 95-year-old is a supporter of the British Broadcasting Challenge campaign, which last month called on the government \"to stop short-sighted political and financial attacks\" on broadcasters.\nCulture minister John Whittingdale, who previously rejected privatisation in 1996, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government \"want to make sure Channel 4 had a long-term successful future\".\n\"For that reason we think it's appropriate to look at the ownership model and see whether or not it wouldn't thrive better if it was able to access the kinds of investment capital which the others are able to put into high quality TV content,\" he said.\nMr Whittingdale compared the network with Channel 5, which he said had enjoyed a higher audience share after it was bought by Viacom in 2014, with more money invested in programming.\n\"That is one of the benefits of having a financially secure owner,\" he said. \"Now, I'm not saying that is necessarily the best way forward [for Channel 4], but it is certainly something which we think the time is right to consider, in order to make sure that Channel 4 does have a secure future.\"\nIn Wednesday's announcement, the government also confirmed it would go ahead with new laws to ensure UK public service broadcasters have a prominent spot on smart TVs and other platforms and devices.

      "text": "John-Russell Barnes has three part-time jobs to help support his mother and sisters. But that's not what makes the 18-year-old from Hastings unusual.\nHe's a white working-class boy who is going to university.\nMore than half a million new students will be heading off to start at universities across the UK this term, with record numbers set to enter despite all the Covid complications.\nBut white males from low-income families are the \"least likely\" group to be going, according to the most recent figures from the Department for Education.\nAmong state school youngsters not on free school meals, 45% go on to higher education by the age of 19. Those more disadvantaged students, eligible for free school meals, have a lower entry rate of 26%.\nBut for \"male, white British, free school meals\" pupils, the figure is 13% - even lower than the year before, and to put it in context, it's below \"looked after\" children who have been in council care and far below those speaking English as a second language. \nThis figure of 13% is stuck in another era compared with the success stories of other groups, such as black students, with 59% progressing to higher education, and 64% of Asian students.\nFor sixth formers in independent schools, 85% make the step forward into higher education.\nThe gap is so wide that the chairman of the House of Commons education select committee, Robert Halfon, says there has almost been a \"taboo\" talking about it.\nBut why are young white males from poorer backgrounds so less likely to go to university? \n\"At the beginning of college a lot of my mates were saying they were going to go to university - and then at the end, they're like 'maybe not,'\" says John-Russell Barnes.\n \"People started to drift off on to different paths.\"\nThat might be a positive alternative, such as an apprenticeship or a good job - but it might also be insecure, temporary work they can pick up in the East Sussex seaside town.\nHe thinks boys are particularly susceptible to short-term incentives, taking the quick cash available and putting off going to university in a way that means it will never really happen.\n\"Whereas I feel girls are probably more mature. They're prepared to just go to uni and not worry about it, whereas men are: 'Oh, you know, I'll see how I am in a couple of years and then maybe I'll go.' And they don't end up going.\"\nAnd in practice it's often easier for men to get better-paid casual labour than women, he says.\nJohn-Russell's own focus has been on studying law, the subject he's going to take at Swansea University after getting the A-level grades he needed at a further education college. He wants it to be a different future from his round of temporary jobs in a bakery, corner shop and pub.\n\"I've always been quite set on it,\" he says, and he's been supported by the Villiers Park trust, a charity which works with bright disadvantaged youngsters trying to get into university.\nHe's been on projects run by Villiers Park, which provide information, advice and opportunities to meet other young people who are thinking about going to university. And for John-Russell, the biggest deciding factor has been seeing university as the route for his ambition to become a lawyer.\nFor those of his friends not going to university, he says it's not necessarily the tuition fees that are the main deterrent, but the lack of certainty about getting a career to make the expense worthwhile.\nThere's also the \"fear of the unknown\", he says, that it's \"intimidating\" to move into something very different and away from home and family, with no guarantee of a good job at the end.\n\"Personally I don't really like change that much. It's like going to a restaurant - I always order the same sort of things, rather than trying something new,\" he says. \nIt's a big step for him - but he's confident that it's the right decision.\nBut why has this group been so often left behind while others have taken big strides in getting into higher education?\nThere is nothing inevitable about deprivation being a barrier. Inner London is the most stellar illustration of this, with 49% of pupils on free meals going on to higher education - and overall numbers of disadvantaged students have been rising.\nWomen have continued to get more places and accelerated further ahead of men - and boys from middle-class families are able to stay on the conveyor belt that takes them seamlessly from school to university.\nAnd the biggest single increase in university entry over the past decade has been among black youngsters, with black African families doing particularly well. For boys on free school meals from black African families, 52% progress to higher education, compared with 24% for black Caribbean boys on free school meals.\nAnne-Marie Canning, chief executive of the Brilliant Club, which campaigns to widen access to university, says there remains a \"real issue\" about the lack of a similar breakthrough for white working-class boys.\n\"We need to be more mature about what diversity means,\" says Ms Canning, a former director of social mobility at King's College London.\nShe says too often projects to engage this demographic have reverted to stereotypes - with links to things like boxing or other sports  which from the outside might seem gritty and male, but which in practice fail to land a punch.\nThere are much deeper issues at play with young white males from \"post-industrial towns\", she suggests.\nThese are places where the confidence, status and identity of communities have been badly dented by changes in jobs and the economy.\nShe points to the \"collapse of local institutions\" - whether it's social clubs, work-based societies, church groups, adult education or trade union organisations, which might once have raised horizons.\n\"Parental attitudes really matter,\" she says - and too often such disadvantaged youngsters thinking about applying to university can suffer badly from \"imposter syndrome\".\nThere is a strong overlapping regional dimension. The areas of England with a high concentration of white disadvantaged youngsters, such as the north-east, east, south-west and coastal towns, are also where university entry rates are lower.\nSir David Bell, vice chancellor of the University of Sunderland, says universities need to think more about how to present courses to their local community - such as showing clear links into employment and appealing to students who want to carry on living at home.\n\"Social mobility too often is thought of as a relatively small number going away to study and never coming back,\" said Sir David, a former head of Ofsted.\nThere have been arguments from the government against getting 50% of young people into university - but in the north-east, where the entry rate for those on free school meals is 21% - he sees this as missing the point.\n\"It's a nice argument to have in the salons of London that too many people are going to university,\" said Sir David.\nBut what's being done to close the gap?\nGraeme Atherton, director of the National Education Opportunities Network, produced research last year revealing that more than half of England's universities had fewer than 5% of poor white students in their intakes.\nInstead of this being a call to arms, he says there has been a \"perfect storm of inaction\".\nHe has carried out research, so far unpublished, which will show that the numbers of universities with targets for disadvantaged white students are going down rather than up - from 27 institutions to four.\nUniversities find this a \"difficult conversation\", he says, and without pressure from policymakers, it's one they often seem to prefer to leave alone.\nThe low entry rate is in some ways easy to explain. Boys get worse exam results than girls, white students are among the lowest achievers and poor pupils tend to do worse than the wealthy.\nWhen those factors are combined, white boys from low-income families have among the lowest exam results and are the least well-equipped to get university places.\nBut Dr Atherton says there are other dimensions.\n\"We use the term social mobility, but it also means you're leaving something behind, physically and culturally,\" he says.\nGoing away to university is a big social departure - and if the rest of the family are ambivalent about its benefits and didn't go themselves, the idea can soon be abandoned.\nEven in terms of qualifications, this group can be facing an uphill struggle. They are disproportionately more likely to be taking BTecs rather than the A-levels that will be the more typical path into higher-ranking universities.\nOnly 2% of white working class boys get into more selective, \"high tariff\" universities.\nMPs warned that delays in BTec grades this summer could have caused even more disruption for students wanting to use the results for university places.\nMary Curnock Cook was previously in charge of Ucas, the admissions system for universities, and she says there has been a reluctance to engage with this issue - which gets left in the \"too difficult to handle box\".\nBut she says it's a \"double discrimination\" if disadvantaged white males not only are under-represented in university, but then have the problem ignored.\nRobert Halfon, whose select committee is investigating the achievement gap for these \"left behind\" young people, says it's important that it's no longer \"swept under the carpet\"."

      "text": "Tinder's signature \"swipe left, swipe right\" approach to match-making is no longer enough to satisfy singles used to lockdown dating, its CEO has said.\nPeople used to match in order to meet in real life, Jim Lanzone told the BBC - but that changed when virtual dating became the norm in lockdowns.\nNow the dating app is shifting towards more \"holistic\" profiles so users can get to know each other better online.\nNew changes reflect their desire to \"swipe possibly\", Mr Lanzone said.\nIn his only UK interview ahead of changes to the app, the 50-year-old boss told the BBC the trend was especially evident among Gen Z users in their late teens and early 20s - who now make up more than half of the app's users.\n\"As we know from the past 15 to 18 months, people have really leaned in to getting to know people virtually, even having relationships virtually, before they take those relationships offline,\" Mr Lanzone said.\n\"The larger trend here is that people on Tinder coming out of Covid... they just want to slow things down and get to know people first a lot more before they decide to match, let alone before they decide to go meet someone offline. \"\nTinder's data suggests the average number of messages sent per day is up 19% compared to before the pandemic - and conversations are 32% longer.\nHalf of Gen Z users have had dates via video chat, and a third did more virtual activities together, the company says.\nChanges being rolled out this week will still give users the option to swipe right on someone else's profile if they like the look of them, and swipe left if they are not interested.\nHowever they will also have \"more tools to show a more multidimensional version of themselves,\" according to Mr Lanzone, who is based in San Francisco and became CEO of Tinder during the pandemic last year.\nThey include the option to add videos to profiles and to search for modes in an \"explore hub\" to tailor the type of profiles shown. For example, users could say they want to find people who have pets or like adventures.\nFor the first time, they will have the option to chat with someone before matching, using a feature that asks them to give their \"hot take\" or opinion on a topic.\nOther dating apps - such as Hinge, which is owned by the same company as Tinder, and Bumble - already ask users to respond to questions as well as posting pictures.\nMr Lanzone said these apps served people looking for \"a serious relationship\" - which is a \"different stage in life\" to people in their 20s who are \"open to a wider range of possibilities\". \nAsked whether Tinder was more of a hook-up app while Hinge was for forming relationships, he said: \"I wouldn't be able to speak to that directly. Different apps, different companies.\"\nTinder's decision to focus more on video comes as TikTok's popularity continues to grow. ByteDance, the Chinese company behind the smash-hit video app, saw its earnings double last year.\nMr Lanzone said members of Gen Z - often categorised as those born between 1997 and 2015 - \"live in video\" and he expected that Gen Z Tinder members would continually update their profiles, rather than sticking with the same set of videos and pictures.\nTinder's data suggests younger users value \"authenticity\" and openness in a partner, with more mentions of mental health and values in their bios during the pandemic - including the words \"anxiety and \"normalize\". \n\"Part of being more authentic is trying to be less of a perfectionist about the thing you're sharing and keeping it updated about what's happening in your life,\" Mr Lanzone said.\nHe insisted that Tinder was not going to become a social media platform, and - unlike rival app Bumble - would not go down the route of helping users form platonic friendships.\nHowever, he said the pandemic had thrown people off the linear dating trajectory which, in principle, involved swiping, matching, meeting for a date, having a relationship and getting married.\n\"First of all it started to lead to things like video chat because you couldn't meet somebody in real life. But then last summer as things started to open up a little bit before the next wave hit, the trend became very quickly not 'let's meet for a drink' but 'let's go hiking',\" he said. \"People were deciding to go for adventures together.\"\nThere is \"a lot more\" to getting to know someone \"than just matching and having a quick chat before you then meet offline,\" he added.\n\"I think it's time that we give people more tools to show a more multidimensional version of themselves.\"\nHas your approach to dating changed during Covid?

      "text": "Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is the only candidate to succeed Edwin Poots as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader.\nEdwin Poots announced his resignation last week after an internal party revolt, leaving the DUP looking for a third leader in a matter of weeks.\nThe crisis has raised questions about the stability of the Stormont assembly and devolution in Northern Ireland.\nSir Jeffrey's name will go forward to the party's electoral college, which is expected to meet on Saturday.\nFollowing that meeting of the party's eight MPs and 27 members of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLAs), the Lagan Valley MP's leadership will have to be ratified at a meeting of the DUP executive, which is set to take place next week. \nHe would become the party's fifth leader in its 50-year history, and its third in 50 days.\nSir Jeffrey said he had the vision \"to unite Northern Ireland and heal the divisions of the past\".\nHe accepted the task was great, but added: \"The overwhelming majority of people who live here want Northern Ireland to keep moving forward.\"\nHe had previously said he would leave his Westminster seat to run for the Stormont assembly so he could be Northern Ireland's first minister as well as his party's leader.\nSuch a move would mean a by-election in his Lagan Valley constituency.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson will need to get his political ducks in a row to find a path from Westminster to Belfast.\nThe clearest way is through the co-option process, which allows a party to replace an assembly member without a by-election, although it remains to be seen which constituency he would target.\nThere is no sign that the two DUP MLAs in his political power-base of Lagan Valley - Paul Givan and Edwin Poots - will be stepping down any time soon.\nThe only obvious vacancy coming up in the near future is in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the political home of Arlene Foster.\nDUP chairman Lord Morrow said mistakes had been made in a difficult few weeks for the party, and called on its members to \"move forward in a spirit of humility and mindful that our focus must be on serving the people\".\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he looked forward to working with Sir Jeffrey and the Stormont executive to \"deliver on the shared interests of all the people of Northern Ireland\".\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin congratulated the soon-to-be DUP leader on Twitter, writing that he had \"worked with Jeffrey over many years in various roles and look forward to working constructively with him in the very important time ahead\".\nSinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald tweeted that she would meet Sir Jeffrey \"early next week\" after they both spoke on Tuesday evening. \nSir Jeffrey has said his first priority was dealing with the post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland, known as the protocol.\nThe mechanism, which was part of the UK-EU Brexit deal, keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, ensuring free trade across the Irish border.\nHowever, it has placed additional restrictions on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, prompting unionists to complain of there being an Irish Sea border.\nOn Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey said he wanted to speak to the prime minister about the protocol as soon as possible, and that he would tell Boris Johnson it was not realistic to expect stability \"when every unionist representative in the devolved institutions opposes the Northern Ireland Protocol\".\n\"The government and those who claim to be protectors of peace and stability must step up and deal with the protocol in a manner which respects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,\" he added.\nThe leadership vacancy arose when Mr Poots resigned after just 21 days in the position he took over from Arlene Foster.\nHe had defeated Sir Jeffrey in the party's first leadership election on 14 May by 19 votes to 17.\nHe quit having lost the support of party colleagues as he pursued a deal with Sinn F\u00e9in and the UK government over provisions for Irish language legislation. \nSinn F\u00e9in had made clear it would only re-nominate Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister if the party secured a guarantee that language legislation agreed in the New Decade New Approach Deal in 2020, which restored power-sharing, would be implemented.\nDue to the power-sharing nature of the Stormont assembly, a refusal by Sinn F\u00e9in to nominate would have crashed the Northern Ireland Executive and prompted a snap election.\nA continued impasse could have led to a suspension of devolution.\nHaving not received the backing of DUP MPs and MLAs over a deal to resolve the issue brokered by Mr Lewis, a majority of them opposed his plans to nominate Paul Givan as first minister in an internal revolt at a party meeting last Thursday. \nMr Poots announced his resignation later that day.\n\"There was a section in the party that struggled to accept that I won the election,\" he told Sky News on Monday.\n\"In terms of the support I received, it didn't come from people that it should have and that's just a reality that everybody knows.\"\nSir Jeffrey, born in Kilkeel, County Down, became politically active as a constituency agent for the South Down MP Enoch Powell (above, left) in the mid-1980s before working as a personal assistant to the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader James Molyneaux.\nAfter James Molyneaux retired as an MP in 1997, Sir Jeffrey was voted as his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, retaining the seat through six subsequent elections.\nHe is a member of the Orange Order and also served as a corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during the Troubles.\nIn 2003, following long-standing opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble, he announced he would leave the UUP, later joining the DUP, along with Arlene Foster and Norah Beare. \nHe was appointed to the Privy Council, a body which advises the monarchy, in 2007 and stood down as an MLA for Lagan Valley in 2010.\nHe was awarded a knighthood in 2016 for political service.\nSir Jeffrey was defeated by 19 votes to 17 in the DUP leadership election to succeed Arlene Foster in May.\nRead more: Who is the man set to be the DUP's new leader?"

      "text": "NHS patients in England will get greater control over their health and social care data under plans set out by the government, Matt Hancock says. \nIt means people will be able to access their medical records from different parts of the NHS through various apps.\nHowever critics are worried that data could be misused and the system has not been properly explained to patients.\nIn defending the plan, the health secretary said more effective use of data would deliver better patient care.\nThe new strategy, called Data Saves Lives, will give patients confidence that health and care staff have up-to-date information enabling them to make quicker, more informed decisions, the government said.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that improving data collection would mean staff spent less time looking for information and more time treating patients.\nPatients will be able to manage appointments, refill medications and speak with health staff when needed via apps, it said.\nMore than two million people use the NHS app, which includes a person's Covid vaccination status and gives access to some services.\n\"The pandemic has taught us we must be bold and the great strides we have made on vaccines and treatments during this time have been made possible by the way we use data,\" Matt Hancock said.\nMr Hancock said the use of dexamethasone to treat Covid had been discovered thanks to the use of data within the NHS and had gone on to save \"over a million lives\" around the world.\n\"The goal here and what I am determined to do, is to have trusted research environments which protect people's privacy whilst also allowing for us to get insights out of the data which saves lives,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nBy Chris Vallance, BBC technology reporter\nThe first three words of the new draft data strategy are \"Data Saves Lives\" - three words we are likely to hear repeated as ministers promote these plans.\nData, we are told, was a vital resource in tackling the pandemic, and now there is an opportunity to build on that momentum.\nFrom the use of algorithms to predict who might be at greater risk from coronavirus, to the use of artificial intelligence to help analyse the brain scans of acute stroke patients, the document lists plenty of examples of what we might gain.  \nThe data resources of the NHS are potentially of huge value to research. But they also paint a rich and comprehensive picture of our lives.\nAnd privacy campaigners are already concerned about what may be buried in the small print.\nAs part of the strategy the DHSC says it will introduce legislation to \"enable the proportionate sharing of data\".\nBut Cori Crider, co-founder of Foxglove, which campaigns to stop abuse of digital technology, said the government took a \"collect it all first and ask questions later\" approach when it came to GP data and said the strategy included potential commercial uses of information.\nShe told the Today programme that GP data was \"possibly the most valuable\" set of health information in the world and called for the DHSC to send a consent form to individuals offering them the chance to opt out.\nMs Crider said that, while there were some positives in the strategy, people should be offered the option to opt out of specific uses of their data while allowing others.\nMr Hancock said he thought consent should be at the heart of the strategy and believed the vast majority of people would be willing to share their data if there was a \"strong mission and purpose\" behind the use of data.\nPhil Booth, of advocacy group MedConfidential, said the draft strategy had not \"changed much\" and many of the ideas were similar to the scrapped Care.data plan from 2014. \nHe said: \"The biggest single issue is trust and unless the government gets this right they are going to collapse trust again.\"\nMr Booth said the doctor-patient relationship was vital and confidentiality was an important part of that. He said if people thought their data was being sold to commercial entities they may not want to tell their doctor some things.\nHe said the government had become \"drunk on data\" during the pandemic - with people more willing to allow their information to be used for medical research. \nBut he suggested two factors which made people less keen to share their data were if it was taken without their permission or if a commercial entity was involved.\nEarlier this month, the creation of a central digital database using GP records in England was pushed back, amid concerns that patients needed more time to understand the system.\nMatthew Gould, chief executive of NHSX - the unit responsible for setting policy for the use of data and technology in the NHS - said patients needed to \"own their data\", have access to it and have confidence on how the NHS was handling it on their behalf.\nThe proposals also include using data to analyse trends in the health of the nation, which the DHSC said could help improve commissioning and planning of services.\nThe DHSC said that the NHS was committed to using data lawfully and holding it securely.\nThe strategy has been published in draft form ahead of engagement with the sector over the summer, the DHSC said."

      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon,Manchester,Salford,Coronavirus pandemic,Andy Burnham",
      "text": "Scotland's first minister has defended the ban on non-essential travel with Manchester and Salford after an angry reaction from the area's mayor.\nGreater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has now written to Nicola Sturgeon asking her to explain the move.\nMs Sturgeon earlier said the decision was a public health measure, based on Covid levels in the area.\nOpposition politicians in Scotland said there had been a lack of consistency and a lack of consultation.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon - who received her second vaccination in Glasgow on Monday - said she had a \"duty\" to keep Scotland as safe as possible.\n\"I have always got on well with Andy Burnham. If he wants a grown-up conversation he only has to pick up the phone,\" she said.\n\"But if, as I suspect might be the case, this is more about getting into a spat with me as part of a some positioning in a Labour leadership contest of the future, then I am not interested.\"\nThe first minister said she was \"confused\" by Mr Burnham's position.\n\"Back in May we imposed travel restrictions on Bolton for exactly the same reasons we are now doing it on Manchester,\" she said.\n\"Andy Burnham is mayor of Bolton as well and he did not raise any of these issues then.\"\nMs Sturgeon said the restrictions would not be enforced differently to previous travel rules, and would be in place \"no longer than is absolutely necessary\".\nMr Burnham acknowledged the first minister has faced \"difficult decisions\" during the pandemic but condemned the fact he was given no advance warning of the travel ban.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: \"The UK government has called me when they were making changes affecting Greater Manchester.  I think the first minister should have extended us the same courtesy.\n\"If Westminster had, without notice, imposed a travel ban on Scotland on Friday, I feel pretty certain in saying the first minister would have expressed publicly her concern in exactly the same way I am doing that on behalf of the people of Greater Manchester.\"  \nMr Burnham's letter to the first minister also asks why residents of Bolton are still subject to a travel ban while residents of Dundee, which he said has a higher case rate, are not. \nIn Dundee the latest seven-day positive test rate per 100,000 population, up to 18 June, was 303.4. On Monday the seven-day figure in Bolton was 257. \nMr Burnham also called on the Scottish government to compensate those who are now out of pocket and described the suggestion he was playing politics as \"fairly insulting\". \nMurdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservatives' spokesman for Covid recovery, said Mr Burnham was \"absolutely correct\" to express concern about the ban and the \"lack of consultation\".\nMr Fraser told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme there was a \"lack of consistency\" in the Scottish government's approach.\n\"We know that the city of Dundee, for example, has case rates very similar to Manchester,\" he said.\n\"So why is there a travel ban being introduced for Scots going to Manchester, but there are no similar restrictions put in, in relation to Dundee?\"\nDundee, which has the highest Covid case rate in Scotland, recorded 487 new cases in the week up to 18 June, according to UK government figures.\nManchester recorded 1,928 cases and Salford 880 in the same period, but the rate per 100,000 people for all three areas is very similar.\nJackie Baillie, deputy leader of Scottish Labour, said people would find the ban hard to understand.\n\"This has just been put in place without any consultation, without any dialogue and without any concern for either the people of Manchester or the tourism industry in Scotland,\" she said.\n\"Are we consistent in saying it's OK to travel in and out of areas of Scotland where the rates of infection are higher than they are in Manchester? That's the inconsistency that people just do not understand.\"\nAre you affected by the ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford? Have you had to change your plans? Please share your stories and pictures with us.\nYou can now get in touch with BBC Scotland on the phone messaging service, WhatsApp. \nTo start using the app, simply download WhatsApp on to your smartphone free from the internet.\nThen add our WhatsApp number +44 7902 704679 to your phone's contact list.\nPlease make sure you read our terms of use and privacy policy.\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney said the provisions that had been put in place were \"consistent\" with approaches taken in the area previously.\nNon-essential travel was banned between Scotland and Bolton in Greater Manchester, and Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, on 24 May.\nMr Burnham said he would be writing to the Scottish government to ask how it would compensate businesses in Manchester who could lose bookings.\nBut Mr Swinney said that would not be \"appropriate\".\nAsked whether similar travel restrictions should be introduced in Dundee, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government would need to look \"very carefully\" at \"localised situations\".\nMother-of-two Renu Bhardwaj had been due to travel to Manchester this weekend.\n\"The children are finishing school in four days and we had plans to go down and meet my family again and enjoy the summer holidays, or make the most of what we can,\" she said.\nThe lifestyle blogger, who moved to Glasgow 13 years ago, used to make regular trips south to visit her relatives before the pandemic.\nShe said she could understand the reasoning behind the decision, but that the timing, so close to the school holidays, was \"the worst for everybody\". \nPolice Scotland said its approach throughout the pandemic remains the same.\nAssistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs said: \"Officers will engage with the public, explain the legislation and encourage compliance, but will not hesitate to use enforcement as a last resort. \n\"The Chief Constable has said publicly on numerous occasions that we will not be routinely stopping vehicles or setting up road blocks, and that will not change.\"\nOn Monday, the UK recorded another 10,633 Covid cases - including 8,766 cases for England and 1,250 for Scotland.\nBoth nations have seen rising seven-day infection rates, with the Scottish rate at 131.7 per 100,000 people and 92.7 per 100,000 people in England on 18 June.\nScotland, which has one of the highest infection rates in Europe but also one of the highest vaccination rates, has paused the lifting of Covid restrictions this summer because of rising cases."

This means that you must have received your first dose before 2 May.\"\nThe Scottish government confirmed an investigation had been launched, although the fault was now said to have been fixed.\nMr Yousaf said: \"We have been made aware of a system error which has led to a number of people being called forward for their second vaccination ahead of the eight-week recommended interval.\n\"If you have received an invitation for a second dose that is less than eight weeks after your first, please don't come to your appointment.\"\nHe added: \"If you are immunosuppressed and have an earlier second dose appointment for clinical reasons, please go along as planned.\n\"It's important to stress that there is no clinical risk associated with receiving the vaccine earlier than eight weeks.\n\"This is the recommended interval because it increases the efficacy of the vaccine and the level of protection.\"\nThe health secretary said anyone with an early appointment should rearrange by phoning Scotland's vaccination helpline or visiting NHS Inform.\nThe announcement came on the day First Minister Nicola Sturgeon received her second vaccine dose.\nMeanwhile, NHS Dumfries and Galloway apologised after hundreds of children who were too young to receive a vaccination received invitation letters.\nImmunisation co-ordinator Dr Nigel Calvert said the health board had \"got a bit ahead of ourselves\" and would contact everyone affected.\nA health board spokesman confirmed more than 800 letters had been sent out in error.\nDr Calvert said they could only vaccinate people who would be 18 or over by 31 July and apologised for the \"misinformation\" issued."

      "title": "Government borrowing eases in May",
      "tags": "UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Government borrowing fell in May compared with the same month last year, with the economy in recovery mode after lockdown measures eased.\nBorrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was \u00a324.3bn, official figures show, which was \u00a319.4bn lower than May last year.\nHowever, the figure was the second-highest for May since records began.\nBorrowing has been hitting record levels, with billions being spent on measures such as furlough payments.\nThe huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed government debt up to nearly \u00a32.2 trillion, or about 99.2% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) now estimates that the government borrowed a total of \u00a3299.2bn in the financial year to March. \nWhile that was down by \u00a31.1bn from its previous estimate, it remains the highest level since the end of World War Two.\nThe ONS said the cost of measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic meant that day-to-day spending by the government rose by \u00a3204.2bn to \u00a3942.6bn last year.\nThese figures show how rapidly borrowing can fall, even as the government spends more, not less - and keeps taxes down to help boost the recovery. Because restrictions in May were lighter than the same month a year before, the amount of tax coming in jumped by 15% and central government spending dropped by 12%. \nSo far this financial year, the government is estimated to have spent \u00a353bn more than its income from taxes. While that has meant the second-highest borrowing on record, it's \u00a338bn less than in the same period last year and less than most economists expected. \nThe latest revisions for the year to March 2021 confirm what we already knew - that the government spent more than it has before in peacetime. It is now estimated to have had to borrow \u00a3299bn to plug the gap between its income and its spending in the pandemic's worst year. But it's also worth noting that this is \u00a328bn less than was officially forecast in the Budget. \nWhile debt is high at \u00a32.2 trillion, that's slightly less than the size of the economy (compared to more than twice the size of the economy in World War Two). And the cost of interest on central government debt - \u00a34.3bn in May - is comfortably manageable. As the pandemic restrictions have eased, so too has the pressure on the public finances. \nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said public borrowing was continuing to decline more rapidly than had been expected by the spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\n\"The stronger-than-expected economy meant that central government receipts came in at \u00a356.9bn in May, above the OBR's \u00a355.2bn forecast,\" he pointed out.\n\"Public borrowing will continue to undershoot the OBR's Budget forecast, given that GDP in 2021 likely will be about 3% higher than it expected this year,\" he added.\n\"That windfall will be offset only partially by higher-than-expected interest payments, due to rising RPI inflation, and the likelihood that the government will extend Covid-19 related health spending into next winter.\"\nThomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, agreed that a strong economic recovery was starting to feed through into lower government borrowing.\n\"The trend in tax receipts should continue to improve over the rest of the year, as stronger GDP growth than anticipated by the OBR boosts the public coffers,\" he said.\n\"That means the Chancellor [Rishi Sunak] may be spared having to implement his proposed tax hikes/spending cuts before the 2024 general election.\"\nIn a statement, Mr Sunak said the government was \"continuing to support people and businesses to get back on their feet\" as the country emerged from the pandemic.\nHowever, he added that it was \"also important over the medium term to get the public finances on a sustainable footing\"."

      "title": "Wimbledon: Fans frustrated as Ticketmaster cancels tickets",
      "text": "Lucy Rayner was jubilant when she managed to buy tickets to Wimbledon's men's final day, but five days later she received an email from Ticketmaster cancelling her purchase.\n\"It was gutting,\" says Lucy. \nShe and her family had unwittingly breached the sales terms, by using the same credit card on more than one transaction.\nThey say the rules were unclear, meaning they've missed out on dream tickets for this year's tournament.\nThey aren't the only ones. Dozens of upset tennis fans have taken to Twitter to complain about tickets that have suddenly been cancelled, several days after they were bought.\nAs for many popular events, there is a rule against buying more than two tickets. But customers say neither the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), nor Ticketmaster the platform which operates the ticket sales, made clear that they would crosscheck use of the same credit card. Both organisations say that the terms and conditions were made quite clear at \"multiple locations\".\nLike many other tennis superfans, Lucy, her sister Holly and her mother Marion, gathered round their laptops last Thursday, ready for the moment when tickets went on sale. They'd had tickets for last year's cancelled tournament and were more eager than ever to get to see this year's.\nThey waited in three separate virtual queues, each using their own MyWimbledon account set up for the purpose. \n\"They'd released three codes on our individual emails,\" says Marion. \n\"They'd asked us to read the pre-purchase ticket information and we had scanned it,\" she adds. \"There was nothing as far as we were aware saying you had to use different credit cards.\" \nWhen they managed to buy first a pair of tickets for number one court on 8 July, then a pair for ladies' finals day, and finally a pair for men's finals day, they were in a hurry to complete each purchase. \nSo they paid with the same card \"just out of convenience, it was handy and we already had it out and because of the time pressure to secure the tickets,\" says Lucy. If they'd been aware of the rule they wouldn't have.\nThere is always strong demand for Wimbledon tickets, but the competition is higher than ever this year as Covid rules mean reduced crowds.  \nAnd many fans are saying they now feel cheated. \nSeveral tweeted that they had made an initial ticket purchase, but then, after waiting in virtual queues, they managed to secure better tickets, so had cancelled the first purchase.\nTheir own cancellations went through, but their subsequent purchases were also later revoked by Ticketmaster, they said, leaving them with no tickets.\nOthers said they had logged in on behalf of relatives, to help them navigate the online system, or because they were out at work, and paid for the tickets as a gift, or because they didn't have access to their relative's credit cards. They later found Ticketmaster had identified the repeated use of their credit card and cancelled the second transaction.\nThe AELTC said: \"Under the AELTC's Conditions of Sale, the purchase of more than two tickets by any one credit card is strictly prohibited. \n\"Regrettably, people who purchased more than two tickets using one credit card were contacted by Ticketmaster to advise that any transactions beyond the purchase limit would be cancelled.\n\"We appreciate the disappointment this will have caused to those affected, but these conditions were clearly stated in multiple locations on the website, and at the 'accept and continue' stage of the ticket purchase.\"\nOne customer highlighted that the AELTC's own terms and conditions, that are over 9,000 words long, don't contain any mention of the rule covering credit card use.\nHowever, Ticketmaster supplied a screenshot of the terms it said customers were shown during the purchase process, which stated \"Please note: There is a ticket limit of two tickets per person and per credit card on this event.\"\nIt said the ticket limit of two per person and per credit card had been a long-standing Wimbledon policy in order to ensure that tickets are as fairly distributed as possible."

      "tags": "Flexible working,Rail travel",
      "text": "The introduction of flexible rail tickets - aimed at a growing number of commuters who only travel to the office two or three days a week - has had a muted response.\nThe Campaign for Better Transport said commuters will be \"disappointed\", while rail expert Tony Miles, of Modern Railways magazine, also had reservations.\nBut Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the new tickets would offer \"greater freedom and choice about how we travel, simpler ticketing and a fairer fare\".\nWe asked regular train travellers for their first impressions.\nSteve Allibone commutes from Worthing to London, where he works in financial services. An annual season ticket from West Worthing to London Bridge costs him \u00a35,168. The flexible season ticket is \u00a3397 for 28 days, or \u00a35,161 annually - meaning he would save \u00a37 annually.\n\"In principle, it was quite a neat solution, but the cost and the pricing is a bit of a joke,\" he says. \nPre-Covid he was commuting five days a week and is currently going in one day a week, which will increase to two days a week after the restrictions ease.\n\"I could in theory save \u00a3400 if I only buy 12 of them, but that would require considerable planning when my weeks off are,\" he explains. When I saw the numbers I was disappointed.\" \nHe is also unimpressed with current service standards, noticing other passengers often having to stand for over an hour. Also, due to the frequency of train delays Mr Allibone was refunded \u00a3100 over the course of a year. \n\"The cost of the tickets has gone up and the quality of the service has gone down,\" he says. \nFor Philippa, a project manager who moved to Bath from close to Stansted, Essex, during the pandemic, the new tickets fail to offer a sufficiently attractive saving.  \nPhilippa, who did not want her surname used, works from home and misses the office. She does, though, have a \"lovely work life balance\".\n\"Before all this I was getting out of bed at 5.30 in the morning, coming back after work and going to bed and doing the same five days a week,\" she adds. \nAt the moment, her company is looking into a hybrid way of working, which would mean a couple of days a week in the office.\n\"I was hoping that I might be able to move to a couple of days a week in the office, enjoy London life and going out and things,\" Philippa explains. \nTo travel only two days out of seven would save Philippa only \u00a317.60 a year, so she is still weighing up other options for reducing costs such as moving back closer to London.\n\"I was secretly hoping for a much better deal,\" she says. \nKate Morgan, a management consultant in financial services, says her commute from Brighton to London, would be about 11% cheaper - \u00a330 a month - with a new flexible ticket.\nHowever, this reduction would be less than the cost of one day ticket, so any additional days required in the office would negate those savings. \"Far from it being good news for commuters, it's pretty appalling,\" she says. \n\"People's point of reference is their annual season ticket, so it's not right for rail companies to compare savings with daily tickets,\" she adds. \nFor Ms Morgan, returning to the office for two days a week is going to cost about the same as it would for five days a week.  \n\"The bit that I'm really disappointed in, is people have been working from home for 18 months and employers are in a difficult position - this really isn't helping that,\" she explains. \n\"It creates a real barrier in the way of that flexible working becoming a reality.\" \nNiall McGregor, from Norwich, commutes to Canary Wharf to work in a bank. Before Covid he commuted twice a week and worked from home on the other days.\n\"When you look at the price per journey, the numbers don't make it sufficiently attractive,\" he explains. \nHis annual season ticket costs \u00a38,884 for unlimited travel, whereas the Greater Anglia flexi ticket from Norwich to London would cost \u00a3682.30 - \u00a38,187 a year - for only eight tickets a month. \n\"It doesn't feel like a massive saving for what you're giving up in terms of travel days,\" he says, because it means he would swap 20 days a month travel for eight days a month travel to save \u00a3697 a year.\n\"The maths of the new flexible season ticket just don't make much sense,\" he adds. \nThe government estimates commuters could save between \u00a360 and \u00a3350 a year on selected journeys. Ministers say it might not be suitable for every commuter, but is tailored to the growing demand for more flexible working patterns.\nThe Department for Transport said: \"Flexible season tickets will offer most 2 and 3 day per week commuters savings against buying daily tickets or traditional seasons.\"\n\"We have always been clear that passengers should consider which product best suits their journey and travel pattern.\"\nAnd with the government planning a complete shake-up of the rail network, with the creation of Great British Railways, these changes could be just the start.\nThe Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators said the rail companies would certainly like to go further in reforming the fares system to help commuters secure the best deal.\nAnd the independent watchdog Transport Focus said the changes would help persuade people to choose rail travel again.\n\"Our research with passengers showed us there was strong demand for a new ticket that suited people who expected to commute less frequently in future,\" the group said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Contact tracing,Travel,Coronavirus vaccines,Travel & leisure industry,Self-isolation,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Plans to ease Covid restrictions in England on 19 July are \"looking good\", the prime minister has said.\nBoris Johnson said that was based on the efficacy of vaccines against identified variants.\nBut he warned there could be a \"rough winter for all sorts of reasons\", including a resurgence of flu.\nIt comes as the health secretary said he hoped to exempt fully vaccinated people from the requirement to isolate for 10 days when contact-traced.\nAsked during on a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire whether he could rule out further lockdowns this winter, Mr Johnson said: \"You can never exclude that there will be some new disease, some new horror that we simply haven't budgeted for, or accounted for.\n\"But looking at where we are, looking at the efficacy of the vaccines against all variants that we can currently see - so Alpha, Delta, the lot of them, Kappa - I think it's looking good for 19 July to be that terminus point.\"\nHis comments came after Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the government's advisory committee on vaccination, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that flu \"could be potentially a bigger problem this winter than Covid.\"\nFlu immunity is likely to have dropped in the population as a result of low prevalence because of lockdowns, and it could come \"back to bite us\", he said.\nMr Johnson said the risk of a \"rough winter\" was \"all the more reason to reduce the number of Covid cases now, give the NHS the breathing space it needs to get on with dealing with all those other pressures, and we are certainly going to be putting in the investment to make sure that they can\".\nMeanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that he hoped to bring in a new approach to self-isolation to reflect the changing situation as the country opens up more and more.\nFor the past two months, a pilot study has been under way in which 40,000 people who have been named as contacts of someone who has tested positive for Covid have been allowed to take daily Covid tests and continue with their lives, rather than having to self-isolate. \n\"We're piloting that now to check that will be effective and it is something that we're working on,\" the health secretary said.\n\"We're not ready to be able to take that step yet. But it's something that I want to see and we will introduce, subject to clinical advice, as soon as it's reasonable to do so.\"\nThe trial is not expected to be completed until later in the summer. \nCurrently, anybody who has been told by NHS Test and Trace that they are a contact of somebody who has tested positive for the virus must self-isolate for 10 days.\nThis means not leaving home at all - even to buy food or medicines, or for exercise.  \nThe rule applies to people regardless of whether they have received a coronavirus jab. \nSo far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two doses of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose.\nMore than one million jabs were booked on Friday and Saturday in England, after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. \nThere have been a further five deaths within 28 days of testing positive in the UK, according to the government's daily figures - and 10,633 new cases.\nThe prime minister said the government was also looking at using daily tests for travellers.\nAsked whether ministers were considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK if they took daily tests, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"When it comes to travel, we'll certainly be looking at that. \n\"But I want to stress this is going to be, whatever happens, a difficult year for travel - there will be hassle, there will be delays, I'm afraid, because the priority has got to be to keep the country safe and to stop the virus coming back in.\"\nCurrently, people arriving in the UK from a country on the government's amber list must quarantine for 10 days - regardless of whether they have had a coronavirus jab.\nHowever, in England an individual may be able to end their quarantine period early if they pay for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was \"cautiously hopeful\" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. \nHe said the government had always committed to regularly review their international travel plan, with the next \"checkpoint\" taking place on 28 June.  \nHe said that the checkpoints would look at whether the \"science would support\" relaxations including people who have received two vaccine doses no longer have to quarantine after returning from certain countries. \nThe original date the government had planned to remove all legal limits on social contact in England was 21 June - but this has been delayed to allow more people to be vaccinated. \nHowever, some restrictions have still been eased. \nThe number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue.\nAnd in Wales, rules are also being lifted slightly, including capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size.\nIn Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictions has been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotland are expected to be extended until mid-July.

      "text": "A UK government project will examine the case for the M4 relief road and upgrades along the A55, according to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.\nMajor road projects in Wales have been the responsibility of Welsh ministers in Cardiff since devolution in 1999.\nBut a Westminster review says there is a strong case for a pan-UK network.\nThe Welsh government said there were \"important\" parts of the review but warned UK ministers not to \"trample over devolution\".\nMr Shapps said he wanted to work with the Welsh government to get both roads - which have suffered from congestion over the years - \"fixed\".\nHe said a \u00a320m scheme off the back of the review - which is looking at a number of transport projects - would look at Wales' two busiest and most congested roads.\nThe Welsh government has previously said the relief road was a matter for Wales. \nThe report looks at rail, road, air and maritime transport, with the review also looking at a ferry link between Holyhead and Northern Ireland.\nMr Shapps denied the UK government wanted to take control of building trunk roads from the Welsh government adding: \"This isn't about powers.\"\n\"There's lots of areas we already work closely together, rail infrastructure for example, which we already work on together,\" he told BBC Wales.\nThe \u00a31.6bn M4 relief road was axed by the Welsh government in 2019 over cost and its impact on the environment following ministers in Wales declaring a climate emergency. \nTo build roads in Wales, the UK government would need to change the laws that govern the country unless it worked with Welsh ministers.\nIt is not clear in the review how a pan-UK network would be implemented and the study is being led by Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy.\nAn interim report says that following conversations with stakeholders \"the review believes that there is a strong strategic case for a new pan-UK transport network\".\nBoth the A55 and the M4 in south-east Wales are identified by the report as being of interest to the review.\nIt says that UK government funding would, like former EU funding for the TransEuropean Network for Transport, \"be used to add to existing funding streams, to enable higher capacity, faster, and more reliable connectivity\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson called for a UK-wide transport strategy in the Telegraph on Tuesday, saying the Welsh Labour government has \"mystifyingly junked\" the M4 relief road after spending \u00a3144m.\nNow, speaking to BBC Wales, Mr Shapps said: \"The A55, people know, gets very choca-bloca if you're trying to get through to Manchester and Liverpool and north Wales.\nThe minister said: \"We've already been speaking to the Welsh government throughout, for example with Ken Skates in Welsh government who broadly welcomes this, and I think everyone's keen to make that connection between England and Wales work a lot more smoothly.\n\"And we know the M4 - there's been a lot of talk about an M4 relief road - or indeed the Welsh government through the Burns review has looked at different solutions to that.\n\"This is really just to say, 'brilliant, let's work together to get them fixed'.\"\nMr Shapps said the review \"says we will primarily look to work with devolved administrations - the Welsh government in this case - to help to build, construct, with assistance where appropriate, and maintain these things\".\nThe transport minister added \"the M4 relief road was the most obvious way\" to deal with congestion.\nThe UK government said it would fund a \u00a320m project to look at a wide-range of projects across the UK that were identified by the review.\nIt will look at rail improvements in south-east Wales, building on ideas from the Welsh government's Burns Commission which proposed spending \u00a3800m on public transport to deal with the bottlenecks on the M4 around Newport, as well as the wider motorway.\nMr Shapps said: \"I'm putting in \u00a320m to kickstart work on some of these projects so we can get to the appropriate answers like what happens to the A55 in north Wales connecting England? \n\"What happens with the M4 - whether the relief road is the right approach or whether some other sort of Burns report type approach - is a question we can answer in the process.\"\nDuring the interview, Mr Shapps said: \"I think I'm right in saying something like a quarter of Welsh people actually work in England.\"\nFigures from Stats Wales showed that in 2019, 98,500 of 1.4m working Welsh residents commute outside of Wales - 6.8%.\nA spokesman for the Welsh government said: \"As a Welsh government we are clear. There are some important areas coming out of this Union Connectivity Review where governments across the UK can and should work collaboratively, respecting each other's powers, to create a stronger transport network.\n\"Today's review recognises the success of transport devolution and highlights the important role the recent Burns recommendations are to addressing issues like congestion on the M4.\n\"But if the UK government simply want to ignore all of that, including the content of their own report, and use this as yet another attempt to trample over the devolution settlement - just as it is with the Levelling Up Fund - then we will get nowhere.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts accused the UK government of seeking to split Wales into north and south, with an obsession that \"all roads lead to London\".\n\"Proper cross-border links are of course needed. But any ambition to improve cross-border transport must prioritise improving transport links within Wales first as an essential foundation for improved cross-border connections.\"\nThe interim report says the review will also look at faster and higher capacity connections for passengers from HS2 to Scotland and north Wales.\nRail upgrades in south-east Wales to Bristol are also being discussed, as well as whether there should be a new ferry route from Holyhead to Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland. \nMeanwhile it is is assessing the feasibility of a bridge or tunnel between Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nPart of the UK government's strategy to \"boost the union\" at the moment is to invest in projects - particularly infrastructure - around the UK, which can then be branded as \"UK government funded\". \nThis review looking at transport links between the four nations appears to be their latest tool to do this. \nAt times some Conservative MPs and figures in UK government have expressed frustration that they hadn't, until a new law passed last year, kept hold of powers as a central UK government to invest in devolved areas like road infrastructure in the nations.\nBut the strategy hasn't always made them popular with the Welsh government who have accused them of trying to ride roughshod over devolved responsibilities. \nSo what's not clear is: what happens if the UK government decide a project like the M4 relief road, which Welsh ministers scrapped, is a solution they want to invest in?"

      "tags": "Child abuse,Revenge porn,NSPCC",
      "text": "Under-18s who want nude pictures or videos of themselves removed from the internet can now report the images through an online tool.\nThe service - from the Internet Watch Foundation and Childline - aims to help children who have been groomed, or whose partners have posted photos of them online.\nThe IWF will examine the images and try and remove them if they break the law.\nIt says the tool is a \"world first\" and could help many worried children.\nThe IWF works to remove child abuse material from the internet. \nThe charity says there are a number of reasons a young person might send nude images or videos without knowing they will be posted online, including grooming and coercion. Some may have also sent images for fun, or to a boyfriend or girlfriend who has since shared them without their consent.\nIn recent years, the IWF says it has noticed more and more of these types of images online that have been created by children themselves. In the first three months of this year, 38,000 self-generated images were reported - double the amount in comparison to the same time last year.\nBut now for the first time, people under the age of 18 who are concerned that a nude photo of them is online - or could potentially end up there - can now flag up the content using the Report Remove tool on the NSPCC's Childline service's website.\nIf a picture or video has already appeared online, they can share the URL and the charity will examine the images. If the pictures break the law, the IWF will work to have them removed. \nAnd if the content has not yet appeared online but a person is worried it might, the charity can create a digital fingerprint for the picture - known as a hash - which will be shared with tech companies and law enforcement around the world to help prevent it from being uploaded and shared.\nYoung people can report the images anonymously, as long as they verify their age, or they can leave their details and get support from Childline.\nAnyone who makes a report should expect to receive feedback on the outcome in one working day.\nThe head of the IWF, Susie Hargreaves, said the tool was a \"world first\" and the new tool \"will give young people the power, and the confidence, to reclaim these images and make sure they do not fall into the wrong hands online\".\n\"Once those images are out there, it can be an incredibly lonely place for victims, and it can seem hopeless,\" she said. \"It can also be frightening, not knowing who may have access to these images.\"\nChildline also said many children in that situation could be feeling extremely worried and unsure on what to do or who to turn to for support.\nIt gave the example of one 14-year-old girl who contacted Childline and said: \"I don't know what to do because this Instagram account keeps posting pictures of me and they keep saying they're going to follow my friends so they can see them too. \n\"It all started after I shared naked pics with someone who I thought was a friend but it turned out to be a fake account. I just feel so hopeless and I don't know how to make it stop.\"\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by these issues, the following organisations may be able to help. For support, children can contact a trained Childline counsellor on 0800 1111 or via 1-2-1 chat online."

      "text": "A charity has launched an inquiry into why women from ethnic minorities are at a higher risk of serious harm or death in pregnancy and childbirth. \nBirthrights says women from ethnic minorities are too often failed by maternity services.\nIts year-long inquiry will gather views from parents, midwives, obstetricians and anti-racism campaigners.\nNHS England says it is working on a new strategy to tackle inequality in maternity and neonatal care services.\nOne of those giving evidence, Tricia Boahene, had concerns her baby might be jaundiced when she left hospital, but felt midwives failed to take her seriously.\n\"We could definitely tell that he was jaundiced and the healthcare professionals just couldn't see it and that is really scary,\" she says.\nEventually, her baby had to return to hospital.\n\"The healthcare professionals really struggled to recognise the jaundice, because my son is darker skinned,\" Tricia says. \n\"I do feel perhaps if he was lighter, even lighter but still black, they may have noticed it a lot sooner.\n\"It definitely felt that they just couldn't see my son, possibly in the way they would their own child, and definitely his skin colour had something to play in that.\n\"I don't think it is necessarily unusual for healthcare professionals to do all that they can to put the mother at ease - you know, 'Don't worry, it's probably not that big a thing of a deal,' -  but it definitely felt that I was not being heard until I really, really had to push.\"\nSabia Kamali says she could have avoided an emergency Caesarean section if her pain had been taken more seriously.\n\"When I said that I needed extra painkillers because gas and air wasn't enough, they were like, 'Oh no, it's normal, we'll come back, it's nothing, women go through that all the time.' \n\"So it's like shunning the idea that you are in pain.\"\nOften not \"very forceful\", Asian women can be overlooked by professionals, Sabia says.\n\"What they tend to do is that they categorise you in say the ethnic box, or the Bangladeshi, the Muslim,\" she says.\n\"They think because you look a certain way, you dress a certain way, they think you don't understand things.\"\nWhile death in pregnancy or childbirth is rare, black women are four times more likely to die during or up to the first six weeks after pregnancy than white women, according to the UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths, published in 2019, which blamed racial discrimination, stereotypes and cultural barriers.\nAnd, according to the Office for National Statistics, about a quarter of women giving birth in England and Wales belong to ethnic minorities.\nResearch suggests they have poorer pregnancy outcomes than white women and poorer experience of maternity care, the ONS says.\nThey tended to access antenatal care later in pregnancy, have fewer antenatal checks and ultrasound scans, less screening and were less likely to receive pain relief in labour. \nBlack African women in particular were more likely to deliver by emergency Caesarean section.\nNHS England chief midwifery officer Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent said: \"The NHS is one of the safest healthcare systems in the world to have a baby and all women who use our maternity services should receive the best care possible - which is why we acted immediately to boost support for pregnant women from ethnic minority backgrounds, when heightened risks first became clear.\n\"We are working on a new strategy to tackle inequality in maternity and neonatal care and have been fast-tracking our continuity of carer programme for women from ethnic-minority backgrounds, which is proven to significantly improve their overall experience of care.\"\nBirthrights chief executive Amy Gibbs said: \"UK law demands everyone has equal access to safe, respectful maternity care but we are failing to safeguard black and brown people's basic rights - to survive childbirth, to be treated with dignity, to have their bodies and choices respected.\"\nShaheen Rahman QC, who will chair the inquiry, said: \"We want to understand the stories behind the statistics, to examine how people can be discriminated against due to their race and to identify ways that this inequity can be redressed.\"\nThe early findings from the Birthrights investigation - supported by law firm Leigh Day - are expected to be published in the autumn, ahead of the full report in February 2022."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Scotland is aiming to remove all of its major legal Covid restrictions in early August, the country's first minister has announced. \nNicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed lockdown easing would be paused for three weeks to allow more time for people to be vaccinated. \nIt means mainland areas will not move to the lowest level zero restrictions until 19 July.\nThe hope is that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August.\nMs Sturgeon said this would allow life in Scotland to return to \"almost complete normality\".\nBut the government will not advise an immediate return to full office working on that date - and people will still be required to wear face masks in some settings. \nScotland recorded 2,167 new cases on Monday - the highest daily total since the peak of the second wave in January - with the country said to have had the highest rate in Europe last week\nThe percentage of Covid-19 tests coming back positive rose to 9.1%, up from 7.2% the previous day, and the deaths of a further four people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded. \nThe UK as a whole recorded 11,625 new cases and 27 deaths in the past 24 hours. \nThe new daily case rate in Scotland is seven times higher than it was in early May and 40% higher than last week, with Ms Sturgeon saying the faster-transmitting Delta variant is \"now dominant\".\nBut the first minister said the vaccination programme was breaking the link between the number of positive cases and the number of people being hospitalised and dying. \nThe government's original \"route map\" out of lockdown would have seen the whole of Scotland move to level zero - the lowest point in the five-tier system of restrictions - from next Monday.\nThis has now been pushed back to 19 July - the same date as measures are planned to be lifted in England.\nIsland communities such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero, with all mainland areas in level one or level two of the country's five-tier system of restrictions.\nSome \"minor\" changes will be phased in sooner - removing staff and suppliers of wedding services from the cap on numbers at services from Monday and allowing live entertainment at receptions, and allowing people from more than one household to help carry a coffin at a funeral.\nThe move to level zero will increase the number of people who are allowed to meet up indoors, cut the requirement for physical distancing indoors from 2m (6.5ft) to 1m (3.2ft), and increase the number of people allowed to attend wedding and funerals to 200.\nMs Sturgeon said this would be a \"significant step back to normality\", but said she wanted to move beyond level zero \"as quickly as it is prudent to do so\".\nShe said the \"major remaining legal restrictions\" could be lifted from 9 August, signalling a \"return to almost complete normality in our day to day lives\".\nMs Sturgeon added: \"We will consider and make a final assessment nearer the time of whether - as we hope - this could include the lifting of the legal requirement to physically distance indoors as well as outdoors.\"\nHowever she warned that some measures, including the use of face coverings in shops and on public transport and \"rigorous and regular hand-washing\" would be needed \"at least for a period\".\nAnd the first minister said there should be \"appropriate phasing\" of the return of workers to offices after 9 August, saying the government would \"encourage continued support for home working where it is possible\".\nThe first minister has always said that Covid restrictions would be driven by the data, not by dates.\nBut Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland can expect to be in level zero from 19 July,  and that all major legal restrictions could be lifted from 9 August.  \nLooking at the raw data, this might seem surprising.  There are 154 new coronavirus cases a day in Scotland per 100,000 people. That's almost twenty more than the daily rate on Boxing Day, when the country went into another lockdown. \nThe difference is the vaccine, which has dramatically reduced the consequences of catching coronavirus. Fewer people are now dying from Covid, down from an average of 31 a day in December to less than 2 a day now. \nThat's why the Scottish government can look forward to a date when it can relax restrictions instead of imposing them. \nThe changes are dependent on case levels being suppressed and targets being hit in the vaccination programme.\nAll adults in Scotland will have had at least one dose of a vaccine by 18 July, with everyone in the 40-49 age group due to have had both doses by a week later. \nBy 20 August, all 30 to 39-year-olds will have had a second dose, with everyone over the age of 18 due to have had two doses by 12 September. \nMs Sturgeon faced questions on her statement from opposition leaders at Holyrood - where MSPs are due to debate an extension of emergency powers into 2022.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed progress with the vaccination programme and that \"we have more of an indication of when we will be free from restrictions\".\nHe pressed Ms Sturgeon for more detail about what measures would continue after 9 August, including whether masks would still be required in offices and schools.\nMs Sturgeon said the legal requirement for physical distancing could be removed at that point, but that in some settings - such as schools - masks may need to be worn for a bit longer.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said \"we must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown\", calling for clearer messaging and protocols around financial support."

      "tags": "Police corruption,Metropolitan Police Service,Daniel Morgan",
      "text": "A private detective who was a prime suspect during inquiries into the murder of Daniel Morgan has denied corruption hampered the police.\nAn independent panel found evidence Jonathan Rees drank in pubs with police officers close to the investigation, even after he became a suspect.\nMr Rees told the BBC he did not consider exchanging information with police officers as being corrupt.\nHe was acquitted of murder in 2011 after the case against him collapsed.\nDaniel Morgan was found dead in a pub car park in South London in 1987. He had been attacked with an axe.\nMr Rees - who in 2000 was convicted in a separate case on charges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice, along with a corrupt police officer - told the BBC he denied involvement in the murder.\nHe said: \"Danny was my friend\", adding that his former business partner's death had caused him \"financial and business grief\".\nDespite four police investigations, there have been no convictions. \nIn its report last week, the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel concluded forms of police corruption had hampered both the murder inquiry, and its own work to investigate the reasons why the case was never solved.\nJonathan Rees and Daniel Morgan ran a small private investigation agency, Southern Investigations, in the 1980s. Mr Rees concentrated on investigations for defence lawyers, while Daniel Morgan specialised as a bailiff and debt collector.\nAccording to the report of the independent panel, police became suspicious after seeing Jonathan Rees's \"extremely nervous\" behaviour on the night of the murder.\nLater an inquest witness claimed he had been told that Mr Rees had paid to have Mr Morgan murdered because the partners had fallen out over the running of the business.\nPolice also considered a series of other possible motives for whoever carried out the murder, including that Mr Morgan might blow the whistle on corrupt police officers, financial pressures, a reprisal from someone he'd collected a debt from, or something in his private life.\nAsked by the BBC if he had killed Daniel Morgan, Mr Rees said: \"No. For what motive?\"\n\"Danny was my friend... he taught me a lot and earned the firm a lot of money. It was a partnership. And so the more he brings in, the more I bring in, the more profits we get to share at the end of the year. And it worked well.\n\"So him dying caused me a massive amount of grief, financially and business-wise, because the partnership ceased to exist.\"\nThe independent panel found \"extensive evidence\" of links between Jonathan Rees, a police officer friend - Metropolitan Police detective sergeant Sid Fillery - and other officers, even after Mr Rees had become a suspect in the murder.\nMr Rees accepts that at the time he regularly drank with serving police officers.\nBut he said: \"Relationships between a journalist or private investigator with officers in the case, and lawyers and barristers exchanging information, I don't see that as corrupt.\n\"It's up to the individual officers and people involved to make sure that they don't break the law, they don't get involved in serious illegal activities.\"\nAsked whether he personally knew any police officers who he regarded as corrupt, he said: \"I've never worked with them.\"\n\"There were some people that I wouldn't cross the road to talk to them,\" he added. \"There were some wrong'uns, that they got themselves involved in things that were totally illegal and wrong.\"\nSo what information was considered by the panel about Mr Rees's relationships with police officers?\nIt found there was past intelligence suggesting that of 19 former police officers associated with Mr Rees, his firm and Mr Fillery, 10 had been convicted of criminal offences and sent to prison. \nAccording to the panel, the offences included:\nOne officer had resigned while under investigation and another had been dismissed for failing to meet standards of honesty and integrity. \nNigel Shepherd, a lawyer representing Mr Rees and Mr Fillery, said the intelligence report was an attempt by police to cover their \"shambolic investigation\" and its claims could not be verified.\nMr Rees said he had employed some police officers who had been suspended for disciplinary reasons, though \"some we couldn't take on because of what they were accused of.\"\nHe insisted they were valuable to his firm as \"experienced investigators\" but \"it doesn't mean we condone anything they did\".\nHowever in 2000, Mr Rees was himself convicted of conspiring to pervert the course of justice with another corrupt officer, Det Con Austin Warnes.\nThey arranged to plant drugs in the car of a young mother and have them discovered by the police. Jonathan Rees was working for her husband during a custody battle.\nMr Rees told the BBC he was innocent of that offence and the conviction was being considered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.\nThe CCRC told us it had rejected his application for an appeal in December.\nThe panel also revealed a Metropolitan Police analysis from 2000 detailing 273 cases where \"journalists were provided with confidential information\" by Mr Rees's company. \nMr Rees told the BBC he had never paid police officers cash, but that he did pay their expenses and bought them drinks and meals. \nMr Rees also dismissed suggestions that his decision to give Mr Fillery a job at Southern Investigations after Morgan's death was part of a plan to fill a \"dead man's shoes\".\nMr Fillery worked on the Met Police's initial investigation into Mr Morgan's murder, and at one point took a witness statement from his friend, Jonathan Rees.\nHe then went on to join Southern Investigations. Mr Rees said this was \"nearly two years\" after Daniel Morgan's murder.\nYet the panel report refers to evidence that Mr Fillery, while he was a detective, told other officers seven months after the murder that he might go and work for Mr Rees, and before taking the job, he worked without pay at the firm.\nThe panel concluded there was evidence indicating Mr Rees had a \"very close and unprofessional relationship with Det Sgt Fillery\". At one point the officer had left a police file in his car.\nThe panel report contains dozens of allegations about or criticisms of Mr Rees. He was sent a long list before it was published. \nBut the panel did not accuse him or anyone else of involvement in Mr Morgan's murder. It is not a court, and that was not its remit. \nMr Rees said the reason the case against him and other defendants had collapsed was not because of police corruption, but because \"there was no evidence against us\".\nAllegations against him came in \"anonymous phone calls, letters, gossip, and vicious rumours\".\nJonathan Rees and his lawyer, Nigel Shepherd, also believe police incompetence is the main reason why Mr Morgan's killer was never found. \nMr Shepherd points to the panel's revelation that 30 years after the murder, a Parker pen - likely to be MrMorgan's - was found in a police store where it had been kept after being recovered from his car.\nMr Rees's statement in 1987 included a suggestion that his business partner had been writing with it as they sat together in a pub, shortly before he was attacked and killed. \nThe pen was not found, casting doubt on this account.\nMr Rees believes police were \"blinkered\", pursuing one line of inquiry, that he was part of a murder conspiracy. \nHe continues to work as a private investigator."

      "text": "\u00a3800m should be invested in public transport to help ease traffic jams on the M4, a report has recommended. \nA commission was set up after Welsh ministers scrapped plans to build a \u00a31.6bn relief road around Newport.\nTo encourage people out of their cars, its report suggested considering a \"workplace parking levy\" and ensuring public transport was \"affordable for all\". \nThe panel was told not to consider plans for another motorway.\nThe M4 around Newport is the fourth most congested stretch of road in the UK.\nThe South East Wales Transport Commission recommended tripling the number of train stations between Cardiff and the River Severn, from three to nine, as well as establishing bus and cycle route networks in Newport.\nIf all the recommendations were acted on, it suggested more than 90% of people in Cardiff and Newport would live \"within one mile of a rail station or rapid bus corridor\". \nThe report recommended better integration and coordination of rail and bus networks and integrated tickets across all services. Services should run every 15 minutes and stations should be more accessible on foot and for cyclists.\nCurrently, common M4 journeys are poorly served by public transport alternatives, it said, with Newport served particularly poorly by rail.\nIt said \"flexible office hubs\" should be established in major towns and cities, in order to support remote working.\nAlthough most M4 journeys cannot be substituted by walking or cycling because of their distance, the report said active travel had \"a key role\". \nThe commission suggested making walking or cycling the \"natural choice\" for the first and last mile of public transport journeys and recommend establishing \"a major cycleway\" linking Cardiff and Newport. \nAlthough travel habits have changed due to Covid-19, the report said those changes \"do not fundamentally alter\" the need for more transport options and claimed the pandemic provided \"an opportunity to prepare significant transport improvements while demand is reduced\".\nA 20% reduction in flow on the M4 would have a significant positive impact on journey times, it said. \nThe commission, chaired by Lord Burns, described its recommendations as \"ambitious yet achievable\".\nIt said its \"fast track\" recommendations - made in a progress update in December 2019 - were \"consistent\" with their final recommendations. \nThis included the introduction of a 50mph average speed control and more lane guidance on the westbound approach to the Brynglas tunnels in Newport.\nThe report said the cost of the recommendations would be between \u00a3600m and \u00a3800m: \nAt peak times, between 3,000 and 5,000 vehicles approach the Brynglas tunnels every hour. \nAlleviating congestion on the M4 by moving commuters and travellers on to public transport would benefit goods and services traffic which are less able to switch to other modes of transport, according to the report. \nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford scrapped plans to build a \u00a31.6bn relief road last year after declaring a climate emergency because of its environmental impact, as well as the effect on the public purse.\nWelsh Secretary Simon Hart said in October the UK government had not ruled out bypassing the Welsh Government to build to road.\nThe commission said in principle it was in favour of road charging, but was not recommending this due to the absence of a UK-wide scheme, but said it should be considered again in future.\nThe UK government said it continued to believe that a relief road remained the \"most viable solution to the ongoing congestion problems\" around Newport.\nA spokesman added: \"The report is welcome and highlights the undoubted necessity for improvements in south Wales' transport infrastructure. \n\"The need to make improvements for people using the road and rail network is why the UK government launched its Union Connectivity Review last month.\""

      "text": "Australia's government has lashed out after a United Nations report claimed it had not done enough to protect the Great Barrier Reef from climate change.\nUN body Unesco said the reef should be put on a list of World Heritage Sites that are \"in danger\" due to the damage it has suffered.\nKey targets on improving water quality had not been met, it said.\nEnvironment minister Sussan Ley said UN experts had reneged on past assurances.\nShe confirmed that Australia planned to challenge the listing, which would take place at a meeting next month, saying: \"Clearly there were politics behind it; clearly those politics have subverted a proper process.\"\nThe World Heritage Committee is a 21-nation group chaired by China, which has had a vexed diplomatic relationship with Canberra in recent years.\n\"Climate change is the single biggest threat to all of the world's reef ecosystems... and there are 83 natural World Heritage properties facing climate change threats so it's not fair to simply single out Australia,\" said Ms Ley.\nEnvironmental groups say the UN's decision highlights Australia's weak climate action, however.\n\"The recommendation from Unesco is clear and unequivocal that the Australian government is not doing enough to protect our greatest natural asset, especially on climate change,\" said Richard Leck, Head of Oceans for the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia.\nThe latest row is part of an ongoing dispute between Unesco and Australia over the status of the iconic site.\nThe reef, stretching for 2,300km (1,400 miles) off Australia's north-east coast, gained World Heritage ranking in 1981 for its \"enormous scientific and intrinsic importance\".\nAfter Unesco first debated its \"in danger\" status in 2017, Canberra committed more than A$3 billion (\u00a31.bn; $2.2bn) to improving the reef's health.\nHowever, several bleaching events on the reef in the past five years have caused widespread loss of coral.\nScientists say the main reason is rising sea temperatures as a result of global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels.\nIn 2019, Australia's own reef authority downgraded the reef's condition from poor to very poor in its five-year update.\nBut Australia remains reluctant to commit to stronger climate action, such as by signing up to a net zero emissions target by 2050.\nThe country, a large exporter of coal and gas, has not updated its climate goals since 2015. Its current emissions reduction target is 26-28% of 2005 levels by 2030.\nThese have been a tough few months for Australia and its climate change policy.\nInternational pressure has been mounting on Scott Morrison's government to pledge net zero emissions by 2050 and the prime minister has time and time again refused to commit - including as recently as last week at the G7 meeting in the UK. \nIn his address to US President Joe Biden's virtual climate conference with global leaders in April, the prime minister said the country will \"get there as soon as we possibly can,\" adding that \"for Australia, it is not a question of if, or even by when, for net-zero but, importantly, how\".\nThat in itself is at the heart of the problem. The \"when\" is as crucial as the \"how\" when it comes to climate change. \nScientists and global leaders say Australia is not doing enough or going fast enough.\nThe Great Barrier Reef row between Unesco and the Australian government is not new, but it will be quite embarrassing if the country's World Heritage Site is downgraded to the \"in danger\" list. \nIt's another reminder that if Australia does not get serious about tackling climate change with clear and decisive measures, this will affect its standing in the world, not just diplomatically and economically but culturally too.  \nIf the reef is downgraded, it will be the first time a natural World Heritage Site has been placed on the \"in danger\" list primarily due to impacts of climate change.\nListing a site as \"in danger\" can help address threats by, for example, unlocking access to funds or publicity.\nBut the recommendation could affect a major tourism destination that creates thousands of jobs in Australia and was worth A$6.4bn prior to the pandemic."

      "tags": "DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Sir Jeffrey Donaldson",
      "text": "Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's self-proclaimed interest in military history could be about to come in handy.  \nHe may have conquered second time around in the fight to become the new party leader, but now the strategising really starts.\nHe will have to devise a battle plan for the next assembly election. \nThere is also the question of how he intends to unite his divided troops over the direction the party should take.\nEven for an experienced politician whose rise through the ranks of unionism has been steady, it will be a tough task.\nHis decision to enlist in a life of politics was influenced initially not by power, but in protest against IRA violence.\nBorn in December 1962, the oldest of five boys and three girls, Jeffrey Donaldson was brought up in rural Kilkeel, County Down. \nHe described his own childhood as being \"shattered\" by the Troubles, most significantly by the murder of his cousin, Samuel Donaldson, a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer.\nHe joined the Orange Order at the age of 16 and the Young Unionist movement soon afterwards, as well as joining the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR).\nHe began working for MP Enoch Powell between 1982 and 1984 after joining the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), later leading election campaigns for him.\nHis own career in frontline politics began in 1985 when he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly to represent the South Down constituency.\nHe entered the failed assembly as its youngest member and later became heavily involved in the unionist movement in the United States, often joining his party's delegations to visit President Bill Clinton in Washington.\nIn 1997, when his boss James Molyneaux retired as the Lagan Valley MP, Jeffrey Donaldson retained the seat comfortably for the Ulster Unionists.\nBut as political negotiations at Stormont moved towards the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement, his reputation as a man of protest remained. \nHe became one of the Ulster Unionist Party's biggest critics of the deal, warning his leader David Trimble against supporting it.\nHe, instead, argued there needed to be clear evidence of the IRA's decommissioning of weapons and disagreed on the reformation of the police, which would eventually see the RUC replaced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\nAlthough he remained part of the UUP's negotiating team, just as the deal was nearing completion, the MP staged a dramatic walkout from the talks.\nHe remained a thorn in the side of Mr Trimble long after the power-sharing executive was formed.\nThe anticipated leadership challenge never came, though the Lagan Valley MP repeatedly refused to get in line behind party policy and supported failed bids by others to oust Mr Trimble from office.\nIt was no surprise that he eventually quit the party in 2003, defecting to the DUP just a month later.\nHe was one of three ex-UUP members to make the move - also among that trio was Arlene Foster.\nIt seemed a perfect fit and he quickly rose through the DUP's chain of command, no longer a figure of protest but a key policymaker within the party.\nAlthough in recent years he has been based at Westminster, he also served as an assembly member (MLA) at Stormont and as a Lisburn councillor for a time, though he stepped down from those two roles when the ban on double-jobbing was introduced. \nIn the 2009 expenses scandal he faced scrutiny along with many other MPs.\nHe later apologised for claiming back the cost of hotel pay-per-view films on his parliamentary expenses, repaying more than \u00a3660 to the Commons' fees office.\nBut his record otherwise has remained unblemished.\nAn ambitious politician, he became the DUP's spokesperson on defence issues in the Commons and the party's chief whip at Westminster in 2015.\nThe following year he became the first member of the DUP to receive a knighthood, as part of the Queen's 90th Birthday Honours list.\nIn June 2017, he found himself at the heart of a major negotiation as the DUP agreed a confidence-and-supply deal with the Conservative Party.\nThe votes of Sir Jeffrey and his nine DUP colleagues were crucial to keeping then-Prime Minister Theresa May in government, after she lost her parliamentary majority.\nHe later became heavily involved in talks with the government as it worked to reach a Brexit deal with the EU. \nHowever, when Boris Johnson entered Downing Street, the DUP's hope that he would deliver an agreement for unionists appeared misguided.\nSir Jeffrey and other DUP politicians spoke out against the Irish Sea border, but were unable to persuade the prime minister to scrap it.\nThey were accused of wasting their influence over the government, which then disappeared entirely once Boris Johnson won a snap general election in December 2019.\nThat election saw the Lagan Valley MP's own performance suffer too.\nHe has been elected to Westminster seven times, almost all of them with an overwhelming majority. \nIn 2019 it fell sharply, with Alliance's Sorcha Eastwood narrowing the gap from 20,000 votes to just over 6,000 - a result few saw coming and one Sir Jeffrey will not want to repeat.\nThe MP has said he wants to be first minister and will not lead remotely from Westminster, but he will need to be co-opted into the assembly.\nThe prospect of a close Westminster by-election is not one the DUP will relish right now.\nThe seasoned politician did not expect to be taking over from Edwin Poots so quickly after they competed against each other.\nControl of the DUP will soon officially be Sir Jeffrey's, but there are massive challenges looming.\nCan he reunite and reform the party, while convincing the electorate he is the right person to lead the DUP and show that his party has much to offer?"

      "text": "A charity which supports young artists is being set up in memory of a teenager who was found dead after being missing for almost a month. \nFrantisek \"Frankie\" Morris, from Llandegfan, Anglesey, disappeared on 2 May after going to a rave in Gwynedd. \nDespite an intensive search, the 18-year-old's body was not found until 3 June in dense woodland near Bangor. \nHis mother Alice Morris has spoken of how she \"feared the worst\" from the moment her son disappeared.\nShe now wants to set up a charitable foundation to support young people like Frankie, who was a keen graffiti artist. \nMs Morris, who now lives in the Czech Republic, travelled to Wales when she heard Frankie was missing.   \nShe said even before she set off, the support from Frankie's friends and the wider community helped her to stay strong at a \"horrendous\" time. \n\"The response was overwhelming. There were so many people messaging me and other members of the family,\" she said.\n\"I just would like to express my sincere and heartfelt thanks because it was just really nice to have such a big response and many people really trying hard to find him. \n\"I feared the worst from the very beginning. Knowing Frankie, this was totally out of character that he would just disappear and wouldn't tell anybody where he was going. \n\"I was glad that his body was found because there are cases when bodies have never been found and it's big trauma for the relatives.  \n\"So in this way I was glad that Frankie's body was found, but obviously it wasn't good news.\" \nFrankie was well known in the community around Bangor and Caernarfon for his graffiti tags, often based on the word \"crazy\".\nA petition has been set up to keep one of these on the old post office in Bangor as a permanent memorial to him. \nMs Morris said: \"The main thing about him was that he was very authentic. There were never any pretentions about him. \n\"He was always very much into things that were outdoors, so he loved being in the countryside.  \n\"He loved things like things like snowboarding and skateboarding, anything to do with physical activity.  \n\"He was interested in drawing, the arts, he loved to draw, he did graffiti.  \n\"His graffiti brings back very happy memories because it's like seeing Frankie himself.   \n\"The graffiti he did that is sprayed on the post office in Bangor - it would be really nice if it's going to be preserved.  \n\"There is a petition that many people have signed, and I guess - for me and for many people as well - it would be nice if it just stayed there.\" \nNorth Wales Police says there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding Frankie Morris's death.  \nA post mortem examination found he died as a result of hanging, and an inquest is due to take place in September. \nMs Morris says she hopes the inquest will give her some answers as to the circumstances surrounding why her son died.  \nFor now, she is focusing on setting up a long-term memorial to him. \n\"Frankie wanted to travel the world in a van, and had some money saved for this dream,\" she said.\n\"I thought that a good way of using this money would be to start a foundation which I am going to call the Frankie Morris Foundation.   \n\"We are just thinking about what is going to be its exact purpose. \n\"But so far, I can say that it's going to be a charity, it is going to be based on Anglesey and the purpose of it will be to support young artists who want to be creative and do art.  \n\"It would be nice if there was a place on Anglesey where artists could meet, do their art and share inspiration with each other.   \n\"My favourite Welsh painter, Kyffin Williams, comes from Anglesey and there is a big legacy left by his work and his connection to the island.   \n\"It would be nice if Frankie could be remembered by something positive and creative - something that would inspire people.\""

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nNicola Sturgeon is expected to confirm a delay to the easing of Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions later, to allow more people to be vaccinated. The first minister has signalled the move to level zero - the lowest in the nation's five-tier system - could be pushed back by three weeks from the scheduled date of 28 June. She's also promised to publish a review of social distancing rules.\nDating app Bumble, on which women are in charge of making the first move, has temporarily closed its offices this week to combat workplace stress, with its 700 staff worldwide told to switch off and focus on themselves. The pandemic has been extremely busy for the company, as lockdown boredom set in and swiping to find a match picked up in popularity, culminating in a 30% year-on-year increase in paid users in the three months to 31 March.\nWhile pupils across Wales are getting provisional A-level, GCSE and AS grades - set by teachers - throughout this month, there are concerns some may be \"in limbo\" for weeks before results are confirmed. University places will not be confirmed until August. Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland says: \"I am particularly concerned about the potential effect of this on... some young people, who may already have fragile wellbeing following this very difficult period.\"\nMore than 9,000 students from lower income backgrounds at Queen's and Ulster universities are to receive an additional \u00a3495 payment for disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. That is on top of a \u00a3500 payment from the Stormont Executive to about 40,000 students across Northern Ireland.\nIt wasn't the worst thing to happen in 2020 but the cancellation of last summer's Love Island due to the pandemic was still keenly felt by many viewers in need of light relief.

      "text": "Rent reductions will make landowners reluctant to let phone masts be put on their property, an MP has warned.\nPlaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts is calling on the UK government to ensure landowners get a fair return to protect mobile connectivity.\nThe 2017 Electronic Communications Code (ECC) allowed telecoms companies to vastly reduce many rents they paid.\nThe UK government said it would legislate to encourage \"collaborative negotiations\".\nEd Bailey, a farmer and chartered surveyor from Llanbedr, near Harlech in Gwynedd, originally agreed a rent of \u00a35,500 a year in 2017 to have a telecoms mast on his land. \nBut after telecoms companies were given more powers in a review of key legislation, the rent offer was reduced to \u00a33.50 a year.\n\"We've been taken advantage of as a family, and obviously it puts doubts into wanting to work with a company again,\" said Mr Bailey. \n\"I think it's created a situation which has actually slowed down digital connectivity.\"\nThe changes to the ECC, the legislation which governs the relationship between mast operators and landowners, were meant to speed up the roll-out of new masts and improve connectivity across the UK, especially the 5G network.\nBut campaign group Protect and Connect say the changes to the code in 2017 have had the opposite effect. \nThe group has called for further changes to the ECC, especially to the method for calculating rent introduced by the 2017 revision which is based on the minimal value of the land. \nIn rural areas this means agricultural land prices, which does not take into account the value of the telecoms equipment that will be located on the land.\nCampaigners say the \"power balance has swung too far\" in favour of the telecoms companies.\nProtect and Connect chairwoman Anna Turley said: \"These changes are having a significant effect on thousands of people who have committed to support better connectivity in this country by having phone masts on their land. \n\"The power balance has swung too far and many ordinary people are finding themselves on the end of aggressive behaviour by these companies as well as losing out financially. \n\"Many are now asking if it's worth hosting the sites at all or are getting bogged down in court. \n\"The worry is that this imbalance of power through the code is hampering better access at the time we need it the most.\"\nMs Turley added that the revised code means landowners' only option is to take the companies to court.\n\"The power is completely in the hands of these companies - who can afford to take on these huge giants with their big legal budgets?\" she asked.\nLiz Saville Roberts, MP for Dwyfor Meirionydd, warned the UK government will struggle to meet network improvement targets.\n\"In a rural area like Dwyfor Meirionydd this really rings alarm bells as to whether we're going to be able to continue to roll out the improvement with mobile connectivity which we so desperately need,\" she said.\n\"If we don't have that in our rural areas, we will be left behind.\"\nThe UK government's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has been consulting on the impact of the revised ECC and is considering further changes. \nA DCMS spokesperson said: \"Our priority is levelling up the country with better mobile coverage and to do so quickly we need fair prices to be agreed for the right to access land and install new equipment. \n\"We are aware of concerns raised about the code and have confirmed we will legislate to encourage fairer, faster and more collaborative negotiations with network operators.\""

      "text": "A large number of poorer countries receiving Covid-19 vaccines through a global sharing scheme do not have enough doses to continue programmes, the World Health Organization has said.\nWHO senior adviser Dr Bruce Aylward said the Covax programme had delivered 90 million doses to 131 countries.\nBut he said this was nowhere near enough to protect populations from a virus still spreading worldwide.\nThe shortages come as some nations in Africa see a third wave of infections.\nOn Monday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called for an end to vaccine hoarding by wealthier countries as his government scrambled to curb a steep rise in cases.\nOn a continental level, only 40 million doses have been administered so far in Africa - less than 2% of the population, Mr Ramaphosa said.\nTo address this, he said his government was working with Covax to create a regional hub to produce more vaccines in South Africa.\nCovax was created last year to ensure Covid-19 doses were made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations.\nLed by the WHO and other international organisations, Covax initially set a target of providing two billion doses worldwide by the end of 2021. \nMost of those are being donated to poorer countries, where Covax hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the populations.\nHowever, the distribution of these vaccines has been hampered by manufacturing delays and supply disruptions, leading to shortages in countries wholly reliant on Covax.\nUganda, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Trinidad and Tobago are just some of the countries that have reported running out of vaccines in recent days.\nAt a WHO briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday, Dr Aylward acknowledged the extent of those shortages in stark terms.\nOf the 80 low-income countries involved in Covax, \"at least half of them do not have sufficient vaccines to be able to sustain their programmes right now,\" Dr Aylward said.\n\"If we look at what we're hearing from countries on a day-to-day basis, well over half of countries have run out of stock and are calling for additional vaccine. But in reality it's probably much higher,\" Dr Aylward said.\nHe said some countries had tried to make alternative arrangements to end shortages, with harsh consequences, such as paying above market value for vaccines.\nAs vaccine supplies come under strain, some wealthier countries with spare doses are leading efforts to step up donations through Covax and other means.\nOn Monday the administration of US President Joe Biden announced how it planned to donate 55 million vaccine doses to countries in need.\nOf those, 41 million would be distributed through Covax, with the remaining 14 million shared with countries deemed to be priorities.\nThese vaccines are not included in the 500 million doses President Biden said the US would donate via Covax. President Biden made that pledge earlier this month at a summit of major economic powers, known as the G7 (Group of Seven).\nTogether, those G7 members committed to donate one billion vaccines to poorer countries over this year.\nBut campaigners criticised the pledge, saying it lacked ambition, was far too slow and showed Western leaders were not serious about tackling the worst public health crisis in a century.\nSome health experts believe it could be months - if not years - before enough people are vaccinated globally to declare an end to the pandemic.\nWhen asked about global need for vaccines on Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said: \"What we have found to be the biggest challenge is not actually the supply, we have plenty of doses to share with the world, but this is a Herculean logistical challenge.\""

Industry body UK Hospitality has said waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand.\nRestaurateur Mr Moore said 800 people applied for a receptionist role in November 2020, but he received just seven responses when he re-advertised for the role three weeks ago, and no-one showed up to an interview.\nHe said higher wages were \"still not getting the eyeballs\" on advertisements.\n\"I don't know anybody who is not looking for a kitchen porter,\" he added.\nMr Moore said Brexit was \"definitely the biggest\" factor behind staff shortages, and he said the \"heartbeat\" of the hospitality industry was \"young kids\" coming from abroad to work in restaurants and bars to gain life experience and new skills.\n\"[The government] don't realise the huge commodity we have that they have excluded us from, that keeps this industry moving more than anything else,\" he said.\nHe said before the pandemic, just three out of his 30-strong workforce were British. His restaurant currently has 12 staff.\nHe said some workers who were furloughed during lockdown had moved back to their home nations and decided not to come back to the UK. \n\"Anecdotally, I have a lot of pals saying they are opening up restaurants and they are expecting their 18 employees to come back and only 12 turn up,\" The Pied \u00e0 Terre founder said.\n\"They don't say anything because they don't want to lose their furlough, so they don't mention anything until the last minute.\"\nMark Agnew, manager of Gylly Beach Cafe in Falmouth, Cornwall, said he will close every Monday and Tuesday due to staffing shortages.\n\"The main reason is a severe lack of trained professional chefs, [and] trained front of house,\" he said.\n\"There seems to be a national crisis that we are now feeling the effects of. Brexit I'm sure is a factor within this. Undoubtedly Covid and the continual lockdown, too.\"\nBefore Brexit a lot of the UK's hospitality workforce was made up of workers from overseas, including from the EU, but hundreds of thousands of foreign workers have left the UK in 2020 and it is unclear whether they will return. \nAccording to UK Hospitality, 1.3m foreign workers left the UK during the pandemic.\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said labour shortages appeared to be a \"perennial problem\" which had been \"aggravated further by many foreign workers not returning to the UK, either because of travel restrictions or their ability to resume work in the UK\".\nItsu boss Julian Metcalfe said the food chain's \"young European chefs\" had \"now sadly all disappeared\" because \"they are not allowed in\".\nMr Metcalfe said there were many reasons for staff shortages, but that Brexit posed a \"long term\" issue.\nMr Moore echoed calls by Mr Metcalfe for the government to grant 18-month or two-year work visas to people wanting to work in hospitality in the UK. \nA government spokesman said it had \"implemented an unprecedented package of measures to support businesses\" during the pandemic and added it was working with UK Hospitality to \"better promote jobs in the sector\".\n\"We want employers to focus on training and investing in our domestic work force, rather than relying on labour from abroad. Employers should focus on getting people in the sector who are benefitting from the furlough scheme back to their roles when restrictions end,\" a statement added."

      "text": "White working class pupils have been failed by decades of neglect in England's education system, a report by MPs says. \nThe Education Select Committee accused the government of a lack of targeted support for disadvantaged white pupils.\nIt says use of the term \"white privilege\", suggesting white pupils are at an advantage, is the \"opposite\" of the reality for poor white pupils.\nThe government says it is committed to making sure no child is left behind.\nThe report warns that white pupils on free school meals underachieve from early years in school through to GCSE, A-levels and university entry, compared with pupils on free meals from other ethnic groups.\nCommittee chairman Robert Halfon said it was a \"major social injustice\" that so little had been done to address this gap in attainment - and accused the government of \"muddled thinking\" in suggesting it could be explained by poverty.\n\"If you think it's about poverty, then it doesn't explain why most other ethnic groups do much better,\" he said.\nPoorer white pupils are falling behind \"every step of the way\", he warned, and with almost a million young people being affected, it could not be \"swept under the carpet\".\nMr Halfon warned against using the term \"white privilege\" in education, saying it was divisive and likely to \"promote disharmony\" and \"pits one group against another\". \nThe committee described white privilege, which has been used in a wider social context, as the idea of \"societal privilege that benefits white people over other ethnic groups\".\nThe committee said that in education \"privilege is the very opposite to what disadvantaged white children\" experience - and questioned whether under equality legislation schools should use that terminology.\nBut a Labour MP on the committee, Kim Johnson, rejected the reference to white privilege as a red herring which was trying to \"stoke the culture war\" and avoid scrutiny of the \"lack of investment\" in schools and local communities.\nThe report highlighted a mix of challenges about the local areas where many poor white pupils lived - and also \"cultural factors\" that could limit how much support they got from their families.\nThese underlying social problems included:\nIn response, the committee proposed more targeted funding and making the education system feel more relevant for these communities.\n\"There's this nagging feeling that it's not for me,\" says 18-year-old Oliver Jones-Lyons, describing the \"suspicions\" about the value of education that he thinks hold back some white working class communities.\nHe has been a pupil on free meals at a school near Newcastle and says there is still a concern about the education system harbouring snobbery and class prejudice, even down to stereotypes about regional accents which \"mark you out as different\".\nThere's an inclination to turn away from exams and instead say \"my dad can get us a job\".\n\"There's a lack of explanation of how education is helping you,\" Oliver says.\nBut he argues \"the biggest barriers to education are outside education\" - in places with limited job opportunities, bad housing, poor public transport and families not able to support their children in school.\nAnd he says that while he describes himself as a \"white working class boy\" he doesn't like the way that the label is being used to \"create more stereotypes\".\n\"It shouldn't be about putting people against each other\" or about \"culture wars\", he says, and rejects the white working class identity being caricatured as being bigoted or narrow minded.\nA better description would be people \"more likely to undersell ourselves\" and to dislike showing off, says Oliver.\nBut his own ambition has been supported by working with the Social Mobility Foundation charity - and he is waiting to see if he gets the A-levels grades needed to get into Oxford University next year. \nThe underachievement is down to a \"poisonous mix of place, family and local culture\", said Chris Zarraga, director of Schools North East, a regional network of head teachers in one of the areas with the biggest concentrations of disadvantaged white pupils.\nHe said it meant tackling the consequences of \"long-term deprivation\", where there might be fifth and sixth generations of workless families.\n\"Schools can't do it alone,\" he said, warning that already the pandemic had seen schools having to cope with feeding and clothing pupils.\n\"We need a cross-party sense of urgency about solving these problems,\" he said.\nMr Zarraga backed the targeted use of pupil premium funding and called for better ways of retaining teaching staff in the most challenging areas.\nThe report argues that vocational routes in education need to be clearly available - showing the connection between qualifications and work.\nThis chimes with the concerns of Kerry, a mother in Mansfield who is thinking about what jobs will be available for her sons, Bailey and Finley, in the years ahead.\nHer own parents stepped from school into factory work, which she says offered secure jobs.\nThe current world of employment seems more precarious, she says.\n\"I don't see good jobs arising, I don't think there's much opportunity out there,\" says Kerry. \"I want them to go to college, then get apprenticeships.\"\nThe aim is \"guaranteed work\" and she is worried about the cost of university. \"As a parent, I wouldn't be able to fund them to go,\" Kerry adds.\nWithout tackling the underachievement of white working class pupils the wider aim of narrowing the attainment gap between rich and poor will fail, warned former Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw\n\"Two thirds of children on free school meals live in these communities. We will never reduce educational inequality unless we urgently address this longstanding issue,\" he said.\nLabour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the MPs' report showed the Conservative Party has \"turned its back on these pupils who need most support, from knowingly underfunded free childcare places in early years to cutting the pupil premium\".\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"This government is focused on levelling up opportunity so that no young person is left behind.\n\"That's why we are providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade,\" added the DfE spokesman, with \u00a33bn in recovery funding and existing plans to increase school budgets.\n\"The pupil premium is expected to increase to more than \u00a32.5bn this year, through which schools can support pupils with extra teaching, academic support or activities like breakfast clubs or educational trips.\""

      "title": "Covid-19: Delay to Scotland easing, and Wembley to admit 60,000 fans",
      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that her government aims to have all legal coronavirus restrictions lifted on 9 August. She told MSPs there would be a delay to the easing of lockdown to allow more people to get their vaccinations. Ms Sturgeon added that the Scottish government would not recommend a widespread return to offices in August and that some settings would still require masks to be worn. The government's original \"route map\" out of lockdown would have seen the whole of Scotland move to level zero from next Monday. That has now been pushed back to 19 July - the same date as restrictions are eased in England.\nThe largest crowds to attend a sporting event in the UK since the pandemic struck will be at Wembley stadium in London for the Euro 2020 semi-finals and final, after the government announced at least 60,000 fans will be allowed in to the games. The increase in capacity is taking place as part of the Events Research Programme. The decision comes as Italy's prime minister had called for London to be stripped of hosting the final due to rising Covid cases. But football's European governing body Uefa said it has \"no plans\" to do so.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed the government is working on a plan where fully vaccinated people could go to countries on the so-called amber travel list and not need to quarantine on their return to England. Mr Hancock said ministers were looking at ways to allow the return of some freedoms for those who had received two jabs, but the plan had not been \"clinically advised yet\". At the moment, anyone returning from a country on the amber list must self-isolate for 10 days.\nA series of emails leaked to the BBC's File on 4 suggest former No 10 aide Dominic Cummings tried to bypass the usual awarding process and fast-track a \u00a3530,000 government grant at the start of the pandemic. In an email, also leaked to the Guardian and Source Material, the PM's ex-top adviser told civil servants to \"immediately\" issue the cash to research project Our World in Data with \"no procurement, no lawyers, no meetings, no delay\". Further emails show civil servants had concerns about the timeframe and whether it was in line with the rules. The government says due diligence was followed in awarding the grant, which was eventually issued in summer 2020 in instalments. \nThe boss of digital dating app Tinder has told the BBC that coronavirus has changed people's approach to match-making, where instead of choosing who they want to meet in real life, users are taking the time to get to know potential dates. Jim Lanzone said people are now having relationships virtually before taking the step of meeting up.  And while the app will maintain the pre-pandemic approach where people would swipe right if they liked the look of someone, Mr Lanzone said changes coming in this week will mean daters can \"show a more multidimensional version of themselves\".\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe government is considering letting people in England who have had both Covid vaccinations avoid quarantine after travelling to amber list destinations - so how can you prove you've had both jabs?\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "Pupils across Wales are getting A-levels, GCSE and AS grades, with concern that some may be \"in limbo\" for weeks before results are confirmed.\nProvisional results are being shared by schools and colleges throughout June after teachers set the grades for their students.\nUniversity places will not be confirmed until after the official A-level results day on 10 August.\nPupils can appeal if they are unhappy with their results.\nArrangements for sharing results are different depending on the school and college - some pupils are receiving emails at home, while others are getting grades face-to-face. \nThere is some concern A-level pupils, especially those who are disappointed with grades, will not get certainty about the next steps until August.\nPupils who have taken vocational qualification will also have to wait for their full set of results.\nThe children's commissioner for Wales has written to Universities UK urging universities to offer \"guidance, support and information\" to pupils who may not have got the grades they need.\nIn the letter, Sally Holland said she fears the two months until results day could feel like \"an uncertain period of limbo\".\n\"I am particularly concerned about the potential effect of this on the wellbeing of some young people, who may already have fragile wellbeing following this very difficult period\", she said.\nLois is 17 and studied her A-levels at Ysgol Gyfun Gwynllyw in Pontypool, Torfaen.\nThe teenager has already had her interim A-Level results and plans to appeal one of her grades. \n\"I feel like it's new for everybody. Even though everything's a bit on the rocks, it's new for everyone,\" she said.\n\"I'm in a good position really. I don't mind waiting because my teachers have helped me through it and I know they're going to make sure I come out with the best grade I can.\"\nMali is 18 and an A-Level student in Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy in Llanrwst.  \nShe has the grades she needs to study chemistry in university, but still has to wait for confirmation in August. \n\"A few of my friends are a little bit disappointed with one or two of their grades so they're going to go through the appeals process,\" she explained.\n\"It's quite difficult to know whether to celebrate or not at the moment because these are only provisional grades and it's difficult to know whether they'll change or not for my friends who are waiting for the appeals process.\"\nUniversities UK said it recognised the challenges for students this year and \"stand ready to support students in Wales over the summer in the lead up to results day in August and beyond.\"\n\"Universities UK is working with other higher education bodies to ensure that students and parents understand what provisional results will mean for them and will tailor their support for students accordingly.\"\nCollege Merthyr Tydfil has been holding a \"future pathways\" event to support students with the next steps, after Centre Determined Grades (CDGs) were shared via email.\nIt includes workshops involving employers and universities and key information about university admissions and the clearing process.\nChris Ford, director of learning at the college, said \"learner wellbeing\" had to be at the heart of everything.\n\"The Centre Determined Grades are provisional and that places our learners in a state of limbo if you like until they receive confirmation from the awarding body on 10 August,\" Mr Ford said.\n\"So what we've tried to do is to keep learners engaged and focused on the next steps of their educational journey by providing a transitional programme.\n\"What we're trying to do is to reduce some of those anxiety levels for learners and provide them with some reassurance.\"\nSeventeen-year-old Niamh, from Merthyr Tydfil, has received her provisional AS grades.\n\"Obviously this year has been weird but it's nice to have an idea of what you've got even though they still are provisional and they're not definite.\"\nShe said it was still \"the same sort of adrenaline\" opening the email with her grades.\nShe has a year to go but, she says there is \"a lot of stress and anxiety\" for those waiting for confirmation of university places.\nJoseph, 17, is also at the end of the first year of A-levels and is pleased to get some \"clarity on the standard of working\" through provisional results.\n\"It's a different way to get them, obviously - on the email, not a letter and coming in and they are still provisional. But I'm confident that what I've got, I've earnt it and deserved it.\"\n\"Because it's not set in stone, it's hard to really celebrate until I've got them on paper... it's not 100% yet.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccine passports,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Ministers are \"working on\" plans for quarantine-free travel from amber list countries for people who are fully vaccinated, Matt Hancock has said.\nHe said the plans for England had not been \"clinically advised yet\".\nBut the health secretary said the government was looking at plans to allow the vaccine to \"bring back\" some freedoms.\nCurrently travellers arriving from countries on the red or amber travel lists have to isolate for 10 days.\nAsked on Sky News if the measure could be in place as soon as August, Mr Hancock said: \"We'll get there when it's safe to do so.\"\nInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine she would not speculate about what was going to happen in terms of travel, but said the government was looking at what it could do to \"ease up requirements where it makes sense\".\nShe said: \"We're not ready to make an announcement yet, but fundamentally what we need to do is - while keeping people safe - making sure we're freeing up the rules as much as we can.\"\nResponding to Mr Hancock's comments, Green MP Caroline Lucas, vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said scrapping quarantine measures would be \"reckless\" and called for the government to focus on upgrading systems at airports.\n\"The Delta variant first arrived here in the UK precisely because of inadequate pre-travel requirements and health checks at UK arrival halls, compounded by a lack of support and enforcement of mandatory quarantine,\" she said.\nUnder the current rules for England, arrivals from red list destinations such as India and South Africa must isolate in a government approved hotel for 10 days. \nThose coming from amber countries must quarantine for 10 days, with tests to be taken on days two and eight after return, but they do not need to be in a hotel.\nIt may be possible to end quarantine early in England by paying for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme.\nThe vast majority of countries are on the amber list.\nArrivals from the few green list countries - which includes a small number of countries including Israel and Iceland - do not have to quarantine but must book a test for day two of their return.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are following similar rules.\nAndrew Flintham, from travel firm Tui, said it had become an interested party in the legal action taken against the government by Manchester Airports Group, alongside Ryanair, British Airways' parent company IAG and Virgin Atlantic about how the government manages and publishes the green travel list.\n\"At the time of the last country review, many destinations such as Malta, the Greek islands and the Balearics had much lower rates than the UK,\" he told a conference organised by the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta).\n\"It was inexplicable as to why these were not added and instead Portugal was moved straight from green to amber, without the slightest sign of stopping at the much-vaunted green watchlist.\"\nMark Tanzer, of Abta, urged ministers to \"put aside any misguided prejudices against outbound travel\".\nHe added that the amount of state support given to travel firms is \"way behind\" the situation in other countries.\nOn Monday, the prime minister said the government was considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK if they took daily tests.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was \"cautiously hopeful\" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme, with the next \"checkpoint\" taking place on 28 June.\nThe health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that England remained \"on track\" for the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions on 19 July, with case rates \"slowing\" and hospitalisations \"not rising quickly\".\nHe said the number of people dying from Covid in England remained \"very, very low\" and said this showed the \"vaccine was working\".\nMr Hancock also warned that the coming winter could be \"challenging\", but said that he hoped the government would not have to bring back restrictions.\nMore than 43.1 million people (81.9% of the population) have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and nearly 31.5 million (59.8%) have had a second, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.\nThe UK has reported a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test on Tuesday, and another 11,625 cases. \nThe Office for National Statistics said infections were continuing to increase in England but the \"trend is uncertain\" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe number of hospital admissions for Covid has jumped by a third in the last week with the latest data showing four consecutive days of more than 200 admissions.\nA month ago we had three days of under 100 admissions so the change is very clear.\nBut that just tells you part of the story. Ministers have spoken about vaccinations breaking the link between cases and hospitalisations.\nThat has not happened, but it has certainly been weakened.\nDuring the winter wave around 10% of infections being diagnosed ended up in hospital 10 days later.\nCurrently it looks to be around 3%. That is a significant difference. But it still means if infection rates keep climbing as they are we could see in excess of 1,000 admissions a day later in the summer.\nThat is what the NHS would expect to see in the depths of a bad winter for all types of respiratory illness.\nThe hope is that the \"wall of immunity\" built up by the vaccination programme will kick in before we reach that point and help reduce infection levels and then admissions."

      "text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has received a dose of Moderna as her second shot of coronavirus vaccine having had Oxford-AstraZeneca as her first, a government spokesman said.\nThe 66-year-old leader was vaccinated a few days ago after getting a dose of AstraZeneca in April.\nExperts believe mixed dosing of Covid vaccines could be a good idea but it is too early to say for sure. \nMrs Merkel will be stepping down as leader this year after 16 years.\nIn March, Germany, along with other European countries, halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine after a number of blood clots cases were reported.\nGermany had previously restricted the use of the jab to over-60s, but is now set to offer it to all adults, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports.\nAfter a slow start, Germany's vaccination rollout accelerated in recent weeks.\nMore than half of the country's population has now received their first dose of a vaccine.\nIn April, Mrs Merkel's spokesman tweeted a photo of her vaccination certificate to show she had received the injection.\nThere have been some studies conducted on the mixing of different vaccines.\nOne study in the UK found that adults were more likely to report mild and moderate side effects after mixing doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer Covid vaccines.\nSome countries have been looking at mixing vaccines in the face of supply shortages and to improve protection, Reuters news agency reports.\nThe Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec have both said they plan to mix vaccines in the near future, amid uncertainty over shipments of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and concerns about rare blood clots.\nExperts believe mixed dosing of Covid vaccines could be a very good idea. It might give broader, longer-lasting immunity against the pandemic virus and new variants of it, and offer more flexibility to vaccine rollout.\nStudies are under way, but some countries are already allowing it within their national immunisation programs.\nGermany initially restricted the use of the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine to people under 60 because there wasn't much trial data available on efficacy in older people.\nIt reversed that decision in April, offering it to all adults. Weeks later Mrs Merkel received her first dose. \nMore recently, following reports of rare blood clots in a small number of younger people who had the AZ vaccine, Germany recommended that under-60s who had already received a first dose of should have a different coronavirus vaccine for their booster second jab for safety reasons, as a precaution. \nMerkel doesn't fit this age bracket, but, nonetheless, she's had Moderna rather than AZ for her second dose. \nIt may prove to be a decision that gives her better protection, but until we have the evidence from large trials, it is really too early to say for sure.

Some historians believe the speech helped end the War of Independence.\nThe existence of the border remains a subject of political debate.\nTwo former party leaders have made different predictions about the constitutional future of Northern Ireland.\nFormer Ulster Unionist leader Lord Empey has said he was convinced it will still exist in another century, while retired Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams said he there could be a united Ireland within the next 20 years.\nIn a BBC News NI interview, Mr Adams, 72, was asked whether, if he lived to 90, he would see a united Ireland.\n\"I would imagine so, I would like to think so,\" he replied.\n\"I certainly think our children and our grandchildren will grow old in a united Ireland.\"\nEvents are being held throughout 2021 to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland including an inter-denominational church service and an investment conference.\nThe visit to Belfast of King George V, the grandfather of the current Queen, was one of the landmark political events in 1921.\nHe arrived by boat with his wife Queen Mary and went straight to Belfast City Hall by horse-drawn carriage to carry out the state opening of the newly-created parliament.\nIt was set up two weeks previously, in line with the Westminster model of a lower and upper house.\nThe Northern Ireland House of Commons contained 52 members but only the 40 unionists took their seats.\nThe King addressed them in what is now the council chamber at Belfast City Hall.\nTo mark the centenary of that event, Belfast City Council arranged an event on Tuesday evening at which the King's speech was read out again.\nAt 22:30 BST, a lighting animation, featuring images of King George V's visit, will be projected on the facade of City Hall.\nThe chairs used by the royal couple 100 years ago were retained and recently underwent conservation work - they featured in Tuesday's centenary event.\nBelfast Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that when that work took place deep-blue silk lining the chairs was discovered.\nExperts were able to trace the silk back to Portugal, where the chairs had belonged to King Manuel II, and when it became a republic, the deposed king moved to Twickenham in England.\n\"For some reason these chairs ended up in the ownership of Sir Crawford McCullagh who lent [them] to City Hall for the event and the council later bought them,\" said Ms Nicholl. \nThe 100th anniversary of the official opening of the Northern Ireland Parliament would mean different things to different people, said the lord mayor.\n\"Every political party signed up this programme of events,\" she said.\n\"I feel conscious of the magnitude of this day historically but also proud that we have been able to mark key events in the decade in such an inclusive way.\n\"I think you can be distracted by the dysfunction of Stormont sometimes but if you look at local leadership it can be heartening as there is collaboration and cross-community work.\n\"The majority of people are able to be good neighbours and work well together.\"\nThe BBC News NI website has a dedicated section marking the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland and partition of the island.\nThere are special reports on the major figures of the time and the events that shaped modern Ireland available at bbc.co.uk/ni100.\nYear '21: You can also explore how Northern Ireland was created a hundred years ago by listening to the latest Year '21 podcast on BBC Sounds or catch-up on previous episodes."

      "title": "Scotland aiming to lift all Covid restrictions by 9 August",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Scotland is aiming to remove all of its major legal Covid restrictions in early August, the country's first minister has announced. \nNicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed lockdown easing would be paused for three weeks to allow more time for people to be vaccinated. \nIt means mainland areas will not move to the lowest level zero restrictions until 19 July.\nThe hope is that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August.\nMs Sturgeon said this would allow life in Scotland to return to \"almost complete normality\".\nBut the government will not advise an immediate return to full office working on that date - and people will still be required to wear face masks in some settings. \nScotland recorded 2,167 new cases on Monday - the highest daily total since the peak of the second wave in January - with the country said to have had the highest rate in Europe last week\nThe percentage of Covid-19 tests coming back positive rose to 9.1%, up from 7.2% the previous day, and the deaths of a further four people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded. \nThe UK as a whole recorded 11,625 new cases and 27 deaths in the past 24 hours. \nThe new daily case rate in Scotland is seven times higher than it was in early May and 40% higher than last week, with Ms Sturgeon saying the faster-transmitting Delta variant is \"now dominant\".\nBut the first minister said the vaccination programme was breaking the link between the number of positive cases and the number of people being hospitalised and dying. \nThe government's original \"route map\" out of lockdown would have seen the whole of Scotland move to level zero - the lowest point in the five-tier system of restrictions - from next Monday.\nThis has now been pushed back to 19 July - the same date as measures are planned to be lifted in England.\nIsland communities such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero, with all mainland areas in level one or level two of the country's five-tier system of restrictions.\nSome \"minor\" changes will be phased in sooner - removing staff and suppliers of wedding services from the cap on numbers at services from Monday and allowing live entertainment at receptions, and allowing people from more than one household to help carry a coffin at a funeral.\nThe move to level zero will increase the number of people who are allowed to meet up indoors, cut the requirement for physical distancing indoors from 2m (6.5ft) to 1m (3.2ft), and increase the number of people allowed to attend wedding and funerals to 200.\nMs Sturgeon said this would be a \"significant step back to normality\", but said she wanted to move beyond level zero \"as quickly as it is prudent to do so\".\nShe said the \"major remaining legal restrictions\" could be lifted from 9 August, signalling a \"return to almost complete normality in our day to day lives\".\nMs Sturgeon added: \"We will consider and make a final assessment nearer the time of whether - as we hope - this could include the lifting of the legal requirement to physically distance indoors as well as outdoors.\"\nHowever she warned that some measures, including the use of face coverings in shops and on public transport and \"rigorous and regular hand-washing\" would be needed \"at least for a period\".\nAnd the first minister said there should be \"appropriate phasing\" of the return of workers to offices after 9 August, saying the government would \"encourage continued support for home working where it is possible\".\nThe first minister has always said that Covid restrictions would be driven by the data, not by dates.\nBut Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland can expect to be in level zero from 19 July,  and that all major legal restrictions could be lifted from 9 August.  \nLooking at the raw data, this might seem surprising.  There are 154 new coronavirus cases a day in Scotland per 100,000 people. That's almost twenty more than the daily rate on Boxing Day, when the country went into another lockdown. \nThe difference is the vaccine, which has dramatically reduced the consequences of catching coronavirus. Fewer people are now dying from Covid, down from an average of 31 a day in December to less than 2 a day now. \nThat's why the Scottish government can look forward to a date when it can relax restrictions instead of imposing them. \nThe changes are dependent on case levels being suppressed and targets being hit in the vaccination programme.\nAll adults in Scotland will have had at least one dose of a vaccine by 18 July, with everyone in the 40-49 age group due to have had both doses by a week later. \nBy 20 August, all 30 to 39-year-olds will have had a second dose, with everyone over the age of 18 due to have had two doses by 12 September. \nMs Sturgeon faced questions on her statement from opposition leaders at Holyrood - where MSPs are due to debate an extension of emergency powers into 2022.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed progress with the vaccination programme and that \"we have more of an indication of when we will be free from restrictions\".\nHe pressed Ms Sturgeon for more detail about what measures would continue after 9 August, including whether masks would still be required in offices and schools.\nMs Sturgeon said the legal requirement for physical distancing could be removed at that point, but that in some settings - such as schools - masks may need to be worn for a bit longer.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said \"we must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown\", calling for clearer messaging and protocols around financial support."

      "text": "Teachers are set to decide GCSE, AS and A-level grades in Wales after a system replacing end-of-year exams was axed.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said the pandemic had left her \"no choice\" in scrapping the classroom assessments.\nGrades determined by schools and colleges based on the work covered would be \"simple and clear\", she said.\nExams were cancelled in favour of assessments in November, but these were also ditched when schools were told to close until February half term.\nAdvice from the Design and Delivery Group of school and college leaders said grades should be based on \"evidence of learning\".\nThe approach is similar to the so-called 'Centre Assessed Grades' given to students in the summer of 2020 when the Covid-19 crisis affected end-of-year assessments.\nThe new measures include:\nMs Williams said in November that end-of-year exams would be cancelled because the varying impact of Covid-19 on different schools and pupils meant it was not possible to ensure a level playing field.\nA new system based on a mix of assessments was put in place, drawn up by an exams advisory group made up of school and college leaders.\nHowever, when it was announced schools and colleges would stay closed for most pupils until at least 29 January, and probably until after February half-term, the advisory group was asked to look again at how assessments should be carried out.\nMs Williams said: \"The worsening situation with the pandemic has meant we have no choice but to revisit our approach to ensure wellbeing and public confidence in our qualifications system.\n\"The proposals we are announcing today puts trust in teachers' and lecturers' knowledge of their learners' work, as well as their commitment to prioritise teaching and learning in the time available to support learners' progression.\"\nShe said they were working with universities to see how they can \"provide a bridge into courses\".\n\"Teaching the core content and aspects of each course remains my absolute priority for learners in exam years, so they are supported to progress with certainty into their next steps, with confidence in their grades\", she added.\nWJEC chief executive Ian Morgan, said that after an \"exceptional year\" there needs to be a different approach to assessment in 2021.\n\"Our teams will work at pace to develop a package of guidance for our teachers, including adapted past papers, mark schemes, and a range of support materials. We will also work with the Design and Delivery Advisory Group to develop a quality assurance process to support schools and college,\" he said.\nIn England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said grades would be decided by schools and colleges but pupils could be asked to sit mini-exams to help teachers with their assessments.\nCarys, an A-level student from Ysgol Bro Edern in Cardiff, said before the announcement she wished students had been given a clearer picture about what they would be facing.   \n\"It has been very confusing for us,\" she said.\n\"I feel like we're all asking the teachers what's happening, what's going on, and they're just as much as in the dark as we are.\"\nCarys said she and her friends had struggled to see how the external assessments would be different to their cancelled exams.  \n\"It is causing a large concern to us all and we're not quite sure what we're aiming towards,\" she said.\n \"I just want all our hard work to be credited.\"\nBetsy, a GCSE pupil also at Ysgol Bro Edern, said she felt the fairest way to grade pupils this year was to let teachers decide on grades. \n\"It has been very challenging,\" she said.\n\"I know many pupils who have been off school for weeks, or months even.\"\n\"I feel like the most fair way to do this is to just collect loads of coursework and trust the teachers to give us predicted grades,\" she said.\n\"They know the effort we've put in through the lockdown and through the online learning.\n\"I know that we will always be classed as the coronavirus year that didn't do exams.\n\"Universities hopefully will take that into consideration.\"\nThe NASUWT union, which represents some teachers in Wales, said \"the devil will be in the detail\" and full consultation with teachers is needed as there were concerns over fairness and staff workloads.\n\"How is this going to be achieved and what are the workload implications going to be on already hard pressed teachers?\" said Neil Butler of the NASUWT.\nUCAC, another teaching union, said it was \"the only realistic solution under the current circumstances\".\nBut their general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young added he would like to see external standardisation between schools.\nThe school leaders' union NAHT Cymru said they were pleased to get clarity - but are \"concerned about the proposed processes for appeals.\n\"The suggestion that initial appeals are made directly to the school or college is misguided in principle, and logistically unworkable,\" said director Laura Doel.\nExecutive members of the National Education Union Cymru said they were pleased to be moving to a system \"with more trust in teachers and lecturers\" and were keen there was \"no repeat of the position we all found ourselves in last summer\".\nThe director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, Eithne Hughes, said it was a \"pragmatic solution\" but more detail is needed regarding quality control.  \nThe announcement does not include vocational and technical qualifications, which are being considered separately.\nQualifications Wales said it would work with the awarding bodies offering Wales-only vocational qualifications \"to reflect these arrangements in those qualifications\".\nIt added it would \"continue to work with our fellow regulators to determine the arrangements for vocational and technical qualifications offered across the UK. Ofqual are currently consulting on proposals\"."

      "tags": "Money,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than five million people became millionaires across the world in 2020 despite economic damage from the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWhile many poor people became poorer, the number of millionaires increased by 5.2 million to 56.1 million globally, Credit Suisse research found.\nIn 2020, more than 1% of adults worldwide were millionaires for the first time.\nRecovering stock markets and soaring house prices helped boost their wealth.\nWealth creation appeared to be \"completely detached\" from the economic woes of the pandemic, the researchers said.\nLower interest rates and government support programmes had led to \"a huge transfer\" of wealth from the public sector to the household sector, they added.\nThis had prompted a surge in household saving, which had \"inflated household financial assets and caused household debts to be lower than they would be otherwise\".\nThe number of ultra-high net worth individuals, usually defined as those having investable assets of more than $30m, grew by 24% worldwide in 2020, the fastest rate of increase since 2003.\nCredit Suisse said its total of the number of millionaires might be higher than other organisations' estimates because it included both investable and non-investable assets, such as owner-occupied homes.\nAnthony Shorrocks, economist and author of the Global Wealth Report, said the pandemic had an \"acute short-term impact on global markets\", but added this was \"largely reversed by the end of June 2020\".\n\"Global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil, but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year,\" he said.\nHowever, wealth differences between adults widened in 2020, and Mr Shorrocks said if asset price increases, such as house price rises, were removed from the analysis, \"then global household wealth may well have fallen\".\n\"In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed,\" he said.\n\"Some of the underlying factors may self correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices.\"\nTotal global wealth grew by 7.4%, the report said.\nSince the start of the 21st Century, the number of people with wealth between $10,000 and $100,000 had more than tripled in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. \nThey said the increase reflected the \"growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world\".\nNannette Hechler-Fayd'herbe, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, said: \"There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organise massive income transfer programmes to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis.\"\nShe added: \"The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact.\n\"It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth.\"\nBut she added that these interventions \"have come at a great cost\".\n\"Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries.\n\"Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries.\"\nMs Hechler-Fayd'herbe said a \"major reason\" why share prices and house prices had \"flourished\" was due to the lowering of interest rates by banks, which, she added, translated \"directly into our valuations of household wealth\"."

      "text": "All new road-building projects in Wales are being frozen while the Welsh government conducts a review.\nIt means plans for the Deeside \"Red Route\", the Llandeilo bypass, and a third Anglesey crossing will be put on hold.\nMinisters say it is a necessary part of Wales' effort to reduce carbon emissions.\nBut the Conservatives warned the decision was a \"significant blow\" for the economic recovery.\nMeanwhile Plaid Cymru said the review cannot mean communities \"are left behind\".\nDeputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters announced the review in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday afternoon.\nProjects that already have diggers in the ground, such as the Heads of the Valleys Road, will continue.\nAs part of the plans the Welsh government wants to shift money from new roads to maintaining existing routes and investing in public transport.\nWales is aiming to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. \nBut to get there, Mr Waters said Wales needs to increase emissions cuts in the next decade to double what has been cut in the last 30 years.\nHe told BBC Wales: \"Transport generates something like 17% of all our emissions, so it has to play its part.\n\"If we can hit these climate change targets, that's got to change. That means redirecting investment.\n\"If we carry on going as we're going, we're not going to hit net zero until 2090. At the very latest scientists tell us we have until 2050 to stop this running out of control.\"\nThere was concern about the announcement from business people in Llandeilo, where the bypass had had already been delayed to 2025. \nIt was promised by Welsh Labour ministers as part of a deal with Plaid Cymru to get the 2017-18 budget passed, and would have directed traffic away from the busy main road through the Carmarthenshire town.\nEllen Plowman, who runs Maryellens coffee shop in the town, said: \"The volume of traffic that's coming through Llandeilo at the moment is far too much for the town, it's having an impact on people feeling safe walking through the town.\n\"If the bypass doesn't happen then I think they really should look at changing the weight of the lorries and the size of the noise coming through.\"\nJeweller Mari Thomas said she understood the need for the review \"but I think Llandeilo specifically has a problem with traffic and congestion, and... pollution\".\nShe said it was dangerous for pedestrians.\n\"Public transport will help a lot but I don't think it will solve my problems here,\" she said, saying large lorries should be prevented \"from coming through such a small town when you've got narrow streets\".\nThe Welsh government picked a preferred route for a new Menai crossing in 2018, although a government minister later said the scrapping of the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power plant scheme had weakened its case.\nPlans for the red route dual carriageway in Deeside - which would see the A548 upgraded and a new link built with the A55 to tackle congestion - have sparked opposition for cutting through ancient woodland.\nThe review will be conducted by a yet-to-be-announced external panel.\nBusiness lobby group the CBI warned that commuters were currently preferring private transport over alternatives.\n\"Public transport use in Flintshire is down 47% and down 33% in Carmarthenshire,\" said the CBI's Ian Price. \"This could spell trouble for the local communities of Deeside and Llandeilo if there is no plan to respond to these trends.\n\"The government review should consider what viable alternatives exist for Deeside and Llandeilo that can meet short and long-term pressures.\" \nThe announcement was criticised by Natasha Asghar, transport spokesperson for the Welsh Conservatives: \"At such a delicate economic time, this decision could prove a significant blow for our recovery.  \n\"Many roads across Wales are not fit for purpose and have had a damaging impact on our economic fortunes, environment and public safety. Regular traffic jams deter investment and have contributed to Wales having some of the worst air quality in the UK. \n\"Welsh workers and businesses urgently require more information about the scope of the review and the Welsh Labour Government's long-term intentions for our transport infrastructure.\"\nThere was a mixed response from Plaid Cymru's climate change spokesperson Delyth Jewell.\nShe added: \"This move from the Welsh government, whilst a welcome indication that they are serious about tackling carbon emissions, cannot mean that communities that are long overdue infrastructure investment are left behind. \n\"Communities like Llandeilo, who are understandably angry that this has been announced without consultation, have seen air pollution levels in their town centre rise to higher than the national standards and would benefit from the kind of infrastructure investment that has been promised but continuously delayed for the last six years.\"\nTransport is Wales' third-largest source of the gases driving climate change, according to advisers at the independent Climate Change Committee. \nIn a December 2020 report, the committee said transport emissions fell by 2% between 2016 and 2018 but overall emissions \"have remained virtually flat since 1990\".\nThe Welsh government's new transport strategy - Llwybr Newydd - said Wales' transport emissions \"must be roughly halved between 2020 and 2030 from six to three million tonnes\" of carbon dioxide. \nIt adds: \"Whilst electric vehicles may provide the biggest emissions savings, this is unlikely to be the main source of savings until the late 2020s and possibly later.\"\nNew cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and diesel will not be sold in the UK from 2030. \nSeperately the deputy climate change minister said it would be \"inevitable at some point we're going to have some level of road charging. \n\"As people move to electric cars, they won't be paying tax on fuel,\" Lee Waters said.\n\"So the whole model of how we fund, transport and general taxation is changing and it'll have to be changes to reflect that you pay per mile, rather than just a flat rate as we currently do.\"\nThe Welsh government's strategy says other measures will also be needed, including a target of 30% of the workforce working remotely and an increase in people using public transport, walking and cycling.\nAround 32% of all journeys are currently made by public transport, walking and cycling - the government's target is to increase that share to 45% by 2040.\nWales has seen a huge drop in public transport journeys as a result of the pandemic.\nIn the year to March 2021, 24 million bus journeys were made in Wales - a 73% drop compared to the previous year. \nTransport for Wales also saw an 84% drop in rail passenger journeys in the past financial year - down from 31.8 million in 2019/20 to 5 million in 2020/21.\nFriends of the Earth Cymru has called for a ban on new roads in Wales.\nAsked on the BBC Politics Wales programme recently whether there should be a ban, Climate Change Minister Julie James said: \"It's tempting, isn't it, to say, 'of course we won't build new roads'.\n\"But there are really complex issues here around air quality, what traffic routes people take, how many cars on the road and so on.\""

      "text": "Poor white teenagers in England's former industrial towns and those living on the coast are among the least likely to go to university, warns the watchdog for fair access.\n\"These are the people and places that have been left behind,\" says Chris Millward of the Office for Students.\nThe watchdog has used a new measure to see which groups are likely or not to go to university.\nMPs are investigating low attainment among white working class pupils.\nThe Office for Students looked at overlapping factors - such as poverty, race, gender and where people live - which are indicators of whether someone is likely to go to university.\nThis combined measure found white youngsters on free meals or from disadvantaged areas were 92% of those in the bottom fifth, in terms of the likelihood of going to to university.\nThese were particularly concentrated in some areas - such as parts of Nottingham, Great Yarmouth, Barnsley, Sheffield, Stoke and Hull.\nMr Millward, director of fair access, warns that these communities, \"over successive generations\", have missed out on the rise in access to universities.\n\"The expansion of educational opportunities, and the belief that equality of opportunity would flow from this, have not delivered for them. So they are less likely to see education as the way to improve their lives,\" writes Mr Millward.\nThe research emphasises the importance of place, identifying particularly low entry rates in \"former industrial towns and cities across the north and midlands, or coastal towns\".\nBut white students on free meals in London seemed to have bucked the trend, with an the entry rate that \"has pulled away from that in other parts of the country\" - and the capital overall has higher rates of going to university.\nFigures from the Department for Education last year reported that \"male white British free school meal pupils are the least likely of all the main ethnic groups to progress to higher education\".\nThe Education Select Committee is investigating why \"left behind white pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds\" seem to be underachieving in education."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Monkton,Newton Stewart,Kilmarnock",
      "text": "A former prison officer has been told he must serve a minimum of 20 years for murdering his friend and dumping her naked body in a forest.\nRoss Willox, 42, killed Emma Faulds, 39, after a party at his house in Monkton, South Ayrshire, in April 2019.\nThe youth worker's body was found six weeks later after CCTV and mobile phone analysis was used to narrow down the remote search area.\nWillox was convicted of the murder at the High Court in Glasgow last month.\nOn Tuesday, he was jailed for life and ordered to serve at least 20 years before he can apply for parole.\nJudge Lord Mulholland told him: \"Only you will know what happened in your house that night that led to you killing your friend.\n\"Having murdered her you created an elaborate scheme to cover up your crime.\"\nHe said that Willox placed Emma's body in a shallow grave and covered it up, and tried to ensure it would decompose more quickly by placing it in a wet area.\nLord Mulholland added: \"You hoped it would never be found and her devoted family would have to spend the rest of their lives wondering where she was and if she was alive or dead.\"\nIt is still not known why or how Willox killed Emma, whom he had been friends with since they worked together as prison wardens at HMP Kilmarnock.\nDetectives said the pair, who had a platonic relationship, had agreed to meet at his house in Monkton for a party on Sunday 28 April 2019.\nAt about 20:00, Emma messaged a friend to say she planned to have a few drinks and stay over.\nEmma was usually in frequent contact with her loved ones, but no-one heard from her the following day.\nHer mother, Margaret, said this was \"totally out of character\".\nThe alarm was raised on 30 April after Mrs Faulds learned that Emma had not turned up for work at Kibble School in Paisley.\nWhen police officers broke in to Emma's flat in Kilmarnock they found that her pet dog, Maverick, was home alone.\nAs the last person to see her alive, Willox became the immediate focus of the investigation, codenamed Operation Solzen.\nHe told officers that Emma had decided to drive back to her flat, which was less than nine miles away, at about 23:00. \nHe said Emma had been \"positive and upbeat and enjoying herself\" and was talking about her forthcoming 40th birthday.\nThe trial heard he twice called the police for updates on the case and gave different accounts to Emma's sister, Sarah, about how she left his home in Monkton.\nFootage from a dash-cam revealed that Emma's car was parked outside Willox's house at 17:39 on April 28.\nBut at about 07:25 the following day Emma's neighbour told the jury he saw a man driving the vehicle in Fullerton Street, Kilmarnock.\nThe driver was also captured on private CCTV wiping down the interior of the car. Willox's DNA was later found on a seat lever.\nThe jury heard Willox did not join Emma's family and friends when they put up posters and distributed leaflets after she was reported missing.\nAs the search for Emma intensified, experts began to plot Willox's movements using CCTV and cell site analysis of his mobile phones.\nThey also discovered he used to build wind farms near the Galloway Forest, in Dumfries and Galloway.\nHe was caught on camera making two journeys to the remote area in the days following Emma's disappearance.\nCCTV footage was also discovered showing Willox going into various shops in Ayr and buying bleach, rubber gloves and tins of outdoor disinfectant.\nPolice drafted in search experts from the UK National Crime Agency, as well as an officer who had expert knowledge of Galloway Forest Park - which covers about 300 square miles.\nBy examining the cell site analysis from Willox's phones and CCTV from the routes he took in the 48 hours after Emma vanished, digital forensic experts were able to narrow down the search area.\nOn 12 June, six weeks after Emma disappeared, her naked body was found in Glentrool Forest, east of Loch Moan.\nA pathologist was unable to confirm how Emma died due to the \"degree of decomposition\".\nBut the jury was told that soil found on boots owned by Willox was a 92% match for mud at the spot where the body was recovered.\nProsecutor Paul Kearney told the jury Willox had made a \"determined attempt to create a false narrative to conceal and destroy evidence\".\nDonald Findlay QC, who was acting for Willox, said it would not be appropriate to express any contrition on behalf of his client, who denies he was responsible.\nMr Findlay added: \"He is not the kind of person I would have expected to have found himself guilty of a crime of murder, murder of somebody that he knew and cared for - they cared for each other, not in any romantic sense, but as friends.\n\"Something catastrophic went wrong in the early hours of the morning, and one life was lost.\"\nDet Insp Peter Crombie described the killer as \"a selfish, arrogant monster\" and said he compounded the agony of Emma's loved ones by failing to admit his crime."

      "text": "Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams has apologised \"directly and unreservedly\" for the way A-level results were handled last week.\nThere was outrage after 42% of A-level grades in Wales were downgraded.\nOn Monday ministers abandoned the system used to calculate the results, awarding assessments made by teachers instead.\nMs Williams said she was \"truly sorry\" for a process that made a stressful time \"worse\" for some students.\nThe minister made the apology in a social media video, and in evidence to a Senedd committee, a day after the U-turn.\n\"For our young people, and indeed everyone in Wales, the last few months have been and continue to be a stressful time,\" she said.\n\"It has been a time of anguish for people right across the country.\n\"I am sorry that, for some of our young people, the results process has made that worse.\"\n\"Recent months have thrown up unexpected, new and complex challenges,\" she said. \n\"Working with Qualifications Wales and the WJEC we looked for an approach which provided fairness and balanced out differences in the standards applied to judgments in schools.\n\"But, as I announced yesterday, and given decisions elsewhere, the balance of fairness now lies with awarding centre assessment grades to students.\"\nThe apology marks a change in tone from the First Minister Mark Drakeford, who said on Monday he was \"sorry for those young people who've had to live through such an uncertain period\", but defended the system that had been used.\nSome of his comments after the U-turn were dubbed \"pretty shocking\" by Blaenau Gwent Labour AM Alun Davies, in a tweet.\nMs Williams' apology was the second that day from a Welsh Government minster, after Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was sorry for any anxiety and stress caused.\nUK government Education Minister Gavin Williamson has apologised for exam \"distress\" in England, where ministers have also moved to grades estimated by teachers. Similar decisions were taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nAs well as A-levels, teacher assessed grades will be used for GCSEs, AS-levels, skills challenge certificates and the Welsh Baccalaureate. \nLast week's results in Wales were produced by a system known as standardisation - designed to ensure grades were \"as fair as possible\" and consistent with previous years. \nBut it was criticised by students and politicians for producing unfair grades for individual students. GCSE results are to be published on Thursday.\nThe Liberal Democrat education minister told the Senedd's education committee that she was not informed of the scale of the impact of using the algorithm to moderate A-level results until 10 August, three days before the results were due to be announced.\nShe said she had been told on that day that 42% of grades would be depressed.\n\"I was given those results on the 10th of August, and we were concerned,\" she said.\nMs Williams said the Welsh Government was \"particularly concerned\" about whether there might be a \"disproportionate effect\" on pupils receiving free school meals and had asked for more data.\nShe said the WJEC supplied that information to Qualifications Wales the following evening, and it was given to her the morning after that - Wednesday - the day before the results came out.\nLynne Neagle, chairwoman of the Senedd education select committee, thanked Ms Williams for her apology but said her colleagues \"need to know what the Welsh Government is doing to make sure this does not happen again\".\nShe added: \"No one can predict if or when we may see another lockdown like this one, so we must learn from these experiences and avoid the confusing, confidence-sapping decisions we have seen over the last few weeks.\" \nLater, in an interview with BBC Wales, Ms Williams insisted the new results would \"absolutely\" be credible, and \"young people should not feel that they aren't\".\nBut she said the original system had been robust \"there or thereabouts\", with 95% of students having received either a grade at the level their teacher predicted or within one grade of that.\nMs Williams' earlier comments followed calls for a \"full and proper apology to the young people of Wales\" from Plaid Cymru.\nIt also came after a long day of evidence at the Senedd committee from officials involved in the process, where the chief executive of the Welsh examinations board, the WJEC, defended the algorithm used for A-level results.\nIan Morgan said that system would have meant grades A* to E would have been up by 1% from last year and A* to A would have risen by 2.9%, with A* up 0.1% on 2019, with 1.7% of candidates reaching that level.\nHe said the decision to use teachers' estimates instead meant 99.9% of candidates achieving grades A* to E. There was now a 13.4% increase in candidates getting A* to A, meaning 40.4% reaching that standard.\nEarlier on BBC Radio Wales Mr Morgan said that to \"some extent\" he was probably disappointed with the U-turn. \"I think there's a huge amount of rigour that's gone into the standardisation process,\" he said.\n\"I'm not here to try and question the effort teachers have put in, these were a complex set of circumstances and teachers have worked diligently.\"\nMr Morgan acknowledged there were \"imperfections\" with some students not receiving the correct grades - but said these would have been weeded out during the appeals process.\nJo Richards, regulation director of Qualifications Wales, acknowledged a delay to BTEC results. She said students students should expect their results by the end of Tuesday.\n\"We've had notification of that from Pearson and we are working with them and are asking for regular updates, they are working through that data,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, teaching union NASUWT said \"urgent lessons\" need to be learned.\nGeneral Secretary Dr Patrick Roach said: \"The problems that have been left to unfold over recent days have impacted not only on those young people who were receiving their awards this year, but also the confidence of the thousands of pupils who are now preparing for examinations next year.\""

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "tags": "Puberty,LGBT,Transgender people",
      "text": "The Court of Appeal is considering whether under-16s can give informed consent to medical treatment that delays the onset of puberty.\nThe appeal is brought by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust.\nIt says puberty blockers give children distressed by their birth sex time to consider \"options\".\nBut a representative for Keira Bell, who brought the original case, says children cannot understand all of the treatment's implications. \nJudgement is reserved for a later date.\nThe two-day appeal also includes submissions from LGBT and other interested groups.\nIn December 2020, the High Court ruled that under-16s were unlikely to be able to give informed consent to what it described as \"experimental\" treatment, which is sometimes used to pause puberty in children experiencing gender dysphoria.\nKeira Bell, one of the claimants in the case, started taking puberty blockers at the age of 16 after being referred to the Tavistock and Portman Trust, which runs the UK's only Gender Identity Development Service (Gids). \nNow in her mid-20s, says she regrets her decision to transition to a male, and says the clinic should have challenged her more.\nSpeaking outside the Appeal Court on Wednesday morning, she said: \"I'm always hopeful, but the result could go any way.\"\nThe Tavistock has argued throughout that it provides safe treatment and puts the best interests of young people and their families first.\nOn Wednesday, Fenella Moss QC, representing the Trust, argued that the High Court's original judgement was wrong to find the use of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria was \"experimental\".\nMs Morris said that puberty blockers are deemed fully reversible in international guidelines, and that \"not providing treatment means that the child remains in a position of distress and difficulties in making choices about what to do next\". \nShe argued that it is not inevitable that a young person would continue on to taking cross-sex hormones  - which the NHS advises cause some irreversible changes - after puberty blockers.\nChildren and young people are told about effects on their fertility that may be caused by later stages of transition, she added.\n\"There is no suggestion anywhere that this is one pathway... there is no shying away from explaining to children and young people what the possibilities are.\"\nJeremy Hyam QC, representing Ms Bell and Mrs A, the other claimant, argued that the appeal should fail as it did not find any \"material errors\" in the original ruling.\nIn written arguments, he said: \"The need for a child to understand, retain and weigh up the salient facts is all the more important because, unlike life-saving cancer treatment, there is much uncertainty as to what the benefits of puberty blockers actually are.\"\nIn court on Wednesday, he added: \"Right at the heart of what the court was concerned about was how can it be said that children of 10, 11, 12 have any proper conception of what sexual function is?\"\nNine organisations or individuals - including human rights group Liberty and The Endocrine Society - have given evidence in the appeal.\nIn a separate case in March, the Family Division of the High Court ruled that parents could give consent for under-16s to access puberty blockers.\nBut it said it may be that \"additional safeguards\" should be put in place, such as the requirement for an independent second opinion.\nPuberty blockers are drugs that suppress the release of hormones produced in much bigger quantities during puberty. \nThey are sometimes used to treat gender dysphoria, which the NHS describes as \"a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity\".\nGids says puberty blockers allow a young person \"time to consider their options and to continue to explore their developing gender identity before making decisions about irreversible forms of treatment\". \nIt advises that while the effects are physically reversible if treatment is stopped, the full psychological effects - or whether it alters the course of adolescent brain development - aren't known.\nThe NHS says \"little is known\" about the long term side effects in young people with gender dysphoria, including whether the treatment affects the development of the teenage brain or children's bones.\nPuberty blockers are also used to treat conditions which cause premature puberty in much younger children.\nThis is the most contentious of areas. \nPartly because opinions will vary hugely on the age at which a child can understand the impact of a decision made in their early teens on the life they will lead as an adult. \nAnd partly because at its heart lie the futures of young people struggling with their gender identity, who may already feel marginalised, misunderstood and harmed by delays in treatment. \nThe Court of Appeal hearing has so far revolved around two key areas.\nFirstly, whether under-16's can truly consent to puberty blockers when their feelings about, for instance, their fertility may change substantially in the next decade. \nSecondly, whether that treatment is experimental. The High Court concluded it was. The Tavistock disagrees, throughout it has pointed to prescription of the drugs by doctors going back more than twenty years.\nIt will be for the Appeal Court to settle these arguments, but the case has already underlined the importance of more research in this complex area. \nIn the December ruling, Dame Victoria Sharp, sitting with Lord Justice Lewis and Mrs Justice Lieven, said: \"It is doubtful that a child aged 14 or 15 could understand and weigh the long-term risks and consequences of the administration of puberty blockers.\"\nThe judges added it was \"highly unlikely\" that children aged 13 and under would have the capacity to give consent.\nMermaids, which provides services for young people and their families who struggle with their gender identity, says that decision, \"put a further strain on the already marginalised transgender and non-binary community and their families\".\n\"We believe strongly that trans and non-binary children should have the same rights over their healthcare decisions as anyone else, in line with their evolving understanding,\" the charity said in a statement.\nTransgender Trend, an organisation made up of parents, professionals and academics who are \"concerned about the current trend to diagnose children as transgender,\" has submitted evidence to the hearing.\nFounder Stephanie Davies-Arai said: \"Children do not have the maturity or life experience to give informed consent to medical interventions with such devastating long-term consequences and we hope and expect that the Appeal Court will uphold the High Court's judgement\"."

      "tags": "Turkmenistan,Cost of living",
      "text": "The capital of Turkmenistan in Central Asia has been named as the world's most expensive city for foreign workers.\nAshgabat, a city of about one million people, topped a 2021 cost-of-living survey by consultancy firm Mercer.\nThe ranking puts Ashgabat above last year's priciest city, Hong Kong, which was placed second, followed by Beirut in Lebanon and Tokyo in Japan.\nThe annual report ranks 209 cities based on the cost of expenses such as housing, transport and food.\nMercer said it evaluated more than 200 goods and services for the report, which is designed to help companies and governments around the world determine how much they should pay expatriate employees.\nExpatriates, or expats, are people who live or work outside their native countries.\nMost of the cities in Mercer's top 10 are business hubs where economic growth has led to a hike in the price of housing and other living costs.\nBut Ashgabat owes its high ranking to economic woes rather than prosperity, making it an outlier.\nJean-Philippe Sarra of Mercer told AFP news agency that \"high local inflation\" explained Ashgabat's rise to first from second in last year's survey. Inflation is the rate of increase in prices for goods and services over time.\nKnown for its autocratic government and large gas reserves, Turkmenistan has been grappling with a long-running economic crisis that has plunged many citizens into poverty.\nFormerly part of the Soviet Union, the country is highly dependent on natural gas exports to Russia. Given this, Turkmenistan's economic turmoil has been driven, in part, by low gas prices.\nA global slump in energy prices in 2014 pushed up inflation and food prices.\nIn September last year, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the Covid-19 pandemic had \"drastically exacerbated Turkmenistan's pre-existing food crisis\".\n\"Shortages of subsidised food, accelerating since 2016, have worsened, with people waiting hours in line to try to buy more affordable food products, often being turned away empty-handed,\" the report said.\nDespite this, Turkmenistan's government started a major expansion of Ashgabat in May. Long-time President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov pledged to turn the capital into \"one of the most prosperous cities in the world\".\nBy Abdujalil Abdurasulov, BBC News\nThe report is just another illustration of the stark inequalities in Turkmenistan.\nMany citizens in Ashgabat struggle to afford even basic things such as food. It is common for people to queue for hours outside of shops to get hold of bread or flour as food shortages still grip the country.\nBut there is also another Ashgabat - a glitzy capital full of marble buildings. This is the image that state propaganda tries to project in order to convince everyone that Turkmenistan is one of the most prosperous nations in the world.\nMeanwhile, foreign companies have to boost this image if they want to enter the market. For energy giants, they are attracted by one of the largest gas reserves in the world. \nTo access it, some are prepared to follow written and unwritten rules on how to do business in Turkmenistan. This means their staff pay high prices for almost everything - from renting a house to buying food.\nLebanon's capital, Beirut, was a big riser, jumping from 45th a year earlier to 3rd in the 2021 survey.\nMercer attributed this to a number of factors, including the \"political turmoil\" of recent years and the \"severe and extensive economic depression\".\n\"The Covid-19 pandemic and the Port of Beirut explosion [in 2020] have all amplified the economic effects, causing record-high inflation,\" Mercer said.\nThree Swiss cities were in the top 10, including Zurich, which dropped to fifth. \nOf the priciest Chinese cities included, Shanghai climbed one spot to number six while the capital, Beijing, rose to ninth.\nSingapore, an island city-state known for its flourishing financial sector, took seventh place.\nIn the UK, London was placed 18th, edging up by one place from number 19 last year, while Birmingham was ranked at 121, moving up by eight places from 129 in 2020.\nAt the bottom of the list, Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek was ranked as the least expensive city for foreign employees by the survey."

      "text": "The UK government has \"promised that there will be a significant win\" on the Northern Ireland Protocol, outgoing Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Edwin Poots has said.\nHe told BBC News NI he had \"received assurances\" from Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and that they could emerge in early July.\nMr Poots said \"we haven't got detail\" of the changes but was told they would be \"very significant\".\nHe will quit as DUP leader within days.\nThe protocol is part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned to the EU single market to ensure the free movement of goods across the Irish border.\nIt has been criticised by unionists because it has led to additional checks and delays on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nSome aspects of the protocol, such as restrictions on the movement of fresh sausages and chilled meats, have been mitigated by so-called grace periods which could end in July.\nThe EU is considering a UK request for the ban to be postponed until October.\nThe BBC understands that Tesco and two other major supermarkets are now sourcing almost all their sausages locally for sale in Northern Ireland.\nSpeaking after Mr Poots made his comment about the promised \"significant\" changes, Mr Lewis repeated his view that the government \"will do what we need to do\" in managing the protocol.\nBut he did not specifically address Mr Poots' suggestion.\nHe was asked about the remarks during a debate in the Commons on Tuesday afternoon.\nHe said he was conscious of challenges for consumers and businesses posed by the protocol and that the government would \"not allow that to continue\".\n\"We want to get this corrected so that consumers and businesses can continue to function as a full and integral part of the UK,\" he added.\n\"We take nothing off the table in that regard... but we want to work this through with the EU.\"\nUK and EU officials have been engaged in months of technical talks aimed at simplifying the operation of the protocol.\nBut the UK's Brexit Minster Lord Frost has said those negotiations have made little progress.\nSo short of an unexpected breakthrough there what \"significant win\" could the Northern Ireland secretary have promised?\nIt is possible that the UK could take further unilateral action.\nThe government has not ruled out using Article 16, which allows parts of the protocol to be temporarily suspended.\nBut using that mechanism would mean a fresh crisis in the broader UK-EU relationship.\nLast week Mr Poots announced he would resign from the top job after just 21 days.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson, who stood against Mr Poots in the party's first leadership contest last month, has confirmed his second bid for the leadership.\nNominations closed at midday on Tuesday and Sir Jeffrey is the only candidate to succeed Mr Poots.\nSir Jeffrey has warned that Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive could be at risk if the UK government fails to take \"decisive action\" over the protocol.\nOn Tuesday Mr Poots said such threats would not work and have \"demonstrated failure in the past\".\nMr Poots explained how, as a \"young loyalist\", he attended street protests about the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the 1980s but cautioned that it \"didn't make any difference whatsoever\".\nHe said he hoped that when he hands over to a new leader at the end of June most of the work on the protocol \"will already be achieved\".\n\"I can see we are making actual progress on making those arguments,\" he said.\nMr Poots, who succeeded Arlene Foster in May after an internal DUP revolt, said he did not choose to stand for the leadership until others approached him.\nAfter his own \"bruising\" ousting from the position, he said his \"focus isn't on engaging on infighting\".\n\"I would like to think that I am a better man than to continue some sort of infighting because I think there is a bigger prize out there for the people of Northern Ireland,\" he told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nThe decision by Mr Poots to stand down followed a row about his decision to nominate Paul Givan as first minister.\nMr Poots had agreed a deal that both the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in would nominate first and deputy first ministers after Sinn F\u00e9in received commitments on legislation for Irish language provisions.\nA majority of DUP MPs and MLAs - 24 to 4 - wanted to delay the nomination process.\nReflecting on the move, Mr Poots said most of his decisions would be shown to be \"good ones\" with the \"benefit of history\".\n\"People will say that I had made the right choices in actually ensuring that we could continue to fight the protocol issue, the big constitutional issue of the day as opposed to closing the assembly down over a much narrower issue,\" he explained.\nThe outgoing DUP leader, who is the Stormont agriculture minister and has been a Lagan Valley MLA since 1998, told Sky News that he regretted the brevity of his leadership.\n\"Essentially, there was a section in the party that struggled to accept that I won the election, that I won democratically, I won it fairly, and that's how things are now, that I've been forced into a resignation,\" he said.\n\"But that's life.\""

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is expected to confirm a delay to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland later.\nThe first minister signalled last week the move to level zero - the lowest in the five-tier system - was likely to be pushed back by three weeks.\nOriginally set for 28 June, it could be delayed until at least mid-July so more people can be vaccinated.\nMs Sturgeon has also promised to publish a much-anticipated review of social distancing rules.\nShe is expected to give an indication of what life could look like once the country has transitioned to level zero and beyond.\nWhile large parts of Scotland moved into level one earlier this month, and some islands went down to level zero, many parts of the central belt remain in level two, where there are stricter limits on the size of groups that can meet.\nThe first minister has previously indicated that it was unlikely any area would move down a level on 28 June.\nInstead, she suggested the current level of restrictions was likely to remain until 19 July - the same date Prime Minister Boris Johnson has targeted as a \"terminus\" for England's lockdown restrictions. \nIn Wales, lockdown rules are being reviewed again on 15 July, while the next planned easing in Northern Ireland is set for 5 July.\nMs Sturgeon is expected to update MSPs in a statement to the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood at about 14:20 BST on Tuesday.\nThe number of Covid cases in Scotland has been steadily rising since early May.\nAnother 1,250 new Covid cases were reported in Scotland on Monday, 7.2% of all the new tests taken.\nFigures showed there were 158 people in hospital with a recently confirmed case of Covid, with 14 of those needing intensive care.\nMs Sturgeon said last week that the reason for the likely pause in easing restrictions was to \"buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus\".\n\"Doing that will give us the best chance, later in July, of getting back on track and restoring the much greater normality that we all crave,\" she added.\nBy Monday morning, 3,647,437 people in Scotland had received the first dose of the Covid vaccination, with 2,586,970 having received their second dose.\nMs Sturgeon said on Friday that all adults in Scotland should have been offered a first dose of the vaccine by the end of this week, and all adults will have received a first dose by 18 July - almost two weeks ahead of schedule.\nThe likely delay to ending restrictions has already been criticised by the hospitality industry, which has warned of the potential of \"another lost summer\".\nMembers of the Scottish travel industry will also lobby both Holyrood and the Westminster parliaments this week urging greater support.\nOn Monday they sent an open letter accusing the first minister of \"banning\" them from operating - other than \"in name only\" - with impractical Covid rules. \nBefore her latest Covid statement on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon will face a topical question at Holyrood from Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson, asking on what basis the government has introduced a ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford.\nMs Sturgeon defended the ban on Monday after an angry reaction from Greater Manchester's mayor, Andy Burnham. She insisted it was a public health measure based on Covid levels in the area.\nMr Burnham condemned the fact he was given no advance warning of the travel ban, and called on the Scottish government to compensate those who are now out of pocket.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

He has made it clear he wants to lead the party here as first minister. \nTo do that, he has to find a seat and get himself co-opted. \nThe number one priority for Sir Jeffrey is to get back among the MLAs at Stormont. \nSinn F\u00e9in had refused to nominate a deputy first minister to the joint office unless there was a commitment to implement the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement, which contained provisions for the Irish language. \nThe UK government said it would introduce legislation in October if the assembly had failed to do so.\nSir Jeffrey has previously said he will not nominate a first minister unless there is \"significant change in the plans to bring in Irish language laws\".\nHe has also expressed opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI aligned to the EU single market, but has caused disruption in trade with Great Britain.\nEarlier, outgoing First Minister Paul Givan said Sir Jeffrey would have his \"full support\" should he decide to run for leader of the DUP.\n\"Jeffrey is a formidable politician, one that has a lot to offer Northern Ireland,\" said Mr Givan.\n\"I have spoken to Jeffrey Donaldson over the weekend, I have encouraged him to put his name forward, if he does, he'll have my full support.\"\nMr Givan was speaking following his first official event in Belfast since becoming first minister last week.\nHe described Sir Jeffrey as \"a close, personal friend\" and a \"constituency colleague\".\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson shares an office with both Mr Givan and outgoing DUP leader Edwin Poots.\nSir Jeffrey, born in Kilkeel, County Down, first became politically active as a constituency agent for the South Down MP Enoch Powell in the mid-1980s, before working as a personal assistant to the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader James Molyneaux. \nAfter Lord Molyneaux retired as an MP in 1997, Mr Donaldson was voted as his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, retaining the seat through six subsequent elections.\nHe is a member of the Orange Order and also served as a corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during The Troubles.\nIn 2003, following long-standing opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble, Mr Donaldson announced he would leave the UUP, later joining the DUP, along with Arlene Foster and Norah Beare. \nJeffrey Donaldson was appointed to the UK Privy Council, a body which advises the monarchy, in 2007, and stood down as an MLA for Lagan Valley in 2010.\nHe was awarded a knighthood in 2016 for political service.\nSir Jeffrey was defeated by 19 votes to 17 in the DUP leadership election to succeed Arlene Foster in May 2021.\nOn Monday, Stormont finance minister and Sinn F\u00e9in MLA Conor Murphy accused the DUP of having \"no intention\" of delivering on commitments in NDNA.\nThis agreement brokered the return of power-sharing after three years of deadlock.\nMr Murphy told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that his party did not \"want to box anybody in\" but questioned the DUP's \"credibility\" if it could not deliver on the commitments.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood also said the next leader of the DUP cannot be allowed to \"choreograph the collapse of the institutions at Stormont\".\nWhen Paul Givan resigns it will trigger a seven-day period for new nominations to the posts of first and deputy first minister, or the possibility of a fresh election.\nMr Eastwood said the \"imminent resignation\" of the DUP's first minister showed that the party intended to \"manufacture another political crisis that will once again threaten our local institutions\".\n\"In a desperate attempt to stabilise their own party, they are recklessly prepared to destabilise devolution,\" he said.\nPotential new leaders must submit their nomination in writing, supported by a proposer and a seconder, to DUP chairman Lord Morrow by midday on Tuesday, with a result confirmed on Saturday.\nOnly Stormont assembly members (MLAs) and members of parliament (MPs) are entitled to take part if there is a vote.\nIn May's contest, Sir Jeffrey, who has been the MP for Lagan Valley since 1997, lost by 19 votes to 17 in the first DUP leadership election in its 50-year history.\nAmong the first tasks for a new leader will be a decision over the ministerial team appointed by Edwin Poots.\nPaul Givan is likely to become the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland when he is removed, while a new leader could have other plans for the education, economy and agriculture portfolios."

      "text": "The UK government has \"promised that there will be a significant win\" on the Northern Ireland Protocol, outgoing Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Edwin Poots has said.\nHe told BBC News NI he had \"received assurances\" from Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and that they could emerge in early July.\nMr Poots said \"we haven't got detail\" of the changes but was told they would be \"very significant\".\nHe will quit as DUP leader within days.\nThe protocol is part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned to the EU single market to ensure the free movement of goods across the Irish border.\nIt has been criticised by unionists because it has led to additional checks and delays on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nSome aspects of the protocol, such as restrictions on the movement of fresh sausages and chilled meats, have been mitigated by so-called grace periods which could end in July.\nThe EU is considering a UK request for the ban to be postponed until October.\nThe BBC understands that Tesco and two other major supermarkets are now sourcing almost all their sausages locally for sale in Northern Ireland.\nSpeaking after Mr Poots made his comment about the promised \"significant\" changes, Mr Lewis repeated his view that the government \"will do what we need to do\" in managing the protocol.\nBut he did not specifically address Mr Poots' suggestion.\nHe was asked about the remarks during a debate in the Commons on Tuesday afternoon.\nHe said he was conscious of challenges for consumers and businesses posed by the protocol and that the government would \"not allow that to continue\".\n\"We want to get this corrected so that consumers and businesses can continue to function as a full and integral part of the UK,\" he added.\n\"We take nothing off the table in that regard... but we want to work this through with the EU.\"\nUK and EU officials have been engaged in months of technical talks aimed at simplifying the operation of the protocol.\nBut the UK's Brexit Minster Lord Frost has said those negotiations have made little progress.\nSo short of an unexpected breakthrough there what \"significant win\" could the Northern Ireland secretary have promised?\nIt is possible that the UK could take further unilateral action.\nThe government has not ruled out using Article 16, which allows parts of the protocol to be temporarily suspended.\nBut using that mechanism would mean a fresh crisis in the broader UK-EU relationship.\nLast week Mr Poots announced he would resign from the top job after just 21 days.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson, who stood against Mr Poots in the party's first leadership contest last month, has confirmed his second bid for the leadership.\nNominations closed at midday on Tuesday and Sir Jeffrey is the only candidate to succeed Mr Poots.\nSir Jeffrey has warned that Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive could be at risk if the UK government fails to take \"decisive action\" over the protocol.\nOn Tuesday Mr Poots said such threats would not work and have \"demonstrated failure in the past\".\nMr Poots explained how, as a \"young loyalist\", he attended street protests about the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the 1980s but cautioned that it \"didn't make any difference whatsoever\".\nHe said he hoped that when he hands over to a new leader at the end of June most of the work on the protocol \"will already be achieved\".\n\"I can see we are making actual progress on making those arguments,\" he said.\nMr Poots, who succeeded Arlene Foster in May after an internal DUP revolt, said he did not choose to stand for the leadership until others approached him.\nAfter his own \"bruising\" ousting from the position, he said his \"focus isn't on engaging on infighting\".\n\"I would like to think that I am a better man than to continue some sort of infighting because I think there is a bigger prize out there for the people of Northern Ireland,\" he told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nThe decision by Mr Poots to stand down followed a row about his decision to nominate Paul Givan as first minister.\nMr Poots had agreed a deal that both the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in would nominate first and deputy first ministers after Sinn F\u00e9in received commitments on legislation for Irish language provisions.\nA majority of DUP MPs and MLAs - 24 to 4 - wanted to delay the nomination process.\nReflecting on the move, Mr Poots said most of his decisions would be shown to be \"good ones\" with the \"benefit of history\".\n\"People will say that I had made the right choices in actually ensuring that we could continue to fight the protocol issue, the big constitutional issue of the day as opposed to closing the assembly down over a much narrower issue,\" he explained.\nThe outgoing DUP leader, who is the Stormont agriculture minister and has been a Lagan Valley MLA since 1998, told Sky News that he regretted the brevity of his leadership.\n\"Essentially, there was a section in the party that struggled to accept that I won the election, that I won democratically, I won it fairly, and that's how things are now, that I've been forced into a resignation,\" he said.\n\"But that's life.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Flexible working,Employment,Dating apps,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Bumble, the dating app where women are in charge of making the first move, has temporarily closed all of its offices this week to combat workplace stress.\nIts 700 staff worldwide have been told to switch off and focus on themselves.\nOne senior executive revealed on Twitter that founder Whitney Wolfe Herd had made the move \"having correctly intuited our collective burnout\".\nBumble has had a busier year than most firms, with a stock market debut, and rapid growth in user numbers.\nThe company announced in April \"that all Bumble employees will have a paid, fully offline one-week vacation in June\".\nA spokeswoman for Bumble said a few customer support staff will be working in case any of the app's users experience issues. These employees will then be given time off to make sure they take a whole week of leave. \nThe spokeswoman confirmed that the majority of Bumble's staff are taking the week off. \nBumble has grown in popularity during lockdown as boredom set in and swiping to find a match picked up.\nThe number of paid users across Bumble and Badoo, which Bumble also owns, spiked by 30% in the three months to 31 March, compared with the same period last year, according to its most recent set of results.\nMs Wolfe Herd also became the youngest woman, at 31, to take a company public in the US when she oversaw Bumble's stock market debut in February. \nShe rang the Nasdaq bell with her 18-month-old baby son on her hip and in her speech she said she wanted to make the internet \"a kinder, more accountable place\".\nBy Dearbail Jordan\nBumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd's quest to make the internet a \"kinder\" place extends to the company's head office. And then some.\nBack in 2017, the firm unveiled its new headquarters in Texas. Saturated in Bumble's signature yellow, wall mirrors are emblazoned with messages such as \"you look bee-autiful honey\". Even the light switches have slogans, telling people to \"shine bright like a diamond\".\nIt also boasts a \"Mommy Bar\" - described as a \"private lactation space\" by Ms Wolfe Herd - as well as fortnightly manicures, hair trims and \"blowouts\" which the founder said showed \"appreciation for our busy bees\".\nWorking hours? Not nine to five apparently. Employees can choose the hours they want, just as long as the work gets done.\nCould the UK see the same sort of office environment here? With many people spending so much time at home recently, perhaps companies will follow through on making changes to working life. Just don't hold out for free manicures though.  \nWorkers in other industries have complained about working long hours and the effect on their well-being. \nEarlier this year, a group of younger bankers at Goldman Sachs warned they would be forced to quit unless conditions improved. They said they were working an average of 95 hours a week and slept five hours a night.\nA spokeswoman for the investment bank said at the time: \"A year into Covid, people are understandably quite stretched, and that's why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them.\"\nPrior to Covid, one of the most high-profile examples of overwork emerged in when Antonio Horta-Osorio, then the relatively new chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, was forced to take a leave of absence. After joining the bank in January 2011, Mr Horta-Osorio took eight weeks off from November after prolonged insomnia led to exhaustion.\nFollowing his return, Mr Horta-Osorio - now chairman of Credit Suisse - led a re-evaluation at the bank on the importance of mental health. \nBumble made its announcement after several tech companies have unveiled their plans for remote working as the economy reopens.\nTwitter has said that it expects a majority of its staff to spend some time working remotely and some time in the office. That's despite its boss Jack Dorsey initially saying that employees could work from home \"forever\".\nAnd Google rejigged its timetable for bringing people back to the workplace. As of 1 September, employees wishing to work from home for more than 14 days a year would have to apply to do so.\nBut Apple employees have launched a campaign pushing back against boss Tim Cook's plans for a widespread return to the office, according to media reports earlier in June.\nIt followed an all-staff memo in which the Apple chief executive said workers should be in the office at least three days a week by September.\nThe key to coping with burnout is control, according to experts. \"Not everyone has the option of leaving their job but it's about doing what you can with the things you can control,\" says Siobhan Murray, author of 'The Burnout Solution'.\nCary Cooper, president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester, says it is \"important that individuals take control of their environment to manage the hours they work and ensure that they're socially connected.\" He advises:\nBut companies must play their part too, says Trades Union Congress health and safety officer, Shelly Asquith. Stress is an \"occupational hazard\" she says and it \"requires risk assessment and management to protect the wellbeing of staff\". \nOther companies, such as accountancy firm KPMG, have introduced new measures to combat the fatigue some workers might feel after more than a year of working in a less-than-ideal home set-up.\nVoice-only meetings, for example, are now required on Fridays to reduce the need for video calls.\nIt is in stark contrast to comments made by KPMG's UK chairman, Bill Michael, in February when he told colleagues to \"stop moaning\" during a virtual meeting discussing the pandemic and possible cuts to their pay, bonuses and pensions.   \nAccording to the Financial Times, Mr Michael also told employees to stop \"playing the victim card\". Mr Michael has since apologised and resigned."

      "text": "Ministers are \"working on\" plans for quarantine-free travel from amber list countries for people who are fully vaccinated, Matt Hancock has said.\nHe said the plans for England had not been \"clinically advised yet\".\nBut the health secretary said the government was looking at plans to allow the vaccine to \"bring back\" some freedoms.\nCurrently travellers arriving from countries on the red or amber travel lists have to isolate for 10 days.\nAsked on Sky News if the measure could be in place as soon as August, Mr Hancock said: \"We'll get there when it's safe to do so.\"\nInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine she would not speculate about what was going to happen in terms of travel, but said the government was looking at what it could do to \"ease up requirements where it makes sense\".\nShe said: \"We're not ready to make an announcement yet, but fundamentally what we need to do is - while keeping people safe - making sure we're freeing up the rules as much as we can.\"\nResponding to Mr Hancock's comments, Green MP Caroline Lucas, vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said scrapping quarantine measures would be \"reckless\" and called for the government to focus on upgrading systems at airports.\n\"The Delta variant first arrived here in the UK precisely because of inadequate pre-travel requirements and health checks at UK arrival halls, compounded by a lack of support and enforcement of mandatory quarantine,\" she said.\nUnder the current rules for England, arrivals from red list destinations such as India and South Africa must isolate in a government approved hotel for 10 days. \nThose coming from amber countries must quarantine for 10 days, with tests to be taken on days two and eight after return, but they do not need to be in a hotel.\nIt may be possible to end quarantine early in England by paying for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme.\nThe vast majority of countries are on the amber list.\nArrivals from the few green list countries - which includes a small number of countries including Israel and Iceland - do not have to quarantine but must book a test for day two of their return.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are following similar rules.\nAndrew Flintham, from travel firm Tui, said it had become an interested party in the legal action taken against the government by Manchester Airports Group, alongside Ryanair, British Airways' parent company IAG and Virgin Atlantic about how the government manages and publishes the green travel list.\n\"At the time of the last country review, many destinations such as Malta, the Greek islands and the Balearics had much lower rates than the UK,\" he told a conference organised by the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta).\n\"It was inexplicable as to why these were not added and instead Portugal was moved straight from green to amber, without the slightest sign of stopping at the much-vaunted green watchlist.\"\nMark Tanzer, of Abta, urged ministers to \"put aside any misguided prejudices against outbound travel\".\nHe added that the amount of state support given to travel firms is \"way behind\" the situation in other countries.\nOn Monday, the prime minister said the government was considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK if they took daily tests.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was \"cautiously hopeful\" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme, with the next \"checkpoint\" taking place on 28 June.\nThe health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that England remained \"on track\" for the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions on 19 July, with case rates \"slowing\" and hospitalisations \"not rising quickly\".\nHe said the number of people dying from Covid in England remained \"very, very low\" and said this showed the \"vaccine was working\".\nMr Hancock also warned that the coming winter could be \"challenging\", but said that he hoped the government would not have to bring back restrictions.\nMore than 43.1 million people (81.9% of the population) have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and nearly 31.5 million (59.8%) have had a second, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.\nThe UK has reported a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test on Tuesday, and another 11,625 cases. \nThe Office for National Statistics said infections were continuing to increase in England but the \"trend is uncertain\" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe number of hospital admissions for Covid has jumped by a third in the last week with the latest data showing four consecutive days of more than 200 admissions.\nA month ago we had three days of under 100 admissions so the change is very clear.\nBut that just tells you part of the story. Ministers have spoken about vaccinations breaking the link between cases and hospitalisations.\nThat has not happened, but it has certainly been weakened.\nDuring the winter wave around 10% of infections being diagnosed ended up in hospital 10 days later.\nCurrently it looks to be around 3%. That is a significant difference. But it still means if infection rates keep climbing as they are we could see in excess of 1,000 admissions a day later in the summer.\nThat is what the NHS would expect to see in the depths of a bad winter for all types of respiratory illness.\nThe hope is that the \"wall of immunity\" built up by the vaccination programme will kick in before we reach that point and help reduce infection levels and then admissions."

      "text": "The government should drop its \"disproportionate\" plan to ban noisy protests in England and Wales, a parliamentary committee has warned.\nThe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill would also introduce powers to deal with demonstrations involving only one person.\nThe Joint Committee on Human Rights said the legislation could undermine freedom of expression.\nBut the Home Office said it would not \"impinge\" on the right to protest.\nExisting laws are out of date and \"disruptive and dangerous tactics\" have to be dealt with, a spokeswoman added.\nThe committee's chairwoman, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, said the plans were \"oppressive and wrong\".\nThe bill says group protests should not be loud enough to cause \"serious unease, alarm or distress\" to people \"in the vicinity\".\nA noise limit would also apply to a single person if they caused \"serious disruption\" or if they \"may have a relevant impact on\" people nearby.\nIn a report highly critical of the bill, the committee, which advises MPs and peers on the compatibility of all government bills with human rights laws, called for \"statutory protection\" for the right to hold protests to be introduced.\nIt added that councils should be told to \"refrain from interfering unlawfully\" with them and be given \"the duty to facilitate protest\".\nThe report also said the language used in the bill left an \"excessive degree of judgement in the hands of a police officer\".\nAnd it described the proposed limits on single-person protests as \"unprecedented\".\nThis legislation comes after repeated city centre occupations by the Extinction Rebellion movement - and last year's toppling of the statue of a Bristol slave trader and municipal benefactor. \nThe committee said allowing police to set noise limits could silence lawful and peaceful chants - and the most popular demonstrations could face restrictions on duration and location, interfering with the right to assembly. \nIt also urges the government not to create powers to interfere with public demonstrations held by a single person and warns that a new crime of causing a public nuisance is too vague to be understood. \nMPs and peers don't need to act on the report, but the legislation has already triggered its own protests.\nAnd there are predictions it could lead to years of legal battles all the way to the Supreme Court.\nCommenting on the plans, committee chairwoman Ms Harman said: \"One of our most fundamental rights is to protest. It is the essence of our democracy.\n\"To do that, we need to make ourselves heard. The government proposals to allow police to restrict 'noisy' protests are oppressive and wrong.\"\nMPs have already backed the bill in principle and it is currently undergoing detailed scrutiny.\nIt also outlines stronger police powers to break up \"unauthorised encampments\" and longer sentences for people convicted of serious crimes.\nThe government said existing public order laws needed updating because \"the use of disruptive and dangerous tactics - including obstructing emergency vehicles or blocking the free press - costs millions to the taxpayer and causes misery to businesses and local communities\".\n\"The right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy,\" a Home Office spokeswoman said. \"Our proposed measures are in line with human rights legislation and in no way impinge on the right to protest.\"\nThe bill would allow police to \"better manage demonstrations so that legitimate protest groups can make their voices heard without disrupting the lives and livelihoods of others\", she added."

      "text": "Plans to ease Covid restrictions in England on 19 July are \"looking good\", the prime minister has said.\nBoris Johnson said that was based on the efficacy of vaccines against identified variants.\nBut he warned there could be a \"rough winter for all sorts of reasons\", including a resurgence of flu.\nIt comes as the health secretary said he hoped to exempt fully vaccinated people from the requirement to isolate for 10 days when contact-traced.\nAsked during on a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire whether he could rule out further lockdowns this winter, Mr Johnson said: \"You can never exclude that there will be some new disease, some new horror that we simply haven't budgeted for, or accounted for.\n\"But looking at where we are, looking at the efficacy of the vaccines against all variants that we can currently see - so Alpha, Delta, the lot of them, Kappa - I think it's looking good for 19 July to be that terminus point.\"\nHis comments came after Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the government's advisory committee on vaccination, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that flu \"could be potentially a bigger problem this winter than Covid.\"\nFlu immunity is likely to have dropped in the population as a result of low prevalence because of lockdowns, and it could come \"back to bite us\", he said.\nMr Johnson said the risk of a \"rough winter\" was \"all the more reason to reduce the number of Covid cases now, give the NHS the breathing space it needs to get on with dealing with all those other pressures, and we are certainly going to be putting in the investment to make sure that they can\".\nMeanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that he hoped to bring in a new approach to self-isolation to reflect the changing situation as the country opens up more and more.\nFor the past two months, a pilot study has been under way in which 40,000 people who have been named as contacts of someone who has tested positive for Covid have been allowed to take daily Covid tests and continue with their lives, rather than having to self-isolate. \n\"We're piloting that now to check that will be effective and it is something that we're working on,\" the health secretary said.\n\"We're not ready to be able to take that step yet. But it's something that I want to see and we will introduce, subject to clinical advice, as soon as it's reasonable to do so.\"\nThe trial is not expected to be completed until later in the summer. \nCurrently, anybody who has been told by NHS Test and Trace that they are a contact of somebody who has tested positive for the virus must self-isolate for 10 days.\nThis means not leaving home at all - even to buy food or medicines, or for exercise.  \nThe rule applies to people regardless of whether they have received a coronavirus jab. \nSo far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two doses of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose.\nMore than one million jabs were booked on Friday and Saturday in England, after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. \nThere have been a further five deaths within 28 days of testing positive in the UK, according to the government's daily figures - and 10,633 new cases.\nThe prime minister said the government was also looking at using daily tests for travellers.\nAsked whether ministers were considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK if they took daily tests, Mr Johnson told reporters: \"When it comes to travel, we'll certainly be looking at that. \n\"But I want to stress this is going to be, whatever happens, a difficult year for travel - there will be hassle, there will be delays, I'm afraid, because the priority has got to be to keep the country safe and to stop the virus coming back in.\"\nCurrently, people arriving in the UK from a country on the government's amber list must quarantine for 10 days - regardless of whether they have had a coronavirus jab.\nHowever, in England an individual may be able to end their quarantine period early if they pay for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was \"cautiously hopeful\" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. \nHe said the government had always committed to regularly review their international travel plan, with the next \"checkpoint\" taking place on 28 June.  \nHe said that the checkpoints would look at whether the \"science would support\" relaxations including people who have received two vaccine doses no longer have to quarantine after returning from certain countries. \nThe original date the government had planned to remove all legal limits on social contact in England was 21 June - but this has been delayed to allow more people to be vaccinated. \nHowever, some restrictions have still been eased. \nThe number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue.\nAnd in Wales, rules are also being lifted slightly, including capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size.\nIn Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictions has been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotland are expected to be extended until mid-July.

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: What will the next few months be like?",
      "text": "Scotland has put the brakes on easing Covid restrictions this summer and it is all down to the new Delta variant that first emerged in India. \nWe may have seen it coming but that doesn't stop a familiar anxiety creeping across our shoulders. Despite confident assertions from the first minister that this is just \"a pause\", we have been here before. \nThe good news is that scientists do not seem to be overly worried. \nScotland may have the highest infection rate in Europe but it also has one of the highest vaccination rates and the jabs are doing their job.\nProf Aziz Sheikh is the director of Edinburgh University's Usher Institute for Population Health.  \nHis team has been working with Public Health Scotland to track the pandemic in real time.  \nTheir latest research, published in the Lancet this week, does raise some concerns about the Delta variant.  \nThey found that not only was it more infectious than the Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, but that the risk of hospital admission was double.  \nBut Prof Sheikh says vaccines are providing good levels of protection. \n\"The vaccines overall are still very effective which is fantastic news, and that's both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,\" he says. \n\"But there seems to be a bit of a delay with the vaccines exerting their maximum effectiveness, so the key message here is that the second dose is really important, and what we need to do after that is give people a couple of weeks to mount their immune response.\"\nThat's one reason to buy more time.  \nJust over 56% of the adult population in Scotland has had two doses but almost 900,000 people - one in every five adults - are still completely unvaccinated.\nSo keeping existing restrictions will allow many more people the chance to get at least one jab.  \nThe scientists also want time to monitor the data in detail.  \nThere has been an increase in the number of people in hospital over the past few weeks.  \nIt's nothing like the rise we saw in previous waves, and it appears that this time patients tend to be younger, less likely to need intensive care, and stay in for shorter periods - meaning the pressure on the NHS is less intense.  \nA few more weeks of data gathering will allow a clearer picture of what is going to emerge.\nYou could see this wave of infections as a test.  \nBy mid-July we will know how well we've coped and the rest of the summer could look a lot brighter. But that doesn't mean Covid is banished from our lives. \nProf Emma Thomson is an infectious diseases consultant working with Covid patients at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.  \nShe is also one of the leading scientists behind the UK's efforts to identify and monitor new variants and is running a trial in Scotland to investigate the role of booster jags.\nShe compares the role of vaccines to a dam, holding back the virus. \nAs restrictions ease, she says, we're asking the vaccines to work harder to do that and so far they're succeeding.  \nBut we are starting to seeing chinks where the virus is breaking through the dam - with new variants for example -  so it needs to be constantly reinforced.  \nFor now that means speeding up second doses, but as time goes on, scientists will need to continuously adapt the vaccines to plug more holes, and to make sure they maintain the advantage and stop the virus overwhelming us again.   \nProf Thomson says the virus is here to stay in the medium term.  \n\"Most of us think that we are going to be stuck with it, possibly for years to come.,\" she says.\n\"The key thing that we need to do is to get ahead of it.  And if we can get ahead of it with booster vaccines or with adapted vaccines then it becomes something for us to worry about as health professionals, and it becomes less of a major strain on the country.\"\nThat's why sequencing and monitoring new variants is so important.\nAt Glasgow University's Centre for Virus Research, they made an early call to put all other work on hold to do that, last March.  \nProf David Robertson, head of bioinformatics, explains that the Delta variant was introduced to the UK hundreds of times in hundreds of locations, since it was first detected in early April.  \nHe says the speed with which it became the dominant variant took experts by surprise. But the big question now is when and how the next powerful mutation will arise. \n\"What is predictable is that the virus will continue to evolve and the ability to escape the human immune response is inevitable,\" he says. \n\"We really just don't know the timeline that that will emerge on, so it seems wise to proceed on the assumption that worse mutations will emerge sooner rather than later. \n\"It won't be tomorrow, and it's not five years - but it's somewhere in between. \n\"So keeping our surveillance systems in place and making sure not too much virus is circulating seems wise. That's how this will become normal in the longer term.\"\nHopefully it will soon be an issue that only worries the scientists - allowing the rest of society to slowly reset. \nIn the meantime, politicians will have to wrestle with what might be acceptable levels of coronavirus - an equation that gets ever more difficult to answer."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is expected to confirm a delay to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland later.\nThe first minister signalled last week the move to level zero - the lowest in the five-tier system - was likely to be pushed back by three weeks.\nOriginally set for 28 June, it could be delayed until at least mid-July so more people can be vaccinated.\nMs Sturgeon has also promised to publish a much-anticipated review of social distancing rules.\nShe is expected to give an indication of what life could look like once the country has transitioned to level zero and beyond.\nWhile large parts of Scotland moved into level one earlier this month, and some islands went down to level zero, many parts of the central belt remain in level two, where there are stricter limits on the size of groups that can meet.\nThe first minister has previously indicated that it was unlikely any area would move down a level on 28 June.\nInstead, she suggested the current level of restrictions was likely to remain until 19 July - the same date Prime Minister Boris Johnson has targeted as a \"terminus\" for England's lockdown restrictions. \nIn Wales, lockdown rules are being reviewed again on 15 July, while the next planned easing in Northern Ireland is set for 5 July.\nMs Sturgeon is expected to update MSPs in a statement to the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood at about 14:20 BST on Tuesday.\nThe number of Covid cases in Scotland has been steadily rising since early May.\nAnother 1,250 new Covid cases were reported in Scotland on Monday, 7.2% of all the new tests taken.\nFigures showed there were 158 people in hospital with a recently confirmed case of Covid, with 14 of those needing intensive care.\nMs Sturgeon said last week that the reason for the likely pause in easing restrictions was to \"buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus\".\n\"Doing that will give us the best chance, later in July, of getting back on track and restoring the much greater normality that we all crave,\" she added.\nBy Monday morning, 3,647,437 people in Scotland had received the first dose of the Covid vaccination, with 2,586,970 having received their second dose.\nMs Sturgeon said on Friday that all adults in Scotland should have been offered a first dose of the vaccine by the end of this week, and all adults will have received a first dose by 18 July - almost two weeks ahead of schedule.\nThe likely delay to ending restrictions has already been criticised by the hospitality industry, which has warned of the potential of \"another lost summer\".\nMembers of the Scottish travel industry will also lobby both Holyrood and the Westminster parliaments this week urging greater support.\nOn Monday they sent an open letter accusing the first minister of \"banning\" them from operating - other than \"in name only\" - with impractical Covid rules. \nBefore her latest Covid statement on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon will face a topical question at Holyrood from Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson, asking on what basis the government has introduced a ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford.\nMs Sturgeon defended the ban on Monday after an angry reaction from Greater Manchester's mayor, Andy Burnham. She insisted it was a public health measure based on Covid levels in the area.\nMr Burnham condemned the fact he was given no advance warning of the travel ban, and called on the Scottish government to compensate those who are now out of pocket.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?
