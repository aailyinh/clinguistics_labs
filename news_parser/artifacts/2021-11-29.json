      "title": "Magdalena Andersson: Sweden's first female PM returns after resignation",
      "tags": "Sweden",
      "text": "Sweden's first female prime minister has been reappointed to the top job after political turmoil forced her to resign within hours of taking the post last week.\nMPs backed Social Democratic Party leader Magdalena Andersson by a narrow margin in a new vote on Monday.\nShe will attempt to lead a one-party government until an election in September next year.\nShe stood down as PM last Wednesday after her coalition collapsed.\nJust hours earlier, Ms Andersson had been elected as Sweden's first female prime minister by a single vote in parliament.\nBut the 54-year-old economist's plan for forming a new coalition government with the Green Party was thrown into disarray when her budget proposal failed to pass.\nInstead, parliament voted for a budget drawn up by a group of opposition parties, including the far-right Sweden Democrats.\nThe Green Party said it would not accept a budget drafted by the far-right and walked away from the government, leading to its demise.\nBy convention, the prime minister in Sweden is expected to resign if a coalition party leaves government.\nIn Monday's vote in Sweden's parliament, the Riksdag, 101 of its 349 members voted yes, 75 abstained and 173 voted no.\nTo be appointed prime minister under Sweden's political system, a candidate only needs to avoid a majority voting against them.\nAt a news conference after the vote, Ms Andersson said she was ready to \"take Sweden forward\" with a programme focused on welfare, climate change and crime.\nBut without the support of other parties, Ms Andersson will struggle to pass legislation in parliament, where the centre-left Social Democrats hold 100 of 349 seats.\nAfter a week of drama, Magdalena Andersson's prime ministerial career is back on track, but Sweden's political soap opera is far from over.\nMs Andersson still has to implement a budget put together by some of her right-wing rivals. Plus, she's got to govern a fragile minority without the formal support of the Greens, who've been a crucial coalition partner since 2014.\nAll this has highlighted the complexities of having a deeply divided eight-party parliament. Some political commentators here are worried that Ms Andersson's chaotic rise to power may have dented trust in the entire political system.\nOnce formed, Ms Andersson's new government will remain in place until general elections, which are set to take place in September next year. Until then, she's got just over nine months to prove herself to the public.\nA former junior swimming champion from the university city of Uppsala, Ms Andersson began her political career in 1996 as political adviser to then-Prime Minister Goran Persson.\nShe has spent the past seven years as finance minister before becoming leader of the Social Democrats at the start of November.\nShe replaced Stefan Lofven, who resigned as prime minister after seven years in power.\nUntil Ms Andersson took over, Mr Lofven had remained prime minister of a caretaker government after being ousted in an unprecedented vote of no confidence in June."

      "tags": "SNP Conference,Nicola Sturgeon,Ian Blackford,Scottish independence,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "The SNP is to table a motion of censure over the leadership of Prime Minister Boris Johnson at Westminster.\nThe party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford told SNP conference delegates that Mr Johnson should be held to account for his \"disastrous actions\".\nHe said his party would act as the \"real opposition\" by tabling a motion rebuking the prime minister on Tuesday.\nMr Johnson has insisted that his UK government is \"delivering for the people of this country\".\nThe Conservative administration has a working majority of 77 seats in the House of Commons, meaning it is unlikely Mr Blackford's motion will pass.\nHowever, the SNP MP said it was important the prime minister was held to account, saying: \"Unless he faces consequences for his disastrous actions, he won't just think he's gotten away with the mess he has made of the last few months - he will think he can do it all over again\".\nThe party had tweeted that the motion was to underline that Scots have \"no confidence\" in Mr Johnson's leadership, but the party later clarified that it will not in fact be a formal motion of no confidence.\nIn his speech to the SNP's virtual party conference, delivered from his home in Skye, Mr Blackford criticised the \"chaotic governance\" within Downing Street.\nHe said a recent speech where Mr Johnson lost his place in his notes before making reference to cartoon character Peppa Pig was evidence that the prime minister is \"becoming deeper and deeper out of his depth\".\nThe SNP Westminster leader said he would table a censure motion during the SNP's opposition debating time on Tuesday, saying Mr Johnson had produced an \"omnibus of omnishambles\" in his time as prime minister.\nLabour has also attacked Mr Johnson's performance, with leader Keir Starmer saying he is \"taking the country absolutely nowhere\", breaking promises to voters and \"delivering high taxes, high prices and low growth\".\nMr Johnson has defended his record, pointing in particular to employment figures and the rollout of the vaccine programme.\nHe told MPs on Wednesday: \"We are delivering for the working people of this country. We are fixing the problems that they thought could never be fixed, and we are doing things that they thought were impossible.\n\"There are now more people in work in this country than there were before the pandemic began. That is because of policies that this government has followed.\"\nMr Blackford told the conference that independence was the best way for Scotland to escape the \"constant crisis\" of the UK - claiming that it is \"within grasp\".\nThe MP told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show that a bill would be tabled and passed by the pro-independence SNP and Green parties at Holyrood \"over the course of the coming period\", and that a vote would be held in 2023 \"in an ideal set of circumstances\".\nHowever, there have been questions over when the Covid-19 pandemic will have abated sufficiently to allow the national debate Mr Blackford said he was \"absolutely desperate\" to have, and whether legislation brought forward at Holyrood could be challenged at the Supreme Court.\nAsked by the BBC's Andrew Marr whether concerns about the new Omicron variant could affect the SNP's timetable for a referendum, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that steering Scotland through the pandemic would be her main focus and priority \"for as long as necessary\".\nShe said: \"I made a statement in parliament on Tuesday where I was really hopeful that we were starting to turn the corner. Clearly a few days on the situation looks potentially very different with the arrival of a new variant.\n\"I think if I stood up in front of my party and told them that I alone in the world could see when this Covid pandemic was going to end, then people would look at me askance.\"\nMs Sturgeon wants to strike an agreement with UK ministers to hold a vote - as happened for the 2014 referendum - but has been rebuffed by successive prime ministers.\nBoth Theresa May and Boris Johnson have said the time is not right for a fresh vote, with Mr Johnson arguing that UK-wide responses to the pandemic like the vaccine programme and furlough scheme underline the \"merits of the union\".\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"This is not the time for divisive constitutional arguments.\n\"Now more than ever, people in Scotland want to see the UK and Scottish governments working together to protect lives, jobs and recover from the effects of Covid-19 on our economy and public services.\""

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Cyril Ramaphosa,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "South Africa's president has condemned travel bans enacted against his country and its neighbours over the new coronavirus variant Omicron. \nCyril Ramaphosa said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the action, which he described as unjustified, and called for the bans to be urgently lifted. \nThe UK, EU and US are among those who have imposed travel bans.\nOmicron has been classed as a \"variant of concern\". Early evidence suggests it has a higher re-infection risk.\nThe heavily mutated variant was detected in South Africa earlier this month and then reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) last Wednesday.\nThe variant is responsible for most of the infections found in South Africa's most populated province, Gauteng, over the last two weeks, and the number of cases of \"appears to be increasing in almost all provinces\" in the country, according to the WHO.\nSouth Africa reported 2,800 new infections on Sunday, a rise from the daily average of 500 in the previous week.\nGovernment adviser and epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim said he expected the number of cases to reach more than 10,000 a day by the end of the week, and for hospitals to come under pressure in the next two to three weeks.  \nBut Health Minister Joe Phaahla said there was \"absolutely no need to panic\".\n\"We have been here before,\" he added, referring to the Beta variant identified in South Africa last December.\nOn Monday, Japan became the latest country to reinstate tough border restrictions, banning all foreigners from entering the country from 30 November.\nThe WHO has warned against countries hastily imposing travel curbs, saying they should look to a \"risk-based and scientific approach\". \nWHO's Africa director Matshidiso Moeti said on Sunday: \"With the Omicron variant now detected in several regions of the world, putting in place travel bans that target Africa attacks global solidarity.\"\nHowever, numerous bans have been introduced in recent days, with Rwanda and Angola being among the African states to restrict flights to and from South Africa. \nForeign ministry spokesman Clayson Monyela described their decision as \"quite regrettable, very unfortunate, and I will even say sad\".\nIn his speech on Sunday, Mr Ramaphosa said there was no scientific basis for the travel bans and that southern Africa was the victim of unfair discrimination.\nHe also argued that the bans would not be effective in preventing the spread of the variant.\n\"The only thing the prohibition on travel will do is to further damage the economies of the affected countries and undermine their ability to respond to, and recover from, the pandemic,\" he said.\nHe called on countries with bans in place to \"urgently reverse their decisions... before any further damage is done to our economies\".\nMr Ramaphosa said South Africa would not impose new restrictions, but would \"undertake broad consultations on making vaccination mandatory for specific activities and locations\". \nCurrent regulations in South Africa make it mandatory to wear face coverings in public, and restrict indoor gatherings to 750 people and outdoor gatherings to 2,000.\nThere are no vaccine shortages in South Africa itself, and Mr Ramaphosa urged more people to get jabbed, saying that remained the best way to fight the virus.\nHealth experts said that Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg, had entered a fourth wave, and most hospital admissions were of unvaccinated people. \nOmicron has now been detected in a number of countries around the world, including the UK, Germany, Australia and Israel.\nIn other developments:\nHave your travel plans been affected by the bans?

      "title": "New Covid variant: Will new measures against Omicron work?",
      "tags": "Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "In the past week a heavily mutated Covid variant has been identified, rapidly labelled a \"variant of concern\" by the World Health Organization and named Omicron. It has been detected in countries including the UK.\nIt is a rapidly evolving situation. Omicron's genetic profile has raised concerns, but there's a shortage of real-world data that means nobody has the complete picture of what it can do. \nIt is unclear how big a threat it poses. \nYet, it is at this early stage, in an absence of definitive facts and when there is a danger of both underreacting and overreacting, that the UK government has to act. \nIt's like you or me deciding whether to marry someone after the first date. Only the stakes are much higher. \nWhat we know is Omicron has mutations that theoretically help it to spread more quickly and there is mounting evidence of that happening in South Africa. \nIt also has mutations that theoretically make vaccines less effective and the World Health Organization says there is a higher risk of reinfection than with other variants.\nBut we don't know how transmissible it is. We don't know whether it is milder or more severe. We don't know what will really happen when it comes up against our significant wall of immunity built up through vaccines, boosters and high levels of Covid this autumn. \nThe government's response is to test everyone coming in to the UK, isolate all Omicron contacts, ramp up boosting and bring back compulsory face masks in some public places.\nLet's be clear - that will not stop more Omicron cases arriving or circulating. It's already arrived. If a virus is good at spreading then eventually it will slip through. \nAnd it has the potential to spread here too. Cases of Covid have been climbing except for a lull over the October half term. \nThey are averaging at more than 40,000 a day and the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - is just above the crucial threshold of one, which means cases are growing.\nThe government has been focusing on the pressure on hospitals and pre-Omicron this would have been a key factor in whether to tighten restrictions or go for Plan B. But despite the rise in cases, the numbers needing hospital care for Covid has actually been tumbling due to the success of booster vaccines. \nBut if the current Delta variant can spread here and Omicron combines faster transmission with some ability to evade immunity, then it too has the potential to circulate.\nAll the measures can do is buy time, but for what? Science and boosters.\nThere are important scientific questions that need answering and top of the list is what happens when Omicron meets high levels of immunity. The answer, for better or worse, will dictate what happens next. \nThe vaccines that have been used in the UK train the body to attack the spike protein on the virus - specifically the version of spike from the original variant from Wuhan in China. \nOur immune system learns to attack several parts of that spike. The antibodies in our blood are like a pit crew descending on a Formula 1 car - each going to their target area. But the mutations in Omicron are like changing some parts of the car to bamboozle the mechanics and make their job harder.\nAny dent to immunity is most likely to affect the odds of you catching Covid. What we've seen from the phenomenon of waning immunity is that protection against severe disease and death is more resilient. It will take time to know for sure.\nIt might sound odd, but booster doses could limit any impact. In theory you can compensate for a less efficient immune defence by simply throwing more antibodies and T-cells at the problem, even if they are imperfect.\nMore than 17 million people have already had a third dose and the government wants to ramp up boosting. Other countries have cut the gap between the second and third dose from six months to five and we should hear from the government's vaccine advisers soon. \nPharmaceutical companies say they could update vaccines to match the Omicron variant in around 100 days if they were needed. \nIt is worth noting we do have new weapons in our armoury in the form of anti-viral drugs. Paxlovid and molnupiravir both target the inner workings of the virus and experts have told me there is no suggestion their effectiveness would be knocked by the mutations seen so far. \nThere is also a desire to understand how sick people are getting with Omicron. It is often incorrectly claimed that a virus must become milder as it mutates. The reality is much more complicated and it will take time to get the answer as the country with the most confirmed cases, South Africa, has a relatively young population. The younger you are the milder Covid tends to be.\nThere are already cries that the government is both over-reacting and not going far enough. \nThe problem for all of us is we'll only know the right answer with hindsight.\nFollow James on Twitter"

They just wanted to do something. We are so grateful.\"\nShe said the dogs' heated lamps had gone out due to the power cut and the animals were \"freaking out\", with metal torn from the roof resembling a \"helicopter blade flying over head\".\nSP Energy Networks said about 1,000 properties had supplies restored on Monday morning, with 604 customers still off across north Wales and Aberystwyth in Ceredigion.\nMr O'Sullivan said it was the worst storm damage he had seen since about 2015 due to a large number of trees bringing down \"multiple spans\" of overhead power lines. \n\"There's debris that has caused fixtures and fittings to customers' properties to be pulled away, bringing down lines and then, obviously, with the sheer wind speed, there's a number of other structures that have caused us problems.\"\nOf the those still without power, he said: \"We're hoping to get the bulk of those restored today with with a small number going into be restored tomorrow.\"\nMeanwhile, the boss of a Bridgend pub said a staff member had a lucky escape after a large tree came down, narrowly avoiding her.\nManager Cheryl Pound was on a cigarette break after closing The Star pub when the tree was caught on camera toppling into the garden and patio area. \n\"She couldn't believe the DJ and the doorman hadn't heard anything,\" said landlady Barbara Jefferies.\nIn north Wales, The I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! contestants were removed from Gwrych Castle in Abergele due to Storm Arwen.\nLive episodes will not return until Tuesday, ITV has confirmed.\nCouncillor Tracey Brennan said the storm had been \"horrendous\" with some properties still without power.\nShe said the TV production's tents and marquees were \"literally shredded by the wind\".\n\"We're keeping fingers crossed that the show can go on,\" she said."

He died on 9 March 2021, aged 67. \nHis colleagues thought highly of him, saying: \"We have many happy memories of shifts together, laughs, nights out, and listening to all his stories of his many holidays abroad. We will miss him.\"\nBernadette White, his sister, said he was a caring, gentle and loving man with a wicked sense of humour. \nShe added: \"The last seven years, I would say, is when David started to live his life, doing the things that made him happy without having to worry about anyone else.\"\nStephen Stewart met his future wife, Heather, at a youth club when he was just 14. They got engaged on his 17th birthday and he had just turned 20 when they married. \nThe couple, who lived in Motherwell, came from \"very different\" backgrounds but they grew up together during their 25-year marriage while raising their only child. \nStephen took pride in his work for concrete manufacturer FP McCann, latterly as a lab technician working out what strength the concrete needed to be for certain projects. \nOutside work, he loved fishing, computer games, gadgets and during the first lockdown he managed to build a hot tub shelter with the help of a series of YouTube videos. \nHe died of Covid pneumonia at University Hospital Wishaw on 19 February 2021, aged 45.\nFamily of 45-year-old Covid victim warn of dangers\nNan Douglas worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career. \nShe was already a mother of three when she left her job as a school secretary at West Calder High School to enrol at Moray House in Edinburgh where she qualified as a primary school teacher. \nAfter losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. \nFollowing a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a \"living wake\" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. \nShe lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020. But she picked up Covid and never left. She died on 19 February 2021, aged 95. \nGraeme McGrath's greatest passions were rowing and the River Clyde. \nOn the day of his funeral, fellow rowers held oars in a guard of honour at Glasgow Green in a tribute appreciated by his wife Anne and their three sons.\nFor 40 years Graeme volunteered with the Glasgow Humane Society and was often called on to row rescue boats on the Clyde, or to help evacuate families during floods. \nAfter undergoing a kidney transplant in his 50s, he was unable to get out on the river as much. He retired from his job as a Thomas Cook travel agent and moved to Prestwick in Ayrshire. \nBut he still felt the pull of the Clyde and regularly returned to the city to meet friends and row safety boats at regattas. \nHe died with Covid on 15 February 2021 at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, aged 66, after being admitted for an infection affecting his heart. \nTommy Morrow spent most of his life in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, where he met his partner Jackie and raised their children, Demi and Mark. \nHis family described him as a character and not a day went by without them laughing at his jokes. \nHe loved camping and fishing in places like Stornoway with his friends but the most important people in his life were his family, including grandchildren, Lacey and Louden. \nDuring his career he worked in various well-known hotels and restaurants in Glasgow but he had not worked for some years due to poor health, including COPD. \nHe died with Covid on 15 February 2021, aged 53. \"It was so cruel - he was so close to getting the vaccine,\" his family said. \nTommy Rooney was a bus driver for 36 years and hugely popular with colleagues at First Bus in Larbert. \nOn the day of his funeral they were among dozens of people who lined the streets and applauded as his cortege passed the depot. \nFirst Bus operations manager Jason Hackett told the Falkirk Herald that Tommy was the \"heart and soul\" of the Larbert station. \nMarried to Margaret, the Bonnybridge man had two daughters and a granddaughter who described him as a \"humble but proud family man who put everyone else's needs before his own\". \nAn avid Celtic fan, he spent much of the pandemic driving key workers to their essential duties. He died on 12 February 2021, aged 57. \nDavid Gray's first grandchild - a girl called Islay - was born in July 2020. The proud \"papa\" used to say that she was the love of his life and she gave him a reason to wake up in the morning. \nTragically, the 62-year-old only got to spend five months with her before falling ill with Covid. He died on 3 February 2021. \nDavid lived in Erskine and worked for BAE Systems for 20 years, first as a mechanical fitter then as records manager dealing with secret files for the Ministry of Defence. \nHis family describe him as \"music daft\" - he played guitar and he was performing a gig with his band in Glasgow when he met his wife, Joyce, 40 years ago. \nThey went on to have two children - Darren and Danielle - as well as his beloved Cocker Spaniels, Buster and Shimmer, who he described as his \"bairns\". \nHarry Osborne was a Dunkirk veteran whose life was full of adventures - his daughter said he was still able to recall stories until just a few days before he died. \nMr Osborne was deployed to France months after joining the Territorial Army in Glasgow, served with the 77th Highland Field Regiment of the Royal Artillery and later became a surveyor.\nFriends recall how upon joining, he promised his mother he would not swear and instead would say \"cricky jings\", which became his nickname in the forces.\nHe was also known as a keen golfer with a \"wicked sense of humour\".\nMr Osborne died from Covid-19 on 25 January, nine months after celebrating his 100th birthday. \nConnie Simpson's grandchildren say she was more like a pal than a granny - she was full of fun and laughter, and was always the first up to dance at a party. \nBorn in Kinning Park, Glasgow, she moved to the east end after marrying John who she met at the Barrowlands when they were teenagers. \nWhile John was away with the Merchant Navy, she brought up their four children in a house \"surrounded by love\", before taking work as a curtain consultant. \nShe was fabulous even in her 80s - she loved getting her hair, eyebrows and manicure done, meeting friends at Mecca Bingo in Parkhead and at a local pensioners' club. \nConnie died on 23 January 2021 at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow, aged 82. \nSheila Gartly was as \"bright as a button\" and the \"heart of our family\", her loved ones said. \nShe was born and brought up in Deskford, Moray, before marrying and moving to Keith in 1954. Widowed in 1975, she remarried but lost her second husband in 2005. \nDuring her working life she had jobs in a florist and in a fish shop - both of which she thoroughly enjoyed. \nShe loved to watch the birds in her garden, read her daily newspaper, listen to traditional Scottish music, and the spring and summer when the nights were lighter and flowers bloomed.\nIn 2019 she had surgery on a broken leg but she was recovering well.  She died with Covid on 19 January 2021, aged 86. \nAlex Goldie was an electrical engineer who latterly worked as a lecturer at Stow College in Glasgow before his retirement. \nHis family said he was a gregarious man, always interested in other people, who took great delight and pride in the antics and education of his two great-grandsons, Charlie and Joe. \nDuring his long life he enjoyed skiing, tennis, pottery, sailing, golf, holidays in Europe, Australia and North America, single malts and red wine. \nHe had been well cared for by Randolph Hill nursing home in Dunblane for 19 months after developing dementia.

      "tags": "SNP Conference,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "The Scottish child payment will increase to \u00a320 per week from April, Nicola Sturgeon has announced.\nThe first minister said more than 100,000 children under the age of six would benefit from the payments.\nThe Scottish government is aiming to expand the payment to all under-16s by the end of 2022, with more than 400,000 children and their families eligible.\nMs Sturgeon said the move was \"the boldest and most ambitious anti-poverty measure anywhere in the UK\".\nShe told the SNP conference that it would involve \"hard choices elsewhere in our budget\", but said eradicating child poverty was \"essential\" to Scotland's future.\nThe child benefit was set up as part of the new Social Security Scotland agency in the previous Holyrood term after more welfare powers were devolved to Scotland.\nMs Sturgeon originally set out the pledge to double it from \u00a310 to \u00a320 per week ahead of May's Holyrood election - at a point when statistics suggested child poverty levels in Scotland had been \"gradually rising\" even prior to the pandemic.\nAt that time, the first minister said it would take until the end of 2022 to get the system fully up and running and delivering monthly payments, with a \"bridging\" system in place in the meantime.\nHowever in her SNP conference speech, she said cash would be committed in the Scottish government's next budget to start payments from April of next year.\nShe said: \"That means the doubled payments will reach over 100,000 children under age six in just four months' time. \n\"Delivering it isn't easy. It will involve hard choices elsewhere in our budget. But it is a choice we in the SNP - in partnership with the Greens - are opting to make.\n\"Poverty scars too many childhoods. It deprives too many children of the chance to make the most of their education and enjoy life to the full, and it robs of our country of far too much potential. \n\"Eradicating child poverty is essential if we are to build the strongest foundation for Scotland's future.\"\nA report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in October had called for the payment to be doubled \"as soon as possible\".\nBut it said that even if this was to happen, the Scottish government would still miss its interim child poverty targets in 2024 by about 4% unless additional measures were also urgently taken.\nThe foundation called for a \"far greater scale and pace of activity\" in supporting single-parent households and minority ethnic families in particular.\nMs Sturgeon also pointed to the doubling of free childcare hours and the delivery of 200,000 baby boxes as evidence her government is \"determined to lift children out of poverty\".\nShe said the budget would include \"significant\" extra funding for the NHS, along with \u00a330m to help GPs increase primary care services in communities\nMuch of the speech focused on the Covid-19 pandemic, with Ms Sturgeon telling delegates that the Omicron variant is \"causing profound concern\".\nShe urged people to get vaccinated, saying this was \"the most precious gift we can give this Christmas\".\nThis speech, necessarily, underwent a significant rewrite over the weekend as the new Covid variant began to emerge. \nNicola Sturgeon repeatedly told SNP members her first priority and duty would be to deal with the pandemic. \nHowever, she's still working on the basis that it will let up in the New Year and that the independence campaign can \"resume in earnest\" in 2022. \nThe caveat, of course, is \"Covid permitting\". \nShe has also re-committed to doing what's needed to \"enable a referendum before the end of 2023\". \nA timetable the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford has already suggested is possible in an \"ideal set of circumstances\". \nMaking it happen would include bringing forward a referendum bill at Holyrood and formally requesting the UK government to agree to hold the vote. \nWithout that explicit consent, it may fall to the UK Supreme Court to decide whether or not indyref2 can go ahead. \nThe SNP leader also spoke about her goal of holding a new independence referendum, having said on Sunday that she did not know how the new Covid variant could affect her plans.\nShe told delegates that \"in the course of the next year, I will initiate the process necessary to enable a referendum before the end of 2023\".\nAnd she said the party would \"set out afresh the positive case for independence\", with a focus on how it could allow Scots to \"repair the damage of Covid in a way that aligns with our values and priorities as a nation\".\nMs Sturgeon wants to secure an agreement with UK ministers to hold a binding referendum, as happened in 2014, but has been repeatedly rebuffed by Downing Street.\nShe said Prime Minister Boris Johnson should agree to \"let the people decide\" if he had any confidence in his arguments against independence.\nHowever, a UK government spokesperson said \"this is not the time for divisive constitutional arguments\".\nThey added: \"Now more than ever, people in Scotland want to see the UK and Scottish governments working together to protect lives, jobs and recover from the effects of Covid-19 on our economy and public services.\"\nMeanwhile Scottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie welcomed the announcement on the doubling of the child payment, but said it was \"deeply disappointing and irresponsible\" for Ms Sturgeon to focus on \"sowing division between Scotland and the rest of the UK\"."

Last Monday there were 378 Covid-19 inpatients. \nMr Givan said that similar measures in the Republic of Ireland had not worked and again called for the acceleration of the booster scheme rollout which he described as \"the single most effective measure we can take\".\nBusinesses have said there is a lack of clarity around the scheme and how they should enforce it.\nOn Friday, Health Minister Robin Swann said unlicensed premises like cafes would be exempt from the rule at this stage.\nThe Department of Health tweeted on Monday that the regulations had commenced, although they are due to be debated at a later date in the assembly.\nPublished on Monday afternoon, the regulations said businesses must have a system for checking people \"as soon as is reasonably practicable\" when they enter premises.\nFrom 29 November, either proof of vaccination, a negative lateral flow test or a positive PCR test for access to:\nThere will be no enforcement until 13 December to allow for the scheme to be \"bedded in\",  the Department of Health said in a statement last week (DoH).\nThe department said the phased approach followed feedback from the retail, hospitality, tourism and events sectors.\nIt said Covid certification can \"reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings\" as vaccinated people are \"less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people\".\n\"There is also evidence, from several studies worldwide, that even when people get infected, if they are vaccinated they are less likely to transmit it to others,\" it continued.\nCoffee shop owner Scott King said he believed it was \"inevitable\" that businesses like his would soon have to check Covid certification as well. \n\"It's only a matter of time before [Omicron] comes over here,\" Mr King told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"I can see more and more restrictions probably coming in place in the course of the next couple of weeks.\"\nMr King, who is based in Armagh, said Covid certification checks on entry could cost his business an extra \u00a3120 per day.\nMichael McAdam, of Movie House cinema chain, said members of the public will be asked for Covid certificates from Monday. \n\"If you're going to the cinema or going to the theatre tonight, you will be asked, and we're required by law to ask you, what your status is,\" he said. \n\"I think it's probably for the better.\"\nMr McAdam said if it drives up the number getting the Covid vaccination, \"it's probably for the better\".\nStephen Megarian, the managing director of a Belfast pub chain, said it felt \"unfair\" that licensed venues had been \"put in the front line\".\n\"It's just an added difficulty at a very difficult time,\" Mr Magorrian told Good Morning Ulster.\nHe said his business could not afford to face fines for not implementing Covid certification checks.\n\"We've used up our reserves we had in place already,\" he said.\n\"We can't afford to put our licence in jeopardy.\"\nMr Magorrian said his customers were confused about what was required of them, adding: \"We're going to have to be advising and telling them, if they turn up with the wrong stuff, what they need.\"\nDeclan Jordan, manager of a pub and restaurant in Londonderry, said he was frustrated with Stormont's messaging around the Covid vaccine passport. \n\"I'm very annoyed that they [the NI Executive] are just telling us that we have to start enforcing this today, not legally until another two weeks, but they can't tell us exactly what we have to do.\n\"We are trying to operate a business and we are trying to stay open, but we may need to take another employee in to just look after the Covid vaccine passport,\" Mr Jordan told BBC Radio Foyle. \n\"I am so angry, we just need to know what we have to do so we can put things in place.\""

      "text": "Consumers are being asked to \"respect\" new rules on mandatory face masks in shops in England this week following the emergence of a new Covid variant.  \nThe British Retail Consortium, which represents the industry, said it is up to the police to enforce the measure. \n\"However, customers are asked to respect the rules and be considerate to their fellow shoppers and to hard-working shop staff,\" it said.\nViolence against retail staff has increased during the pandemic.\nThe Co-op, which previously reported that violent crime had worsened during Covid, said on Sunday: \"Our priority is to provide a safe shopping and working environment for our customers and colleagues.\n\"As throughout the pandemic, we support our customers wearing a face covering when shopping in our stores.  It's not our place to enforce face coverings or to refuse to serve a customer who chooses not to wear one.\" \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed to Sky News on Sunday that mandatory mask wearing in shops across England will come into force on Tuesday, 30 November. \nIt brings England into line with the rest of the UK where mask wearing in stores is still required.\nThe move follows the discovery of the new Omicron strain of Covid last week. The UK has three confirmed cases of the variant, and more are expected to be found in the coming days.\nAsked whether shoppers in England could face fines if they fail to comply with the rules, Mr Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: \"It will be a legal requirement by government regulation to wear masks in shops and public transport.\" \nPaddy Lillis, general secretary of shop workers' union Usdaw, accused the government of \"flip-flopping\" on the issue, which he warned could lead to conflict.\n\"There is no reason why, when lifting other Covid restrictions in England, the government could not have kept the requirement to wear a face covering in busy public places, like shops and public transport,\" he said.\n\"This flip-flopping on basic and sensible Covid measures and the different rules across the UK create confusion, reduce compliance and can lead to conflict.\"\nHe added: \"We ask the public to follow the rules and respect shop workers, abuse is not a part of their job.\" \nA spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium, said: \"While enforcement of the government's new mandate is one for the police, the ultimate responsibility for wearing a face covering in store rests with individual shoppers.\"\nAldi said that from Tuesday, all customers will be required to wear a face covering in its stores \"unless they are medically exempt\".\nAldi's chief executive Giles Hurley, said: \"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our number one priority.\"\nThe British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) said it supports people wearing face coverings in shops in England: \"We are pleased that a decision has been made to keep everyone safe and stop the spread of this new variant.\" \nBira's chief executive Andrew Goodacre said: \"We now hope that the general public will be as responsible as the shop owners and staff and wear face coverings without any objections.\"\nMorrisons said it would follow all government guidelines. A spokesperson for Asda: \"We've always followed government guidance during the pandemic and we are awaiting further details from the government following [Saturday's] announcement.\nSainsbury's said: \"We are reviewing the latest government guidance and will keep customers and colleagues updated.\" \nEarlier this year, bosses from 100 retailers signed a letter to the government asking for tougher laws to protect shop workers from abuse and violence."

      "text": "A third case of the Omicron coronavirus variant has been detected in the UK, the Health Security Agency has said. \nThe person is no longer in the UK but had visited Westminster in London.\nIt comes after the government set out measures in response to the variant, including mandatory face masks in shops and on public transport in England.\nAnd the Department for Education is now advising pupils in Year 7 and above, as well as school staff and visitors, to wear face coverings in communal areas.\nThe measure applies to education establishments in England including secondary schools, colleges and universities, as well as staff in childcare settings.\nEarly evidence suggests the new Omicron variant - initially reported to the World Health Organization from South Africa on Wednesday - has a higher re-infection risk.\nOn Monday, an urgent meeting of G7 health ministers will be held \"to discuss the developments on Omicron\", the Department for Health and Social Care said.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC ministers had acted \"swiftly\" and \"in a proportionate way\" as news of the variant emerged. \nOther measures will see people arriving in the UK required to take PCR tests and isolate until they get a negative result. Both this requirement and the mask mandate will come into effect at 04:00 GMT on Tuesday.\nMr Javid said he expected to receive new advice within the next couple of days from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on extending the booster vaccination programme.\nThe deputy chairman of the JCVI told the BBC adults aged 18 and over \"will have an offer of a booster earlier than we had previously envisaged\".\nBut the government has stopped short of issuing advice to work from home or requiring vaccine passports in England, which are part of its Plan B for winter - a contingency plan if intervention on Covid is needed to protect the NHS.\nTen countries in southern Africa are now on the UK's travel red list, meaning that until further notice, any British or Irish residents arriving in the UK after recently visiting any of those countries will have to quarantine in an approved hotel for 10 days. Residents from the countries themselves will not be allowed into the UK until the red list status changes.\nProf Neil Ferguson - a key government adviser on the pandemic - said \"it's likely we'll detect quite a lot more cases in the coming days\" because the UK is among the countries to see the largest number of flights from South Africa, where the variant is circulating.\nOmicron has been detected in a number of other countries, including Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Australia, Hong Kong and Israel.\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the person in the third UK case had been linked to travel in southern Africa. Testing is being carried out at locations they visited in London's Westminster area.\nThe agency said it was \"very likely\" more cases would be found in the coming days.\nDr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UKHSA, said: \"Our advanced sequencing capabilities enable us to find variants and take rapid action to limit onward spread. \n\"We are continuing our efforts to understand the effect of this variant on transmissibility, severe disease, mortality, antibody response and vaccine efficacy.\n\"It's critical that anyone with Covid-19 symptoms isolates and gets a PCR test immediately. Vaccination is critical to help us bolster our defences against this new variant.\"\nThe first UK cases were confirmed on Saturday in Brentwood, Essex and Nottingham. Contact tracing is taking place and Essex County Council is asking people who were at a church and a KFC outlet in Brentwood to get a PCR test. \nSouth Africa has a young population and it is encouraging that doctors there are reporting that Omicron is causing mild symptoms with no increase in hospital admissions.\nBut we need to see what happens when the variant moves into older age groups who are the most vulnerable to Covid.  \nWe also need to see what happens when Omicron comes up against the fully immunised, and those who have had a third booster shot. So far the vaccines have proved highly effective at giving strong protections against severe illness from all variants. \nIf the vaccines prevent people falling seriously ill with Omicron, then some breakthrough infections - while unwelcome - will not be disastrous.\nAs long, of course, as people are already vaccinated. If anything, this is a wake-up call for those yet to be vaccinated to come forward and get the jab.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has called the new measures for England \"temporary and precautionary\" - and said they would be reviewed in three weeks, just before most schools break up for the Christmas holidays.\nLabour has called for full implementation of Plan B and for improved sick pay to encourage self-isolation.\nUnder the rules coming in on Tuesday: \nIn Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, face coverings are already mandatory on public transport and many indoor areas.\nAsked about Scotland's approach to the new variant, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said \"we may need to go further in restricting travel in the days to come\", adding: \"We need to be open-minded to doing anything to keep the population safe.\"\nThe average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. A further 37,681 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday."

Having known Stanley for so long she found it hard to believe he had been inappropriate.\n\"But she is crystal clear that those who experience sexual harassment should always be able to speak up and always be heard. She was not looking 'denounce' Caroline and regrets if that is how her comment has been received.\"\nIn an interview with Sky News earlier this month, Ms Nokes said Stanley Johnson inappropriately touched her at the 2003 Conservative Party conference in Blackpool when she was the party's candidate for the Romsey and Southampton North constituency.\nMs Nokes said she recalled Mr Johnson \"smacking me on the backside about as hard as he could and going, 'Oh, Romsey, you've got a lovely seat'.\"\nWhen approached by Sky News, Mr Johnson said: \"I have no recollection of Caroline Nokes at all - but there you go. And no reply... hey ho, good luck and thanks.\"\nAsked about the incident, Ms Dorries said: \"I don't believe it happened\", adding: \"I have known Stanley for 15 years. He is a gentleman. It never happened to me. Maybe there is something wrong with me.\"\nIn response, Ms Nokes said she was \"sorry\" Ms Dorries had \"used her considerable influence and power in the media to denounce me in this way\".\n\"I very much hope her attitude does not deter other women from being brave enough to report their experiences of public sexual harassment,\" she added.\nLabour's Jess Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, said \"I've got to say I expected better from Nadine... \n\"I'm not entirely sure why she thinks Caroline would lie. Where's the benefit?\"\nEarlier this week, Ms Nokes told the BBC's Woman's Hour programme that she had received \"some amazing support\" from women in Westminster, but that \"I've been sent to Coventry by some\".\nThe phrase \"sent to Coventry\" refers to being ignored or being given a frosty reception by others. \nShe also told the programme that not reporting the alleged incident at the time would \"forever be my regret\".\nShe said 20 years ago she wouldn't have known \"how or to whom to call it out... I do now, I have a platform and a voice\".\nMs Nokes' allegation prompted New Statesman journalist Ailbhe Rea to detail her own claim that Mr Johnson touched her inappropriately. \nWriting in the magazine, she wrote: \"As he [Mr Johnson] walked past, he reached out to put his hand on my back. His hand slid down, and lingered too low and for too long.\"\nShe said she was \"surprised and confused\" but added that \"what happened to me never seemed important enough to risk saying anything more publicly\".\nHowever she said that after Ms Nokes' interview, \"I didn't want Nokes to be alone in calling out something I knew hadn't only happened to her. It was a courageous feminist act and I wanted to match that in the very small way I could\". "

But to enjoy public trust and confidence in their products, technology providers must ensure people's legal protections are respected and complied with.\"  \nThe decision is provisional and the ICO said any representations by Clearview AI will be carefully considered before a final ruling is made in the middle of next year.\nHoan Ton-That, chief executive of Clearview AI, said: \"I am deeply disappointed that the UK Information Commissioner has misinterpreted my technology and intentions. \n\"My company and I have acted in the best interests of the UK and their people by assisting law enforcement in solving heinous crimes against children, seniors, and other victims of unscrupulous acts.... We collect only public data from the open internet and comply with all standards of privacy and law.\" \nThere are some signs that big tech companies are growing wary of face recognition.\nEarlier in November, Facebook announced that it would no longer use facial recognition software to identify faces in photographs and videos.\nBut online tools, and search engines, using facial recognition technology continue to operate, privacy campaigners warn."

Those affected are isolating but none are in hospital.\nContact tracing is taking place and all close contacts of suspected Omicron cases will be advised to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said additional testing would be introduced in areas where cases of the new variant are identified. \nShe said there was no evidence that community transmission was sustained or widespread at this stage - but that even limited community transmission underlined the importance of complying with the steps to tackle the spread of the virus.\nMs Sturgeon told a media briefing on Monday: \"At this stage we are asking people to significantly step up and increase compliance with all existing precautions.\n\"Face coverings; hygiene like washing hands and surfaces; vaccination; and of course testing yourself with LFDs and testing before you mix with people from other households.\"\nShe added: \"As of today, I am asking employers to maximise the potential of home working.\"\nAsked about whether the new variant could affect Christmas, the first minister said: \"I'm not asking anybody today to put plans on hold.\n\"Right now what I'm asking people to do is to up the level of compliance with all of the protections that are still in place. These are protections, not restrictions.\"\nOmicron was first reported in South Africa, but cases have been detected in countries across the world, including Australia, Germany, Israel and Hong Kong.\nMs Sturgeon said there was no evidence of any link to the recent COP26 summit in Glasgow, or the Scotland rugby team's match with South Africa at Murrayfield earlier this month.\nScotland's CMO Dr Smith said it was currently believed that the first confirmed case in Scotland had tested positive on 23 November.\nNo new Covid protections were announced by the first minister but clearly the Scottish government is keeping that under review.\nAnd Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that she favours stricter rules - UK wide - for international arrivals.\nThere is already a quarantine requirement for those coming to the UK from a range of countries in southern Africa that have been added to the \"red list\".\nPCR tests within 48 hours for all international arrivals are also being brought in across the four nations. \nMs Sturgeon and her counterpart in Wales, Mark Drakeford, have now written to the prime minister suggesting an eight-day self-isolation period for all those arriving in the UK from abroad.\nThis is being suggested as an additional precaution as scientists try to work out how dangerous, or otherwise, the Omicron variant is.\nThe first ministers are also seeking assurances that the Treasury would support any new Covid measures, should they be required.\nBut Nicola Sturgeon stressed that she hopes a return to restrictions will not be necessary. \nTen countries in southern Africa have been added to the travel \"red list\" in response. All overseas travellers arriving into the UK from 04:00 on Tuesday will need to take a PCR test.\nMs Sturgeon said it was important to \"prepare for the worst and act on a precautionary basis\".\nShe added: \"But that does not mean we are not hoping for something considerably short of the worst.\n\"We are still hoping for the best and that our developing understanding of this variant will reduce rather than increase our concern.\n\"I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis we will seek to act at all times in a proportionate manner.\"\nMs Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford also want to see tougher travel restrictions for people arriving in the UK.\nThey wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson proposing that people should self-isolate for eight days, with tests on day two and day eight.\nHowever, that was ruled out by the prime minister's spokesman, who said such a move would have a detrimental effect on the travel industry.\nMs Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford also called for urgent talks with Mr Johnson, and for a Cobra committee meeting to take place \"as soon as possible\".\nBut Downing Street said that no Cobra meeting was scheduled.\nThe UK government has tightened the rules on the wearing of face coverings in England, bringing them closer into line with those in Scotland - where there is also some use of vaccine passports for large events, and more stringent advice on home working.\nThe new travel restrictions were announced on Saturday as the World Health Organization designated Omicron a \"variant of concern.\"\nEarly evidence suggests the new Omicron variant has a higher reinfection risk.\nThe first UK cases - picked up from analysis of recent positive Covid tests from all around the country - were confirmed on Saturday in Essex and Nottingham.\nProfessor Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast it was \"almost inevitable\" that there would be many more cases.

      "text": "Pupils at secondary schools in England are being \"strongly advised\" to wear face coverings in communal areas from Monday.\nThe education secretary said he wanted to make sure education settings are \"as safe as possible\" amid concerns at the spread of the Omicron Covid variant.\nThe guidance also applies to staff and visitors at all schools and childcare settings.\nUnions welcomed the announcement but called for further support.\nIt comes after the government announced that face masks would once again become mandatory in England in shops and on public transport from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday.\nThe Department of Education (DfE) said its guidance was temporary and would be reviewed in three weeks. However, for most secondary state schools in England, there is only approximately three weeks left of the Christmas term.\nEarly evidence suggests the new Omicron variant has a higher re-infection risk, while scientists said current vaccines could be less effective.\nEducation Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the new variant is likely to have caused concern for teachers, wider education and childcare staff, parents, pupils and students.\nThe government is \"already taking targeted and proportionate action as a precaution while we find out more information about the new variant\", he said.\nHe added: \"As we do, we will continue to prioritise children's and young people's education and wellbeing, making sure education and childcare settings are as safe as possible and children continue to benefit from classroom teaching.\"\nThe DfE said staff and students should continue to be encouraged to test themselves twice a week, using lateral flow tests. \nThe department also suggested educational establishments would \"want to consider\" whether to go ahead with any planned international trips at the current time, given the potential risk to education from the need to isolate and test when returning to the UK.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a raft of new measures to tackle the spread of Omicron, including obliging all travellers arriving in the UK to take a PCR within two days of arrival and self-isolate whilst awaiting a negative result.\nAnd all contacts of new variant cases will have to self-isolate, even if fully jabbed.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, described the guidance on face coverings in schools  as \"a sensible response\".\nBut he added: \"This worrying situation, however, emphasises the need for better support from the government for the education sector.\"\nKevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, also welcomed the measure but said the DfE \"should go further and encourage mask-wearing in secondary classrooms\".\nHe called on the government to draw up plans \"to improve ventilation and air filtration\" in school settings.\n\"These steps can all help reduce the spread of Covid and thereby reduce disruption to education,\" he said.\nA third case of the Omicron variant was confirmed in the UK on Sunday."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's vaccine advisory body is set to announce later if it will back an expansion of the Covid booster scheme.\nNine cases of the Omicron variant have been found in the UK so far and Number 10 has set out measures to contain it.\nProf Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said it would be \"sensible\" to cut time between doses and extend boosters to the under-40s.\nRegulations on face masks and isolation rules are due before Parliament later.\nThe JCVI only advises the government and the final decision on measures to combat Covid always lies with the politicians - but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he intends to wait for the recommendations from the scientific experts who make up the committee. \nIts recommendation will be announced at a Downing Street coronavirus briefing at 15:00 GMT.\nSpeaking at the briefing will be England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, Prof Wei Shen Lim, chair of the JCVI and Dr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\nMeanwhile, an urgent meeting of health ministers from the G7 group of nations is taking place \"to discuss the developments on Omicron\", the Department for Health said.\nEarly evidence suggests the new Omicron variant - initially reported to the World Health Organization from South Africa on Wednesday - has a higher reinfection risk.\nThe Scottish government announced on Monday morning that six cases of the variant had been identified in Scotland, with four in Lanarkshire and two in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area.\nSome of the cases identified in Scotland have had no travel history and caught the virus variant in the community, Deputy First Minister John Swinney told BBC's Good Morning Scotland.\nThe first UK cases - picked up from analysis of recent positive Covid tests from all around the country - were confirmed on Saturday in Essex and Nottingham. \nThe third case identified on Sunday came from a visitor who spent time in the Westminster area of London, although the person is no longer in the UK, the Health Security Agency said.\nThe agency said it was \"very likely\" more cases would be found in the coming days.\nYou might be wondering what's the point of a booster if the current vaccines turn out to be less effective against Omicron?\nWe don't know if that will be the case, but mutations in Omicron mean the jabs may not perform as well.\nThe vaccines will have taught your body to spot the original coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan in China.\nThe mutations on Omicron are like it putting on a disguise to slip past your body's guard.\nBut boosting is the equivalent of hiring more guards to compensate. \nYou'll have more crucial components of the immune system such as antibodies and T cells circulating in the body to increase the chances of seeing through the virus's disguise.\nIf Omicron does prove to be a problem then boosting is the quickest way of enhancing people's protection as it will take about 100 days to update the vaccines if (and it is a major if) that turns out to be necessary.\nBecause there are also high levels of cases of the dominant Delta variant, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said at the weekend he would be asking the JCVI to consider backing the rollout of booster jabs to a wider population than at present.\nProf Harnden, from the JCVI, told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme on Sunday there was a \"strong argument\" for extending boosters to all adults. \n\"Accelerating the booster programme both by extending the age range and by reducing the interval between the second dose and the booster dose would be a sensible strategy,\" he said.\nCurrently, booster jabs have been restricted to those aged 40 and over, front-line health or social workers, and those with health issues.\nAsked in the Radio 4 interview whether everyone over 18 should expect an invitation to get a booster jab, Prof Harnden responded that the offer would come \"earlier than we have previously envisaged\". \nAt the moment, people aged 16 and 17 can book a second dose of the Pfizer jab - to be administered at least 12 weeks after their first. All 12 to 15-year-olds are currently being offered a single Pfizer dose.\nProf Harnden told BBC Breakfast on Monday there was \"an argument\" for reducing the interval between doses for 16 and 17 -year olds and to look at whether 12 to 15-year-olds should get a second jab.\nThe government announced at the weekend that face coverings will become compulsory in shops and on public transport in England, and pupils in Year 7 and above, plus school staff and visitors, are being advised to wear face coverings in communal areas.\nIt placed 10 countries - South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia - on the UK red list, so only British or Irish nationals or those with UK residence rights will be permitted entry if travelling to the UK from those nations. \nThey also must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days at their own expense.\nSome travellers trying to return to the UK from South Africa have complained on social media they have been struggling to book quarantine hotels on the dates they need.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it was \"rapidly expanding capacity\" following the red list additions, and that it expected to have more rooms available to book this week.\nAnd from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday, everyone entering the UK will have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result.\nThe PM announced the \"temporary and precautionary\" measures at a Downing Street news conference on Saturday, adding they would be reviewed in three weeks.\nUnder the rules due to come in on Tuesday: \nThe government agreed last year to give MPs a vote before introducing new pandemic measures.\nThis means the latest measures, due to be laid before Parliament later on Monday, need a majority in the Commons before they will go ahead.\nHistorically the PM has faced opposition to coronavirus restrictions from among his own backbenchers.\nConservative MP Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, told the Daily Telegraph the measures \"will cause chaos\" in schools as, under the rules, children will be expected to isolate after coming into contact with the Omicron variant.\n\"The government needs to explain when all of this will be brought to an end,\" Mr Baker said.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged the prime minister to take a tougher approach to travel restrictions.\nIn a joint letter with the Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford to Mr Johnson, she has requested increased measures that would see UK arrivals isolate for eight days - with PCR tests on day two and day eight.\nSpeaking during Monday's Scottish government's coronavirus briefing, she said the measure would be more effective at identifying cases of the Omicron variant and help prevent further community transmission.\nHowever, the prime minister's spokesman said there were no plans to introduce tougher isolation and testing requirements as they would have a \"detrimental effect\" on the travel sector and people wishing to travel abroad.\nIn a virtual address to the SNP conference, the first minister urged people to \"pull together\" over the winter months to stop spread of the Omicron variant and have a greater chance of a more normal Christmas.\nHave you had a Covid vaccine booster?

They can land vertically, similar to the Harrier Jump Jet, and combine radar-evading stealth technology with supersonic speeds.\nJets from HMS Queen Elizabeth previously participated in missions over Iraq and Syria.\nThe F-35s are operated by the renowned 617 Squadron, known as the \"Dambusters\".\nBuilt by the US firm Lockheed Martin, the UK's F-35s are the B variant of the jet and are flown by pilots from the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, based at RAF Marham in Norfolk."

      "text": "After three nights without electricity, residents in the parts of Scotland worst affected by Storm Arwen are growing weary. \nIn Torphins, Aberdeenshire, people are struggling to keep warm in sub-zero temperatures and are grateful for the hot food handed out by local good Samaritans. \nAmong them are Paul and Rebecca Murray, a father and his daughter, who are relying on the heat provided by a single gas heater. \n\"It's been pretty horrific,\" Rebecca told BBC Scotland. \"The power went off on Friday. I live in a little council house and I'm a single mum of a three-year-old. In our house you can see our breath. \n\"Thankfully I could go round to my mum and dad's house and they've got a gas heater, but aside from that we just had nothing.\"\nPaul and Rebecca have no phone signal to contact anyone and on Sunday there was no water. \"It's absolutely terrifying,\" Rebecca said. \nThey've not been told by their energy provider when the power will be restored. \n\"I don't think they know themselves,\" said Paul. \"They're just trying their best to get it put back on.\"\nFiona Fyfe said she was initially told the power would be restored on Friday night, but it has been repeatedly postponed. \nEnergy firm SSEN has now told her they hope to get her power back by 22:00 on Monday. \n\"I don't think we can go another night without power,\" she said. \n\"It's been really, really cold. We're lucky, we've got a stove and lots of logs but obviously with more snow, it's just maddening, absolutely maddening.\"\nShe said that food in her freezer is starting to defrost and she has to walk to the main road to get signal on her phone. \nAndrew Hutcheon is among those dishing out hot food and drinks in Torphins. He runs Cafe 83 in Kemnay. \n\"Yesterday back in Kemnay, we didn't have any power, the signal was down so we decided to throw the barbeque on, find some hot water, get some heat into people and get a feed into them,\" he said\n\"It's a bit of dire situation but everyone who's coming to us is more upbeat because obviously they're getting some hot food and hot drinks.\"\nHe said the crews working to restore power have an \"unbelievable\" task ahead of them. \n\"Over the years we've obviously had a bit of wind but it's never been anything like this - the amount of trees that are down in the forest, I've never seen anything like that,\" he said\n\"Coupled with the freezing weather and the snow, it's not ideal.\"\nMeanwhile in Aberfeldy, in Perth and Kinross, Debbie Martin has bought a second-hand generator after recently switching to fully-electric heating.\nShe has been told she could be without power until 11:00 on Tuesday because it is still too dangerous to remove trees which have fallen on to power lines.\nShe told the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"You can't do the things you would normally do.\n\"You can't brush your teeth because your toothbrush is flat. You have to drive round in the car to charge your phone.\n\"To boil the kettle, I've been putting it on the log burner stove and it's been taking an hour and a half.\"\n\"When you get a power cut, you just assume that it's going to come back on in an hour or two, but obviously it hasn't,\" Debbie said. \nShe said it's been \"really difficult to get information\" from her energy provider SSE.\n\"Everything in our house is electric. We've got an electric heating system, an electric cooker,\" she added.\n\"We bought a second-hand generator in Dundee yesterday, so we've gone round a couple of neighbours' houses to get their phones and iPads charged because people can't contact relatives.\"\nKenny Anderson, from Castle Fraser in Aberdeenshire, is used to power cuts having lived in rural north-east Scotland all his life.\nBut he says the damage wreaked by Storm Arwen is the worst he has known in more than two decades.\nHe told the BBC: \"Our power went off at four o'clock on Friday afternoon. We're a bit lucky in that we've got a gas hob because we get two or three power cuts a year. \n\"They only usually last a few hours, or maybe a day. So this is the longest one we have had in 23 years.\"\n\"I was brought up in Glenlivet in the 60s and 70s and I don't remember power cuts ever lasting more than a day or two.\"\nHave you been without power since Storm Arwen?

We've had people making soup and bringing it in. Cafes have donated food and the Co-op has donated bread,\" she said.\n\"Everyone is pulling together.\" \nPeople in the village of Nenthead, near Alston, in Cumbria, have been particularly badly affected. \nWithout power, some have been using outdoor stoves in freezing temperatures in order to cook a warm meal.\nHouseholders have also had to contend with failing phone signals and sparse internet connectivity.\nResident Lorraine Costello said she had to resort to chopping up a wooden cabinet to fuel her outdoor stove.\n\"It's been absolutely freezing and we've been walking around the house to keep our body heat up,\" she said. \n\"I'm also cooking outdoors on a clay cooker which is a real struggle.\"\nIn the North West, trees and debris took down power lines and poles.\nA support centre was set up by volunteers at Coniston Social Club which was able to keep power after sourcing a generator while houses around the Lake District area suffered outages.\nClub chairman Willy Watson said the area's grid power had been off since about 21:30 GMT on Friday.\nHe said local hotels and cafes brought food and there had been a \"steady stream\" of volunteers.\n\"By the end of [Sunday] the social centre was full of people needing food and warmth,\" Mr Watson said.\nHot food vans and support were also in place in Alston, Nenthead and Ambleside, Cumbria County Council said.\nA care home in Weardale, County Durham, gathered its 30 residents in the living room where a small generator had been providing the home's only heat since Friday.\nJulie Percival, manager of Crosshill Nursing Home in Stanhope, said: \"It has been absolutely Baltic up here, we have been really cut off.\n\"The residents are all wearing coats, hats, gloves and scarves, we've got them all wrapped up.\" \nShe said she was angry after having no contact from Northern Powergrid, although the firm said it was trying to help vulnerable people.\nMs Percival said: \"It's upsetting, the staff are stressed but they are working over and beyond and the community has really come together.\"\nShe said she didn't think \"we can stay much longer\" and was \"putting plans in place\" to move residents to other homes which do have power, although that would be \"heart-breaking for families, staff and residents\".\nShe said she was taking residents' temperatures hourly, with the more ill patients wrapped in bed in foil blankets.\nMeanwhile about 1,400 customers remain without power in the Staffordshire Moorlands area, Western Power Distribution said, following a peak of about 12,000 on Friday.\nAs well as heavy winds, which brought down hundreds of trees, there was also heavy snowfall which closed the A66 between Bowes in County Durham and Brough in Cumbria until Monday afternoon.\nDurham Police said the job of rescuing dozens of stranded drivers stuck in heavy snow on the A66 near Scotch Corner in Darlington was aided by the National Police Air Service.\nA spokesman for the force said: \"Gritters and snowploughs also worked to remove stranded vehicles.\"\nThe Snake Pass, Woodhead Pass and Cat and Fiddle are among the roads in the Peak District closed by snow. \nLondon North Eastern Railway (LNER) was unable to run trains north of Newcastle as normal and the Tyne And Wear Metro was also hit by closures but is back up and running, apart from one section in Sunderland which is \"under repair\", operator Nexus said.  \nDozens of postcodes across Bradford, Leeds, Halifax, Huddersfield and Wakefield were also hit with about 1,600 West Yorkshire households still without power.\nJim Cardwell from Northern Powergrid said the firm was working \"very hard\" to get the lights back on.\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nCovid booster jabs should be offered to all over-18s to help stop a potential wave driven by the new variant Omicron, scientists have advised the UK government. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said the minimum gap between the second dose and booster should also be reduced to three months. And they recommended children aged 12 to 15 should be invited for a second dose three months after their first. \nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid formally announced to MPs that from Tuesday, masks will be compulsory in shops and on public transport in England. He also confirmed stricter travel rules from some countries. It comes after early evidence suggested the Omicron variant, first detected in South Africa, has a higher reinfection risk. Eleven cases of the Omicron variant have been found in the UK so far.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon is urging people to \"test much more\" after six of the UK's 11 Omicron cases were identified in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon asked people to take lateral flow tests before mixing with other households, and for bosses to maximise home working. She called for even tougher travel restrictions for people arriving in the UK - although that has been ruled out by Downing Street.\nThe new tougher travel restrictions in response to the Omicron variant are causing travel turmoil for people trying to return to the UK. The government has added 10 southern African countries to the UK's travel red list. One traveller, Alex Clarke, told the BBC he had found a flight from South Africa back to the UK but a lack of quarantine hotel spaces meant he might have to re-arrange his return again. Here are your refund rights if your flights are cancelled due to Covid.\nSome may dub it a Tragedy - pop group Steps have postponed the remainder of their UK tour due to Covid-19 cases.

      "text": "Covid booster jabs are to be offered to all over-18s in the UK to help stop a potential wave of infections driven by the new variant Omicron.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation made a series of recommendations to expand the booster rollout.\nIt said the minimum gap between the second vaccine dose and booster should be reduced from six to three months. \nThe experts also said children aged 12-15 should be invited for a second jab.\nEarly evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk, but scientists say it will take about three weeks before it is known how the variant impacts on the effectiveness of vaccines. \nThe government has announced new rules on self-isolation and that face masks will be compulsory in shops and on public transport in England from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday in an effort to contain the spread of the variant.  Eleven cases of Omicron have now been detected in the UK.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told a Downing Street briefing that Omicron was the \"new kid on the block\" and it has \"always been the case that, at some point, we are going to get a variant that gives us heightened concern\".\nHe said: \"If vaccine effectiveness is reduced - as seems pretty likely, to some extent - the biggest effects are likely to be in preventing infections and, hopefully, there will be smaller effects in preventing severe disease.\n\"Vaccine boosting is the thing we can do most easily while we wait for that science mist to clear.\"\nProf Wei Shen Lim, chair of the JCVI, said he was not predicting the new variant would take hold in the UK but the experts wanted to be in the best possible position if there was an increase in infection.\nHe said: \"With any vaccine during a pandemic, we get the greatest benefit for individuals and society if the vaccine is deployed before the wave starts. We want to provide boosters early enough.... before any possible wave\".\nDirector general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, said the emergence of Omicron \"underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is\".\nThe aim of this announcement is to get ahead of a potential wave driven by the new variant Omicron.\nIf that happens - and it is an \"if\" at this stage because so much is unknown about the new variant - giving more people a booster jab will certainly help.\nWhile Omicron may make the vaccines less effective, the booster dose has been shown to significantly increase the immune response, which will help counter any advantages this variant may have.\nBut that will only happen if the vaccine is in people's arms. The NHS is doing about 2.5 million boosters a week on average at the moment. At that rate it will take three months to vaccinate all those eligible.\nIncreasing that will not be easy. About 50 mass vaccination centres have closed since the spring. Many GPs have also stepped back to concentrate on flu jabs and their day-to-day work.\nIt means the solution is likely to lie in extending the opening hours of current vaccination clinics late into the evenings and bringing in extra staff and volunteers to help.\nIn its advice, the JCVI also recommended severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a fourth dose of the vaccine as a booster. They are currently receiving three jabs.\nThe committee said the booster rollout should take account of vulnerability. Boosters - either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines - should be offered in order of descending age groups, with priority given to those in a Covid at-risk group, it said. \nNHS England said people would be contacted when it was time for them to book their booster.\nA spokesperson said: \"The NHS will shortly set out how staff will expand the booster programme - this will include how booster jabs will be given in priority order... while also increasing capacity to vaccinate millions more people in a shorter space of time.\" \nBooster jabs were originally offered to the over-50s, front-line medical staff and people with health conditions that put them at greater risk. Earlier this month the rollout was widened to include the over-40s.\nThe JCVI's latest advice has been given to ministers in all parts of the UK. It only gives recommendations and the final decision on measures to combat Covid lies with the politicians.  \nSo far, ministers in England, Scotland and Wales have said they would follow the recommendations, and Northern Ireland is also expected to accept them.\nThe JCVI said it would continue to review data on the potential benefits and risks of offering the Covid vaccine to children aged five to 11.\nDr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said a review found it was safe for those aged 12 to 15 to have a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  This should be offered at a minimum of 12 weeks from their first dose. \nThe latest cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the Camden and Wandsworth areas of London, the UK Health Security Agency said. Like the other three cases in England, they have been linked to travel in southern Africa, where infections have been circulating. \nMs Sturgeon said some of the six cases identified in Scotland had no travel history. This suggested a degree of community transmission, she said, but there was currently no suggestion this was widespread.\nUK Health Secretary Sajid Javid was asked in the Commons about any impact Omicron could have on Christmas.\nHe said: \"The reason we've taken measures is to protect the progress we have made, and if we can do that then we can look forward to a fine Christmas.\"\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was not asking anyone to put plans on hold as \"these are protections, not restrictions\".\nMeanwhile, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said people should approach Christmas \"in the way that we've advised all the way through\" - that it should be different and better this year.\n\"That doesn't mean that people should neglect those simple things that we can do in our own lives, that still help to protect ourselves and others,\" he said.\nMr Javid also told MPs they would be given a chance to debate and vote on the face masks and isolation rule changes.\nHe said: \"If it emerges that this variant is no more dangerous than the Delta variant, then we won't keep measures in place for a day longer than necessary. \n\"Our experience of fighting this virus has shown us it's best to act decisively and swiftly when we see a potential threat. Which is why we're building our defences and putting these measures in place without delay.\"\nThe average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. A further 42,583 confirmed cases were announced on Monday."

But it said it was taking measures to protect its Christmas food ranges, including stocking more turkeys and pigs in blankets in store compared to last year. \nIt is also keeping extra stock in depots such as mince pies, confectionary, Christmas cakes and puddings, and has recruited 15,000 temporary staff to work during the busy Christmas period.\nIn September, John Lewis said it was chartering a fleet of extra ships, along with a number of other businesses, to make sure it has Christmas stock on time. \nBoss Sharon White blamed a shortage of shipping containers which had made it tough - and expensive - to get a space on cargo ships travelling from various parts of the world.\nAsda - which was recently bought by the billionaire Issa brothers - said the fall in quarterly sales reflected unusually high demand in the same period last year when people were eating more meals at home due to Covid curbs. \nHowever, its rivals Tesco and Sainsbury's have both reported higher sales in the third quarter. \nAsda said customer habits that emerged in the pandemic had remained, with demand for its online delivery service still 80% higher than pre-pandemic levels. \nIt added that the lockdown trend of customers treating themselves to premium own-label products had also continued.

      "tags": "NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,NHS Lanarkshire,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Covid booster programme is to be expanded and speeded up after six cases of the new Omicron variant of Covid were identified in Scotland.\nThe Scottish government said it had already started work on implementing the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nBoosters will be offered to over-18s, and the wait after a second dose is being cut from six to three months.\nChildren aged 12 to 15 will also now be invited for a second jab.\nScotland's chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, welcomed the advice from the JCVI, which said it wanted to help stop a potential wave driven by the new variant.\nDr Smith said: \"Scotland has already started work on its implementation, including the recommendation that boosters can now be given to all adults no less than three months after a second dose.\n\"Urgent talks with health boards and vaccination partners are under way and further information on the delivery of this advice will follow as soon as possible.\"\nThe JCVI said those aged 12 to 15 should be invited for a second jab three months after their first.\nIt has also recommended that severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a fourth dose of the vaccine.\nThe advice came as it emerged 11 Omicron cases have now been detected across the UK.\nFour have been identified in Lanarkshire and two in Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Those affected are isolating but none are in hospital.\nContact tracing is taking place and all close contacts of suspected Omicron cases will be advised to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said additional testing would be introduced in areas where cases of the new variant are identified. \nShe said there was no evidence that community transmission was sustained or widespread at this stage - but that even limited community transmission underlined the importance of complying with the steps to tackle the spread of the virus.\nMs Sturgeon told a media briefing on Monday: \"At this stage we are asking people to significantly step up and increase compliance with all existing precautions.\n\"Face coverings; hygiene like washing hands and surfaces; vaccination; and of course testing yourself with LFDs and testing before you mix with people from other households.\"\nShe added: \"As of today, I am asking employers to maximise the potential of home working.\"\nAsked about whether the new variant could affect Christmas, the first minister said: \"I'm not asking anybody today to put plans on hold.\n\"Right now what I'm asking people to do is to up the level of compliance with all of the protections that are still in place. These are protections, not restrictions.\"\nOmicron was first reported in South Africa, but cases have been detected in countries across the world, including Australia, Germany, Israel and Hong Kong.\nMs Sturgeon said there was no evidence of any link to the recent COP26 summit in Glasgow, or the Scotland rugby team's match with South Africa at Murrayfield earlier this month.\nScotland's CMO Dr Smith said it was currently believed that the first confirmed case in Scotland had tested positive on 23 November.\nNo new Covid protections were announced by the first minister but clearly the Scottish government is keeping that under review.\nAnd Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that she favours stricter rules - UK wide - for international arrivals.\nThere is already a quarantine requirement for those coming to the UK from a range of countries in southern Africa that have been added to the \"red list\".\nPCR tests within 48 hours for all international arrivals are also being brought in across the four nations. \nMs Sturgeon and her counterpart in Wales, Mark Drakeford, have now written to the prime minister suggesting an eight-day self-isolation period for all those arriving in the UK from abroad.\nThis is being suggested as an additional precaution as scientists try to work out how dangerous, or otherwise, the Omicron variant is.\nThe first ministers are also seeking assurances that the Treasury would support any new Covid measures, should they be required.\nBut Nicola Sturgeon stressed that she hopes a return to restrictions will not be necessary. \nTen countries in southern Africa have been added to the travel \"red list\" in response. All overseas travellers arriving into the UK from 04:00 on Tuesday will need to take a PCR test.\nMs Sturgeon said it was important to \"prepare for the worst and act on a precautionary basis\".\nShe added: \"But that does not mean we are not hoping for something considerably short of the worst.\n\"We are still hoping for the best and that our developing understanding of this variant will reduce rather than increase our concern.\n\"I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis we will seek to act at all times in a proportionate manner.\"\nMs Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford also want to see tougher travel restrictions for people arriving in the UK.\nThey wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson proposing that people should self-isolate for eight days, with tests on day two and day eight.\nHowever, that was ruled out by the prime minister's spokesman, who said such a move would have a detrimental effect on the travel industry.\nMs Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford also called for urgent talks with Mr Johnson, and for a Cobra committee meeting to take place \"as soon as possible\".\nBut Downing Street said that no Cobra meeting was scheduled.\nThe UK government has tightened the rules on the wearing of face coverings in England, bringing them closer into line with those in Scotland - where there is also some use of vaccine passports for large events, and more stringent advice on home working.\nThe new travel restrictions were announced on Saturday as the World Health Organization designated Omicron a \"variant of concern.\"\nEarly evidence suggests the new Omicron variant has a higher reinfection risk.\nThe first UK cases - picked up from analysis of recent positive Covid tests from all around the country - were confirmed on Saturday in Essex and Nottingham.\nProfessor Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast it was \"almost inevitable\" that there would be many more cases.

      "text": "Covid booster jabs are to be offered to all over-18s in the UK to help stop a potential wave of infections driven by the new variant Omicron.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation made a series of recommendations to expand the booster rollout.\nIt said the minimum gap between the second vaccine dose and booster should be reduced from six to three months. \nThe experts also said children aged 12-15 should be invited for a second jab.\nEarly evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk, but scientists say it will take about three weeks before it is known how the variant impacts on the effectiveness of vaccines. \nThe government has announced new rules on self-isolation and that face masks will be compulsory in shops and on public transport in England from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday in an effort to contain the spread of the variant.  Eleven cases of Omicron have now been detected in the UK.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told a Downing Street briefing that Omicron was the \"new kid on the block\" and it has \"always been the case that, at some point, we are going to get a variant that gives us heightened concern\".\nHe said: \"If vaccine effectiveness is reduced - as seems pretty likely, to some extent - the biggest effects are likely to be in preventing infections and, hopefully, there will be smaller effects in preventing severe disease.\n\"Vaccine boosting is the thing we can do most easily while we wait for that science mist to clear.\"\nProf Wei Shen Lim, chair of the JCVI, said he was not predicting the new variant would take hold in the UK but the experts wanted to be in the best possible position if there was an increase in infection.\nHe said: \"With any vaccine during a pandemic, we get the greatest benefit for individuals and society if the vaccine is deployed before the wave starts. We want to provide boosters early enough.... before any possible wave\".\nDirector general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, said the emergence of Omicron \"underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is\".\nThe aim of this announcement is to get ahead of a potential wave driven by the new variant Omicron.\nIf that happens - and it is an \"if\" at this stage because so much is unknown about the new variant - giving more people a booster jab will certainly help.\nWhile Omicron may make the vaccines less effective, the booster dose has been shown to significantly increase the immune response, which will help counter any advantages this variant may have.\nBut that will only happen if the vaccine is in people's arms. The NHS is doing about 2.5 million boosters a week on average at the moment. At that rate it will take three months to vaccinate all those eligible.\nIncreasing that will not be easy.

They are currently receiving three jabs.\nIn a statement Health Minister Eluned Morgan backed the advice.\n\"All individuals who are eligible for a booster will automatically receive an invitation to attend an appointment when it is their turn,\" she said, adding that there will be a \"significant number of vaccination appointments issuing over the coming weeks\".\nRecent Covid figures in Wales show a continuing downward trend, with cases at 490 per 100,000 people over the past seven days.\nNine more deaths were reported on Monday, bringing the total to 6,391.\nThere were 567 patients with Covid in hospital beds in Wales on Friday, down from 653 the previous week, with 47 patients being ventilated in critical care beds - down from 57. \nMs Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford wrote to the prime minister on Monday calling for an emergency Cobra meeting as soon as possible.\n\"The emergence of Omicron poses a potential threat to the UK,\" they said.\n\"We need to work collectively - and effectively - as four nations to take all reasonable steps to control the ingress of the virus to the country and then to limit its spread.\"\nThey said the day eight PCR test for travellers arriving in the UK should be reinstated, \"requiring isolation for that whole period\".\nThe pair also called for business support schemes to be funded by the UK government's Treasury \"in the event more interventionist measures are required\".\n\"We do not want to be in a position again where our public health interventions are negatively impacted by a lack of financial support, but can be switched on as required for England,\" they said.\nDowning Street responded saying it does not have plans to introduce the requirement for passengers to take a PCR test on day eight as well as day two on their return to the UK.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said: \"We believe the approach we've taken is the proportionate one to the evidence we currently have available.\n\"Introducing further isolation and testing requirements would have a detrimental effect on the travel industry and those planning to go travelling.\" \nHe added ministers were not planning to change their approach with regards to the furlough scheme either. \nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme that ministers would discuss whether Wales will need stricter measures \"over the next few days\", including whether to close schools earlier for Christmas.\nMark Drakeford later said that there are no plans to close businesses - despite the call for financial support from the Treasury.\nHe said people should approach Christmas \"in the way that we've advised all the way through\".\n\"Christmas should be different this year. Christmas should be better this year.\n\"That doesn't mean that people should neglect those simple things that we can do in our own lives, that still help to protect ourselves and others.\n\"Those simple precautions: think about vulnerable people, if members of your family are particularly likely to suffer from coronavirus - think carefully about whether you visit them or involve them in your plans.\n\"Take a lateral flow test if you're going to visit somewhere where you might be at risk or others are at risk wear masks in crowded public places.\"\nDr Atherton said it is a \"matter of buying time\" with the new variant, saying it was a case of when not if the variant will be identified.\n\"Our best line of defence against this still is vaccines and social distancing, those things that we know keep us safe because they can reduce the transmission of this new variant in the community whilst we understand the implications of it.\"\n\"My expectation is that this will probably take off, we will see cases in Wales - we haven't seen any yet but I do expect us to see cases, they will probably increase.\n\"And my anxiety is also about January and February next year, because it does take time for these things to take off.\"\n\"The Omicron variant does give us further cause for concern and the reason for that is that there's so much that's unknown. \n\"We don't know whether it will lead to more harm than the Delta variety and if it does then hospital rates could go up. So we just need to be cautious for the moment, not to throw caution to the wind\".\nTen countries in southern Africa are now on the UK's travel red list, meaning that until further notice, any British or Irish residents arriving in the UK after recently visiting any of those countries will have to quarantine in an approved hotel for 10 days. \nResidents from the countries themselves will not be allowed into the UK until the red list status changes.\nUnder new measures, which came into force at 04:00 GMT, everyone entering the UK from abroad must take a PCR test and isolate, pending a negative result. \nMasks will also be made compulsory again in shops and on public transport in England. \nFace coverings are already mandatory in shops, health and social care settings and on public transport in Wales."

      "text": "Efforts to create so-called green jobs need to intensify if the UK government is to achieve its target of two million roles by 2030, according to a report.\nJobs linked to the green economy accounted for 1.2% of all advertised roles in the year to July 2021, consultancy PwC said.\nThat equates to just 124,600 new jobs.\nBoosting green job creation is part of the government's \"green industrial revolution\" plans.\nIn November 2020, the government announced \u00a34bn would be spent as part of its plans to create two million green jobs by 2030. \nThe COP 26 summit held in Glasgow a year later has put the issue into sharp focus again. \nBut there are concerns that the green jobs transition could pose some risks, as it will have an impact on traditional jobs, especially in polluting industries.\nIn September, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) warned up to 660,000 jobs could be at risk if the UK fails to reach its net-zero target as quickly as other nations.\nThe simplest answer is a job that directly contributes to tackling climate change, although many think it should also cover roles that indirectly support that ambition.\nGrowing sectors where one might find more green jobs being advertised include low-carbon farming, heating without emissions, and wind turbine maintenance.\nIn its research, PwC said jobs that support the green economy indirectly should also be considered green. \nSuch roles might include environmental advisers or experts in environmental or sustainability research and education.\nPwC's report said work was needed to ensure the move to a net-zero economy does not add to regional inequalities.\nIt found that Wales, Northern Ireland and Yorkshire and the Humber lagged behind other parts of the UK in terms of transitioning to a greener economy. Scotland and London were the top performers, according to the research.\nPwC ranked areas in terms of how they performed in job creation, the benefits of green jobs, the loss of \"sunset jobs\", the carbon intensity of employment, and green workplaces.\nThey hunted for online job ads that mentioned things like sustainability and environment - there had to be a number of mentions.\nKevin Ellis, PwC chairman and senior partner, said: \"Jobs are getting greener and this is cause for optimism, but evidence is needed on the level and distribution of these opportunities. \n\"Left unchecked, green employment will grow in the most fertile spots, but not necessarily where they're needed most.  \n\"By acting now, we have a massive opportunity to rebalance the economy and ensure a fair transition.\"\nA government spokesman told the BBC: \"As this data shows, hundreds of thousands of green jobs are being created across the country, and our landmark Net Zero Strategy sets out how the UK will accelerate this growth, unlocking \u00a390bn in private investment. \n\"Our plans will see the majority of new green jobs to be created and supported outside London and the south east, with our shift to a low carbon economy providing an unprecedented opportunity to attract new, future-proof businesses in our industrial heartlands.\""

      "text": "Australia has paused plans to reopen its borders to some foreign nationals amid fears over the new Covid variant.\nThe country was due to allow vaccinated skilled migrants and international students entry from 1 December.\nBut Prime Minister Scott Morrison said a delay of a fortnight was \"necessary\" following Omicron's discovery.\nThe heavily mutated variant was detected in South Africa earlier this month, with initial evidence suggesting it has a higher re-infection risk.\nIt prompted the UK, EU and US to issue a travel ban on Southern African countries - a decision criticised by South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa.\nJapan announced on Monday that all foreigners would be banned from entering as a result of the variant, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has said poses a high risk globally.\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida did not say how long the measures would last, and told reporters that he was ready to face criticism for being too cautious. \n\"These are temporary, exceptional measures that we are taking for safety's sake, until there is clearer information about the Omicron variant,\" Mr Kishida said. Japan has yet to detect any cases. \nAustralia - which has so far found five Omicron infections among travellers arriving in the country - has not announced rolling back any of the restrictions it had already eased.\nThe country has until recently had some of the strictest border policies in the world, barring even its own people from leaving the country under a strategy sometimes dubbed \"Fortress Australia\".\nThe policy was praised for helping to control Covid, but it has also controversially separated families.\nThe measure was only eased in November this year, giving long-awaited freedoms to vaccinated citizens and their relatives. Under the current rules, permanent residents and fully vaccinated travellers from New Zealand and Singapore are allowed into Australia.\nThe relaxation of rules planned for 1 December would have added fully vaccinated Japanese and South Korean citizens to the list of those who could enter, as well as eligible visa holders.\nBut Australia's National Security Committee said the pause was necessary as it would allow them to consider issues like \"the efficacy of the vaccine\" and the impact of the variant."

      "title": "Omicron: How worried should we be?",
      "tags": "Public health,South Africa,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "We're back in familiar territory - growing concern about a new variant of coronavirus.  \nIt has been named Omicron by the World Health Organization, following the pattern of Greek code-names like the Alpha and Delta variants.\nOmicron has such a long list of mutations that it was described by one scientist as \"horrific\", while another told me it was the worst variant they'd seen. \nIt has now been detected in more than 30 countries and there are signs it may be able to bypass some of our immunity. \nBut there are also claims that it could be milder than earlier versions of Covid, such as Delta.\nThere is a lot of speculation. Here's what we know. \nOmicron is the most heavily mutated version of coronavirus found so far. \nProf Tulio de Oliveira, the director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation in South Africa, said there was an \"unusual constellation of mutations\" and that it was \"very different\" to other variants that have circulated. \n\"This variant did surprise us, it has a big jump on evolution [and] many more mutations that we expected,\" he said.\nHe said there 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein, which is the target of most vaccines and the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. \nZooming in even further to the receptor binding domain (that's the part of the virus that makes first contact with our body's cells), it has 10 mutations compared to just two for the Delta variant that swept the world. \nIt is not certain where Omicron came from, but it is thought it evolved in a single patient who was unable to beat the virus.\nA lot of mutation doesn't automatically mean: bad. It is important to know what those mutations are actually doing.\nThe vaccines have all been based on the original form of the virus that was first detected in Wuhan, in China. The concern is Omicron is now so different to the original that vaccines may not be as effective. \nSome of the mutations have been seen before in other variants, which gives some insight into their likely role in this variant. \nFor example N501Y seems to make it easier for a coronavirus to spread. There are some in there that make it harder for antibodies to recognise the virus and might make vaccines less effective, but there are others that are completely new. \nThere have been many examples of variants that have seemed scary on paper, but came to nothing. The Beta variant was at the top of people's concerns at the beginning of the year because it was the best at escaping the immune system. But in the end it was the faster-spreading Delta that took over the world. \nScientists in South Africa have reported early evidence that Omicron can evade some of our immunity. \nThey have detected a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times, which had not been seen with previous variants. However, the scientists stressed they did not know what this meant for vaccines. \nLaboratory experiments are underway to see how effective the antibodies in people's blood are at stopping the new variant. \nProf Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, said: \"Beta was all immune escape and nothing else, Delta had infectivity and modest immune escape, this potentially has both to high degrees.\"\nThe Omicron variant is being blamed for a surge in cases in South Africa. In mid-November there were around 250 cases recorded every day. This has now topped 8,000 daily cases in a country that has already seen large waves of other variants. \nExperts have warned the same could happen around the world, including in the UK. \n\"The early signs are it will probably spread quite quickly and probably start outcompeting Delta, and become the dominant variant probably within the next weeks,\" said Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia.\nThe jury is still out on the severity of an Omicron infection. \nAnecdotal accounts from South Africa have argued symptoms tend to be mild and data on just 40 patients in one hospital hinted that fewer were becoming severely ill. However, it will take weeks to know for sure as there is a long delay between catching the virus and becoming seriously ill. South Africa also has a relatively young population and younger people tend to have milder Covid.\nAnd any difference in severity could have more to do with the amount of immunity in the country than anything the virus is inherently doing differently. \nSo, for now, we are left with a variant that raises significant concerns despite huge holes in our knowledge. It is one that needs to be watched closely and asks deep questions about what to do and when. The lesson of the pandemic is you can't always wait until you have all the answers. \nFollow James on Twitter"

He was a defenceless detainee. I just could not understand why he was being treated in the way he was being treated,\" he said.\n\"He was clearly distressed. You are standing naked in front of five blokes. They're laughing at you. They are taking the mick out of you.\"\nHe didn't know who had removed the man's clothes or why.\nHe was told about another incident where officers \"stood outside the cell of a suicidal detainee under constant supervision wearing George Michael masks and danced outside the cell whilst staring at the detainee\".\nIn a third incident he said officers used \"uncalled for\" force to take a detainee back to a cell.\nMr Tulley joined G4S in January 2015, aged 18, concerned that going to university to do a degree in physical education might leave him with large debts.\nHis mother spotted the job advertisement.\nMr Tulley said: \"I had no idea it was a prison. My mum would never have suggested I work in a prison.\"\nPressed on why he didn't report what he had seen, he said the process involved going to managers, yet managers had been involved in the abuse he witnessed. \nHe said there was a \"culture of silence\" among staff at Brook House, and a \"them and us\" relationship with detainees.\nLow staffing levels meant Brook House was \"not a fit and proper or humane place to hold detainees\", he added.\nOne evening, shocked at the mistreatment he witnessed - first as an assistant custody officer then a detention custody officer - he began to compose a resignation letter. \nHe then saw a BBC Panorama investigation into a G4S youth detention centre starting on the television.\n\"I was watching staff members who wore the same uniform as me abusing people in their care,\" he said. \n\"It reminded me of things I had witnessed in Brook House.\"\nHe stopped writing the letter and instead contacted Panorama.  \nHe was trained to be an undercover reporter by the BBC and spent a month secretly filming at Brook House.\nThe facility is not supposed to be run like a jail, but Mr Tulley said it was designed like a category B prison, with locked windows, doors which only open from the outside, and toilets within the sleeping area. \nG4S training recommended they be called \"rooms\", although Mr Tulley said they were generally called cells by officers. \nHe criticised the way he was told as a trainee to use inaccurate language when reporting incidents involving force. \nIn situations where an officer struck a detainee with a riot shield he was told this should be recorded as \"I placed the shield on the detainee\". \nWhen using a head or arm lock, the phrase recommended was \"I supported the detainee's head, or arm\". \nMr Tulley told the inquiry he didn't feel comfortable with this sort of language as his time at the centre went on.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

What she got was a bloody advertising board and untrained people,\" he said.\nHundreds of people were also injured when bomber Salman Abedi detonated a homemade explosive at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May that year. \nMr Roussos said: \"I see myself as an uneducated clever man. But in a room full of clever people I have never heard so many excuses, so much justification that the response on 22 May was somewhat acceptable.\n\"The response on that night was shameful and inadequate. The people that excuse it should feel shame.\n\"The response of the security services should go down in history as one of the worst failures from start to finish and that's what we should learn from this.\"\nSaffie's mother Lisa Roussos, who was severely injured in the attack, told the inquiry she was unable to move in the moments after the bombing.\n\"I can remember just thinking: 'Just stay awake. Help will come soon, just stay where you are. Just stay awake there's going to be help on the way',\" she said.\n\"It felt like hours before anybody approached me, and they asked me my name. I was really breathless and all I managed to say was 'Saffie'.\"\nMrs Roussos said she wanted to thank \"those that tried to help Saffie that night and were with her\". \n\"And I also want to say to the professionals and MI5, this inquiry isn't about protecting your job, your reputation, or your uniform,\" she added.\n\"We understand the sheer panic and fear you were faced with that night but until you admit the failings how can there be a positive change?\"\nEarlier, the inquiry heard how Saffie, from Leyland in Lancashire, had \"the night of her life, singing, dancing and laughing\" with her mother and sister Ashlee.\nAfter the explosion, Saffie had been showing signs of consciousness and was asking for her mother. \nA member of the public, Paul Reid, stayed with her for 30 minutes, reassuring her and at times shouting to keep her awake.\nIn a statement to the inquiry, Marianne Gibson, from Emergency Training UK (ETUK) who was the initial first aider at the arena to tend to Saffie, said she thought she was already dead and so moved on to help other people. \nAnother ETUK first aider, Elizabeth Woodcock, later put a bandage on a large wound on her back.\nMr Reid, an off-duty nurse and a police officer were constantly reassuring Saffie and pleading with her to \"stay with us\", the inquiry was told.  \nA group of people carried Saffie out of the foyer on a makeshift stretcher made out of an advertising hoarding.\nAfter they flagged down a passing ambulance, she was put into the vehicle where she asked paramedics: \"Am I going to die?\"\nParamedic Gillian Yates said in a statement to the inquiry: \"If we had not picked up Saffie-Rose, I believe she would have died on the street. I feel we gave her the best chance of surviving.\"\nFellow paramedic Gemma Litter said as soon as she saw the extent of Saffie's injuries she \"knew we would lose her\". \nSaffie reached Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, where a trauma team was waiting, 52 minutes after the bombing but was pronounced dead at 23:40 GMT, over an hour after the blast.\nThe court has been told there was a disagreement among medical experts about whether she might have survived if her treatment had been different.\nThe inquiry, which will spend all this week considering Saffie's case, continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Established money brands Paypal and Monzo are poised to enter the market, and BNPL technology is evolving so that some brands can be used to make any purchase on any site. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nFront-line NHS workers (with some exceptions) in England must be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job. However, ministers are meeting to decide whether or not to scrap the requirement. Around 77,000 NHS staff are unvaccinated and some argue that going ahead with mandatory vaccinations would lead to a staffing crisis.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell preyed on and groomed young girls for convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein to abuse, prosecutors have alleged.\nMs Maxwell appeared in court in New York on Monday for the first day of her trial on sex trafficking charges.\nShe denies the charges and her defence claims she is being used as a scapegoat for Epstein's crimes, following his death in prison in 2019.\nBut prosecutors argue the pair were \"partners in crime\" in sex abuse.\nMs Maxwell has been in a US jail since her arrest last year, and faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted.\nProsecutors say Ms Maxwell, who also has American and French citizenship, recruited and groomed underage girls for her long-term companion Epstein to abuse.\n\"She preyed on vulnerable young girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused,\" Assistant District Attorney Lara Pomerantz said in her opening statement.\nEpstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges in a federal case. His death was ruled to be a suicide.\nProsecutors argue Ms Maxwell was \"essential\" to Epstein's abuse, while the defence said Maxwell was only on trial because they cannot bring him to justice.\n\"The charges against Ghislaine Maxwell are for things that Jeffrey Epstein did, but she is not Jeffrey Epstein,\" her lawyer Bobbi Sternheim argued.\nMs Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sex trafficking and other crimes.\nThe allegations at trial cover the period 1994 to 2004. Prosecutors allege Ms Maxwell was a \"right-hand\" partner for Epstein, helping to groom vulnerable teenage girls as young as 14 for abuse at his luxurious residences.\nThey described her as \"the lady of the house\" who \"helped normalise abusive sexual conduct\".\nMs Maxwell's lawyers will argue her accusers might have faulty memories caused by time and contamination \"by outside information, constant media reports and other influences\". \nBy Pratiksha Ghildial, BBC News reporter in New York\nWearing a pale jumper and glasses, Ghislaine Maxwell sat alongside two of her attorneys listening and periodically taking notes during Monday's proceedings. The prosecutor Lara Pomerantz painted a picture of her as being key to Jeffrey Epstein's alleged \"pyramid scheme of abuse\" of young girls by normalising sexual behaviour under a veneer of respectability. \nSpeaking from behind a glass screen mounted on a podium inside the courtroom, Pomerantz specifically spoke about one accuser who she said was befriended by Maxwell and Epstein on the pretext of bright future opportunities. \nMaxwell's team in turn argued that she was being punished for Epstein's crimes and that this case was about \"memory, manipulation and money\".\nIn the coming days, four alleged victims are expected to testify. The prosecution also plans to get some of Jeffrey Epstein's staff to testify, along with presenting evidence from flight logs of his private plane and Fedex records of gifts sent to the alleged victims. \nAt least a couple of other accusers of Epstein - not connected to this trial - came to listen to the opening statements. One of them told me that she was feeling \"many emotions\" and came to show solidarity to the alleged victims.\nIt's not yet clear if Ghislaine Maxwell will take the stand to testify. \nFour charges relate to the years 1994-97 when Ms Maxwell was, according to an indictment, among Epstein's closest associates and also in an \"intimate relationship\" with him. \nTwo other charges - of sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor - came in an amended indictment and relate to the period 2001 and 2004.\nSarah Ransome, one of Epstein's alleged victims, told the BBC's Panorama programme that Ms Maxwell worked closely with him.\nShe said: \"Ghislaine controlled the girls. She was like the madam. She was like the nuts and bolts of the sex trafficking operation.\"\nBorn outside Paris on Christmas Day, 1961, Ms Maxwell grew up in a country mansion, went to Oxford University and speaks several languages.\nShe is the youngest child of late media mogul Robert Maxwell.\nShe is said to have had a very close relationship with her late father, and he named his luxury yacht - the Lady Ghislaine - after her.\nSoon after her father's death in 1991, Ms Maxwell left the UK to settle in America, where she worked in real estate, and not long after met Jeffrey Epstein.\nShe sold her Manhattan townhouse in 2016, and kept a low profile until she was arrested last July at her secluded mansion in the state of New Hampshire."

The company also had 5,000 customers without power in England and Wales. \nMark Rough, director of customer operations at SSEN, said it had been \"one of the most significant weather events we have experienced in decades\".\nAn SP Energy Networks spokesman said: \"The time it is taking us to get our customers back on is reflective of the number of faults and severity of the damage to the network.\n\"Where normally we would deal with one or two faults on a line and be able to get a number of customers on we've got several faults on one line and where this is repaired we're only able to restore power to a small handful of customers.\"\nCh Supt George Macdonald of Police Scotland's north east division confirmed a major incident was declared due to the scale of the power outages and the impact it was having on people.\nHe said: \"It is clear that, despite the best efforts of all involved, some parts of the area could take up to another 36 to 48 hours to recover and get back to normal in terms of power and water supplies, and other essential services.\n\"Therefore, we will be working hard to get back to normal and officers from Police Scotland are providing additional patrols in areas worst affected.\"\nCh Supt Macdonald reminded motorists to only travel if it was absolutely necessary and for those who must drive, to take warm clothes, food and water. \nAngus Cameron has been without power since fallen trees took down power cables beside his house in Kintore, Aberdeenshire.\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"I don't know if we will be getting power any time soon.\"\nAsked how he is keeping warm, Mr Cameron said: \"We are coming to the burger van to get some hot food and, fortunately, we have have electric generator which we are away to switch on and get some heat. We are not as bad as some people.\"\nMeanwhile, tree surgeon Nick Dearden arrived in Kintore from Southampton on Sunday to help with recovery work.\nHe joked: \"We have been told that we expect to see Armageddon.\"\nOver the next week he expects to be kept busy in Aberdeenshire, Inverness and Edinburgh.\nCharlie Grant told BBC Scotland he has been without power in the village of Killin, Stirling, since about 23:00 on Friday.\nMr Grant said: \"We were watching TV and everything just went black dark.\n\"We looked out the window and the street lights were out.\n\"It was not just us, it was everywhere.\"\nMr Grant, who has relied on his barbeque for cooking, praised the community spirit since the storm hit and said everyone has been looking out for the most vulnerable. \nIn the Aberdeenshire village of Kemnay a local caf\u00e9 took hot drinks, soup and mince pies to a nearby care home.\n\"The power's been off since four o'clock on Friday,\" said Andy Hutcheon, manager of Cafe 83.\n\"Many of the care home residents are our customers and they've been huddled in the reception trying to stay warm. They were delighted to see us.\" \nThe caf\u00e9 also set up a barbeque outside for any other locals who needed a warming drink or a bite to eat. \n\"There's no heating and no-one has a phone signal - so it's been pretty dire,\" he added\nBBC Scotland reporter Steven Duff told The Sunday Show problems with mobile phone coverage have left many people isolated and unable to contact their loved ones. \nHe added: \"There is still a lot of WiFi down, mobile phone coverage is down. Nowadays that's a big thing for people. There's been lots of social media chat of people trying to get in touch with relatives. \n\"I had one tweet today from someone who said they had finally managed to get in touch with their parents in Ballater this morning to tell them that a care centre had been opened there.\"\nAberdeenshire Council has urged people to stay at home and keep an eye on vulnerable and elderly neighbours.\nA spokesman said: \"Alongside our partners we are doing all we can to restore power, provide food and water, and clear debris from our roads and anything else that helps our communities through this challenging weather. \n\"We would urge people to not travel unless their journey is essential. If you are venturing out please check Travel Scotland, make sure you have enough fuel and your mobile phone is charged fully.\"\nAcross the UK, three men were killed by falling trees during the storm, which triggered the Met Office's highest red level storm warning. \nThe 35-year-old driver of a pick-up truck was fatally injured on Friday afternoon in Aberdeenshire, while head teacher Francis Lagan died in Antrim and another man was killed in Cumbria. \nArwen is the first of the Met Office's latest list of named storms this winter.\nThe last red warning in Scotland was in March 2018 during the storm which was dubbed the Beast from the East. \nAre you in the area covered by the red alert?

      "tags": "NI Health,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan has said NI's Covid-19 certification scheme is \"divisive\", has been rushed and should not go ahead.\nThe scheme, which came into effect today, requires people to show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter some venues and events.\nHowever, there is a two-week grace period before fines are imposed on venues that fail to comply.\nThe majority of Stormont ministers agreed to the plan on 17 November.\nHowever, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ministers voted against it. \nMr Givan called for the other parties to explain why they voted in favour of the \"shambolic\" plan. \n\"They need to explain why they voted for something where there wasn't an equality impact assessment, legal opinion there in terms of humans rights implications or economic impact assessments available to other ministers when they voted,\" he told the BBC's Evening Extra programme.\nThe first minister said a reduction in hospital admissions had been achieved in the past week without the Covid passport.\nAccording to the Department of Health's Covid-19 dashboard there are 340 people in hospital today with coronavirus. Last Monday there were 378 Covid-19 inpatients. \nMr Givan said that similar measures in the Republic of Ireland had not worked and again called for the acceleration of the booster scheme rollout which he described as \"the single most effective measure we can take\".\nBusinesses have said there is a lack of clarity around the scheme and how they should enforce it.\nOn Friday, Health Minister Robin Swann said unlicensed premises like cafes would be exempt from the rule at this stage.\nThe Department of Health tweeted on Monday that the regulations had commenced, although they are due to be debated at a later date in the assembly.\nPublished on Monday afternoon, the regulations said businesses must have a system for checking people \"as soon as is reasonably practicable\" when they enter premises.\nFrom 29 November, either proof of vaccination, a negative lateral flow test or a positive PCR test for access to:\nThere will be no enforcement until 13 December to allow for the scheme to be \"bedded in\",  the Department of Health said in a statement last week (DoH).\nThe department said the phased approach followed feedback from the retail, hospitality, tourism and events sectors.\nIt said Covid certification can \"reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings\" as vaccinated people are \"less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people\".\n\"There is also evidence, from several studies worldwide, that even when people get infected, if they are vaccinated they are less likely to transmit it to others,\" it continued.\nCoffee shop owner Scott King said he believed it was \"inevitable\" that businesses like his would soon have to check Covid certification as well. \n\"It's only a matter of time before [Omicron] comes over here,\" Mr King told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"I can see more and more restrictions probably coming in place in the course of the next couple of weeks.\"\nMr King, who is based in Armagh, said Covid certification checks on entry could cost his business an extra \u00a3120 per day.\nMichael McAdam, of Movie House cinema chain, said members of the public will be asked for Covid certificates from Monday. \n\"If you're going to the cinema or going to the theatre tonight, you will be asked, and we're required by law to ask you, what your status is,\" he said. \n\"I think it's probably for the better.\"\nMr McAdam said if it drives up the number getting the Covid vaccination, \"it's probably for the better\".\nStephen Megarian, the managing director of a Belfast pub chain, said it felt \"unfair\" that licensed venues had been \"put in the front line\".\n\"It's just an added difficulty at a very difficult time,\" Mr Magorrian told Good Morning Ulster.\nHe said his business could not afford to face fines for not implementing Covid certification checks.\n\"We've used up our reserves we had in place already,\" he said.\n\"We can't afford to put our licence in jeopardy.\"\nMr Magorrian said his customers were confused about what was required of them, adding: \"We're going to have to be advising and telling them, if they turn up with the wrong stuff, what they need.\"\nDeclan Jordan, manager of a pub and restaurant in Londonderry, said he was frustrated with Stormont's messaging around the Covid vaccine passport. \n\"I'm very annoyed that they [the NI Executive] are just telling us that we have to start enforcing this today, not legally until another two weeks, but they can't tell us exactly what we have to do.\n\"We are trying to operate a business and we are trying to stay open, but we may need to take another employee in to just look after the Covid vaccine passport,\" Mr Jordan told BBC Radio Foyle. \n\"I am so angry, we just need to know what we have to do so we can put things in place.\""

      "tags": "Angela Rayner,Labour Party",
      "text": "MPs should be banned from providing paid parliamentary advice or consultancy services, a report from the MPs' standards committee has proposed.\nIt comes after the case of former MP Owen Paterson triggered concern about MPs lobbying or holding second jobs. \nThe committee also suggested MPs should be investigated for making \"excessive\" personal attacks online.\nEarlier, Labour had called for an overhaul of the system which regulates ministers' conduct. \nThe government has said it is committed to \"reinforcing high standards\".\nThere has been renewed scrutiny of standards in general at Westminster recently, after the government's failed attempt to change the system, while blocking the suspension of the former Conservative MP Mr Paterson.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has since been added to the list of MPs under investigation by Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards - in his case the investigation relates to the \"registration and declaration of an interest\".\nEarlier this month, MPs supported a government proposal asking the committee to come up with recommendations for banning MPs from taking on certain jobs - however, Labour said its own plan to curb second jobs was tougher.\nOn Monday, the Commons Standards Committee, chaired by Labour MP Chris Bryant, published its long-awaited review into the current code of conduct for MPs.\nThe report made a number of draft recommendations including introducing a ban on MPs \"providing paid parliamentary advice, consultancy, or strategy services\".\nIt said MPs taking on second jobs should first seek guidance from the standards commissioner, and where an MP does take on additional work, they should ensure their contract says that they cannot lobby ministers or public officials on behalf of their employer, the committee said. \nThe committee has also suggested that a principle of \"respect\" is added to the MPs' code of conduct.\nThis would mean an MP could be investigated for breaching the code if they subjected anyone \"to unreasonable and excessive personal attack in any medium\" - which includes social media.\nSuch a move would bring the House of Commons into line with its Welsh and Northern Ireland counterparts. \nFollowing the committee's report into Mr Paterson, there was some criticism from Conservatives that the process was unfair, and specifically did not allow for MPs to appeal the conclusions of an investigation.\nThe committee has said it would ask a \"senior judicial figure\" to judge its processes.\nUnder the committee's suggestions, ministers would have to declare any gifts and hospitality on the House of Commons register - in addition to the lists of ministers interests.\nThis would mean any breaches by ministers could be investigated by the standards commissioner. Currently the prime minister judges whether someone has broken the ministerial code.\nThe committee stressed that its recommendations were in draft form and that it would consult further before publishing a final set of proposals for MPs to debate and vote on - expected around Easter 2022. \nEarlier, Labour called for an overhaul of the system regulating ministers' conduct, accusing Prime Minister Boris Johnson of failing to enforce current rules. \nDeputy leader Angela Rayner said ministers should be banned from work relating to their past job for five years after leaving government. \nLabour argued the current rules on ministers' behaviour do not work and have failed to prevent what it describes as government corruption. \nIn a speech to the Institute for Government think tank, Ms Rayner said democracy could not \"hinge on gentlemen's agreements\" and called for a new body to replace the current post of independent adviser on ministerial interests.\nMs Rayner argued that the role was \"toothless\" because its holder could not investigate possible breaches of the rules by ministers unless ordered to do so by the prime minister.\nInstead, Labour says it would set up an \"independent integrity and ethics commission\" to initiate investigations into ministers' conduct without first having to seek the approval of the prime minister.\nIt would have powers to punish those who break the rules. \nMs Rayner told BBC Breakfast: \"We think it's really important that we clean up the [system] because only under this prime minister have we seen that the code's been so flagrantly disregarded, and we can't have this undermining of public standards.\n\"People have to have trust in ministers doing the job that they're there to do, and that's to protect the British electorate and protect our interests, not their own.\"\nResponding to Ms Rayner's speech, Cabinet Office spokesman said: \"The government has committed to continually reinforcing high standards of conduct in public life so the public can have trust and confidence in the operation of government at all levels.\n\"It's absolutely right that we fully take account of all of the evidence and work up the best solutions before responding.\" \nThe spokesman said the government would consider past reports - including one by the Committee on Standards - and would give an update to Parliament \"in due course\"."

They are currently receiving three jabs.\nIn a statement Health Minister Eluned Morgan backed the advice.\n\"All individuals who are eligible for a booster will automatically receive an invitation to attend an appointment when it is their turn,\" she said, adding that there will be a \"significant number of vaccination appointments issuing over the coming weeks\".\nRecent Covid figures in Wales show a continuing downward trend, with cases at 490 per 100,000 people over the past seven days.\nNine more deaths were reported on Monday, bringing the total to 6,391.\nThere were 567 patients with Covid in hospital beds in Wales on Friday, down from 653 the previous week, with 47 patients being ventilated in critical care beds - down from 57. \nMs Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford wrote to the prime minister on Monday calling for an emergency Cobra meeting as soon as possible.\n\"The emergence of Omicron poses a potential threat to the UK,\" they said.\n\"We need to work collectively - and effectively - as four nations to take all reasonable steps to control the ingress of the virus to the country and then to limit its spread.\"\nThey said the day eight PCR test for travellers arriving in the UK should be reinstated, \"requiring isolation for that whole period\".\nThe pair also called for business support schemes to be funded by the UK government's Treasury \"in the event more interventionist measures are required\".\n\"We do not want to be in a position again where our public health interventions are negatively impacted by a lack of financial support, but can be switched on as required for England,\" they said.\nDowning Street responded saying it does not have plans to introduce the requirement for passengers to take a PCR test on day eight as well as day two on their return to the UK.\nThe prime minister's spokesman said: \"We believe the approach we've taken is the proportionate one to the evidence we currently have available.\n\"Introducing further isolation and testing requirements would have a detrimental effect on the travel industry and those planning to go travelling.\" \nHe added ministers were not planning to change their approach with regards to the furlough scheme either. \nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme that ministers would discuss whether Wales will need stricter measures \"over the next few days\", including whether to close schools earlier for Christmas.\nMark Drakeford later said that there are no plans to close businesses - despite the call for financial support from the Treasury.\nHe said people should approach Christmas \"in the way that we've advised all the way through\".\n\"Christmas should be different this year. Christmas should be better this year.\n\"That doesn't mean that people should neglect those simple things that we can do in our own lives, that still help to protect ourselves and others.\n\"Those simple precautions: think about vulnerable people, if members of your family are particularly likely to suffer from coronavirus - think carefully about whether you visit them or involve them in your plans.\n\"Take a lateral flow test if you're going to visit somewhere where you might be at risk or others are at risk wear masks in crowded public places.\"\nDr Atherton said it is a \"matter of buying time\" with the new variant, saying it was a case of when not if the variant will be identified.\n\"Our best line of defence against this still is vaccines and social distancing, those things that we know keep us safe because they can reduce the transmission of this new variant in the community whilst we understand the implications of it.\"\n\"My expectation is that this will probably take off, we will see cases in Wales - we haven't seen any yet but I do expect us to see cases, they will probably increase.\n\"And my anxiety is also about January and February next year, because it does take time for these things to take off.\"\n\"The Omicron variant does give us further cause for concern and the reason for that is that there's so much that's unknown. \n\"We don't know whether it will lead to more harm than the Delta variety and if it does then hospital rates could go up. So we just need to be cautious for the moment, not to throw caution to the wind\".\nTen countries in southern Africa are now on the UK's travel red list, meaning that until further notice, any British or Irish residents arriving in the UK after recently visiting any of those countries will have to quarantine in an approved hotel for 10 days. \nResidents from the countries themselves will not be allowed into the UK until the red list status changes.\nUnder new measures, which came into force at 04:00 GMT, everyone entering the UK from abroad must take a PCR test and isolate, pending a negative result. \nMasks will also be made compulsory again in shops and on public transport in England. \nFace coverings are already mandatory in shops, health and social care settings and on public transport in Wales."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nThe UK's vaccine advisory body, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, is expected to decide whether it will recommend offering Covid booster jabs to more people. Its deputy chairman Prof Anthony Harnden says it would be a \"sensible strategy\" to reduce time between doses and extend boosters to people under 40, who are not currently eligible. This comes as fresh restrictions were announced to tackle the new Omicron variant, which is currently showing higher re-infection risk. Measures covering face masks, schools and travel go before Parliament later.\nAs the Netherlands grapples with record Covid cases and concerns over the new variant it's emerged that police arrested a couple who escaped from a quarantine hotel. Dutch officers detained them on a plane just before take-off from Schiphol airport in Amsterdam on Sunday evening. They've been handed over to the country's health service and it's not known whether they were among the passengers who tested positive for the new coronavirus variant after arriving on two flights from South Africa last week.\nTravel bans imposed by the UK, EU and US after the new Covid variant, Omicron, was detected in South Africa have been condemned by the country's president. Cyril Ramaphosa says he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the action after cases of the heavily mutated variant emerged. He's described the move as unjustified, and called for bans to be urgently lifted. Omicron has been classed as a \"variant of concern\" with early evidence suggesting it has a higher re-infection risk.\nAnyone travelling through India's northern states would be forgiven for thinking the pandemic is over. It is not over and cases are rising in Europe again, prompting the World Health Organization to say it is \"very worried\". So will there be another wave of Covid? And if that happens, is India prepared? Find out here.\nCardiff rugby union team's hopes of flying out of South Africa following travel restrictions imposed on the back of the Omicron variant have been dashed. They'd been due to take the same flight as their Welsh rivals the Scarlets but the club's confirmed two positive Covid-19 cases in their squad. They'll be isolating with Irish side Munster who've also had a positive case. Here's the full story.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nAs more cases of the Omicron variant emerge, find out here whether existing Covid vaccines still work.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "tags": "London Heathrow Airport,Travel & leisure industry,Air travel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Travellers and airlines are scrambling to rearrange plans as the latest Covid restrictions cause travel turmoil for people trying to return to the UK.\nPassengers criticised airlines and government for a lack of information on returning from \"red list\" countries.\nOne told the BBC he had found a return flight from South Africa but now cannot get a quarantine hotel in the UK.\nAlex Clarke, from near Reading, said a lack of hotel space meant he might have to re-arrange his return again.\n\"I should have landed back in the UK this morning,\" he told the BBC. \"My flight was cancelled but I managed to book another for Friday. Now that's been cancelled.\n\"I found return flights via Dubai and Amsterdam, but they have now been closed off. I now have a return booked for Thursday, but the website that books quarantine hotels says everything is booked.\"\nCases of the new Covid variant - Omicron - were first recorded in South Africa last week. There are concerns it could be more infectious and less responsive to vaccines. As a result, Covid rules are being strengthened once more.\nThe government has added 10 southern African countries - including South Africa where Mr Clarke is stuck - to the UK's travel red list. The only people allowed to enter the UK from these countries are UK or Irish nations, or UK residents.\nThey will have to pay for and self-isolate in a pre-booked government-approved hotel for 10 days.\nMr Clarke, who has been staying with friends while his wife and two young children remained at home in the UK, had travelled from Cape Town to Johannesburg when he thought he had secured an alternative flight. He estimates the extra airline, hotel and UK quarantine costs will be about \u00a34,000.\nHe said: \"There has been absolutely no communication from British Airways or the UK government on getting back to the UK. \n\"In the one email received from BA, the helpline that BA set up went to a call centre and the person in the phone had no idea that flights to the UK had been suspended or cancelled.\"\nWhen he telephoned again later, he was directed to BA's website. \nMeanwhile, another traveller, Mike Haswell, from Cardiff, told the BBC on Sunday how he had been struggling to return from Malawi, where he was working. \nHe reached Ethiopia, where ground staff at Addis Ababa airport refused to let UK nationals onto the flight to the UK. \nMr Haswell said he and about 30 other UK passengers have been stuck at the airport for 18 hours and still did not know when a flight would be available. \nIf your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher.\nAn airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer.\nA package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days.\nRead more here\nMeanwhile, Virgin Atlantic has said it will operate its first flight from Johannesburg to London on Wednesday.  The airline has not flown from South Africa since last Friday morning.\nAll passengers will arrive into Heathrow Terminal 4, which is being reinstated as an arrival facility for red list countries and passengers. They will then go to a managed hotel quarantine facility, as per the new guidance. \nA Heathrow spokesperson said: \"We are reopening Terminal 4 as a dedicated arrivals facility for red list countries on Wednesday 1 December. In the meantime, there will be no direct flights arriving from affected areas.\"\nAs well as adding more countries to the UK's red list, the government has said that from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday, 30 November, anyone entering the UK will require a PCR test within 48 hours of arrival and will need to self-isolate until they have a negative result. \nHowever, Willie Walsh, the head of the IATA airline trade body and formerly the boss of IAG, the group that owns BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus, told the BBC that the latest developments exposed the lack of a sensible testing regime and risk-based approach.\n\"I'm very disappointed to see this knee-jerk reaction by governments to the latest development,\" he said.\n\"It's clear that these measures have been completely ineffective in the past but impose huge hardship on people who are trying to connect with families and friends, and clearly massive financial damage to the tourism and airline industry.\"\nMr Walsh said the failure of similar restrictions to prevent a second coronavirus wave in the UK after being implemented in May last year demonstrates they \"do not have any long-term benefits\" and are \"not the answer\".\n\"I think sensible testing regimes which have been proven to be effective could be introduced which would enable people to continue travelling in a safe environment,\" he added.\nTim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents UK-based carriers, also said the government could do more.\n\"The situation is developing rapidly, and hopefully as more data emerges emergency border restrictions can be reversed quickly - and applied only where they will make a material difference,\" he said.\n\"In the meantime, we urge ministers to make mandatory PCR tests free of charge for impacted passengers, many of whom are now in the invidious position of having less than 48 hours to arrange extra testing whilst overseas.\"\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted that the changes were \"targeted measures to provide confidence and protection\", and they would be reviewed in three weeks \"to ensure they are working effectively\".

But it said it was taking measures to protect its Christmas food ranges, including stocking more turkeys and pigs in blankets in store compared to last year. \nIt is also keeping extra stock in depots such as mince pies, confectionary, Christmas cakes and puddings, and has recruited 15,000 temporary staff to work during the busy Christmas period.\nIn September, John Lewis said it was chartering a fleet of extra ships, along with a number of other businesses, to make sure it has Christmas stock on time. \nBoss Sharon White blamed a shortage of shipping containers which had made it tough - and expensive - to get a space on cargo ships travelling from various parts of the world.\nAsda - which was recently bought by the billionaire Issa brothers - said the fall in quarterly sales reflected unusually high demand in the same period last year when people were eating more meals at home due to Covid curbs. \nHowever, its rivals Tesco and Sainsbury's have both reported higher sales in the third quarter. \nAsda said customer habits that emerged in the pandemic had remained, with demand for its online delivery service still 80% higher than pre-pandemic levels. \nIt added that the lockdown trend of customers treating themselves to premium own-label products had also continued.

Before the pandemic, it drew as many as 70,000 people every day - a list that has included celebrities and dignitaries.\nMr Chouksey's replica - nestled deep inside his sprawling 50-acre property, which includes a hospital, has also been attracting a steady stream of visitors. \nPeople walk in the lawns and click pictures, he said. \"A lot of people have also started to do their pre-wedding shoots here,\" Mr Chouksey added. \n\"I don't stop them because in our town, we are a close-knit community where everyone knows everyone. So, my house is open for all.\"\nMr Chouksey said that not all visitors are allowed inside the house because \"after all, it is our home and we live there\".  \nBut sometimes, the family indulges its guests who come and marvel at the house's lush interiors - the intricate flower motifs that decorate the marble walls and floors, and its overarching lattice windows. \nThe house consists of two main bedrooms that are located on two separate floors. It also has a library and a meditation room. The drawing room flaunts marble columns, a curving staircase and a gilded ceiling. \nAlthough the Taj Mahal was the ultimate inspiration, Mr Chouksey said the interiors are not strictly Islamic in design but are infused with contemporary influences, which is evident from the choice of sofas and the curtains. \nBuilding the replica of the famous monument took three years and a flurry of visits to the city of Agra, where the Taj s located, so Mr Chouksey and his wife could study various aspects of the mausoleum. \n\"We also used a lot of 3D images of the Taj Mahal on the internet to build our own,\" Mr Chouksey added. The idea was to build something similar, so the engineers reduced the size to one third of the actual monument. \nMr Chouksey is not the first one to be inspired by the beauty of Taj Mahal. \nIn 2013, a retired government official in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh had also built a replica of the Taj Mahal in memory of his wife. \nBut Mr Chouksey says his house is not dedicated to his wife alone. \n\"Today, there is a lot of hate in our country. People are being divided in the name of religion and caste,\" he said.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP government has been widely accused of polarising India along religious lines, and fostering intolerance. Even the Taj Mahal has been caught in the crosshairs - in 2017, a BJP lawmaker called the monument a \"blot on Indian culture\" built by \"traitors\". Mr Chouksey said he wanted to \"spread love\" in such distressing times. \n\"And this house for me is a symbol of that love - one which goes beyond our social differences and the political noise.\""

      "text": "France's interior minister has said he wants to work with the UK on migration but that talks need to be serious.\nG\u00e9rald Darmanin made the comments at a meeting of European officials following the deaths of 27 people who drowned in the English Channel this week as they tried to cross from France to the UK \nThe UK's invitation to the meeting was halted in a diplomatic row with France.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel described her absence at the meeting in Calais as \"unfortunate\".\nBut she says she is holding separate urgent talks with European ministers this week.\nThe UK's absence came after Emmanuel Macron reacted angrily to Boris Johnson's public call for France to take back migrants who reach the UK. \nThe French president accused the UK prime minister of showing a lack of seriousness by publishing the letter on Twitter.\nThe UK government insisted that the letter was sincere and urged France to reconsider its invitation, with Mr Johnson saying: \"This is a problem we have to fix together.\"\nBelgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany and the European Commission attended the talks in Calais, which Mr Macron set up to deal with the recent surge in migrant crossings of the Channel.\nThe sinking of an inflatable boat last Wednesday marked the biggest loss of life by drowning in the Channel in many years, with 17 men, seven women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children dying.\nMany of the victims came from Iraqi Kurdistan. They include Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin, the first to be named, who was trying to join her fiance in the UK. \nSpeaking at the start of the meeting, Mr Darmanin said he wanted to work with the UK to deal with the crisis.\n\"Britain left Europe, but not the World. We need to work seriously on these questions... without being held hostage by domestic British politics,\" he said.\nThe interior minister added that there had been too many deaths and \"we cannot accept that any more people die\".\nBut he also argued that the UK had to assume responsibility by making itself less economically attractive for illegal migrants.\nIn the few studies that exist, family ties have been identified as the main reason migrants wish to travel from France to the UK. Immigration expert Marley Morris told the BBC the UK had introduced policies that make it much harder to work illegally.\nOfficials at Sunday's meeting agreed that Frontex, the European border agency, would send a plane to help combat migrant trafficking in the Channel from Wednesday.\nEU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said the criminal groups organising the trips were acting \"more or less on an industrial scale\".\n\"That's why it's so important to have an even closer police cooperation with the help and support from Europol,\" she said."

      "text": "When Anne Burgess isn't skiing or flying a glider, you are likely to find her roaming around some of Scotland's remotest locations, camera and map in hand.\nThe retired tourism officer from Fochabers in Moray is one of an army of volunteers whose mission is to capture and document rural and urban locations and share free-to-use images with the public.\nThey form a unique online community project called Geograph, a charity which aims to collect \"geographically representative\" photographs and information about every square kilometre of Britain and Ireland. \nSince 2005, more than 13,000 contributors have submitted seven million pictures covering 281,000 Ordnance Survey (OS) grid squares. \nThey include landmarks, landscapes and urban environments - everything from cemeteries and castles to monuments and old factories - even motorways, railways and dilapidated housing estates. \nMany of the volunteers, including Anne, happily describe themselves as \"map nerds\", poring over OS maps in order to find new and tough-to-reach locations.\nBut photography is also an essential part of the project.\nAnne says in the past 16 years, she has submitted more than 40,000 images to the Geograph website.\n\"I've been taking photos all my life,\" she says. \"There are so many wonderful places around Scotland and you can find plenty of interesting things to photograph almost anywhere.\"\nThere's a competitive element to the process too, as contributors earn points (but not prizes) for their efforts. The highest number of points are awarded to those who find grid squares which have never been covered.\nEach member of the Geograph family has his or her own reason for being part of the project.\nDevon-based journalist Lewis Clarke says he likes \"to document history and changes in the landscape\". \nSince 2009, he's uploaded more than 80,000 images, ranging from the M5 motorway to rolling countryside and city scenes. He's even captured a number of fires and floods during his time.\n\"Geograph is definitely not a collection of pretty photos - albeit there are many photos uploaded which are very impressive - but it is a place to record history. \n\"I enjoy taking photos for future generations, of places which will soon become developed and construction sites.\"\nHe adds: \"I've had people get in touch from across the globe asking if they can use images of mine in textbooks, for displays, in media online, and most recently on an episode of the BBC's Saving Lives at Sea. \n\"In my mind, it proves that every image you take may have some use to somebody somewhere, even if you're never quite sure what it is at the time.\"\nLewis admits that he gets some stick from family and friends for his hobby. \n\"My mum compares my obsession with trying to grab (grid) squares as nerdy, and akin to trainspotting. \n\"When in Germany taking photos out of a car windscreen for the German equivalent site, my friend had to explain to our international friends that I was doing it because 'I was a bit weird'.\"\nFabian Musto, who joined four years ago at the age of 13, says Geograph has brought him a sense of contentment.\n\"Geograph has helped me deal with autism and social anxiety, since walking in tranquil countryside places makes me feel at ease as I find it difficult to cope in loud and busy environments,\" the Herefordshire resident explains. \n\"After completing a walk in the countryside or a trip to castles and churches, I feel happy to look back on my photographs and treasure memories of the visits for a long time.\" \nChemistry teacher Richard Webb, a Geograph veteran, says anyone joining the project would be contributing to a national archive and helping to provide a major resource, especially for education.\n\"Geography covers a lot of things and overlaps with our courses in many ways - agriculture, petrochemicals, industrial planning, the environment,\" he says.\n\"It is a particularly good resource when covering other subjects. Usually you can find relevant and often local images quickly for any subject.\"\nScotland-based Richard, who acts as a moderator of the Geograph site, says contributors share certain things in common, including an enjoyment of the outdoors lifestyle - and a love of maps.\n\"Almost all contributors are into maps in some way. You have to be comfortable with the national grid and reading maps to find contributing easy, which explains why it is a bit of a niche activity. \n\"However technology has made that aspect a lot less daunting.\"\nRichard is among the most travelled of the Geograph community, having visited sites as far apart as the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth, Foula in the Shetland islands, County Mayo in Ireland and \"the far flung corners of England while travelling to cross-channel ferries\".\nHe adds: \"Mostly my pictures are taken in places where I would be anyway doing outdoor stuff - hills, wilder places and the coast - especially islands. \n\"When I go out deliberately to take photos, I am usually drawn to urban and industrial areas where there are so many interesting subjects.\"\nGeograph has so far mapped about 85% of Britain and Ireland's grid squares - some many times over the years - although there are places that have proved to be inaccessible, such as military sites.\nRichard explains: \"I don't think there are any uncrackable grid squares. \n\"I have managed a fair few awkward ones myself. Frustratingly enough, I have visited several undocumented squares at Porton Down but was not allowed to photograph them. \n\"Surely someone on the inside could send in a close-cropped bit of rabbit-mown grassland to us without any security implications?\"\nHe adds: \"Most of the remaining unvisited squares are reasonably accessible - it just requires commitment to travel to them.\"\nAnyone interested in submitting a photograph to the Geograph website can find out more information by clicking here."

      "tags": "Companies,Social media,Jack Dorsey,Twitter",
      "text": "Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is stepping down as chief executive of the company.\nHe will be replaced by the current chief technical officer, Parag Agrawal, Twitter said. \nMr Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter in 2006, has been serving as chief executive of both Twitter and payment firm Square.\n\"It's finally time for me to leave\" he wrote in a statement, saying the company was \"ready to move on.\"\nMr Dorsey said he had \"deep\" trust in his replacement. \"I'm deeply grateful for his skill, heart, and soul. It's his time to lead,\" he said.\nMr Agrawal joined Twitter in 2011, and has been the firm's head of technology since 2017.\nMr Dorsey challenged corporate conventions with his nose-ring, long beard, and a wellness regime including yoga and eating only one meal a day.\nBut he came under pressure from investors, who felt Twitter was not getting the focus it needed while he was also running Square.\nOn Sunday, Mr Dorsey tweeted, apparently unprompted: \"I love Twitter.\"\nIn a separate message to the official corporate statement, Mr Dorsey tweeted: \"Not sure anyone has heard but I resigned from Twitter.\"\n\"There's a lot of talk about the importance of a company being 'founder-led'. Ultimately I believe that's severely limiting and a single point of failure,\" he wrote in an attached email he sent to staff.\nHe added that he would leave the board after his term expires.\n\"Why not stay or become chair? I believe it's really important to give Parag the space he needs to lead.\"\nTwitter's share price jumped as rumours of Mr Dorsey's departure emerged, first reported by CNBC.\nBut by mid-afternoon shares were trading just under their value at the end of last week.\nVictoria Scholar, investment analyst at Interactive Investor, said the development had not come as a surprise to Twitter's board members \"who have reportedly been preparing to say goodbye to Dorsey since last year\". \nThe change was being seen \"as a way for Twitter to turn over a new leaf and take bigger risks\", she said.\nPerhaps Mr Dorsey's most daring move was to ban former President Donald Trump from the platform, following the riots at the Capitol building. It provoked strong criticism from Mr Trump's supporters.\n\"People tend to conflate Jack Dorsey with Twitter censorship, but my sense is he's actually done what he could these past few years to keep the platform relatively open,\" tweeted Mike Solana, head of the private equity firm Founders Fund.\n\"Things will be worse without him, not better. Godspeed, bird king,\" he added.\nIn a way, Jack Dorsey typifies the Silicon Valley chief executive. \nHe's a multi-billionaire - and has founded two hugely successful companies - Twitter and Square. \nYet he dresses in tie-dye t-shirts and sports a beard like a wizard. He's a hippie at heart, with high ideals for how technology can change the world for good. \nHe genuinely believes, for example, that Bitcoin has the ability to create \"world peace\". And with Twitter, he certainly has changed the world. \nIn particular it revolutionised how politicians communicate with voters - and how news is communicated with the public. \nPerhaps the best known user of Twitter was Donald Trump. The populist US president used the platform as a key way of bypassing traditional media. \nThe decision to remove him from the platform after the Capitol Hill riots was undoubtedly the most controversial moment of Jack Dorsey's time. \nThe nature of his departure is also interesting. He is extricating himself from the company, even giving up his board seat. \nThat's very different to say, Jeff Bezos, who retains much influence at Amazon despite stepping down as boss earlier this year. \nMr Dorsey claims this is his decision. But at a multi-billion dollar company, there could well be more at play behind the scenes.\nHe is in his mid-40s, and still has lofty ambitions to change the world. With his track record, he may well do so again.\nThe 45-year-old co-founded the company with Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Noah Glass in 2006.\nMr Dorsey has, however, become the face of the company, having sent the earliest tweets on the service and due to his long tenure as chief executive.\nHe left the role of Twitter chief in 2008 and founded the digital payments app Square, which has also grown into a multi-billion dollar company.\nHowever, he was brought back to helm Twitter in 2015 after then-chief executive Dick Costolo stepped down.\nThe role has seen him appear in televised inquiries before US politicians to be quizzed about his platform and its potential role in the spread of disinformation - something Twitter has been repeatedly accused of acting too slowly on in recent years.\nLike other social media sites it has also been accused of political bias on both sides of the US political divide.\nCalls for his departure came in 2020 from Elliott management, an investment firm which owns a significant amount of Twitter's shares. The firm reportedly felt that a full-time chief executive with only one company to run would be better for Twitter's fortunes.\nBut the two sides later came to an agreement which saw Mr Dorsey remain in his post.\nReacting to the news of Mr Dorsey's resignation, Elliott said the new management team were \"the right leaders for Twitter at this pivotal moment for the company\".\nThe change in leadership comes alongside several other changes to Twitter's board, including the appointment of Bret Taylor, an existing Twitter board member and veteran of Google and Salesforce, as the new chairman. \n\"I want to thank Jack for his visionary leadership and unrelenting dedication to Twitter since its founding,\" Mr Taylor said.\n\"Jack returned to Twitter and turned the Company around at the most critical time. The progress since then has been nothing short of incredible. \n\"Jack has given the world something invaluable and we will continue to carry it forward.\""

      "tags": "SNP Conference,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "The Scottish child payment will increase to \u00a320 per week from April, Nicola Sturgeon has announced.\nThe first minister said more than 100,000 children under the age of six would benefit from the payments.\nThe Scottish government is aiming to expand the payment to all under-16s by the end of 2022, with more than 400,000 children and their families eligible.\nMs Sturgeon said the move was \"the boldest and most ambitious anti-poverty measure anywhere in the UK\".\nShe told the SNP conference that it would involve \"hard choices elsewhere in our budget\", but said eradicating child poverty was \"essential\" to Scotland's future.\nThe child benefit was set up as part of the new Social Security Scotland agency in the previous Holyrood term after more welfare powers were devolved to Scotland.\nMs Sturgeon originally set out the pledge to double it from \u00a310 to \u00a320 per week ahead of May's Holyrood election - at a point when statistics suggested child poverty levels in Scotland had been \"gradually rising\" even prior to the pandemic.\nAt that time, the first minister said it would take until the end of 2022 to get the system fully up and running and delivering monthly payments, with a \"bridging\" system in place in the meantime.\nHowever in her SNP conference speech, she said cash would be committed in the Scottish government's next budget to start payments from April of next year.\nShe said: \"That means the doubled payments will reach over 100,000 children under age six in just four months' time. \n\"Delivering it isn't easy. It will involve hard choices elsewhere in our budget. But it is a choice we in the SNP - in partnership with the Greens - are opting to make.\n\"Poverty scars too many childhoods. It deprives too many children of the chance to make the most of their education and enjoy life to the full, and it robs of our country of far too much potential. \n\"Eradicating child poverty is essential if we are to build the strongest foundation for Scotland's future.\"\nA report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in October had called for the payment to be doubled \"as soon as possible\".\nBut it said that even if this was to happen, the Scottish government would still miss its interim child poverty targets in 2024 by about 4% unless additional measures were also urgently taken.\nThe foundation called for a \"far greater scale and pace of activity\" in supporting single-parent households and minority ethnic families in particular.\nMs Sturgeon also pointed to the doubling of free childcare hours and the delivery of 200,000 baby boxes as evidence her government is \"determined to lift children out of poverty\".\nShe said the budget would include \"significant\" extra funding for the NHS, along with \u00a330m to help GPs increase primary care services in communities\nMuch of the speech focused on the Covid-19 pandemic, with Ms Sturgeon telling delegates that the Omicron variant is \"causing profound concern\".\nShe urged people to get vaccinated, saying this was \"the most precious gift we can give this Christmas\".\nThis speech, necessarily, underwent a significant rewrite over the weekend as the new Covid variant began to emerge. \nNicola Sturgeon repeatedly told SNP members her first priority and duty would be to deal with the pandemic. \nHowever, she's still working on the basis that it will let up in the New Year and that the independence campaign can \"resume in earnest\" in 2022. \nThe caveat, of course, is \"Covid permitting\". \nShe has also re-committed to doing what's needed to \"enable a referendum before the end of 2023\". \nA timetable the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford has already suggested is possible in an \"ideal set of circumstances\". \nMaking it happen would include bringing forward a referendum bill at Holyrood and formally requesting the UK government to agree to hold the vote. \nWithout that explicit consent, it may fall to the UK Supreme Court to decide whether or not indyref2 can go ahead. \nThe SNP leader also spoke about her goal of holding a new independence referendum, having said on Sunday that she did not know how the new Covid variant could affect her plans.\nShe told delegates that \"in the course of the next year, I will initiate the process necessary to enable a referendum before the end of 2023\".\nAnd she said the party would \"set out afresh the positive case for independence\", with a focus on how it could allow Scots to \"repair the damage of Covid in a way that aligns with our values and priorities as a nation\".\nMs Sturgeon wants to secure an agreement with UK ministers to hold a binding referendum, as happened in 2014, but has been repeatedly rebuffed by Downing Street.\nShe said Prime Minister Boris Johnson should agree to \"let the people decide\" if he had any confidence in his arguments against independence.\nHowever, a UK government spokesperson said \"this is not the time for divisive constitutional arguments\".\nThey added: \"Now more than ever, people in Scotland want to see the UK and Scottish governments working together to protect lives, jobs and recover from the effects of Covid-19 on our economy and public services.\"\nMeanwhile Scottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie welcomed the announcement on the doubling of the child payment, but said it was \"deeply disappointing and irresponsible\" for Ms Sturgeon to focus on \"sowing division between Scotland and the rest of the UK\"."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the Omicron coronavirus variant poses a high risk of infection surges around the globe. \nThe variant could lead to severe consequences in some regions, the WHO said on Monday. \nThe head of the organisation, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, renewed a call for a global push to get vaccines to poorer nations. \nCovid-19 is \"not done with us\" yet he warned.\nThe variant was detected in South Africa earlier this month with initial evidence suggesting it has a higher re-infection risk. South Africa has been praised for its prompt reporting of the variant. \n\"Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic,\" the WHO said.\nSpeaking on Monday, Dr Tedros said scientists around the world are working to discover if the new variant is associated with higher transmission, risk of reinfection and how it reacts to vaccines.\n\"Omicron's very emergence is another reminder that although many of us think we are done with Covid-19, it is not done with us,\" he said. \nHe added that no deaths have been linked to the new variant yet. \nCases have already been reported in a number of countries including Canada, the UK, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands. \nThe new variant has prompted the UK, EU and US to issue a travel ban on Southern African countries - a decision criticised by South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa.\nJapan has announced it is closing its borders to new foreign visitors from midnight on Tuesday, while Australia has paused its long-awaited plan to ease border restrictions. \nTravel into Australia for international students and \"skilled workers\" holding visas was meant to re-start on Wednesday but has now been delayed until 15 December. \nIsrael has also banned foreigners from entering the country. \nIn the UK, Covid booster jabs are set to be offered to all over-18s to help stop a new wave driven by Omicron. \nThe US has also followed suit with Joe Biden telling Americans to \"go get your booster\". He also urged people to wear masks indoors. \nBut Mr Biden also said he did not anticipate any further US travel restrictions or lockdowns at this time. \nThere have been more than 261 million cases and five million deaths around the globe since the pandemic started in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

      "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has appointed Yvette Cooper shadow home secretary, in a wide-ranging reshuffle of Labour's top team.\nIn other moves, David Lammy has been promoted to shadow foreign secretary, replacing Lisa Nandy.\nMs Nandy takes a new role scrutinising Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove.\nNews of the appointments came several hours after the reorganisation began on Monday morning, during a speech by Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner.\nMs Rayner appeared to be blindsided by the news and told reporters she didn't know the details of the reshuffle or the timing of it.\nA source close to the Labour leader said Ms Rayner was told a reshuffle would be taking place on Monday.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Ms Nandy said: \"The gaffer picks the team, that's how it goes and that's how it has always gone... frankly, I couldn't care less about the circus of who's in, and who's out, who's up, who's down, who knew, who didn't.\" \nThe new Labour shadow cabinet met on Tuesday morning. \nMs Cooper replaces Nick Thomas-Symonds, who takes over as shadow international trade secretary from Emily Thornberry.\nElsewhere, Ed Miliband retains his role over climate change policy, but loses his shadow business secretary role to Jonathan Reynolds.\nWes Streeting is promoted to shadow health secretary, handing him a key role in scrutinising the government's response to the pandemic.\nThe 38-year old, who recently recovered from cancer surgery, replaces Jonathan Ashworth, who becomes shadow work and pensions secretary.\nLouise Haigh leaves her post as shadow Northern Ireland secretary, replacing Jim McMahon as shadow transport secretary. \nIt comes after she made headlines earlier this month when she said Labour should be neutral if there was an Irish unity referendum.\nShe will be replaced in the role by Peter Kyle, who is promoted from his former role as shadow minister for schools.\nSir Keir said the reshuffle would give him a \"smaller, more focused shadow cabinet that mirrors the shape of the government we are shadowing\".\n\"I look forward to working with the new team to show we are once again a serious party of government,\" the Labour leader added.\nThe reorganisation is the second big shake-up of Sir Keir's shadow ministerial team since he took over as Labour leader last year.\nHis first, after May's national and local elections, triggered an internal row when Sir Keir attempted to remove Ms Rayner from her roles as party chair and national campaign co-ordinator.\nSir Keir cannot remove her from her main role as deputy leader, as she was elected into this position by party members.\nAlthough Ms Rayner eventually lost both roles, she was given two new shadow cabinet titles following a backlash inside the party.\nTechnically Lisa Nandy's move from the Foreign Office brief is a demotion.\nBut Starmer's team says they want her to be more prominent and visible in taking on Michael Gove on \"levelling up\" - the promise to equalise opportunity across the country, and the government's main mantra.\nA bigger job goes to David Lammy, replacing her in taking on Liz Truss.\nAlong with the return of Yvette Cooper to the front bench as shadow home secretary, the hope is that this reshuffle combines making the best of Labour's experience and the young, bright things of the future.\nIt's certainly likely to create some SW1 box office face-offs between Yvette Cooper and her counterpart Priti Patel.\nRead more from Laura \nMs Cooper, who will now face Home Secretary Priti Patel across the despatch box, previously held the role of shadow home secretary for over four years under Mr Miliband, when he was Labour leader.\nFirst elected in the 1997 Labour landslide, she held several ministerial positions under former PMs Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\nThe reshuffle was criticised by former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a key ally of former leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nHe tweeted: \"Reviving the careers of former Blairite ministers and simply reappointing existing shadow cabinet ministers to new posts does give the impression of Christmas Past, not Christmas Future.\"\nIn other confirmed moves:"

      "tags": "Literature,Libraries,Hay-on-wye,Books",
      "text": "\"How can you not have a library in the town of books?\"\nAfter growing up in an area with a globally renowned literature festival, 11-year-old Thomas now has dreams of becoming an author. \nBut despite some 300,000 book fans visiting Hay Festival each year, council cuts almost left the Welsh border community without a library. \nThe threats sparked such an outcry that a five-year campaign to save it was launched by residents.\n\"I think it would be a cool job to be when I am older, but I am not sure what I would write about yet,\" Thomas said. \nHe's a frequent library user and talks from authors who visit his school during the festival have inspired him to put pen to paper. \nBut he was \"thunderstruck\" when he heard the library faced closure.  \nEvery year since 1988 - Covid permitting, of course - everyone from presidents to celebrities flock to the quiet Powys town to talk about books. Its normal population of 1,500 temporarily swells to about 100,000.\nFormer US President Bill Clinton, who visited in 2001, famously described it as the \"Woodstock of the mind\".\nBut In 2016, Powys council threatened to close 10 rural libraries, including Hay's to make budget cuts.\nFor 10-year-old Maisy, taking away the library would ultimately take away \"lots of opportunities\". For her, the library is \"excellent\" because \"there's always a book for everyone\".\nBut the library, which has been there since 1947, has inspired not only the younger generation. \n\"Books are an integral part\" of 83-year-old Tom Hatherill, who's from Hay. \"It's in my blood,\" he said. \n\"It's important for the youngsters and elderly people because we were brought up to be book readers. To take it from us would be a big loss.\"\nTom did not know what a library was until his mates introduced him in 1947. Since then he has fallen in love with the \"real gem of a place\" - he currently has three Hay Public Library books on the go. \nHe found the proposal to shut the library \"ridiculous\" when attending one of the first meetings in 2016.\nFollowing that meeting, a group of 25 members soon turned into 400 after leafleting, public meetings and demonstrations in the town to campaign against the library's closure.\nAfter keeping the threat at bay for years, Hay-on-Wye Library Supporters (HOWLS) \"couldn't believe it\" when plans were announced to slash Powys' rural library service by \u00a3200,000 in 2019.\nIt meant all rural libraries in Powys could be closed and Hay's newly-built library, now homed in a primary school, faced becoming an empty room of books with no librarian once again.\nThe author of His Dark Materials trilogy Philip Pullman called the plan \"a disgrace to civilisation\" and \"an act of destructive folly\" at Hay Festival in 2018.\nThe public outcry of support prompted an extensive rethink by the council after the proposal failed to win backing by just one vote. \n\"It's been a fight to keep our library open,\" said Anita Wright, chair of HOWLS. \nShe said the community had been \"outraged\", adding: \"If you're a single mum you can go in there to meet other parents at story time and we've had a number of homeless people go in there and seek support from a librarian over the years.\"\nWith the town no longer having a community centre and registrar's office, Anita said the library was \"not just a place you can borrow a book, it's a community hub\", adding: \"It's the last outward facing part of our local council.\"\n\"I wasn't going to let them take that from us,\" Anita said. So this time, HOWLS changed strategy.\nIt set up HayPublicLibrary.org Community Interest Company (CIC) with the aim to negotiate a five-year contract with Powys to keep its loved library open.\nAfter conducting consultations with libraries in the county, Councillor Rachel Powell found that Hay's CIC was a potential resolution to saving libraries locally. \nHay Library lends about 17 books an hour, with 340 borrowed a week.\nMichael Eccles, founder and director of the CIC, said the cuts were confusing considering it cost Powys just 2.23% of its combined library budget to run, ranks the fourth cheapest library to run in the county and has the lowest cost per loan.\nIn negotiations, Michael said it became more evident to everyone from these statistics that Hay was an \"extremely good\" library to arrange a legally binding contract with to keep it alive.\n\"I don't know... all I know is we've got the basis for looking forward,\" said Anita.\nThe contract has an option to extend if the town raises \u00a325,000 over the next five years, but supporters are aiming to top that. \nMichael sees the future of the library as a place not only to lend books, but to develop networks that look after \"the resilience and security of our local community\".\nHe said, in light of the climate crisis, he plans to use the library to facilitate welfare security, food security and more. \nMs Powell said: \"This has only been successful due to those members behind it, whose shared vision and willingness to work with the local authority in collaboration, has ensured the future of Hay Library is secured.\""

      "tags": "Birmingham,Perry Barr,Walsall,Kingstanding",
      "text": "A 14-year-old has been jailed for at least 16 years for murdering schoolboy Keon Lincoln, who was shot and stabbed outside his home.\nThe 15-year-old was attacked by a group of youths on Linwood Road, Handsworth, Birmingham, in January.\nA judge at Birmingham Crown Court lifted restrictions on naming 14-year-old Yussuf Mustapha who was accused of firing the fatal shot.\nThree others were also sentenced for murder.\nTahjgeem Breakenridge, 18, from Oldfield Road, Balsall Heath, Birmingham and Michael Ugochukwu, 18, from Twyning Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, were both sentenced to life with a minimum term of 19 years.\nA 16-year-old Walsall youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was ordered to be detained for at least 17 years. \nKieron Donaldson, 19, of Aston Lane, Perry Barr, Birmingham, was sentenced to a 12-year custodial term for Keon's manslaughter, having supplied weapons to those involved in the attack.\nPrior to sentencing, the court was told Mustapha and Keon went to the same school and they had \"appeared to get on reasonably well together\".\nLord Justice William Davis said Keon's murder had been \"carefully planned and executed\" using a revolver and a stolen car.\n\"It's quite clear that all who came from the car were party to the use of the gun,\" he said.\nHe told Italy-born gunman Mustapha, who had no previous convictions, that material before the court indicated he had lived \"a decent life with his family\" prior to the murder.\n\"According to the pre-sentence report he has been able at times to show a maturity in advance of his age,\" the judge said.\n\"Certainly there is no indication that he is immature for his age or that he suffers from any behavioural issues which might have led to the events of 21 January.\"\nLord Justice Davis said the only mitigating factor in Mustapha's case was his age \"given that, for someone of his age, many years in custody will appear, literally, to be a lifetime\".\nMustapha's barrister, Adam Kane QC, told the judge his client was from a loving family and had been doing well at school, academically and in sport.\nKeon's mother, Sharmaine Lincoln, who had been at home when her son was attacked, called the convicted teens \"heartless, evil monsters\".  \nIn a victim impact statement, she said: \"I'm in a nightmare I cannot wake up from, my heart is broken without repair. \n\"I miss my boy so much, it physically hurts, I can only hope the day will come when the senseless murder of children will end.\"\nThe judge told the sentencing hearing: \"She heard the shots. She went out to find her son dying on the pavement. Not only has she been robbed of her son when he was only 15, but also she had to experience the trauma of watching him die.\"\nHe added: \"When a 15-year-old boy is killed in that way the first question will be why? That question has never been answered.\"\nThe trial heard Keon was fatally wounded outside his home in a \"short and brutal\" attack.\nHe was repeatedly stabbed by a group who chased him after getting out of a stolen car. He was then shot in the stomach as he lay on the ground, the court was told, and died two hours later at Birmingham Children's Hospital.\nProsecutors said a Ford S-Max, which had a false registration plate, was used. It was later involved in a crash on Wheeler Street, Birmingham, where investigators found forensic evidence including a hunting knife.\nDetectives previously said it was not clear whether Keon had been specifically targeted or attacked \"by chance\".\nBut Lord Justice Davis said the lack of clarity did \"not mean that the murder of Keon was motiveless\". He said: \"It simply means that neither the jury nor I have any notion of what the motive was.\" \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
