      "title": "Johnson & Johnson vaccine paused over rare blood clots",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US, South Africa and European Union will temporarily stop the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) Covid jab, after reports of rare blood clotting.\nSix cases were detected in more than 6.8 million doses of the vaccine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said.\nJohnson & Johnson has paused its EU rollout, which started this week.\nIt follows similar cases after doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which prompted curbs to its use.\nThe FDA said it was recommending the temporary pause \"out of an abundance of caution\". It confirmed that one patient died from blood clotting complications, and another is in a critical condition.\nAll six cases were in women aged between 18 and 48, with symptoms appearing six to 13 days after vaccination.\nFollowing the advice, all federal sites in the US have stopped using the vaccine until further investigations into its safety are completed. State and private contractors are expected to follow suit.\nThe US has by far the most confirmed cases of Covid-19 - more than 31 million - with more than 562,000 deaths, another world high. \nJohnson & Johnson is a US health care company, but the vaccine was developed mainly by  a pharmaceutical branch in Belgium with laboratories in the Netherlands, and is also known as Janssen. Unlike some of the other jabs, it is given as a single shot and can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures, making it easier to distribute in hotter climates or more remote areas.\nWhile many countries have pre-ordered millions of doses, it has only been approved in a few nations.\nIt was cleared for use in the US on 27 February, but the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been used more widely. The J&J vaccine has been administered to nearly seven million people in the US, which is around 3% of the total immunisations given so far. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's top Covid adviser, said it was too early to comment on whether it could have its authorisation revoked. \nSouth Africa, which was the first country to administer the vaccine, has also paused its use, although no cases of blood clots have been reported in the country. \nThe jab became the preferred vaccine there after studies showed it had a higher protection rate against the South African variant than other jabs. Since mid-February, nearly 300,000 healthcare workers have received it. \nThe World Health Organization told Reuters it was monitoring the situation and waiting for reports from the US and European regulators.\nHowever deliveries of the vaccine to EU countries started just 24 hours before J&J said it would pause the European rollout. As it has not been administered in the EU yet, experts there will be looking to the United States to see what their next move is.\nThe EU's vaccine roll-out has been criticised by the WHO for being too slow, and and there are concerns this latest delay could throw it into further turmoil. \nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine is yet to be approved in the UK, although 30 million doses are on pre-order. The Department of Health said the rollout delay would not affect vaccine supplies in the UK, or derail the aim to offer a jab to all adults by the end of July.\nCanada has pre-ordered 10 million doses of the vaccine, and is \"still on track\" to receive the first shipment by the end of the month, said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\"But obviously, we're following closely the developments in the United States,\" he added.\nIn a joint statement, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said they were \"reviewing data involving six reported US cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&J vaccine\".\nIt said the clotting was called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).\nThe statement said that this type of blood clot needed a different treatment than usual.\nThe common treatment - an anticoagulant drug called heparin - \"may be dangerous\", it said.\nPending a further review, the FDA and CDC recommended \"a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution\".\nThe joint statement said that \"people who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their health care provider\".\nJohnson & Johnson issued a statement saying that it shared \"all adverse event reports\" with the health authorities.\nIt added: \"We are aware that thromboembolic events including those with thrombocytopenia have been reported with Covid-19\u00a0vaccines. At present, no clear causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the Janssen (J&J) Covid-19 vaccine.\"\nBy Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter\nThe US health protection agency has identified a very small number of the same rare form of blood clots seen in people given the AstraZeneca jab.\nGovernments around the world have cautiously begun to link these rare blood clotting incidents to the vaccine because of their unusual presentation - though this link hasn't been definitively proven.\nPeople suffering them had very low platelet counts - blood cells that normally help repair damage in the body.\nThe Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines work in very similar ways. so in some respects it's not surprising they may cause similar side effects. And these appear to be comparably rare.\nThe numbers we're talking about are so low that it's difficult to say confidently what the risk of fatal blood clots is, but for the AstraZeneca jab it has been estimated at one-in-a-million. There have been six cases out of 6.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson jab.\nIn contrast, Covid kills one in 1,000 infected in their 40s among those who develop symptoms (and this risk is much higher among older people).\nOnce you get into the youngest age groups, who are less likely to die from Covid, that risk calculus shifts, particularly when there aren't too many infections in circulation."

      "tags": "Belfast,Religion",
      "text": "The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and Policing Board need to reconnect with communities and build and restore trust, NI Secretary Brandon Lewis has said. \nHe said the decision not to charge anyone over the Bobby Storey funeral had a \"very substantial impact\". \nMr Lewis was addressing Parliament in the wake of recent rioting.\nAlmost 90 police officers have been injured, although recent nights have been quiet. \nWhen the disorder began in loyalist areas at the end of March, it was linked to both a decision not to prosecute anyone for breaching Covid regulations at the Storey funeral last June and tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal.\nSome violence has also been linked to police operations targeting the South East Antrim UDA, a paramilitary group involved in organised crime.\nMr Lewis told the House of Commons on Tuesday that 88 police officers had been injured in the violence, with 18 arrests made and 15 people charged. \nHe said that in the wake of the Bobby Storey funeral decision, there was a \"very important role for the PSNI and Policing Board to be working with communities to restore and build that trust\".\nHe said the decision that was made has had \"a very substantial impact\".\nMr Lewis added that there was work that the PSNI and Policing Board \"need to do to reconnect with communities, to show communities that they are there, the PSNI is there for the safety and protection of everybody across the entire community of Northern Ireland\".\nAmid calls for the convening of a British-Irish summit to discuss the violence, Mr Lewis said he would look at the \"appropriate time\" for another meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC), but he added policing was a devolved matter and did not fall under the remit of the BIIGC. \nThe lack of trouble in recent nights has been linked to the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, although there were disturbances in Belfast and Coleraine on Friday night, hours after his death was announced.\nSaturday also marked the 23rd anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, which signalled an end to years of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland.\nThe rioting has largely seen youths throwing bricks, fireworks and petrol bombs at lines of police officers and vehicles.\nMr Lewis travelled to Belfast last week for a series of political and civic society meetings in the wake of the violence, and was in Northern Ireland again on Monday. \nIt comes as church leaders penned an open letter appealing for politicians to provide a unified response to the recent \"heartbreaking\" scenes of violence, saying its causes are complex and deep-rooted.\nTheir plea is addressed to Northern Ireland ministers, the British and Irish governments and the European Union. \nOn Monday, the Church Leaders' Group (Ireland), which wrote the open letter, met PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne - who has faced calls from unionist political leaders to resign - to express concern for injured officers.\nThey have called for the \"entire\" Northern Ireland Executive to approach the EU and UK government to deal with the fallout of Brexit and the Irish Sea border, and for politicians to express their support for the PSNI.\nThe letter stated the intensity of the violence directed at police had been \"horrific\". \nIt said the PSNI had a political legitimacy across the community which is enjoyed by few other institutions. \n\"It is vital that we address concerns in a way that strengthens our democratic processes rather than undermining them,\" they added.\nThe letter was signed by the Reverend John McDowell and Archbishop Eamon Martin, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland and the Catholic Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland respectively, as well as the Reverend Dr David Bruce, moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Reverend Dr Tom McKnight, president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, and the Reverend Dr Ivan Patterson, president of the Irish Council of Churches. \n\"As Christian Church leaders from across the island of Ireland, we appeal to our political leaders to come together in a unified response to the heartbreaking scenes witnessed on our streets last week and renew their commitment to peace, reconciliation and the protection of the most vulnerable,\" the letter states. \nIn the House of Commons on Tuesday, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the violence was not justified. \nHe said the issue was trust, and that taking the peace process forward has to be built on trust. \n\"That trust was broken in relation to the findings of the Bobby Storey funeral and it has undermined people's trust and confidence in policing and justice in Northern Ireland and there is a two-tier policing system in the eyes of some and that needs to be addressed,\" he said. \nParty colleague Ian Paisley said the Bobby Storey funeral decision was the \"straw that broke the camel's back\", but the Northern Ireland Protocol lies at the heart of the issue. \nHe said \"all the condemnation in the world will not make that violence go away until actions are taken\". \nAlliance MP Stephen Farry expressed his \"full support for the PSNI, including the chief constable\".\nHe said an EU-UK veterinary agreement would \"take the heat\" out of the controversy around the NI Protocol.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that while policing was devolved, peace was not, and he pressed the secretary of state to hold a meeting of the BIIGC. \nThe situation was also earlier raised in the House of Lords by former SDLP leader Baroness Ritchie, who also asked about a British-Irish meeting.\nConservative frontbencher Viscount Younger of Leckie said a range of options was being considered, including the BIIGC. \n\"Nothing is off the table,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, Sinn F\u00e9in's national chairman and MLA Declan Kearney has accused the DUP of reckless behaviour and \"political vandalism\" against the Good Friday Agreement. \n\"The Good Friday Agreement is under renewed assault from those who have always rejected power sharing and the DUP is directly responsible,\" he said.\nMr Kearney added that \"bellicose rhetoric\" from the DUP, including the call for Mr Byrne's resignation, was a \"wrecker's charter\".

      "tags": "Pollution,Rivers,Environment,Environment Agency",
      "text": "Water companies have been illegally dumping untreated sewage into rivers in England and Wales, an investigation by BBC Panorama has found.\nData analysed by the programme showed some companies have regularly breached the conditions in their permits.\nTreatment works are only allowed to put sewage into waterways after wet weather and when they are close to capacity.\nThe water industry says it will invest more than a billion pounds over five years to reduce discharges into rivers.\nTreatment works are allowed to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather, such as torrential rain, and when they are operating close to full capacity.\nThis protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes.\nThe untreated sewage is normally screened and passed through storage tanks before it is dumped.\nDischarge permits issued by the Environment Agency specify the level of sewage each works has to treat before it can dump untreated sewage.\nBut Panorama's investigation found one water company was discharging sewage without a permit and evidence that another company had given the Environment Agency incorrect information about the sewage it was dumping in the river.\nRecent figures published by the Environment Agency reveal untreated sewage, including human waste, wet wipes and condoms, was released into waterways for more than three million hours last year.\nPanorama gathered detailed data from 10 water companies in England and Wales through environmental information requests. They were each asked for information on a handful of sewage works.\nThe data suggests seven of the 10 companies had treatment works that were breaching their permits by dumping sewage before they were treating the specified volumes.\nOne of the worst offenders was the not-for-profit company, Welsh Water. The data shows three of its treatment works were in breach of their permits.\nIts Aberbaiden plant illegally dumped untreated sewage into the River Usk on 12 consecutive days in December.\nThe Usk is supposed to be a protected river, as it is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation.\nAngela Jones, who swims in the river every day, was shocked by the programme's findings: \"I know so many people who swim up that area, you know. It's just appalling, absolutely appalling. \n\"We can see clearly that they are releasing sewage into the water when they're not allowed to.\"\nOpen water swimmers, kayakers, paddlers and dog walkers have been asked to avoid contact with the water during and after sewage spills. \nThe Rivers Trust, an organisation which campaigns to protect rivers in England and Wales, has compiled a map of where water companies release treated sewage and overflows of untreated sewage into rivers.\nIt advises people not to enter the water immediately downstream of where treated sewage is released, and to avoid the overflow areas, especially after wet weather.\nPanorama also discovered Welsh Water has been using a sewage overflow pipe on the River Usk that doesn't have a permit.\nThe company has been illegally dumping untreated sewage through the pipe, sometimes on several occasions a day.\nWelsh Water told the programme it hoped to have a permit for the overflow pipe by July and it doesn't accept its sites are operating illegally. \nThe company said it works closely with regulators and works hard to comply with all environmental regulations. \n\"We continue to invest significantly in our network so that we minimise the impact of our activities on the environment. However, these solutions and processes can sometimes take many years to resolve in order to fully investigate, design solutions, and secure funding.\"\nAdditional data about an eleventh water company, Thames Water, was shared with the programme by the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution.\nIt showed the company's giant Mogden treatment works in south-west London has been illegally dumping billions of litres of untreated sewage.\nThe data revealed Mogden - which deals with waste from more than two million people in the city - breached its permit on 43 days last year.\nAnother Thames Water site, Stanton Harcourt in Oxfordshire, dumped sewage almost continuously for three consecutive months at the start of last year.\nThames Water said the sewage is partially treated because it is screened and settled in storage tanks. \nIt said a small number of its sewage works have struggled following periods of heavy rainfall and it is investing heavily to improve the sites.\n\"Putting untreated sewage into rivers is unacceptable to us, to our customers and to the environment, even when legally permitted,\" the company said. \"We absolutely want to go further, invest more, and play our part in helping the environment to thrive.\"\nPanorama also investigated the Wetherby treatment works run by Yorkshire Water.\nFootage shot by local campaigner Mark Barrow shows the works dumped untreated sewage into the River Wharfe on several occasions last year.\nBut the programme found Yorkshire Water failed to report any of these spills to the Environment Agency.\nIts annual filing showed no sewage dumping at all at Wetherby.\nYorkshire Water said: \"We have not misled the Environment Agency, this is a single data anomaly within a very large set of data and we will certainly investigate what has happened here. There is a process for correcting submitted data with the Environment Agency and if it is found that there has been an unreported discharge we will report this in due course.\"\nPanorama: The river pollution scandal will be on BBC One at 19:40 BST and later on the BBC iPlayer."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales has given 84% of people eligible for Covid boosters a vaccination, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales.\nThe programme has slowed down since before Christmas, delivering 3,752 booster doses a day in the last week.\nAt its height, 50,524 doses were given out on 21 December.\nTwo-thirds of vaccines given out in the past weeks were boosters, while more than 13,000 second doses, mainly to 12 to 15-year-olds.\nPeople can receive a booster three months after receiving their second vaccine, so it means that 84% of those eligible for a booster vaccine have now been reached in Wales.\nThat figure on 27 January was also 84% in Scotland, 81% in England and 75% in Northern Ireland.\nTo reach the remaining eligible people, at the current rate, it would take just over three months.\nThe situation is complicated by those who catch Covid having to wait before they can receive a booster, with higher proportions of the 18 to 40 age group infected since Christmas.\nThe total is 1,875,473 boosters given out by 27 January.\nThese include more than 42% of 18 to 29-year-olds and more than half of those in their 30s.\nWe can see that by last Sunday, 68% of adults had received their booster jab.\nMonmouthshire (78.6%) had reached the most and Cardiff (61.7%) the fewest.\nWith the over-50s, Monmouthshire has reached more than 88% and Powys, Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend and Caerphilly more than 87%. Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot (about 82%) have reached the fewest.\nAround 77% of people in their early 50s had also been given the booster and 81% of those in their late 50s.\nFor care home residents, the range is from just over 82% in Pembrokeshire to 96.6% of those on Anglesey having a booster.\nWales is slightly behind Scotland with the proportions of their populations given a first jab - 79.1%.\nBy 27 January, 2.5m people in Wales had been given their first dose. \nA total of 2,361,042 people have received a second jab, or 74.5% of the total population. \nMore than 64% of 16 and 17-year-olds have now received a second dose.\nWales (74.9%) and Scotland (75.3%) are close together on the proportions of second vaccinations.\nBy 27 January, England was on 71.6% and Northern Ireland trailing a little on 69.1%.\nFor the proportion of its population with booster doses, Wales is ranked fifth in the world, compared with other nations with a population above 1 million.\nWhen we look at figures within Wales, we can see Powys reached nearly 81% of its total population with two doses and 67.9% with boosters. \nSwansea Bay has reached the fewest proportion for vaccines, for all three doses (54.2%).\nNearly 62% of the youngest age group offered vaccines have taken a first dose in Wales by Wednesday.\nBut there is a big variation between counties. This ranged up to last Sunday from 74.1% in Monmouthshire and 70% in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) to less than half of 12 to 15-year-olds in Neath Port Talbot taking up the offer.\nRCT and Merthyr Tydfil have so far reached nearly half of this age group with second doses too."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "The Covid-19 restriction on travelling around Scotland are to be relaxed from Friday, while people are to be allowed to meet up in larger groups outdoors.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said measures were being eased earlier than planned to help people's mental health.\nPeople will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings.\nAnd they will be permitted to travel across Scotland to do so, as long as they do not stay overnight.\nOther restrictions are expected to be eased from 26 April - with premises including shops, gyms, pubs and restaurants due to reopen on a restricted basis.\nHospitality businesses will need to close their doors at 20:00 indoors and 22:00 outdoors, with alcohol only allowed to be served outside.\nGroups of six people from six different households will be allowed to meet in outdoor hospitality. \nRestrictions on travel from Scotland to other parts of the UK are also expected to be lifted from 26 April.\nFrom 17 May, pubs will be able to open indoors until 22:30 and contact sports, cinemas, and some small scale events will be able to take place.\nAlso from that date in May, up to four people from two households will be able to meet indoors.\nOutdoor drinking and dining resumed on Monday in England, with shops, hairdressers, gyms and zoos also opening their doors.\nAnd many hospitality and tourism businesses in Scotland have criticised the more cautious approach north of the border.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the Scottish Beer and Pub Association, said Ms Sturgeon's announcement \"falls short of what is required to make licensed premises viable\".\nShe added: \"We desperately need a return to licensing hours indoors, as well as allowing alcohol to be sold indoors from 26 April.\n\"The first minister points to indoor reopening being ahead of England, but without alcohol service it is meaningless to licensed hospitality businesses and little comfort to Scottish brewers and other parts of the supply chain who will see no benefit.\"\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that \"we do still need to be cautious\" to keep case numbers down and to prevent new variants of the virus from being imported.\nThe changes were announced as the first minister confirmed that Scotland has \"effectively met\" its initial vaccination target of offering a first dose to all over-50s, unpaid carers and adults with particular underlying health conditions.\nMs Sturgeon said infection rates had been higher in Scotland than other parts of the UK in recent weeks, but were now \"falling more markedly and more consistently\". \nThe first minister said this meant she could confirm a \"very significant re-opening of the economy\" from 26 April, when the whole of Scotland will move into level three of the Covid-19 restrictions system.\nScotland's island communities - which have been in level three for some time - will stay in the same level as the mainland in the immediacy, to allow people to travel between areas.\nMs Sturgeon said she expected the whole of Scotland to then move to level two on 17 May - allowing people to meet up indoors - and to level one and then zero in June.\nAnd she said some changes to the travel restrictions that had not been due to come into force until 26 April would be made earlier than originally planned in an effort to boost people's mental health and wellbeing.\nThe first minister insisted the move had nothing to do with the ongoing Holyrood election campaign, saying there was \"a bit of limited headroom\" to make changes due to the fall in case numbers and progress in vaccination.\nIt means that people will be allowed to travel across Scotland from Friday of this week, though people are still being urged to stay local for non-essential shopping. \nIn addition, people can meet in groups of up to six adults outdoors from Friday. \nMs Sturgeon said this would allow \"long awaited and much-anticipated reunions\" of families and friends.\nPeople are currently not allowed to leave their local authority areas for anything other than essential travel, and only four adults from a maximum of two households are allowed to meet up outdoors.\nHowever, the first minister urged caution over the possibility of foreign travel.\nGovernments across the UK are attempting to agree on rules for international travel on a four-nations basis, but Ms Sturgeon warned that it \"remains a significant risk\" given the spread of the virus elsewhere in the world.\nShe said a ban on international travel could be \"the price we pay for greater normality here in Scotland\" and necessary to \"protect our progress here\".\nScotland recorded just 199 new cases of the virus on Monday - the lowest daily total for seven months - although the figure increased to 221 on Tuesday, with the deaths of a further three people who had previously tested positive also being recorded.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed the move to ease travel restrictions earlier than planned, having previously said the emergence from lockdown was too slow compared to England.\nHe said: \"Scotland's hospitality sector is on its knees and that is compounded by seeing equivalent businesses across the border reopening sooner. Every day that doors stay closed, more jobs are lost. \n\"This positive direction of travel is possible thanks to the immense sacrifices people continue to make but the game-changer is the UK's extraordinary vaccine programme.\"\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the changes were a \"welcome announcement for many who have been separated from loved ones for so long\".\nHe added: \"We need to ensure that this lockdown is our last. We need to continue, and improve the pace of, the vaccine roll out and ensure the testing and tracing infrastructure is in place to support a return to normal.\"\nThe Scottish Greens welcomed the announcement, but said that caution was needed if the country was to avoid another wave of the virus.\nThe party's Mark Ruskell said: \"We probably don't want to replicate the images of large groups gathering that we saw in London. A surge in gatherings could create a surge in the virus and avoiding that is hugely important to avoid the risk of a third lockdown.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said he was concerned that the Scottish government had \"consistently acted too late on testing and tracing\".\nHe added: \"With hospitality businesses in other parts of the UK now open, the Scottish government must now make sure that financial support is now available to ensure that Scottish businesses don't lose out.\""

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nAll over-50s and those in high-risk groups in the UK have been offered a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, in time for Thursday's target, according to the government. Boris Johnson says it's \"another hugely significant milestone\", as the programme focuses on giving out second doses, a record 475,230 of which were administered on Saturday. The government also says it's on target to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July, although that's dependent on supply.\nEngland becomes the latest nation to start offering the Moderna jab - the third Covid-19 vaccine to be licensed in the UK - as it's made available at 21 sites. Wales and Scotland began using the Moderna vaccine last week. Developed with similar technology to the Pfizer jab, it provides an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for under 30s, after concerns about a possible link to very rare blood clots.\nPeople aged 11 and over who live, work or travel through Wandsworth and Lambeth are being urged to get a PCR test, after confirmation of a cluster of coronavirus cases involving the South African variant. So far, there have been 44 confirmed and 30 probable cases of the variant, which it's feared could spread more quickly and affect how well vaccines work.\nThe UK economy \"showed some improvement\" in February, growing by 0.4% despite Covid restrictions remaining in place to varying degrees across all four nations of the UK, according to official figures. However, the impact of coronavirus was still evident, with the economy 7.8% smaller than a year earlier, before the UK felt the impact of the pandemic.\n\"Like we're out of prison,\" was how one reveller summed up enjoying a drink outside a bar in London's Soho district at the end of England's lockdown. Another told us it was \"how I imagine VE Day\". Others faced \"Arctic\" conditions, as snow fell in various locations. One man, who found a \"cosy\" sheltered terrace in Newcastle, wasn't to be deterred: \"We're from the north so we're used to it.\"\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\n... the rules on socialising in pubs, cafes and restaurants, if they're open where you live.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "About 40 people were arrested just north of Minneapolis in a second night of unrest over the police shooting of a black man.\nProtesters in the city of Brooklyn Center defied a curfew and threw objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and tear gas.\nPolice said Daunte Wright, 20, was shot and died after an officer mistook her gun for a Taser during a traffic stop.\nThe shooting came as the high-profile George Floyd murder trial continues.\nThis report contains strong language\n In a courtroom just a few miles away, ex-police officer Derek Chauvin is charged with murdering the African American man in May last year.\nDerek Chauvin's defence team on Monday asked for jury members to be sequestered - separated from other people - as they might be swayed by the latest events. The judge denied the request.\nThe officer who shot Mr Wright was named on Monday as Kim Potter, 48, who has worked for Brooklyn Center Police for 26 years.\nMr Wright was pulled over on Sunday for a traffic violation, but there was a struggle when he tried to get back into his car.\nAfter drawing her gun, apparently by mistake, the officer said: \"Holy shit, I just shot him.\"\nThe curfew went into force at 19:00 (midnight GMT) across four counties with a huge law enforcement deployment.\nIn a press briefing after midnight local time, Minnesota State Patrol colonel Matt Langer said officers had reached out to organisers to try to keep protests peaceful but \"unfortunately... the organisers weren't able to influence the desires of the crowd\".\nCol Langer said officers had been \"shelled pretty significantly with objects\" including fireworks.\nHe said protesters had pushed against the fence of the Brooklyn Center police headquarters and a decision had been made to push back the crowd.\nThere were \"sporadic\" incidents of looting in the area and in other parts of Minneapolis and neighbouring St Paul.\nIn response to the unrest, US President Joe Biden said peaceful protest was \"understandable\" but added: \"I want to make it clear again: there is absolutely no justification, none, for looting.\"\nShortly before midnight, Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliot said he had spoken to Daunte Wright's father and would \"do everything to ensure justice is served\".\nBBC's Barbara Plett Usher reports from the scene\nOne sign at the protest captured the mood: \"During the trial!!?\" it read in bright orange letters. \n\"It's ridiculous,\" said the young man carrying it. \"They know they have a delicate relationship with the black community right now and they should look to be making amends, not this.\"\nCity officials had said the shooting could not have happened at a worse time, with tensions high over the George Floyd case. \nSome protesters threw bottles and shot fireworks toward police lines. They vented their rage as officers in riot gear stood impassively. \"You took his life, for what?\" screamed a young woman. \n\"He was a son, he was a father, he was a black man that deserved to live.\"\n\"Do you know the difference between a gun and a Taser?\" shouted someone else. \"Hell yeah,\" roared the crowd, scorning the police chief's belief that the shooting was a tragic mistake. \n\"There's no room for accidents,\" said one man. \"The fact is that we lost another young black male to a police officer.' \nPolice Chief Tim Gannon he believed the shooting of Mr Wright to be \"an accidental discharge\".\nHe was stopped by police for having expired car registration plates and they then discovered an outstanding warrant out on him, so tried to arrest him, said the police chief.\nDuring a news conference on Monday, he played a video from the body camera worn by the policewoman which shows Mr Wright trying to get back into his car as officers attempt to handcuff him on the side of the road.\nAn officer can then be heard saying \"Taser, Taser, Taser\" - normal police procedure before firing one of the stun guns. Mr Wright is seen to get into his car and drive away, while the same officer admits, using an expletive, to having shot him.\nFatally wounded, Mr Wright crashed a few streets away.\n\"It is my belief the officer meant to deploy their Taser but shot him with a single bullet,\" Chief Gannon said, adding: \"There's nothing I can say to lessen the pain.\"\nDaunte Wright's aunt, Naisha Wright, told CNN she did not believe the police account, saying officers knew the difference between a gun and a Taser.\nShe said: \"I've owned an over 20,000 volt Taser. They don't feel nothing like a gun.\"\nThe officer has been placed on administrative leave - temporary leave with benefits and salary still paid.\nMayor Elliot has said she should be fired. He will make a decision on Tuesday about whether Chief Gannon will keep his job, the StarTribune reported.\nAnalysis by BBC Reality Check\nAxon, the Taser manufacturer, says its weapons are designed to be distinguishable from handguns. \nA company statement reported by the local media said it had \"implemented numerous features and training recommendations to reduce the possibility of these incidents occurring...This includes building Taser energy weapons to look and feel different than a firearm.\"\nDifferent Taser features include:\nAlmost all American police departments now issue their officers with Tasers, according to an estimate by Reuters news agency. \nPolice officers are typically trained to keep guns in a holster on their dominant side to avoid confusing it with their Taser, kept on the belt on the other side of the body. \n\"So if you're right handed you carry your firearm on your right side and [you] carry your Taser on your left,\" Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon told reporters.  \nMistaking a gun for a Taser is relatively rare, but has happened before. \nComprehensive nationwide figures aren't available. However, a law journal published in 2012 found nine examples of police officers accidentally using a handgun instead of a Taser between 2001 and 2009.\nThere have also been more recent instances of a suspect being shot instead of Tasered, such as in 2019 when a shoplifter was accidentally shot and seriously injured in St Louis, Missouri.\nThe trial of Derek Chauvin over the death of George Floyd has been under way in the city for two weeks now.\nMr Chauvin was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest operation in Minneapolis last May. The footage of the incident sparked global protests against racism.\nOn Monday, Mr Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson called for jury members to be asked about the Daunte Wright shooting to determine if what they had heard could affect their verdict.\nHe repeated a call for the jury to be kept separate from the public, but Judge Peter Cahill said full sequestering would only start when closing arguments began.\nLaw enforcement officials have been bracing for possible unrest once the jury reaches a verdict.\nGeorge Floyd's death sparked waves of protests around the city, many peaceful but some violent with hundreds of buildings damaged."

      "text": "George Floyd's younger sibling has testified \"I miss my brother\" as prosecutors prepare to rest their case against the ex-officer accused of murdering him.\nAfter the state of Minnesota spent more than two weeks making the case against Derek Chauvin, his defence team will begin to present its case on Tuesday.\nMr Chauvin is on trial after he knelt on Mr Floyd's neck during his arrest last May. \nHe has denied the charges.\nTensions are high in Minnesota after the fatal shooting of a 20-year-old black man by a white police officer in a suburb only 10 miles (16 km) away from the courtroom where Mr Chauvin's trial is taking place.\nMr Chauvin's trial has been closely watched. Footage of Mr Chauvin, a white man, kneeling on the neck of Mr Floyd, a black man, sparked global protests against racism and policing in the US.\nPhilonise Floyd took to the stand as a \"spark of life\" witness, a circumstance by which the prosecution in a Minnesota trial can humanise the victim for the jury.\nMr Floyd, 39, remembered his brother as \"a big mama's boy\" and \"a leader to us in the household\" as the court was shown old photos from their childhood.\nHe mused about their competitiveness as siblings: \"Me and George played video games all the time. I finally beat him in a game and I was just so happy thinking about that.\"\nThrough tears, the younger Floyd recounted how his brother had cried at their mother's funeral and \"didn't want to leave the casket\" because \"he loved her so dearly\".\n\"I miss both of them,\" he said.\nTwo expert witnesses testified on behalf of the prosecution about their independent reviews of the Floyd arrest.\nDr Jonathan Rich, a Chicago-based cardiologist, told the court that, in his professional opinion, George Floyd did not die of a heart attack or drug overdose.\nHe noted his review of Mr Floyd's medical records since 2018 indicated problems with hypertension, high blood pressure and struggles with drug addiction, but turned up no evidence of a previous or oncoming heart attack. He added the deceased had \"an exceptionally strong heart\".\nHe said the footage made it clear that Mr Floyd died \"gradually and slowly\" because he was restrained \"in a life-threatening manner\" and then lay on the ground \"pulseless without any CPR\" for too long.\nUse of force expert Seth Stoughton, a law school professor with prior law enforcement training, said the force used by Mr Chauvin and the other officers apprehending Mr Floyd was \"unreasonable, excessive and contrary to generally accepted police practice\".\n\"The sanctity of human life is the highest priority in policing,\" said Mr Stoughton.\nHe added that \"the duty to assist and render aid\" whenever possible was the second priority, observing that officers failed to do so.\nThe defence suggested an op-ed written by Mr Stoughton a few days after the incident suggested he had already made up his mind long before he testified on Monday.\nThe witness retorted: \"I think it's fair to say that I formed the opinion that putting your knee across someone's neck - except in unbelievably rare circumstances - is generally an inappropriate use of force.\""

      "text": "There will be no limit on the number of people allowed to attend weddings, civil partnerships and receptions in England from 19 July.\nRules will also ease in Scotland on that date. \nFrom 19 July, there will be no limits on the number of people who can attend services or receptions, whatever the venue. \nCurrent rules about social distancing and face coverings will no longer apply, there will be no requirement for table service, and restrictions around singing and dancing will also end.\nAt the moment, any number of guests can attend a wedding ceremony or reception held outside, or in a Covid-secure public venue. \nWeddings held in outdoors private settings - such as gardens - require a risk assessment to determine how many guests can be hosted safely. \nA marquee or other structure in a private garden must have at least half of its walled area open to be classed as \"outdoors\". \nWeddings in private homes can only take place with six people or two households present, unless one of those getting married is seriously ill, in which case 30 people can attend.\nThe maximum limit of who can attend wedding and civil partnership ceremonies and receptions depends on the Covid level.  \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the whole country will move to level 0 on 19 July, meaning up to 200 guests can attend a wedding. \nThe actual permitted number of guests for a particular event will still depend on the size of the venue. The marrying couple and witnesses are included in this number, but people working at the wedding are not. \nThe government hopes that more restrictions will be scrapped on 9 August, subject to a decision next month.\nThe number of people who can attend wedding or civil partnership ceremonies or receptions is determined by the size of the venue and a Covid risks assessment. \nThe celebration must be organised by a business in a regulated venue, such as an hotel.\nFace coverings must be worn indoors by everyone aged 11 and over when not eating or drinking, unless they have a reasonable excuse. \nThis does not apply to the married couple or the person officiating. \nFood and drink are permitted in line with hospitality guidance. \nThere is no limit on the number of people at a wedding, but venues must assess how many they can safely accommodate. \nDuring the ceremony, face coverings must be worn by everyone (unless exempt), apart from the wedding couple and the person officiating.\nReceptions can take place, subject to the following rules:\nSome rules are due to change on 26 July, subject to approval on 22 July. Volume restrictions on live music will be removed and social distancing rules will be relaxed.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) published guidance in September 2020:\nWedding insurance shouldn't affect your right to a refund, but you can't get your money back twice. \nMost insurance doesn't cover a ''government act\", so is unlikely to pay out if lockdowns affected your wedding. \nRecent wedding insurance policies are unlikely to cover coronavirus.\nSome policies will pay out if your supplier/venue has gone bust.

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Queen Elizabeth II,Windsor Castle",
      "text": "The Queen has conducted her first in-person royal duty since her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, died on Friday.\nThe monarch hosted a ceremony in which the Earl Peel formally stood down as Lord Chamberlain, whose office organises royal ceremonies.\nDuring a private event held at Windsor Castle, the Queen accepted her former royal aide's wand and office insignia.\nThe Royal Family is observing two weeks of mourning. The duke's funeral will take place at Windsor on Saturday.\nA royal official said members of the family would continue \"to undertake engagements appropriate to the circumstances\".\nThe Earl Peel announced he would retire as Lord Chamberlain last year, with his replacement Andrew Parker, a former MI5 chief, beginning in the role just over a week before Prince Philip died.\nTuesday's official engagement was recorded in the Court Circular - a daily list of the events attended by the Queen and her family.\nIt said: \"The Earl Peel had an audience of The Queen today, delivered up his Wand and Insignia of Office as Lord Chamberlain and the Badge of Chancellor of the Royal Victorian Order and took leave upon relinquishing his appointment as Lord Chamberlain, when Her Majesty invested him with the Royal Victorian Chain.\"\nThe Earl Peel had overseen arrangements for the duke's funeral - known as Operation Forth Bridge.\nThe Lord Chamberlain's Office, led by the Queen's Comptroller Lieutenant Colonel Michael Vernon, is tasked with the practical side of the day.\nBut in overall charge is Baron Parker who took up his new role on 1 April, following the Earl Peel's retirement after more than 14 years in the post.\nDespite losing her beloved husband of 73 years on Friday and being a week away from her 95th birthday, the Queen is carrying on with the job.\nShe never really stopped. On the day it was announced that Prince Philip had died, she had to go through the revised funeral plans which she then approved. They were made public the following day.\nOne imagines that, had she wanted to, yesterday's audience to mark the retirement of the former Lord Chamberlain could have been postponed until the period of royal mourning was ended. But that is not her way.\nIn an interview with the BBC, the former Prime Minister Sir John Major said he hoped the Queen would be given time and privacy. \n\"I know she is the monarch, I know she has responsibilities, but she has earned the right to have a period of privacy in which to grieve with her family,\" he commented.\nFew would disagree but the Queen has a work ethic and commitment to duty and service which she has always placed above all other considerations.\nThe ceremony at Windsor Castle came after the Queen held a phone call with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday, according to the Court Circular.\nOn Sunday, the Duke of York said the Queen had told her family that Prince Philip's death at the age of 99 \"left a huge void\" in her life.\nHe added: \"The Queen, as you would expect, is an incredibly stoic person.\n\"She described it as having left a huge void in her life but we, the family, the ones that are close, are rallying round to make sure that we're there to support her.\"\nThe funeral, on Saturday at 15:00 BST, will be a much more low-key event due to the pandemic, but Buckingham Palace says the plans reflect Prince Philip's wishes.\nHis coffin will be carried in a modified Land Rover, which the duke helped to design, as part of a procession from the State Entrance of Windsor Castle to St George's Chapel.\nMembers of the Royal Family will walk behind the coffin, although the Queen will travel separately. Meanwhile, guns will be fired in salute and a bell will toll.\nInside the chapel, the Royal Family will wear face masks and keep to social distancing rules. Only 30 people will be able to attend, in line with coronavirus regulations.\nThe Duke of Sussex has returned to the UK from his home in the US to attend the funeral, although the Duchess of Sussex will not make the trip on medical advice."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People aged 45 or over in England will now be invited to get a Covid jab, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.\nThe vaccination programme would then move on to everyone aged 40 or over \"in line with supplies\", he added.\nAppointments can be made on the NHS booking website, which temporarily crashed on Tuesday morning when it opened up to the new age group. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon also confirmed over-45s would start to get invites in Scotland this week.\nUnlike in England, appointments there will be allocated and there are no plans to introduce an online booking service.\nIn Northern Ireland, people aged 40-45 are eligible to get a Covid vaccine, while in some areas in Wales 40-49 year-olds are being invited.\nAll over-50s and those in high-risk groups in the UK have been offered a first dose of the vaccine.\nIn other developments:\nThe UK has bought millions of that vaccine, also known as Janssen, but the Department of Health said the delay would not affect the UK's vaccine efforts.\nA further 2,472 coronavirus cases were recorded across the UK on Monday, with a further 23 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported. \nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that coronavirus infections and deaths will start to rise again as restrictions were eased.\nHe said that although the vaccination programme had helped reduce the numbers, \"the bulk of the work in reducing the disease has been done by the lockdown\" and he urged people to be \"cautious\".\nHowever, he said he could not see any reason to change England's roadmap out of lockdown. Mr Johnson added that he was \"very confident\" about the UK's vaccine supplies.\nMr Hancock said the government was \"on track\" to offer a vaccine to everyone aged 18 or over by the end of July after meeting an earlier target for offering jabs to the most vulnerable.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Mr Hancock hailed the \"remarkable achievement\" of delivering more than 40 million vaccine doses and fully vaccinating 7.8 million people.\nThe health secretary also confirmed the rollout would descend through the age groups, based on advice from the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nThere are an estimated 3.7 million people in England aged 45 to 49.\nGiven how quickly the vaccination programme has been rolled out in the UK, hitting the target of all priority groups by mid-April is not unexpected. \nAnd remember, there is no published data on the number of people offered jabs, as opposed to those who have actually been vaccinated. However, NHS England has made clear that across the nine groups, 95% have actually had their first doses - that is an average, with take-up rates varying in different groups.\nOnline bookings for the next age group, those aged 45 and over, have opened in England. Text messages to 48 and 49-year-olds from local vaccination centres are set to go out soon. \nBut what's not known is to what extent supplies of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will fill the gap caused this month by supply problems with the AstraZeneca doses. \nThe government is sticking to the line that the programme is on track to offer every adult a first dose by late July. \nBut officials qualify it by saying this is \"subject to supply\" - and that is a key variable.\nProf Brown, a member of the JCVI, predicted there will be a \"mix-and-match\" for vaccines in the coming years.\nHe told the BBC: \"It's practically going to have to be that way because, once you've completed a course of, say, the Moderna or Pfizer or the AstraZeneca with two doses, in the future it's going to be quite difficult to guarantee you get the same type of vaccine again.\n\"So there will be a mix-and-match occurring just by the sort of practicalities of doing a third or fourth vaccination over the next few years.\"\nHe added that trials involving mixed vaccine combinations were ongoing.\nAnother member of the JCVI, Prof Adam Finn, welcomed the news that the UK had completed the first phase of its vaccination programme but added: \"We're only halfway up the hill.\"\nHe told the BBC: \"We mustn't take our eye off the task and we've got to keep working to get to the top.\"\nProf Finn said people over 50 who have not been invited for a first dose of the vaccine should make a \"gentle enquiry\" with their GP.\nSurge testing has been implemented in the Wandsworth and Lambeth areas of south London after a cluster of the South African Covid-19 variant was found. \nThe BBC has seen documents that show the outbreak appears to have been triggered by an individual who travelled from an African country in February that was not on the red list for mandatory quarantine, but is now.\nThe government has also announced that students in England will return to university \"no earlier than 17 May\", with an offer of supervised Covid tests."

      "text": "Veteran politician and Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Shirley Williams has died at the age of 90, the party has announced.\nShe was hailed as a \"Liberal lion and a true trailblazer\" by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey.\nOriginally a Labour MP, she was part of the \"Gang of Four\" who quit the party to found the Social Democratic Party.\nShe was a leading member of the 1970s Labour government and one of the first women cabinet ministers.\nShe later went on to support the SDP's merger with the Liberal Party, which led to the creation of the Liberal Democrats in the late 1980s. \nHer career in politics spanned more than 50 years, after she first entered Parliament as the Labour MP for Hitchin in 1964. \nShe retired from political life in 2016, after leading the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords. \nThe Lib Dems said she died peacefully in the early hours of Monday. \nSir Ed said she had been an \"inspiration to millions,\" and news of her death was \"heartbreaking for me and for our whole Liberal Democrat family\".\n\"Political life will be poorer without her intellect, her wisdom and her generosity,\" he added. \n\"Shirley had a limitless empathy only too rare in politics today; she connected with people, cared about their lives and saw politics as a crucial tool to change lives for the better.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described her as \"a kind and thoughtful member of the once radical centre left\". \n\"Even when we disagreed - as we often did - she had the gift of sounding so completely reasonable at all times.\n\"I spent many happy hours sparring with her on Question Time. She will be much missed.\" \nBaroness Williams served in several ministerial roles under the premiership of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson, before landing her first cabinet job in 1974 as the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection. \nWhen Wilson resigned as Labour leader in 1976 his successor, Jim Callaghan, made her Secretary of State for Education and Science.\nShe lost her seat in the 1979 election when Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher came to power following the so-called Winter of Discontent.\nAfter this, she found herself increasingly out of step with the Labour Party on issues including defence and her support for the UK's membership of the European Union.\nShe later quit the party in 1981 - and with leading Labour lights Bill Rodgers, Roy Jenkins and David Owen formed the \"Gang of Four\" which founded the Social Democratic Party.\nWith growing support, the SDP went on to secure 25% of the vote at the 1983 general election, as part of an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party. \nThis only delivered 23 MPs for the fledgling alliance, but then-Labour leader Michael Foot blamed it for reducing his party's share of the vote and giving Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives another term in government.\nThe Alliance fought the 1987 election, but failed to boost its representation in the Commons - with almost 23% of the vote amounting to just 22 MPs.\nLord Steel, who led the Liberal Party during the Alliance, said Baroness Williams was a \"key figure\" in helping it come close to breaking the two-party mould in British politics. \n\"She was a very, very popular person - much more popular than any of the rest of us,\" he told BBC News. \nHe added that she was a \"tremendous public inspirer and communicator, and a real humanitarian\". \nIt was decided in 1988 that the SDP and the Liberal Party should merge, leading to the formation of the Liberal Democrats in October 1989.\nSir Nick Clegg, who stood down as Lib Dem leader after the 2015 election, said he would \"forever be grateful for the support, candid advice and generosity\" Baroness Williams showed him during his time in charge of the party. \n\"Her warmth, commitment to progressive ideals and, above all, her wisdom were a constant inspiration down the years to so many,\" he added.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Baroness Williams had been \"widely respected across politics and was a tireless champion for the causes she believed in\"."

      "title": "Fukushima: Japan approves releasing wastewater into ocean",
      "tags": "Fukushima nuclear disaster,Japan",
      "text": "Japan has approved a plan to release more than one million tonnes of contaminated water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea. \nThe water will be treated and diluted so radiation levels are below those set for drinking water. \nBut the local fishing industry has strongly opposed the move, as have China and South Korea. \nTokyo says work to release water used to cool nuclear fuel will begin in about two years.\nThe final approval comes after years of debate and is expected to take decades to complete. \nReactor buildings at the Fukushima power plant were damaged by hydrogen explosions caused by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The tsunami knocked out cooling systems to the reactors, three of which melted down.\nMore than a million tonnes of water have been used to cool the melted reactors. \nCurrently, the radioactive water is treated in a complex filtration process that removes most of the radioactive elements, but some remain, including tritium - deemed harmful to humans only in very large doses. \nIt is then kept in huge tanks, but the plant's operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TepCo) is running out of space, with these tanks expected to fill up by 2022.\nAbout 1.3 million tonnes of radioactive water - or enough to fill 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools - are currently stored in these tanks, according to a Reuters report. \nEnvironmental groups like Greenpeace have long expressed their opposition to releasing the water into the ocean. \nThe NGO said Japan's plans to release the water showed the government \"once again failed the people of Fukushima\".\nThe country's fishing industry has also argued against it, worried that consumers will refuse to buy produce from the region.\nThe industry was hit extremely hard after the 2011 disaster, with many countries banning the import of sea food caught off Japan's north-eastern coast. \nThe decision has also prompted criticism from Japan's neighbours. Ahead of the decision, South Korea's foreign minister on Monday expressing \"serious regret\".\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian also urged Japan to \"act in a responsible manner\".\n\"To safeguard international public interests and Chinese people's health and safety, China has expressed grave concern to the Japanese side through the diplomatic channel,\" Mr Zhao said. \nThe US appears to support Japan's decision, however, saying it seemed to have \"adopted an approach in accordance with globally accepted nuclear safety standards\". \nJapan argues that the release of the waste water is safe as it is processed to remove almost all radioactive elements and will be greatly diluted.\nThe plan has the backing of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which says the release is similar to the disposal of waste water at other plants around the world.\n\"Releasing into the ocean is done elsewhere. It's not something new. There is no scandal here,\" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in 2021.\nScientists argue that the elements remaining in the water are only harmful to humans in large doses. With dilution the treated water poses no scientifically detectable risk, they say. \nWhile the tritium is radioactive, it has a half-life of around 12 years, meaning it will disappear from the environment over a period of decades rather than centuries. \nRadiation from tritium can be ingested, however, which is why fishing industry groups are concerned about the risk of it getting into the food chain and being consumed through sea food. \nThe risk of this happening is not zero, but the scientific consensus is that it does not pose a threat to human health. \nScientists also point out that vastly more radiation has been released into the pacific by nuclear weapons tests carried out by the US, UK and France during the 1940s, 50s and 60s.\nOn 11 March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the north-eastern coast of Japan, triggering a 15-metre tsunami.\nWhile the back-up systems to prevent a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant survived the initial quake, further damage was inflicted by the tsunami.\nAs the facility's cooling systems failed in the days that followed, tonnes of radioactive material were released. The meltdown was the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986.\nAround 18,500 people died or disappeared in the quake and tsunami, and more than 160,000 were forced from their homes."

      "text": "Taiwan has said a record number of Chinese military jets flew into its air defence zone on Monday.\nThe defence ministry said 25 aircraft including fighters and nuclear-capable bombers entered its so-called air defence identification zone (ADIZ) on Monday.\nThe incursion is the largest in a year and comes as the US warns against an \"increasingly aggressive China\".\nBeijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province.\nHowever, democratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state.\nThe latest Chinese mission involved 18 fighter jets, as well as four bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons, two anti-submarine aircraft and an early warning aircraft, Taiwan said.\nThe defence ministry added they dispatched combat aircraft to warn the Chinese jets, while missile systems were deployed to monitor them.\nChina has carried out regular flights over the international waters between the southern part of Taiwan and the Taiwanese-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea in recent months.\nMonday's incursion also saw the jets fly into the ADIZ to the south-west of Taiwan near the Pratas Islands.\nThe latest incident came a day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was concerned about China's \"increasingly aggressive actions\" towards Taiwan. \nIn an interview with NBC he reiterated that the US had a legal commitment to Taiwan and said Washington would \"make sure Taiwan has the ability to defend itself\", adding that it would be a \"serious mistake for anyone to try to change the status quo by force\".\nThe news of China's nuclear-capable bombers flying ever closer to Taiwan, in larger numbers each time, has left the world wondering what Beijing is doing.\nThere's been speculation ranging from intimidation to a trial run for an actual attack. \nSome have also seen it as China pushing back against the United States which has been boosting links with Taipei and moving its navy around the region.\nHowever, each time Chinese jets fly these missions, they are pushing the line in terms of where the limit might be that would prompt a more deadly response from Taiwan's armed forces.\nThere is much we don't know about Beijing's intentions and much analysis has been guess-work, but here is something that we do know: If you look at the Taiwan-related propaganda inside mainland China it is clearly ramping up, celebrating the might of the PLA air force and decrying enemies on this rogue island.\nThe most concerning thing is the possibility that this is being used to gradually soften up the population to the idea of an actual invasion of Taiwan.\nAnalysts say Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned that Taiwan's government is moving the island towards a formal declaration of independence and wants to warn President Tsai Ing-wen against taking steps in that direction.\nPresident Tsai, however, has repeatedly said that Taiwan is already an independent state, making any formal declaration unnecessary.\nThe island has its own constitution, military, and democratically elected leaders.\nChina has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification with Taiwan.

      "text": "Netflix has announced there will be a third and fourth series of its hit period drama Bridgerton.\nThe announcement comes before its second series has even completed production.\nNetflix has previously said Bridgerton is the biggest series in its history, with 82 million households watching the show in its first month of release.\nHowever, the streaming giant counts a view as anybody who watches more than two minutes of a single episode.\nTherefore, a subscriber who only watches five minutes of one episode and switches off is given the same weight as somebody else watching all eight episodes in full.\nBridgerton is based on Julia Quinn's series of romance novels and produced by Shondaland, which was set up by Grey's Anatomy and Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes. \nIn a statement, the fictional Lady Whistledown said: \"Esteemed members of the Ton. It seems we have a rather special announcement. Bridgerton shall return for seasons three and four.\n\"This author shall have to add more ink,\" the elusive lady added.\nThe first series of the show, which starred Phoebe Dynevor, Nicola Coughlan and Reg\u00e9-Jean Page was released on Christmas Day.\nHowever, it was recently announced that Page will not be returning for series two. \nShonda Rhimes said: \"From the first time I read Julia Quinn's delicious Bridgerton series, I knew these were stories that would captivate a viewing audience\n\"This two-season pickup is a strong vote of confidence in our work and I feel incredibly grateful to have partners as collaborative and creative as Netflix.\"\nBela Bajaria, the vice president of global TV at Netflix said: \"Bridgerton swept us off our feet. The creative team, led by Shonda, knew the material and delivered a beautiful, emotional, romantic drama for our members. They have some exciting plans for the future, and we think audiences will continue to swoon for this show.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "England is giving out its first doses of the Moderna jab, the third Covid-19 vaccine in the nation's rollout.\nIt will be available at 21 sites, included the Madejski Stadium in Reading and the Sheffield Arena.\nAlong with the Pfizer jab, it offers an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for under-30s, after concerns about a possible link to very rare blood clots.\nWales and Scotland began using the Moderna vaccine last week.\nEmily Sanderson, a 28-year-old solicitor with an underlying health condition, said she felt \"brilliant\" after receiving her Moderna jab at Sheffield Arena.\nShe was due to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine but it was switched to Moderna, which she said made her really pleased \"because it gives people in my situation an alternative\".\nAs of Monday, 32,250,481 first doses of a Covid vaccine had been given in the UK, as well as 7,857,396 second jabs, the latest government data shows.\nProf Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, said having \"a third jab in our armoury\" marked another \"milestone\" in the vaccine programme.\nHe said more sites would offer the Moderna vaccine as further supplies arrive.\nAnd he urged people to come forward for vaccination when they are invited, saying the vaccines were \"our hope at the end of a year like no other\".\nThe first person to receive the Moderna vaccine in the UK was 24-year-old unpaid carer Elle Taylor from Carmarthenshire in Wales.\nShe said she was \"very excited and happy\" that being vaccinated meant she could care for her grandmother \"properly and safely\".\nThe Moderna vaccine uses a similar innovative RNA technology to the Pfizer jab, but it is stored at temperatures of -20C, like a normal freezer, compared to -70C for the Pfizer vaccine. It can also be stored for 30 days at normal fridge temperatures.\nThe NHS said the Moderna and Pfizer jabs would be used for under-30s who were due to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine but whose appointments were rearranged.\nLast week, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which advises the UK government on vaccines - recommended that under-30s be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine, out of the \"utmost caution\" following reports of blood clots in about four in one million cases.\nThe NHS said the majority of appointments in April were for second doses, but first dose appointments were still available for people in the initial priority groups who have not yet been immunised - including the over-50s, people who are clinically vulnerable or those working in health or social care.\nMeanwhile, the Department of Health has begun its \"largest surge testing operation to date\" in an effort to bring under control a \"significant\" cluster of cases of the South African coronavirus variant in south London.\nThe Moderna vaccine is a two-dose jab given at an interval of between four and 12 weeks.\nLike Pfizer's, it is an RNA vaccine and works by injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body, where it enters cells and tells them to create antigens.\nThese antigens are recognised by the immune system and prepare it to fight coronavirus.\nNo actual virus is needed to create an mRNA vaccine, meaning the rate at which it can be produced is accelerated.\nIt also only requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer.\nTrial results suggested efficacy against the disease was 94.1%, and vaccine efficacy against severe Covid-19 was 100%.\nMore than 30,000 people in the US took part in the trial, from a wide range of age groups and ethnic backgrounds.\nThe government has bought 17 million doses - enough to vaccinate about 8.5 million people.\nScotland is due to receive more than one million of the UK's order, and the doses will arrive over a period of months.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon cautioned that the supply does not mean the vaccine programme would be accelerated.\nModerna said the vaccine was generally well-tolerated, with no serious safety concerns identified.\nEvents after the first dose included injection-site pain, and after the second dose fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, other pain and redness at the injection site.\nBut these were generally short-lived."

      "text": "Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found.\nThis is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage.\nIncreased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in very specific locations - local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets.\nSome of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not have Covid symptoms.\nThe testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.\nSurge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.\nEast\nNorth West\nWest Midlands\nSouth East\nSurge testing is also currently being carried out in specific and targeted locations within the following local authority areas:\nLondon\nSouth East\nNorth West\nYorkshire and the Humber\nTargeted community testing is also taking place in various health board areas across Scotland. \nScientists have identified a number of \"variants of concern\" - these are  newly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. \nAlso, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines.\nThe Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). \nThe variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming system which uses Greek letters instead. \nThe PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test \nPeople tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. \nThis involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis.\nIt is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result.\nThe lateral flow test \nThis also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes.\nWherever you are in the UK, if you have symptoms you should book a free test online. You will be sent to a testing site or have a testing kit sent to your home. \nIf you have problems booking, call 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland. \nAnyone in England can now get free lateral flow tests each week - even if they do not have symptoms. These can be ordered online, by calling 119, or can be collected from test centres and pharmacies. \nAnyone in Scotland can also order free lateral flow tests online, or collect them from test centres.\nAnyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. NHS Test and Trace will tell their contacts to isolate if necessary.\nSelf-isolating means not leaving home for exercise or even to buy food, medicines or other essentials.\nPeople in England who fail to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nAnyone on a low income who has been told to self-isolate can claim a \u00a3500 payment."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "The Covid-19 restriction on travelling around Scotland are to be relaxed from Friday, while people are to be allowed to meet up in larger groups outdoors.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said measures were being eased earlier than planned to help people's mental health.\nPeople will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings.\nAnd they will be permitted to travel across Scotland to do so, as long as they do not stay overnight.\nOther restrictions are expected to be eased from 26 April - with premises including shops, gyms, pubs and restaurants due to reopen on a restricted basis.\nHospitality businesses will need to close their doors at 20:00 indoors and 22:00 outdoors, with alcohol only allowed to be served outside.\nGroups of six people from six different households will be allowed to meet in outdoor hospitality. \nRestrictions on travel from Scotland to other parts of the UK are also expected to be lifted from 26 April.\nFrom 17 May, pubs will be able to open indoors until 22:30 and contact sports, cinemas, and some small scale events will be able to take place.\nAlso from that date in May, up to four people from two households will be able to meet indoors.\nOutdoor drinking and dining resumed on Monday in England, with shops, hairdressers, gyms and zoos also opening their doors.\nAnd many hospitality and tourism businesses in Scotland have criticised the more cautious approach north of the border.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the Scottish Beer and Pub Association, said Ms Sturgeon's announcement \"falls short of what is required to make licensed premises viable\".\nShe added: \"We desperately need a return to licensing hours indoors, as well as allowing alcohol to be sold indoors from 26 April.\n\"The first minister points to indoor reopening being ahead of England, but without alcohol service it is meaningless to licensed hospitality businesses and little comfort to Scottish brewers and other parts of the supply chain who will see no benefit.\"\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon warned that \"we do still need to be cautious\" to keep case numbers down and to prevent new variants of the virus from being imported.\nThe changes were announced as the first minister confirmed that Scotland has \"effectively met\" its initial vaccination target of offering a first dose to all over-50s, unpaid carers and adults with particular underlying health conditions.\nMs Sturgeon said infection rates had been higher in Scotland than other parts of the UK in recent weeks, but were now \"falling more markedly and more consistently\". \nThe first minister said this meant she could confirm a \"very significant re-opening of the economy\" from 26 April, when the whole of Scotland will move into level three of the Covid-19 restrictions system.\nScotland's island communities - which have been in level three for some time - will stay in the same level as the mainland in the immediacy, to allow people to travel between areas.\nMs Sturgeon said she expected the whole of Scotland to then move to level two on 17 May - allowing people to meet up indoors - and to level one and then zero in June.\nAnd she said some changes to the travel restrictions that had not been due to come into force until 26 April would be made earlier than originally planned in an effort to boost people's mental health and wellbeing.\nThe first minister insisted the move had nothing to do with the ongoing Holyrood election campaign, saying there was \"a bit of limited headroom\" to make changes due to the fall in case numbers and progress in vaccination.\nIt means that people will be allowed to travel across Scotland from Friday of this week, though people are still being urged to stay local for non-essential shopping. \nIn addition, people can meet in groups of up to six adults outdoors from Friday. \nMs Sturgeon said this would allow \"long awaited and much-anticipated reunions\" of families and friends.\nPeople are currently not allowed to leave their local authority areas for anything other than essential travel, and only four adults from a maximum of two households are allowed to meet up outdoors.\nHowever, the first minister urged caution over the possibility of foreign travel.\nGovernments across the UK are attempting to agree on rules for international travel on a four-nations basis, but Ms Sturgeon warned that it \"remains a significant risk\" given the spread of the virus elsewhere in the world.\nShe said a ban on international travel could be \"the price we pay for greater normality here in Scotland\" and necessary to \"protect our progress here\".\nScotland recorded just 199 new cases of the virus on Monday - the lowest daily total for seven months - although the figure increased to 221 on Tuesday, with the deaths of a further three people who had previously tested positive also being recorded.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed the move to ease travel restrictions earlier than planned, having previously said the emergence from lockdown was too slow compared to England.\nHe said: \"Scotland's hospitality sector is on its knees and that is compounded by seeing equivalent businesses across the border reopening sooner. Every day that doors stay closed, more jobs are lost. \n\"This positive direction of travel is possible thanks to the immense sacrifices people continue to make but the game-changer is the UK's extraordinary vaccine programme.\"\nAnd Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the changes were a \"welcome announcement for many who have been separated from loved ones for so long\".\nHe added: \"We need to ensure that this lockdown is our last. We need to continue, and improve the pace of, the vaccine roll out and ensure the testing and tracing infrastructure is in place to support a return to normal.\"\nThe Scottish Greens welcomed the announcement, but said that caution was needed if the country was to avoid another wave of the virus.\nThe party's Mark Ruskell said: \"We probably don't want to replicate the images of large groups gathering that we saw in London. A surge in gatherings could create a surge in the virus and avoiding that is hugely important to avoid the risk of a third lockdown.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said he was concerned that the Scottish government had \"consistently acted too late on testing and tracing\".\nHe added: \"With hospitality businesses in other parts of the UK now open, the Scottish government must now make sure that financial support is now available to ensure that Scottish businesses don't lose out.\""

      "text": "The government's LGBT advisory panel has been disbanded after three members quit last month, the BBC can reveal. \nA government spokesman said a replacement for the panel, which was set up under Theresa May's premiership, \"will be set out in due course\". \nSome members told the BBC they had been willing to stay on when their terms ended on the 31 March.\nA Conservative backbencher has accused the government of a series of \"unforced errors\".\nIt's understood the panel has not formally met senior government representatives since last year, although government sources say there has been communication with officials. \nEqualities Minister Liz Truss has now written to the remaining members thanking them for their \"constructive input\".\nIn the letter, seen by the BBC, Liz Truss said: \"I will also be shortly making an announcement concerning the International LGBT Conference and convening a new body that will take international LGBT rights forward.\" \nThe panel was set up as part of an LGBT Action Plan, established under Theresa May. It was to advise ministers \"on issues and policies concerning lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\"\nThree advisers quit last month over the government's handling of LGBT rights and amid claims it was \"dragging its feet\" on a pledge to ban so-called conversion therapy.\nThe first to resign, Jayne Ozanne, accused ministers of creating a \"hostile environment\" for LGBT people. \nShe said it was \"such a shame\" that Ms Truss was disbanding the advisory panel.\n\"It was a force for good, where the needs of LGBT people could be heard and understood. \n\"This does nothing to rebuild trust or reassure LGBT community of their grave concerns,\" she added in a Twitter message.\nConservative MP Crispin Blunt, who leads the all-party parliamentary group on Global LGBT+ rights, said government delays and inaction mean the prime minister is \"in breach of promise on causes he supports\".\n\"The government is led by one of the most socially liberal, live-and-let-live leaders in our history,\" he said, \"yet it is making a series of unforced errors that will serve to wholly unnecessarily alienate LGBT+ people and do untold damage to his reputation\".\nIf the prime minister wanted to establish the values of Global Britain on human rights then \"it is hardly the moment to dispose of your experts,\" he added. \nConversion therapy\nNancy Kelley, chief executive of campaign group Stonewall, who was one of the remaining panel members, said: \"Many key commitments from the UK LGBT Action Plan remain incomplete, including delivering an effective ban on conversion therapy, and the pandemic has only deepened the inequalities LGBTQ people experience, particularly in mental health.\"\nStonewall was \"keen to continue working with the government to progress LGBT+ rights\", she added, and she urged the government to ensure the new advisory panel included experts on \"both domestic and global LGBT+ policy\". \nIn her letter to the panel, Ms Truss said: \"I am pressing ahead with our commitment to ban conversion therapy in order to protect LGBT people from these abhorrent practices. I look forward to announcing these measures shortly.\"\nA government spokesman said: \"The LGBT Advisory Panel was created under the previous administration and the term of all panel members ended on 31 March. \n\"The Minister for Women & Equalities has written to panel members to thank them for their contributions, and plans for a replacement for the Panel will be set out in due course.\" "

      "text": "All over-50s and those in high-risk groups in the UK have now been offered a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, the government has announced. \nIt means ministers have met their target of offering a first dose to the top nine priority groups by 15 April. \nThe government said it was on track to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July, with those in their late 40s expected to be next in England. \nMore than 32 million people in the UK have had their first dose. \nAnd on Saturday a record 475,230 second doses were given out, with more than 7.6 million people now fully vaccinated.\nUnder-50s in Northern Ireland have already been asked to book appointments, and more people in the age group in other parts of the UK are now set to get their invitations.\nIt comes as England joins Wales and Scotland in giving out its first doses of the Moderna jab, the third Covid-19 vaccine to be administered in the UK.\nAll under-30s in the UK are to be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described hitting the vaccination target as \"another hugely significant milestone in our vaccine programme\". \n\"We will now move forward with completing essential second doses and making progress towards our target of offering all adults a vaccine by the end of July.\"\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"I'm delighted the team have done such an amazing job to hit yet another target early.\n\"The tide of this pandemic is turning in every part of the UK, as every day more and more people are being given the safety of a Covid-19 vaccine.\" \nGiven how quickly the vaccination programme has been rolled out in the UK, hitting the target of all priority groups by mid-April is not unexpected. \nAnd remember, there is no published data on the number of people offered jabs, as opposed to those who have actually been vaccinated. However, NHS England has made clear that across the nine groups, 95% have actually had their first doses - that is an average, with take-up rates varying in different groups.\nThe key question is: where next? Pending the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, ministers seem set to give the all-clear for invitations to go out to people in their late 40s.  \nBut what's not known is to what extent supplies of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will fill the gap caused this month by supply problems with the AstraZeneca doses. \nThe government is sticking to the line that the programme is on track to offer every adult a first dose by late July. \nBut officials qualify it by saying this is \"subject to supply\" - and that is a key variable.\nUrging those who are eligible to come forward for the jab, Mr Hancock added: \"Vaccines are safe and effective and have already saved more than 10,000 lives. \n\"The vaccine programme has had a significant impact on reducing the pressure on hospitals, helping us to gradually ease restrictions.\"\nOn reaching the milestone, Professor Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told BBC Breakfast: \"It's obviously great news, but we're only halfway up the hill.\n\"We mustn't take our eye off the task and we've got to keep working to get to the top.\"\nProf Finn said people over 50 who have not been invited for a first dose of the vaccine should make a \"gentle enquiry\" with their GP.\nSir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said it was an \"incredible achievement\" to have vaccinated 19 out of 20 people aged over-50 with a first dose.\nHe said the vaccination programme was \"without a doubt the most successful in our history\", adding: \"It's one of our tickets out of this pandemic and offers real hope for the future.\"\nThe announcement came on the day lockdown restrictions were further eased across the UK.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, representing NHS Trusts, urged people offered a vaccine to take it up, saying: \"As we return to pub gardens and sports activities and make our way back to non-essential shops, we must continue do all that we can to prevent the spread of infection and ensure this lockdown will be the last.\"\nThe top nine priority groups include all over-50s, over-16s with underlying health conditions, unpaid carers for the elderly and disabled and health and social care workers. It covers 99% of those at high risk of dying with Covid-19.\nThe vaccination roll-out will move on to focus on those aged 40-49.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments, is expected to publish its final advice on how the government should vaccinate under-50s, and the next phase of the programme is expected to begin this week.\nNHS organisations in the four nations, in collaboration with devolved administrations, will decide how to carry out the JCVI advice. \nOn Monday, the UK recorded 3,568 new coronavirus cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \nIt comes after pub gardens, non-essential shops and hairdressers reopened in England. \nNorthern Ireland's \"stay at home\" order also ended on Monday, while in Wales non-essential shops and close-contact services reopened. \nIn Scotland, non-essential shops and hospitality are not due to open until 26 April. \nMeanwhile, surge testing has been implemented in the Wandsworth and Lambeth areas of south London after a cluster of the South African Covid-19 variant was found. \nThe Department of Health and Social Care called it the \"largest surge testing operation to date\" following the identification of 44 confirmed and 30 probable cases."

Paradise says she was introduced to Paul via a mutual friend.\nOn one particular day that summer, she alleges Paul pulled her into the corner of his studio and started kissing her, which she said she \"was fine with... I did think he was cute\".  There were other people in the studio that day to record, she says.\nPaul then led her to his bedroom, according to Paradise, where they started dancing and kissing until \"he took it to his bed\", and put her hands in places she did not want.\nIn the video - titled Triggered: Jake Paul Sexually Assaulted Me - she says she attempted to move her hands away, to which Paul allegedly replied: \"If nothing's going to happen, what's the point?\"\nIn her video, Paradise said: \"Sex is very special and very important to me. Normally, everybody respects me when I don't want to do sexual things, so I thought that it was fine if I went in his room. I thought it would be fine to kiss him, because I thought he would stop if I didn't want to do anything else.\"\nHowever, Paul allegedly then forced her to perform oral sex while physically on top of her. \n\"He didn't ask for consent or anything,\" Paradise said. \"That's not okay. On no level at all is that okay.\"\nShe added Paul then acted cold towards her and did not speak to her again. She says he did not apologise and stopped responding to her text messages.\nParadise said she was sharing her story publicly in an attempt to make sure Paul \"realises what he did and doesn't do it again\".\nJake Paul has more than 20 million subscribers on YouTube. He is also a rapper and professional boxer.\nHe has attracted controversy on numerous occasions. Last summer, amid the coronavirus pandemic, he threw a party at his home in Los Angeles. \nEarlier in the year, he was charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly during unrest at a mall in Arizona.\nJustine Paradise has more than 10,000 YouTube subscribers but is considerably bigger on TikTok, where she has more than 520,000 followers.\nPaul has not responded to Paradise's video where she makes the allegations, which was posted on Friday.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Mr Johnson added that he was \"very confident\" about the UK's vaccine supplies.\nMr Hancock said the government was \"on track\" to offer a vaccine to everyone aged 18 or over by the end of July after meeting an earlier target for offering jabs to the most vulnerable.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Mr Hancock hailed the \"remarkable achievement\" of delivering more than 40 million vaccine doses and fully vaccinating 7.8 million people.\nThe health secretary also confirmed the rollout would descend through the age groups, based on advice from the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).\nThere are an estimated 3.7 million people in England aged 45 to 49.\nGiven how quickly the vaccination programme has been rolled out in the UK, hitting the target of all priority groups by mid-April is not unexpected. \nAnd remember, there is no published data on the number of people offered jabs, as opposed to those who have actually been vaccinated. However, NHS England has made clear that across the nine groups, 95% have actually had their first doses - that is an average, with take-up rates varying in different groups.\nOnline bookings for the next age group, those aged 45 and over, have opened in England. Text messages to 48 and 49-year-olds from local vaccination centres are set to go out soon. \nBut what's not known is to what extent supplies of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will fill the gap caused this month by supply problems with the AstraZeneca doses. \nThe government is sticking to the line that the programme is on track to offer every adult a first dose by late July. \nBut officials qualify it by saying this is \"subject to supply\" - and that is a key variable.\nProf Brown, a member of the JCVI, predicted there will be a \"mix-and-match\" for vaccines in the coming years.\nHe told the BBC: \"It's practically going to have to be that way because, once you've completed a course of, say, the Moderna or Pfizer or the AstraZeneca with two doses, in the future it's going to be quite difficult to guarantee you get the same type of vaccine again.\n\"So there will be a mix-and-match occurring just by the sort of practicalities of doing a third or fourth vaccination over the next few years.\"\nHe added that trials involving mixed vaccine combinations were ongoing.\nAnother member of the JCVI, Prof Adam Finn, welcomed the news that the UK had completed the first phase of its vaccination programme but added: \"We're only halfway up the hill.\"\nHe told the BBC: \"We mustn't take our eye off the task and we've got to keep working to get to the top.\"\nProf Finn said people over 50 who have not been invited for a first dose of the vaccine should make a \"gentle enquiry\" with their GP.\nSurge testing has been implemented in the Wandsworth and Lambeth areas of south London after a cluster of the South African Covid-19 variant was found. \nThe BBC has seen documents that show the outbreak appears to have been triggered by an individual who travelled from an African country in February that was not on the red list for mandatory quarantine, but is now.\nThe government has also announced that students in England will return to university \"no earlier than 17 May\", with an offer of supervised Covid tests."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden is set to announce that American troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September, officials have told US media.\nThe US would miss a May deadline for a pull-out agreed with the Taliban by the Trump administration last year.\nThe new deadline would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the US in 2001.\nMr Biden had previously said the 1 May deadline would be tough to meet.\nUS and Nato officials have said the Taliban, a hardline Islamist movement, have so far failed to live up to commitments to reduce violence.\nThe president is due to make the announcement himself on Wednesday.\nThe UK is now expected to withdraw 750 British soldiers stationed in Afghanistan by September, with Nato likely to pull its forces out collectively.\nGerman Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told ARD public television early on Wednesday: \"We always said: we'll go in together, we'll leave together. I am for an orderly withdrawal, and that is why I assume that we (Nato) will agree to that today.\" \nThe Taliban have been warned that if they attack US troops during the pull-out phase, they \"will be met with a forceful response\", a senior US official told reporters.\nMr Biden had decided a hasty withdrawal that would put US forces at risk was not a viable option, the official added.\nAt the same time, a review of US choices determined that now was the time to close the book on the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan to focus on more acute threats. \nThe Afghan government has not yet responded officially, but the speaker of the Afghan parliament, Mir Rahman Rahmani, warned that the withdrawal of foreign forces in the current circumstances would lead to civil war.\nBy Secunder Kermani, Afghanistan correspondent\nMany here will see this decision as a boost to the Taliban, despite it being a breach of the 1 May deadline the insurgents have insisted is adhered to. It seems unlikely they would now resume attacks on American forces given the short extension period; nevertheless, the Taliban reaction so far has been hostile. \nSome in the Afghan government had hoped the new Biden administration would adopt a more \"conditions-based\" approach to the peace process. Instead, that has been explicitly ruled out.\nThe slow pace of talks between Afghan and Taliban negotiators so far suggests it will be difficult to reach a power-sharing arrangement before US troops are withdrawn. Perhaps the Taliban's desire for international legitimacy will lead them to compromise. \nBut many fear the Taliban will be tempted to wait out the withdrawal, and then push for outright victory or at least dominance. The Afghan government has until now remained reliant on US air strikes to help hold the insurgents back. \nThe Taliban said on Tuesday that it will now not attend a summit on Afghanistan's future, due to be held in Turkey later this month, until all foreign forces leave the country.\n\"Until all foreign forces completely withdraw from our homeland, [we] will not participate in any conference that shall make decisions about Afghanistan,\" Mohammad Naeem, spokesman for the Taliban office in Qatar, tweeted. \nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin are expected to brief Nato allies on the decision in the Belgian capital, Brussels, on Wednesday.  \nThe United States has spent trillions of dollars and lost more than 2,000 service members since 2001 in what has been its longest war.\nThe deal signed in February last year said the US and its Nato allies would withdraw all troops in 14 months if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks.\nAs a condition of starting negotiations with the Afghan government, the Taliban also demanded the release of thousands of their men in a prisoner swap. \nDirect talks then began in Doha in September 2020, but a breakthrough has still not been reached.\nAlthough the group stopped attacks on international forces as part of the historic agreement, it has continued to fight the Afghan government.\nLast month, the Taliban threatened to resume hostilities against foreign troops still in the country on 1 May.\nThere are fears that if foreign military forces withdraw before a lasting agreement is reached, the Taliban might seize power. \nThe US has some 2,500 troops in the country as part of a 9,600-strong Nato mission.\nOctober 2001: US-led bombing of Afghanistan begins following the 11 September attacks on the United States \nFebruary 2009: Nato countries pledge to increase military and other commitments in Afghanistan after US announces dispatch of 17,000 extra troops\nDecember 2009: US President Barack Obama decides to boost US troop numbers in Afghanistan by 30,000, bringing total to 100,000. He says US will begin withdrawing its forces by 2011\nOctober 2014: The US and UK end their combat operations in Afghanistan\nMarch 2015: President Obama announces his country will delay its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, following a request from President Ashraf Ghani\nOctober 2015: President Obama announces that 9,800 US troops will remain in Afghanistan until the end of 2016, backtracking on an earlier pledge to pull all but 1,000 troops from the country\nJuly 2016: President Obama says 8,400 US troops will remain in Afghanistan into 2017 in light of the \"precarious security situation\". Nato also agrees to maintain troop numbers and reiterates a funding pledge for local security forces until 2020\nAugust 2017: US President Donald Trump says he's sending more troops to fight a resurgent Taliban\nSeptember 2019: Protracted peace talks between the Taliban and the US break down\nFebruary 2020: After months of on-off talks, the US signs a troop withdrawal agreement in Doha with the Taliban"

      "tags": "Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "A police officer was \"justified\" in pinning George Floyd to the ground before his death, says a use-of-force expert called by the defence team.\nBarry Brodd told the trial in Minnesota that Derek Chauvin - who denies murder - acted with \"objective reasonableness\" during the arrest last May.\nVideo of Mr Chauvin kneeling on the neck of Mr Floyd led to worldwide protests against racism and policing.\nTensions are running high over a recent police shooting of a black man.\nThat happened on Sunday in a Minnesota suburb only 10 miles (16 km) away from the court where Mr Chauvin's trial is taking place.\nOn Tuesday, the court heard testimony from witnesses called by Mr Chauvin's defence team.\nFormer police officer Mr Brodd told the court that \"the imminent threat\" posed by Floyd was a major factor in his detention.\n\"I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified and acting with objective reasonableness following Minneapolis police department policy and current standards of law enforcement in his interaction with George Floyd,\" he said.\n\"From a police officer's standpoint, you don't have to wait for it to happen. You just have to have a reasonable fear that somebody is going to strike you, stab you, shoot you.\"\nMr Brodd added: \"It's easy to sit in an office and judge an officer's conduct. It's more of a challenge to put yourself in the officer's shoes, to try to make an evaluation through what they are feeling, what they're sensing, the fear they have, and then make a determination.\"\nDefence lawyer Eric Nelson asked Mr Brodd: \"Was this a deadly use of force?\"\n\"No, it was not,\" Mr Brodd replied.\nHe said that the crowd surrounding George Floyd during his arrest \"posed an unknown threat\" and drew Mr Chauvin's attention away from Floyd.\nCross-examining Mr Brodd, the prosecution maintained that the dangers of positional asphyxia - not being able to breathe in a certain position - were well known. \n\"Would you agree that that's something commonly understood in law enforcement?\" prosecutor Steve Schleicher asked.\n\"Yes,\" Mr Brodd replied, confirming it was not new information.\nHis testimony was an attempt by the defence to rebut a number of medical experts called by the prosecution who said Chauvin used excessive, deadly force.\nThe trial also heard from Peter Chang, a Minneapolis Park Police officer who responded to the scene of Floyd's arrest. The court was shown footage from his bodycam.\nMr Chang told the court the crowd of bystanders around Floyd was \"very aggressive to the officers\". \n\"Did that cause you any concern?\" Mr Nelson asked him.\n\"Concern for the officers' safety, yes,\" Mr Chang replied.\nShawanda Hill, an acquaintance of George Floyd, was compelled by the defence to testify on Tuesday.\nShe was sitting in the back seat of the car when Floyd was approached by store employees who confronted him over an alleged counterfeit $20 bill.\nShe said Floyd had earlier been \"happy, normal, talking, alert\".\nShe said that he had offered to give her a ride, and that she received a phone call while sitting in the car with Floyd.\nWhile she was on the phone, she said Floyd suddenly fell asleep just before the employees came out to confront him.\nShe said she woke him again as the police arrived.\nShe said that as soon as Floyd woke up, the first thing he saw was an officer's gun. Ms Hill said that he immediately grew distressed and started pleading with the officers not to kill him.\n\"Did he seem startled when the officer pulled a gun on him?\" the prosecutor asks.\n\"Very,\" she said.\nLast week the court heard from several expert witnesses who testified that Mr Chauvin's use of force was excessive.\nThey were also steadfast in their belief that Mr Floyd died from being subdued and not from drug use or ill health.\nThe police chief who fired the officer after seeing the video of him kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck told the court his actions went against all police training.\nThere were also eyewitnesses who described their concerns for Mr Floyd as they watched the arrest taking place.\nWhat questions do you have about the Derek Chauvin trial?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "England is giving out its first doses of the Moderna jab, the third Covid-19 vaccine in the nation's rollout.\nIt will be available at 21 sites, included the Madejski Stadium in Reading and the Sheffield Arena.\nAlong with the Pfizer jab, it offers an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for under-30s, after concerns about a possible link to very rare blood clots.\nWales and Scotland began using the Moderna vaccine last week.\nEmily Sanderson, a 28-year-old solicitor with an underlying health condition, said she felt \"brilliant\" after receiving her Moderna jab at Sheffield Arena.\nShe was due to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine but it was switched to Moderna, which she said made her really pleased \"because it gives people in my situation an alternative\".\nAs of Monday, 32,250,481 first doses of a Covid vaccine had been given in the UK, as well as 7,857,396 second jabs, the latest government data shows.\nProf Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, said having \"a third jab in our armoury\" marked another \"milestone\" in the vaccine programme.\nHe said more sites would offer the Moderna vaccine as further supplies arrive.\nAnd he urged people to come forward for vaccination when they are invited, saying the vaccines were \"our hope at the end of a year like no other\".\nThe first person to receive the Moderna vaccine in the UK was 24-year-old unpaid carer Elle Taylor from Carmarthenshire in Wales.\nShe said she was \"very excited and happy\" that being vaccinated meant she could care for her grandmother \"properly and safely\".\nThe Moderna vaccine uses a similar innovative RNA technology to the Pfizer jab, but it is stored at temperatures of -20C, like a normal freezer, compared to -70C for the Pfizer vaccine. It can also be stored for 30 days at normal fridge temperatures.\nThe NHS said the Moderna and Pfizer jabs would be used for under-30s who were due to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine but whose appointments were rearranged.\nLast week, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which advises the UK government on vaccines - recommended that under-30s be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine, out of the \"utmost caution\" following reports of blood clots in about four in one million cases.\nThe NHS said the majority of appointments in April were for second doses, but first dose appointments were still available for people in the initial priority groups who have not yet been immunised - including the over-50s, people who are clinically vulnerable or those working in health or social care.\nMeanwhile, the Department of Health has begun its \"largest surge testing operation to date\" in an effort to bring under control a \"significant\" cluster of cases of the South African coronavirus variant in south London.\nThe Moderna vaccine is a two-dose jab given at an interval of between four and 12 weeks.\nLike Pfizer's, it is an RNA vaccine and works by injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body, where it enters cells and tells them to create antigens.\nThese antigens are recognised by the immune system and prepare it to fight coronavirus.\nNo actual virus is needed to create an mRNA vaccine, meaning the rate at which it can be produced is accelerated.\nIt also only requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer.\nTrial results suggested efficacy against the disease was 94.1%, and vaccine efficacy against severe Covid-19 was 100%.\nMore than 30,000 people in the US took part in the trial, from a wide range of age groups and ethnic backgrounds.\nThe government has bought 17 million doses - enough to vaccinate about 8.5 million people.\nScotland is due to receive more than one million of the UK's order, and the doses will arrive over a period of months.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon cautioned that the supply does not mean the vaccine programme would be accelerated.\nModerna said the vaccine was generally well-tolerated, with no serious safety concerns identified.\nEvents after the first dose included injection-site pain, and after the second dose fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, other pain and redness at the injection site.\nBut these were generally short-lived."

He is also on trial.\nOne of the group is still at large and is being tried in absentia.\nThe men in Gruppe S intended to \"shake and ultimately topple the state and social order\" in Germany, the indictment says.\nWerner S, the group's alleged ringleader, organised an meeting with seven other founding members at a barbecue area in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in September 2019. \nOver the next few months others joined, keeping in touch by phone and internet chat.\nAccording to investigation files seen by German public broadcaster ZDF and the Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspaper, Werner S planned to acquire a Kalashnikov assault rifle with 2,000 rounds of ammunition, an Uzi submachine gun and hand grenades. The group already had 27 unlicensed weapons, mostly pistols, it is alleged.\n\"If the accused had been able to carry out their planned acts of terror, we would have had a totally brutal and massive killing machine running here,\" said Ralf Michelfelder, chief criminal investigator for the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, ahead of the trial.\nGerman media report that the authorities were alerted to the group's activities in autumn 2019 by an informant, who is now the chief witness, under close police protection. In February 2020 police arrested 13 men from five German states. One later died in pre-trial detention.\nMost of the group's members also belonged to other far-right groups, including the Bruderschaft Deutschland (German Brotherhood), German broadcaster ARD reports.\nThorsten W, who is accused of supporting the group, worked for the police in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and allegedly offered \u20ac5,000 ($6,000; \u00a34,300) to buy weapons for the attacks."

      "text": "The resignations of a police chief and of an officer who shot dead a black motorist in Minnesota have failed to end unrest over Sunday's killing.\nChief Tim Gannon and Officer Kim Potter have quit the Brooklyn Center force. \nMrs Potter said she shot Daunte Wright accidentally, having mistakenly drawn her gun instead of her Taser, a stance backed by Mr Gannon.\nDespite the resignations fresh clashes between police and protesters erupted for a third night.\nMr Wright's mother has been speaking about her last phone call to her son. In tears, she told reporters she could never have imagined he would be killed.\nThe death happened in a suburb of Minneapolis, a city already on edge amid the trial of a white ex-police officer accused of murdering African American George Floyd.\nOn Tuesday night bottles and other projectiles were thrown at the Brooklyn Center police headquarters and officers responded by firing tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets. \nMore than 60 people were arrested, Minnesota State Patrol Colonel Matt Langer told reporters.\nAnother demonstration broke out in Portland, Oregon, on Tuesday night, with about 100 protesters marching on the Portland Police Association Building. \nFlames were seen coming out of the side of the police building about an hour later. The Portland Police Bureau declared the gathering a riot.\nPortland was the centre of mass demonstrations last year, in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.\nSpeaking to reporters earlier, Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott said he had appointed 19-year veteran Tony Gruenig to take over for Tim Gannon.\nOn Monday, Mr Gannon had said the shooting of Mr Wright appeared to be an \"accidental discharge\" after Mrs Potter mistook her service pistol for a stun gun.\n\"I appreciate the officer stepping down,\" the mayor said, adding that he hoped her leaving would \"bring some calm to the community\".\nHe said the city had intended to fire Mrs Potter. \"We want to send a message to the community that we are taking this situation seriously,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, prosecutors are expected to decide whether to charge Mrs Potter on Wednesday, the Associated Press news agency reported.\n\"We have to make sure that justice is served... Daunte Wright deserves that. His family deserves that,\" Mr Elliott said.\nThe Wright family have spoken of their ordeal on the night Daunte was killed, holding a news conference near the courthouse where police officer Derek Chauvin is standing trial for George Floyd's murder.\nIn an emotional speech, his mother Katie described what she said was the worst day of her life.\nShe said her son called her after he was pulled over, and that she offered to give insurance details to police over the phone. \nShe said she heard police order him to get out of the vehicle. There was a scuffling sound and an officer told him to hang up the phone.\nWhen she was eventually able to call back, his girlfriend answered and told her he had been shot.\n\"She pointed the phone toward the driver's seat and my son was laying there, unresponsive,\" she said in tears.\n\"That was the last time that I've seen my son.\"\nThe family were joined by relatives of George Floyd and by Ben Crump, a lawyer who is representing both families. \nMr Wright's aunt Naisha angrily dismissed Mrs Potter's explanation of the killing.\n\"Every pistol, every Taser has a safety on it,\" she said. \n\"I watched that video like everybody else watched that video. That woman held that gun in front of her a long damn time.\"\nAt the scene - BBC's Tara McKelvey\nUpon hearing the news that the police officer who shot Daunte Wright had resigned, along with the police chief, Amber Young, a food services co-ordinator at a Salvation Army in Minneapolis, said she had two reactions.  \nShe was glad but felt the announcements should have come sooner. \nStanding outside the Brooklyn Center police department, she described how upset she had been with the actions of the police. \n\"She should have been fired,\" said Ms Young, referring to the police officer. \"Her resignation should not have come before [that].\" \nWhen it comes to the police chief, she said simply: \"I'm glad he's gone. He showed no concern for the community.\" \nMr Wright was pulled over for an expired tag on his car licence plate. Family members and advocates say he was racially profiled.\nPolice released body camera footage on Monday showing Mr Wright fleeing from officers after they told him he was being arrested for an outstanding warrant.\nAs Mr Wright re-enters his car, Officer Potter is heard shouting \"Taser\" several times before firing a shot.\nIn a one-sentence resignation letter to city officials. Mrs Potter wrote that she \"loved every minute of being a police officer... but I believe it is in the best interest of the community, the department, and my fellow officers if I resign immediately\"."

      "tags": "Economics,GDP,Economic growth,UK economy,Brexit,Office for National Statistics,Trade",
      "text": "Trade between the UK and EU partially recovered in February, after a steep drop in January following Brexit. \nOfficial figures show exports to the EU jumped by 46.6%, \u00a33.7bn, to \u00a311.6bn, following January's 42% slump when firms struggled with new trade rules. \nHowever, the Office for National Statistics said exports were still below last year's levels and imports from the EU had seen a weaker recovery.\nOther figures from the ONS showed the UK economy grew by 0.4% in February.\nThe UK's statistics body said the economy was still 7.8% smaller than a year earlier, before the impact of the pandemic.\nLast month's trade figures were the first since new trading rules came into force as a result of Brexit trade rule changes.\nBoth the ONS and business analysts said the drop in trade flows was partly caused by stockpiling in December 2020, as businesses tried to get ahead of the introduction of the new rules, depressing trade in January.\nIn addition, the end of the temporary trading arrangement between the UK and the EU coincided with the discovery of a new strain of Covid-19 in the UK, which caused further complications and delays, after lorry drivers were required to take tests before crossing the border at the English Channel.\nAn ONS spokesperson said: \"Exports to the EU recovered significantly from their January fall, though still remain below 2020 levels. However, imports from the EU are yet to significantly rebound, with a number of issues hampering trade.\" \nThe Federation of Small Businesses said overall sales had dropped by \u00a32.5bn and its members needed more help.\nChairman Mike Cherry said: \"UK exports have tumbled since the end of the [Brexit] transition period. \n\"International sales are way down on where they were at this time last year. A fifth of small exporters have halted sales to the EU temporarily and some have already given up on selling into the bloc on a permanent basis.\"\nBut a government spokesperson said the statistics showed \"welcome growth\" in the value of trade with the EU in February. \n\"This is in line with our predictions last month as we saw increasing volumes of freight traffic to and from the EU.\n\"The vast majority of traders and hauliers have adapted well, and our focus now is on making sure that any business that is still facing challenges gets the support they need to trade effectively with the EU.\"\nUK imports from the EU rose by 7.3%, or \u00a31.2bn in February to \u00a317.1bn, after dropping 29.7% the month before.\nThe ONS said the export increases were driven by machinery, transport equipment and chemicals.\nThe ONS said it was too early to make any conclusions about the impact of the new trading arrangements with Europe.\nTotal imports of goods from non-EU countries rose by 10.2% to \u00a317.9bn in February, while exports fell by 10.5% to \u00a312.7bn.\nMark Callaghan is the chief executive of British Corner Shop, an exporter of British food and drink brands.\nHe says his firm \"battled\" to find a solution to continue to export its products, particularly on the consumer channel into the EU. \nBritish Corner Shop had to cut its product range down from 10,000 to 1,400, and is planning to open its own distribution centre in the EU.\nThis means the loss of 40 jobs in the UK, and the new centre will see 60 new jobs in the EU. \n\"We were jumping with joy when Boris announced in late December that there was a deal with the EU and it would be trade as normal, so we were very excited about that,\" he told the BBC.\n\"[It would mean] minimal disruption for the business, but that hasn't been the case.\n\"We've seen huge disruption, we've seen a massive drop in sales, we've had to reduce our workforce by 40 people and we're moving those jobs into the EU, so I wouldn't say that it's been successful at all.\"\nAfter a 42% plunge in January in sales to the EU, February's bounce back of 46.6% is more the kind of figure the government would like associated with Global Britain's new trading era. \nBut just as the earlier figures weren't conclusive evidence that the new arrangements for trading with Europe posed a widespread sustained problem, the latest ones don't mean it's back to business as usual either. \nMany companies avoided sending goods across the border in the previous month, for fear of disruption or delay, having shipped orders ahead of time where they could. Both January's fall and February's rebound were led by non-perishable items - chemicals, machinery - which are easily stockpiled . That trade resumed in February, while many other exporters managed to get to grips with the new formalities. \nBut export levels remain below where they were for much of 2020, and anecdotal evidence suggests some exporters - particularly those of fresh foods - remain overwhelmed by the new checks and forms. They are urging the government to help simplify processes. Meanwhile the pandemic continues to weigh on demand. \nWith the EU typically buying more than two-fifths of British exports, tackling remaining issues will be instrumental to getting the economy back on its feet. \nCovid restrictions remained in place to varying degrees across all four nations of the UK during January and February. \n\"The economy showed some improvement in February after the large falls seen at the start of the year but remains around 8% below its pre-pandemic level,\" an ONS spokesperson said.\nSarah Hewin, from Standard Chartered Bank, told the BBC's Today programme the outlook for the UK economy was improving.\n\"Confidence does seem to be picking up as vaccinations are spreading. We know households have built up their savings in many cases during lockdown. As lockdown restrictions are eased people are going to be able to go out and spend those savings and that will be a big boost to the economy.\n\"As we saw from the scenes yesterday people are keen to get out and spend when they can. There will be more opportunities for travelling and going on holiday and spending in restaurants and pubs will see people spending to go out and enjoy themselves.\"\nThe latest ONS data also indicated that the economy did not shrink by as much as initially estimated in January. The statistics body said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 2.2% in January, an upward revision from its original estimate of a 2.9% drop.\n\"A slightly improved January data could mark the final contraction in the current crisis, with the economy beginning to gather strength even before the end of the lockdown,\" said Yael\u202fSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK.\nRory Macqueen, principal economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: \"Clearly much of the economy has adapted to cope with Covid-19 restrictions... if the vaccine programme and lifting of restrictions continue on schedule this provides a firm basis for continuing growth in the second quarter and 2021 overall.\""

      "text": "Reopening pubs too soon could run the risk of \"undoing all the good\" during lockdown, an infectious disease expert has said.\nBeer gardens reopened in England on Monday, but in Wales industry experts have expressed frustration they cannot open until 26 April.\nDr Mike Tildesley said it was important lockdown was eased gradually to stop a spike in coronavirus cases.\nThe Welsh government said it was taking \"a careful step-by-step approach\".\nDr Tildesley, who is part of a modelling group which advises the UK government on the pandemic, said he understood people were \"frustrated\" at the different timetables out of lockdown.\nHowever, he said a cautious approach was needed for the next few weeks to prevent a third wave, in the hope \"we can get back to normal by summer\".\n\"We need to remember that these are paced at a rate that the vaccinations can keep up with us and can help us along the way,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\nMore than half the people in Wales have now had their first Covid-19 vaccination dose, and Covid admissions to hospitals in Wales have hit record low levels.\nDr Tildesley said while things were moving in the right direction, scientists needed to monitor the impact of relaxing other restrictions on case rates, before reopening other parts of life.\nOn Monday shoppers queued as non-essential shops reopened in Wales for the first time since they were forced to close in the run-up to Christmas.\n\"The key thing is we need to take it at a gradual rate so we can ensure that we can reopen safely... we are doing well, but if we go too fast we run the risk of too much mixing, and undoing all the good we have done so far,\" he said.\nWhile he said cases could go up as people began mixing again and going back to their daily lives, the progress of the vaccine should help avoid a \"significant resurgence\".\nDr Tildesley urged people to be cautious for a few more weeks, adding the biggest concern was that if there was a spoke in cases the virus could mutate.\n\"We are not quite out of the woods yet, in the not too distant future we will be in a position where we can meet people... and hug our friends and family again, but we are not there yet,\" he said.\nOne landlord, whose pub is on the border said it was \"frustrating\" remaining closed until 26 April when outdoor hospitality opened on Monday in England.\nJohn Turner said two other pubs in his village - that are technically in England - had now reopened.\nBut Mr Turner, who runs the Dolphin Inn, in Llanymynech, on the Powys-Shropshire border, said Wales was \"always two weeks behind England\" and he was anxious to open again.\nOn Monday, the border reopened between Wales and England and people are now allowed to travel in both directions.\nOnce in England, you can visit a pub or cafe garden with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households.\nHowever, some people have agreed with Dr Tildesley's view and expressed relief pubs remain closed in Wales.\nGarfield Doc Oakleeffe posted on Facebook: \"After seeing the footage of the lack of social distancing when drinking in Soho, I think slow and cautious is better.\"\nSian Louise said: \"I know it's horrible to not be open and I feel for businesses, I really do as I was getting annoyed with it all, but by looking how this last lockdown went and how it started I actually understand why [Mark Drakeford is] doing it slowly, because we don't want another lockdown and we don't want anymore people getting seriously ill either. \n\"Hopefully, in time we will come out better and safer by doing it gradually.\"\nMichelle Murphy commented: \"I am so glad they are still closed. If this is what it is going to be like, no wonder they predict a third wave.\"\nKerry Lea Edwards did not understand the \"urgency to be back in the pub\", adding: \"If it's the social side you can meet outdoors in your garden with your friends and have a drink.\n\"Surely it's not worth the risk - we will be in another lockdown before we know it, very sad.\"\nMr Turner said: \"The firebreak [lockdown] was going to be the saviour for Christmas and then I didn't even imagine we would miss out on Easter as well.\n\"An extra two weeks' trade will be lost once again to England.\" \nHe added that even when pubs in Wales can reopen, it could be a struggle only being able to serve outside because of \"the weather element\".\nWhile he has used some of his government support to put up a marquee, and purchase heaters and furniture, he said other pubs might not be able to keep up.\nHe said he was anxious to make the money back to make the new equipment worthwhile. \n\"People are desperate to get to the pub. I am hopeful we will be full and I'm looking forward to being busy again because otherwise it will be harder and more disappointing,\" he said.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association (WBPA), said pubs across Wales were \"hugely disappointed\" to not open on Monday alongside England.\nShe said pubs in Wales having to wait another two weeks while pubs in England were trading outdoors was \"a bitter pill to swallow\". \nMs McClarkin said: \"Vaccination rates continue to climb while case rates are falling week on week. Even when they will be allowed to open, we still think about 60% of pubs in Wales will be unable to because of a lack of usable outside space.\n\"The Welsh government need to recognise that and bring forward a package of funding as soon as possible that will prevent hundreds of Welsh pubs being lost for good.\"\nThe Welsh government said it had provided more than \u00a32bn of funding to support businesses impacted by the pandemic, safeguarding 165,000 Welsh jobs. \nA spokesperson said tourism and hospitality businesses would continue to receive cash grants this month to help them through until the reopening date in May. \n\"Businesses will therefore see no interruption in the flow of financial support, as we move cautiously to relax public health restrictions,\" they said.\n\"Another \u00a3200m in additional support for business has already been earmarked in the Final Budget 2021-22. \n\"Ministers have had a constructive meeting with representatives from the hospitality sector and Welsh government officials will work with them on options for a further support package to be put to the new government following May's Senedd election.\"\nA Plaid Cymru spokesperson said many would question the decision not to move forward the reopening of beer gardens after scenes like those seen in Cardiff Bay, where crowds gathered to drink over the bank holiday weekend.\n\"A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"Likewise, the lack of clear date on indoor hospitality remains a major problem and at the very least the government should urgently revisit its decision to delay any additional financial support until after election.\"\nLeader of the Welsh Conservative group Andrew RT Davies, said the Welsh government's decision was about politics not science, and lost trade meant \"lost livelihoods in Wales\".\n\"After a crippling 12 months for businesses, Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay seem to have a tin ear to these concerns. Welsh Conservatives would cut the border games, end the confusion, and get Wales on the road to recovery with a safe, consistent and one-nation approach,\" he said.\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said: \"Lockdown is frustrating but we all need to stay safe and follow the regulations. \n\"If we do, we will not need to enter a lockdown again and that is the the most important thing. We've seen before what happened when lockdowns were eased too quickly.\" "

Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot (about 82%) have reached the fewest.\nAround 77% of people in their early 50s had also been given the booster and 81% of those in their late 50s.\nFor care home residents, the range is from just over 82% in Pembrokeshire to 96.6% of those on Anglesey having a booster.\nWales is slightly behind Scotland with the proportions of their populations given a first jab - 79.1%.\nBy 27 January, 2.5m people in Wales had been given their first dose. \nA total of 2,361,042 people have received a second jab, or 74.5% of the total population. \nMore than 64% of 16 and 17-year-olds have now received a second dose.\nWales (74.9%) and Scotland (75.3%) are close together on the proportions of second vaccinations.\nBy 27 January, England was on 71.6% and Northern Ireland trailing a little on 69.1%.\nFor the proportion of its population with booster doses, Wales is ranked fifth in the world, compared with other nations with a population above 1 million.\nWhen we look at figures within Wales, we can see Powys reached nearly 81% of its total population with two doses and 67.9% with boosters. \nSwansea Bay has reached the fewest proportion for vaccines, for all three doses (54.2%).\nNearly 62% of the youngest age group offered vaccines have taken a first dose in Wales by Wednesday.\nBut there is a big variation between counties. This ranged up to last Sunday from 74.1% in Monmouthshire and 70% in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) to less than half of 12 to 15-year-olds in Neath Port Talbot taking up the offer.\nRCT and Merthyr Tydfil have so far reached nearly half of this age group with second doses too."

He became a director of the firm in late 2016.\nA letter from Mr Crothers to Lord Pickles, a former Conservative Party chairman, written earlier this week, has also been published.\nIn it, he says: \"I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital.\n\"I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so.\"\nHe adds: \"I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time.\"\nThe shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said: \"This is an extraordinary and shocking revelation.\n\"The Conservatives have weakened the rules so much they may as well rip them up and start again.\"\nThe government inquiry in to lobbying is expected to report  by the end of June, but Labour says it does not go far enough.\nIt will use an opposition day debate on Wednesday to force a vote on whether to establish a new Commons select committee to investigate the issue.  \nUnlike regular opposition day votes which are symbolic, this one would be binding if it passes because Parliament would be deciding if it should do something. \nA Cabinet Office spokesperson said there would be a response to Mr Pickles's letter \"in due course\".\nThey added that the \"review into Greensill Capital and supply-chain finance\" would be \"wide-ranging\".\nMr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying and that he welcomes the investigation launched by Mr Johnson."

      "text": "\"Exciting\", \"slightly scary\" and \"an absolute riot\" were some of the verdicts from drinkers enjoying their first night out in months as England reopened outdoor hospitality.\nIn London's Soho, locals welcomed seeing the West End \"buzzing again\" with life.\nThe streets were packed, with roads closed to give more space for al fresco drinking and dining.\nIn Newcastle, people said it was \"worth it\" to brave freezing pub terraces.\nOutdoor drinking and dining resumed on Monday for the first time since England's lockdown began on 5 January - although for millions of people who lived under tier 4 restrictions in December, the wait had been even longer.\nShops, hairdressers, gyms and zoos were among the other businesses reopening in England, while Northern Ireland's \"stay-at-home\" order was lifted and some rules were eased in Scotland and Wales.\nDespite flurries of snow in parts of the country, people flocked to pubs and restaurants to celebrate the return of some of their freedoms.\n\"It's full everywhere, It feels like a celebration, basically,\" one drinker told the BBC. \n\"Honestly it feels so good, it feels like we're out of prison. We're celebrating a birthday, so it's the best gift, I guess,\" said another.\nA woman, who has lived in Soho for 15 years, said it was \"amazing, it's lovely just to see people out, to have life around us, I've missed it so much\".\n\"Just to see it buzzing again is beautiful and to see all the local businesses come alive again, it's great,\" she said.\nAttila Kulcsar, a media communications manager, said the atmosphere was \"like a return to the 'real' Soho of the 1990s\" - or alternatively \"like how I imagine VE Day\", referring to the scenes of jubilation at the end of World War Two.\n\"There is a wonderfully raucous hysteria everywhere. It's very celebratory. There is very little social distancing. A distinct sense that people feel the Covid restrictions have ended,\" he said.\nPolice and Covid marshalls were present, he said, but they were not intervening to try to enforce social distancing.\nWestminster Council said it was aware of \"isolated incidents of crowding\" but said it had been working with businesses to help them operate safely, including having Covid marshalls offering support with social distancing.\nSome described a few anxious moments at the prospect of crowded places for the first time in months. \"But as soon as you sit down to have a beer, it's an absolute riot,\" said one man. \"It's quite overwhelming, but in a good way,\" added his companion.\nMany people said they welcomed the crowds and were not concerned about the risk of Covid spreading. Some said they had already been vaccinated, while one group said they had taken rapid lateral flow tests beforehand as a precaution and that being outside reduced the risk of infection.\nProfessor Adam Finn, a paediatrician on the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation, said people should continue to practise social distancing despite the success of the vaccine programme.\nAsked on BBC Breakfast whether he would go to a beer garden in the current circumstances, he said: \"If I did, I would certainly avoid close contact with other people.\n\"The risks of transmission outside are relatively low, but not if you start coming into very close contact with people. It's not like it's all over, we can all go back to normal.\"\nEarlier on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had urged people to \"continue to behave responsibly\" as the restrictions were eased.\nProf Lawrence Young, a virologist and medical oncologist, said the drop in infections in the UK was not only due to the progress in vaccinations, but also because of lockdown restrictions. \nThat meant it was important to remain cautious, even on a \"joyous day\" like this, he said.\n\"We can't ignore what's going on in the rest of the world - every other day new variants are being reported and infection is rife,\" he said.\nIn Newcastle-upon-Tyne, some revellers shrugged off the \"Arctic\" temperatures. \"To be honest, it's quite nice, it's quite cosy,\" said one man sitting in a sheltered terrace. \"We're from the north so we're used to it.\"\nA group of women said they had layered up to brave the elements. \"It was really snowing earlier. But I think it's worth it,\" one said.\nRobby Scott, managing director of Babucho, an Italian restaurant and bar, said: \"It just sums up 2020 and 2021 that we finally get to open our doors for outdoor dining and we get an Arctic storm. But I don't think people would care at the moment.\"\nBut some business owners warned that they cannot survive on the takings from outdoor hospitality alone.\nJeremy Joseph, owner of G-A-Y in Soho, said the reopening was \"bittersweet\" as even with the streets crowded, they could only operate at just over 10% of their usual indoor capacity.\n\"It's not making money, all we are doing is reducing our losses,\" he told the BBC.\nHe said the nightclub had lost about \u00a31.3m in the pandemic and bills were \"continually coming in\".\n\"Outside hospitality is not going to cover it,\" he said, adding that the recovery would begin for him on 17 May, when indoor hospitality is expected to resume.\nDid you go to a pub or restaurant last night?

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "The Troubles,Northern Ireland Assembly",
      "text": "Stormont's Executive Office has formally pledged to pay for a Troubles pension scheme, a court has been told.\nThe Department of Finance will make the necessary funding available to ensure eligible victims and survivors receive compensation.\nThe move was expected after agreement was reached earlier this month on this coming year's budget.\nThe estimated outlay for the scheme, over the next 20 years, could be up to \u00a31.2bn.\nBelfast High Court had been hearing a case brought by Brian Turley, one of those known as the Hooded Men, who were detained and subjected to special interrogation methods by the British military in the early 1970s.\nHe brought the case seeking a judgement to ensure a financial package was put in place.\nIn correspondence to the High Court, the Department of Finance has guaranteed payments will be made.\nA letter sent on behalf of the Executive Office stated that \"the payment is an entitlement as indicated by the court, and regardless of whether it comes from Westminster or from our block grant, it will be paid when it is due\". \nIt added that First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Finance Minister Conor Murphy \"undertake on behalf of their respective departments that payments will be made to successful applicants\".\nWhen the Department of Justice requests funding, the Executive Office is to be provided with the required money by the Department of Finance \"without delay\".\n\"The Executive Office will then, on receipt of such funding, make the necessary grants to the Department of Justice in response to its requests for funding,\" the letter stated.\nDiscussions between Stormont and the Northern Ireland Office are continuing over whether there will be any additional funding from London to help foot costs.\nThe letter added: \"Ministers will continue to progress financial discussions with the Northern Ireland Office on the basis that it remains their shared view that the scheme should be funded by the Westminster government as an addition to the block grant, and in a manner consistent with the Statement of Funding Policy.\"\nLord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan agreed that a \"satisfactory\" undertaking had been received by the court.\nFormer NI secretary Julian Smith described the move as \"very good news\" and said the executive \"ultimately took the right decision\".\nThe court undertaking provides certainty to the thousands who will apply for a pension.\nThere was inevitability about what has just happened because earlier this year the court ruled that Stormont was liable for the scheme,\nPolitical agreement of the 2021-22 Stormont budget also paved the way for Monday's undertaking.\nBut it does not settle a behind-the-scenes dispute between Belfast and London.\nSome NI ministers have questioned the pension's affordability without extra cash coming from the British government.\nNegotiations continue over Stormont's request for additional cash outside the block grant to help foot the bill.\nThousands of people who were physically or mentally injured on a permanent basis will apply for sums of up to \u00a310,000 a year.\nThe Troubles claimed more than 3,500 lives and the Northern Ireland Office has estimated another 40,000 people were injured.\nThe pensions scheme was drawn up in 2019 by the UK government, when the Stormont assembly was not functioning.\nThe scheme aims to provide pension-like payments to victims of the Troubles, every year for the rest of their lives, with payments ranging from \u00a32,000 to \u00a310,000.\nUpon their death, a spouse or carer will get the payments for a further 10 years.\nVictims will be eligible to apply if they were injured in an incident at any point between 1 January 1966 and 12 April 2010, the date that responsibility for policing and justice was devolved to Stormont.\nThat can be physical injury, such as a loss of limbs, or psychological, caused by being present at a bombing, for example.\nThe scheme will also be open to those injured in incidents that took place outside Northern Ireland.\nThe pensions will be backdated to 2014 - the date when they were first agreed, in principle, by the Stormont parties under the Fresh Start Agreement.\nOlder victims, over the age of 60, may opt to receive a lump sum rather than annual payments.\nA judge-led board will decide who qualifies for the scheme, with the government insisting it would only apply to people who were injured \"through no fault of their own\".\nAlan McBride of the Wave Trauma Centre, whose wife Sharon was killed in the 1993 IRA Shankill bomb, said the campaign for the pension started 13 years ago. \n\"The uncertainty that surrounded this pension was increasing the trauma for people that have been campaigning for this,\" he said.\n\"We've lost about four or five members in that time through ill health and old age, so to have this over the line is a really, really good news story.\"\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said it was a \"very welcome day\" for those set to benefit from the pension, adding that \"the uncertainty for victims is now over\".\n\"It has been a deeply frustrating journey towards this point, but I welcome that we have finally achieved agreement to confirm that the pension will be paid when it falls due to recipients,\" she said. \nUlster Unionist Doug Beattie said the negotiations for extra cash may continue but \"injured victims should not be punished any longer\".  \n\"The executive must move immediately to provide certainty around application and payment dates, as well as how those who have waited longest might be prioritised within the scheme,\" he said. \nSDLP MLA Dolores Kelly welcomed the news but said that there would be many victims and survivors who \"will be wary of accepting the words of politicians\".\n\"People who have suffered severe physical and mental injury over the course of conflict here have waited for far too long for recognition and redress,\" she said, adding that the first and deputy first ministers must now set out what will happen next."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "The impact the Duke of Edinburgh's Award has had on thousands of people will be his everlasting legacy, Wales rugby captain Alun Wyn Jones has said.\nThe youth achievement award was established by Prince Philip in 1956.\nJones, a gold award holder and ambassador, said it taught him skills he had used in his rugby career. \n\"Whether it be life skills, independence, self-awareness - I've probably utilised those to some extent,\" he said. \n\"There's a lot of people I'm sure who'll have a lot of gratitude to be involved in the award,\" he added.  \nThe programme aims to inspire and transform the lives of young people aged 14 to 24 through volunteering, physical activities and expeditions and operates in more than 140 countries.\nIt is based on the principles and philosophy of the UK's first Outward Bound centre, which was established in Aberdyfi, Gwynedd, in 1941.\nThe centre's pioneer was the duke's mentor German educationalist Kurt Hahn, who had also set up boarding school Gordonstoun, where the duke was educated.\nIan Gwilym is senior relationships manager at the DofE and also ran a DofE group at his local rugby club Ystradgynlais RFC in the Swansea Valley. \nHe said: \"I've been fortunate to meet the Duke of Edinburgh on many occasions but more importantly thousands of young Welsh people have as well. \n\"The way he dealt with young people - with genuine interest, he had a certain grit. He related to young people\u2026 he had a genuine interest in finding out what they did for their DofE.\n\"There was always a little joke if young people had not done a foot expedition but done a canoe venture [instead] there was always a very humorous joke about canoeing being easier - 'sitting down and the river taking them through the miles of the countryside' - that does stick in my mind.\"\nMr Gwilym said he had witnessed young people being transformed after taking part in the programme: \"It's a really powerful programme. The key ingredient is seeing young people grow in confidence. \n\"For certain individuals you will see them entering the DofE world as a shy person that struggles to converse, that has low self esteem... they have to become a team member and they have to communicate because when you're on an expedition in a strange mountain environment or a coastal path, if you shrink in that environment then it's not such an enjoyable experience.\" \nShuhani Shohid, from Newport, said the award instilled her with confidence and led her to a career as a primary school teacher.\n\"I was quite a shy individual who lacked a lot of confidence,\" she said.\n\"After attending the sessions for the bronze award and completing the expedition I was amazed how much I'd learnt about myself. \n\"I threw myself into so many activities I would never have done and being an ethnic minority in the community - a British Bangladeshi Muslim - doing these things is completely out of the norm.\"\nShe went on to complete her silver and gold awards and eventually became an ambassador.\n\"Once I became an ambassador and I saw the impact I can have on young people,\" she said.\n\"The Duke of Edinburgh has been a huge part of my journey in deciding my career.\" \nGeorgia Williams, from Flintshire, said she credited the award with getting her a university place.\n\"I didn't get my grades for university but in fact the experience I got on my DofE journey and the opportunities I gained from it actually allowed me to have my first choice university when I didn't have the grades,\" she said. \n\"I was such a shy girl but straight away I was chucked into not knowing anybody and in a completely different environment.\"\nShe said she had also been inspired to teach and was now a primary school teacher working in Luton\nAnd she said she was thankful to the duke for creating the opportunity, which she said had \"changed my life completely\".\nMs Shohid agreed: \"I'd like to say a huge, huge thank you to him for establishing the award\u2026 if it wasn't for the initial start it wouldn't have happened so definitely a huge thank you to him.\"\nMr Gwilym added: \"I think his impact has been absolutely phenomenal.\n\"The programme has grown, the demand for the DofE today is stronger than its ever been and that's a fantastic legacy.\" \nAnd Jones said the programme had a bright future: \"The award itself will live on and his legacy will live long in the memories of everyone involved in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award.\" "

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

Not really. We unfortunately knew they were of this scale,\" she said.\n\"But we have to be careful here. That is the number of spills. The question I am asking Welsh Water to answer is: 'Of that number - how many are outside their permits?\"\nWelsh Water said its operations are \"highly regulated and closely monitored\" by the Welsh government's environment authority, Natural Resources Wales.\n\"Whilst CSOs are mainly operating as designed and permitted, we do recognise that more needs to be done,\" added a spokesman.\n\"However, this requires significant additional funding and development of infrastructure and will take many years to deliver.\"\nThe operator said it had installed an additional 1,000 spill monitors at overflow sites since 2017, covering more than 90% of its CSOs.\n\"This is a crucial first step so that we can identify and understand the scale of the issues we need to address,\" they added."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nPeople aged 45 or over in England will now be invited to get a Covid jab, after the vaccine rollout hit the government's target of offering a first dose to all over-50s and people who are clinically extremely vulnerable by 15 April. The vaccination programme will then move on to everyone aged 40 or over \"in line with supplies\", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the government on vaccine rollouts, has said the the programme should continue to be based on age. The committee said the rollout should continue with the 40 to 49 age group before moving to all those aged 30 to 39 and then adults aged 18 to 29. It has also suggested that the youngest age group are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab after concerns about a possible link to rare blood clots.  You can read more on when you might be called for your jab here.\nAn outbreak of a Covid-19 variant in south London appears to have been triggered by an individual who travelled from Africa in February, according to documents seen by the BBC. Surge testing has begun in Wandsworth and Lambeth after 44 confirmed and 30 probable cases were identified. The country involved was not on the red list for mandatory hotel quarantine at that time, but it is now. The government said \"strong measures\" were in place to find new cases and the prime minister's official spokesman said the cluster was being taken \"very seriously\". If you want to read more about how surge testing works you can read our explainer.\nUS health authorities are calling for a pause in the use of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, after reports of extremely rare blood clotting cases. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said six cases in 6.8 million doses had been reported and it was acting \"out of an abundance of caution\". Johnson & Johnson said it was also delaying vaccine rollout in Europe, where the jab is known under the name Janssen. The UK has ordered 30 million doses of the one-shot inoculation but has not yet approved its use. The blood clot concerns are similar to those surrounding the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThe restriction on travelling around Scotland is to be lifted from Friday, when people will also be allowed to meet up in larger groups outdoors. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said measures were being eased earlier than planned to help people's mental health. The move was announced the day after pubs and restaurants were allowed to start serving customers outside in England, while non-essential shops and other businesses were also able to reopen. In Wales outdoor hospitality will not reopen until 26 April, a decision which intensive care consultant Dr Matt Morgan said \"isn't a bad thing\" as he urged caution.\nNormally the month of Ramadan, which starts this week, would see Muslims meet up with friends and families to eat and drink together. But, with coronavirus restrictions still in place, it means that for a second year Muslims are facing a very different holy month. Despite rules easing, people remain unable to meet indoors to break their fast together. One of those who is unable to mark the occasion in the usual way is Ansa Memon, who is living miles away from her mother in Cardiff.  \"The month is about community and people coming together so it is going to be difficult, but as Muslims we need to understand that we are still doing a good thing and we need to keep that in our heads,\" she said. Here is a reminder of the coronavirus rules on places of worship.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nAnd with the UK's vaccine programme moving to the next age group it is worth reminding ourselves that vaccines alone may not be enough to end lockdown.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "For the first time in months, pub gardens, shops and hairdressers have reopened in England, as rules were also eased in the rest of the UK.\nShoppers flocked to the High Street, with long queues seen outside some retailers. Other people took advantage of England's gyms and zoos reopening.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to \"behave responsibly\".\nNorthern Ireland's \"stay-at-home\" order is ending and some rules are being eased in Scotland and Wales.\nThe PM had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that has been postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday.\nSnow showers and chilly temperatures in parts of southern England appeared to do little to dampen enthusiasm for outdoor pints.\nScott Westlake, landlord of the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, said the pub had received 5,000 bookings over the next month for his new outside eating and drinking area.\nMr Westlake said: \"If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited.\n\"Atmosphere, ambience, seeing your mates, I think they (customers) are looking forward to that more than anything - and they'll sit in a blizzard for the first few days at least.\"\nNicholas Hair, landlord and owner of the Kentish Belle pub in Bexleyheath, south-east London, said there was a \"sense of celebration\" in the early hours of Monday as it opened to midnight customers. \n\"I'm hoping that this is a sort of rebirth, and that we are reopen for the foreseeable,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, a town in Lincolnshire has introduced its own European-style pavement cafes to help boost trade.\nSeveral hospitality venues in the market town of Louth have been allowed to put seating and tables outside to serve people during the day.\nLewis Phillips, general manager of the Masons Arms, which is one of the venues involved in the Louth scheme, said: \"We don't have a lovely big beer garden. So what we've got out the front here is absolutely brilliant.\"\nThe prime minister had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that was postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. \nHowever, Downing Street confirmed that Mr Johnson did have a haircut before he paid tribute to the duke in the House of Commons.\nMarika Smith, general manager of Hough End Leisure Centre, Withington, Manchester, said all of their swimming times were already fully booked on Monday.\nKelly Boad, owner of the Hair & Beauty Gallery in Warwick, opened her salon at midnight for a symbolic \"first cut\" of 2021, adding she is fully booked for the first few weeks.\nShoppers rushed back to the High Street, as queues formed outside branches of Primark, JD Sports and TK Maxx and retailers extended their opening hours.\nAnother business that reopened in England was Secret Spa, which offers at-home salon and spa treatments in London, Manchester and Brighton.\nCo-owner Emily Ewart-Perks said it had \"been such a long time coming\", saying: \"Everyone has really missed the social contact of the day-to-day job and making clients happy.\"\nThe rule changes in England from Monday include:\nBut the British Beer and Pub Association has estimated that only 40% of licensed premises have the space to reopen for outdoor service.\nIn Northern Ireland, the remaining school year groups 8-11 returned to the classroom. The stay-at-home message has been lifted and up to 10 people from two households can meet in a private garden.\nIn Scotland, pupils at schools in six council areas went back to school but not everyone returned on Monday because differing term times mean some schools are still closed for the Easter holidays.\nAfter a drop in Covid cases prompted the Welsh Government to bring forward some dates for reopening, all students returned to face-to-face teaching on Monday. \nNon-essential shops can also reopen, close-contact services can resume, driving lessons can restart and travel in and out of Wales from the rest of the UK is allowed.\nShoppers, gym fans, domestic holiday makers, outdoor drinkers and diners, plus those in need of a haircut will share the government's hope that Monday is an irreversible step towards old and cherished freedoms. \nSo will the business owners who will be welcoming them back. \nBut this significant easing of lockdown is also an important test. \nWill customers want or be able to return in sufficient numbers for firms to break even and if they don't, what will it take to make the economy work again? \nOnly two in five hospitality venues have any outdoor space and the rules over future inside opening are still unclear. \nThe government and the opposition have distanced themselves from requiring Covid certificates for day-to-day life but the government has also hinted individual businesses may require them if they wish.\nHospitality chiefs have told the BBC they fear having to choose between two different ways to lose money - half-empty venues without certificates or full ones with extra staff and hassle to check Covid status. \nDemand may vary by sector. \nHairdressers are booked solid, retailers are hopeful of high footfall and are welcoming longer opening hours but some holiday parks are reporting subdued bookings as many of their public amenities remain closed. \nIt is a test for everyone - but a welcome one for most. \nIn a statement, the prime minister said the rule relaxations are \"a major step forward in our roadmap to freedom\".\n\"I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed,\" he added.\n\"I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress Covid as we push on with our vaccination programme.\"\nThe rule changes in England marks the third easing since the country's third national lockdown began on 6 January.\nThere is a gap of at least five weeks between each step on the government's \"roadmap\" out of lockdown, to allow the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed.\nThe next significant date is 17 May, when up to six people from different households could be allowed to socialise indoors. \nMore than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine and of those 7.6m have had their second dose, according to the latest government data.\nMeanwhile, 189,665 second doses were administered on Sunday - along with 69,223 first doses.\nSaturday marked a record total for second doses, with 475,230 given, while 111,109 were first doses.\nA further 13 people are reported to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there have been 3,568 new infections.\nThere can be a lag in reporting coronavirus statistics during weekends.\nMeanwhile, surge coronavirus testing is being rolled out in areas of Wandsworth and Lambeth in south London, where cases of the South Africa variant were found. \nAll identified cases are self-isolating or have completed their isolation, and their contacts have been traced and asked to self-isolate."

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,Prince William, Duke of Cambridge",
      "text": "The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex have paid tribute to their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. \nIn separate statements, Prince William described him as an \"extraordinary man\", while Prince Harry said he was \"a man of service, honour and great humour\" and the \"legend of banter\". \n\"I will miss my Grandpa, but I know he would want us to get on with the job,\" Prince William added. \nPrince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday aged 99.\nIt comes as parliaments across the UK were recalled to remember the duke. \n\"My grandfather's century of life was defined by service - to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family,\" Prince William said in a statement.\n\"I feel lucky to have not just had his example to guide me, but his enduring presence well into my own adult life - both through good times and the hardest days.\n\"I will always be grateful that my wife had so many years to get to know my grandfather and for the kindness he showed her. \n\"I will never take for granted the special memories my children will always have of their great-grandpa coming to collect them in his carriage and seeing for themselves his infectious sense of adventure as well as his mischievous sense of humour!\"\nHe added that he and his wife, Catherine, would \"continue to do what he would have wanted and will support the Queen in the years ahead\". \nPaying tribute to his grandfather, Prince Harry said: \"He was authentically himself, with a seriously sharp wit, and could hold the attention of any room due to his charm - and also because you never knew what he might say next.\n\"He will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the monarch, a decorated serviceman, a prince and a duke. \n\"But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end.\"\nBy Jonny Dymond, Royal correspondent\nHe walked next to them on the hardest public day of their lives, in the public procession behind their mother's coffin. And now the brothers pay tribute in their own style, with tenderness and with love.\nHarry, you may have noticed, now lives in California. His message is more informal, with memories of family outings, the back and forth of conversation, of a grandfather never short of a quip or an impatient snort.  \nWilliam writes as a grandson who has lost a guide and support; but also as a father who saw the mutual delight of grandfather and son together.\nBoth men flesh out in the few words they write the man they, and the nation, have said farewell to.  There was clearly a lot of laughter. There was clearly a lot of fun. \nOnce more the gruff caricature we were left with of the duke is re-drawn, and filled out.\nPrince Harry described Prince Philip as \"a rock\" for the Queen \"with unparalleled devotion\". \n\"While I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, 'Oh do get on with it!'\" he said. \n\"So, on that note, Grandpa, thank you for your service, your dedication to Granny, and for always being yourself.\"\nPrince Harry signed off his message with the words \"Per Mare, Per Terram\", meaning \"By Sea, By Land\" in Latin - the motto of the Royal Marines, of which Prince Philip and Prince Harry were both Captain General.\nPhilip held the role for 64 years before retiring in 2017. Harry succeeded him briefly before stepping down as a working royal last year when he moved to the US.\nMeanwhile, MPs began proceedings in the House of Commons by observing a minute's silence to remember the duke's life. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said Prince Philip had \"touched the lives of millions\", including through the Duke of Edinburgh's Award schemes.\n\"By his tireless, unstinting service to the Queen, the Commonwealth, the armed forces, the environment, to millions of young people and not-so-young people around the world, and to countless other causes, he gave us and he gives us all a model of selflessness and of putting others before ourselves,\" he said. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the duke's life \"shaped modern Britain and provided much-needed stability to our national story\". \nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon led the tributes in Holyrood, describing the duke and the Queen as a \"true partnership\". \nIn the Welsh Senedd, First Minister Mark Drakeford said Prince Philip led a \"remarkable\" life and had championed a \"broad diversity\" of causes in Wales.\nAnd in the Northern Ireland Assembly, First Minister Arlene Foster described the duke as a \"true intergenerational legacy to our youth, our United Kingdom and the world's environment\".\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there had been \"significant interventions\" by the Royal Family to \"assist in the building of relationships between Britain and Ireland\", which should be recognised. \nIn the Lords, former children's television presenter Baroness Benjamin said Prince Philip had made a \"gigantic contribution\" to Britain and the Commonwealth and they had kept up a correspondence over the years, including him writing to congratulate her on receiving her OBE and damehood.\nA ceremonial royal funeral, which will be televised, will be held for the duke at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, at 15:00 BST on 17 April.\nHis children and grandchildren are expected to attend and Prince Harry has arrived in the UK from the US for the service. His wife, Meghan, who is pregnant, will remain at home in California on the advice of doctors.\nA spokesman for the Duke of Sussex said he was at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, his former residence, observing coronavirus regulations. \nIt will be the first time Prince William and Prince Harry will meet face to face since the Sussexes aired criticisms of the Royal Family in an interview to US broadcaster Oprah Winfrey last month.\nOn Sunday, former prime minister Sir John Major, who was appointed a special guardian to the brothers after their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales died in 1997, said the \"shared grief\" over the death of Prince Philip is an \"ideal opportunity\" to mend any rifts in the Royal Family.\nOver the weekend, Prince Philip's children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - also paid tribute to their father, with Prince Andrew saying the Queen had described his death as \"having left a huge void in her life\". \nby Duncan Kennedy, BBC News\nWindsor is now a town with twin-sided attentions: the crowd-less castle side, sealed-off and busy preparing for a royal funeral, alongside the energised shop side, resurfacing from lockdown.\nAt the entrance to the castle, the glistening steel barriers of the media enclosure are packed with cameras trained on the ancient grey walls. They look out on a scene of perpetual preparation: forklift trucks, catering vans and council vehicles enter, leave, turn and reverse.\nScaffolding, chairs, flowers and boxes are disgorged. And miles of cables are being unfurled from vast drums like never-ending electrical snakes by the television, radio and lighting professionals who will bring the funeral to the world.\nPolice have replaced pedestrians in this cordoned-off unit of determined workflows: on foot, on bicycles and in their cars, their blacked-out windows gliding past the castle's famous black-cloaked wardens, lined up across the entrance.\nThe paper plans of countless committees across endless decades are coming to a melancholy fruition, to give His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, a fitting send-off."

Their marriage was one of the most closely followed in recent decades.\nKardashian, 40, first found fame in 2007 as the star of reality TV show about her family, Keeping Up With The Kardashians. The show has remained popular since then and is due to air its final series on the E! cable network next year.\nLast week her multiple business ventures - including make up, shapewear and mobile apps - saw her gain billionaire status.\nWest, 43, is one of the biggest names in rap music, known for global hits like Stronger, Jesus Walks and Gold Digger. He has also found success as a fashion designer.\nLast year, West unsuccessfully ran for US president. During his campaign, a series of erratic public appearances and online postings by the rapper sparked concern and led Kardashian to speak out.\nShe said her husband had bipolar disorder, was a \"brilliant but complicated person\" and called for greater empathy surrounding his mental health from the public and the media."

      "tags": "David Cameron,UK government,Greensill Capital",
      "text": "The government has announced a review covering David Cameron's efforts to lobby ministers on behalf of finance firm Greensill Capital.\nThe former prime minister has been criticised for contacting ministers via text on behalf of the company, which collapsed in March.\nDowning Street said the probe would be led by lawyer Nigel Boardman on behalf of the Cabinet Office. \nLabour says the government's response is \"inadequate\". \nMr Cameron has said he has not broken any codes of conduct or lobbying rules.\nBut in a statement on Sunday weeks after reports of his lobbying emerged, the former Tory leader said that he should have contacted ministers through \"formal\" channels.\nA spokesman for the former PM told the BBC: \"David Cameron welcomes the inquiry and will be glad to take part.\" \nMr Cameron began working as an adviser to Greensill Capital in August 2018, two years after he stepped down as prime minister.\nIn recent weeks, newspaper reports have revealed he texted Chancellor Rishi Sunak and other Treasury ministers on behalf of the company. \nMr Cameron said he had been trying to involve the company in a government-backed emergency loans scheme for firms hit by the Covid pandemic. \nThe government went on to reject his plans to involve Greensill in the so-called Covid Corporate Financing Facility.\nIt has also been revealed that Mr Cameron met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a \"private drink\" in 2019 to discuss a payment scheme for the NHS. \nAn ally of Mr Hancock said he had \"acted in entirely the correct way\".\nIf you hope that the review that is meant to clear up what happened in this instance will propose some big crackdown, forget it.  Just like the organisation that provides rules for former ministers, it has no power of sanction, no statutory, or legal force. \nSources suggests its remit is to find out narrowly what happened with Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill, not to start a conversation about the rights and wrongs of lobbying, let alone to propose a new system. \nThat is not to cast aspersions either on the ability of the senior lawyer who will carry out the work, who may well turn up more interesting nuggets. \nHe'll report by the end of June, and has been promised access to the information he needs.  But the remit is tightly drawn, suggesting little appetite in government for a big rethink of the landscape.\nDowning Street insists the prime minster understands the significant public interest and wants to look at the issues raised and get more details.\nWhile there is no love lost between Boris Johnson and David Cameron, and it is pretty much impossible to think of a similar case where a serving PM commissions an investigation into one of his predecessors, Labour is already warning that it could be a \"Conservative cover-up\". \nDespite that rather dramatic language, do not forget there are questions that remain for current government figures about conversations they had with Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill. \nRead more here\nA Cabinet Office spokesperson said the review would look into \"the decisions taken around the development and use of supply chain finance (and associated schemes) in government, especially the role of Lex Greensill and Greensill Capital\".\n\"Mr Boardman will have access to all necessary government information required to conduct the review and will engage with those involved at the time when decisions were made.\"\nThe spokesperson also said that Mr Boardman would report his findings to the prime minister \"no later than the end of June 2021\" and that he will pause his work as a non-executive director of the Business Department while the review is carried out.\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg says it is understood the review will not have legal powers, and is likely to come up with findings rather than recommendations. \nAnd Mr Boardman has not been asked to suggest ways of tightening up the lobbying system, but has been given a limited remit to ascertain how decisions about Greensill Capital were made. \nThe shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said what the government has announced \"doesn't go far enough\". \n\"There is a real risk that the government are attempting to brush under the carpet or cover up this scandal of cronyism, of contracts and of involvement of the former prime minister in lobbying current ministers\" she said. \n\"It is essential that everybody involved in this scandal comes before parliament and answers serious and important questions about possible wrongdoing\" she added. \nMr Cameron's predecessor at No 10, Gordon Brown, welcomed an inquiry, adding: \"it's important to get to the bottom of this\".\nThe ex-Labour leader told BBC News: \"I don't really think former ministers and prime ministers should be engaged in lobbying for particular commercial companies, when they are lobbying their successors whom they know very well and could have privileged access to.\n\"Lobbying in this commercial way could also be a stain on our democracy, and therefore an inquiry is completely appropriate.\"\nFormer ministers and senior civil servants are banned from lobbying for two years after they leave government, a rule Mr Cameron followed.\nMr Brown had suggested earlier on Monday the ban should be extended to five years if existing rules prove inadequate.

      "tags": "Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "The world\u2019s wealthy must radically change their lifestyles to tackle climate change, a report says.\nIt says the world's wealthiest 1% produce double the combined carbon emissions of the poorest 50%, according to the UN.\nThe wealthiest 5% alone \u2013 the so-called \u201cpolluter elite\u201d - contributed 37% of emissions growth between 1990 and 2015.\nThe authors want to deter SUV drivers and frequent fliers \u2013 and persuade the wealthy to insulate their homes well.\nThe report urges the UK government to reverse its decision to scrap air passenger duty on UK return flights.  \nAnd it wants ministers to re-instate the Green Homes Grant scheme they also scrapped recently. \nThe document has come from the UK-based Cambridge Sustainability Commission on Scaling Behaviour Change.\nIt\u2019s a panel of 31 individuals who study people\u2019s behaviour relating to the environment. They were tasked to find the most effective way of scaling up action to tackle carbon emissions.\nTheir critics say the best way to cut emissions faster is through technological improvements - not through measures that would prove unpopular. \nBut the lead author of the report, Prof Peter Newell, from Sussex University, told BBC News: \u201cWe are totally in favour of technology improvements and more efficient products - but it\u2019s clear that more drastic action is needed because emissions keep going up.\n\u201cWe have got to cut over-consumption and the best place to start is over-consumption among the polluting elites who contribute by far more than their share of carbon emissions.\n\u201cThese are people who fly most, drive the biggest cars most and live in the biggest homes which they can easily afford to heat, so they tend not to worry if they\u2019re well insulated or not. \n\u201cThey\u2019re also the sort of people who could really afford good insulation and solar panels if they wanted to.\u201d\nProf Newell said that to tackle climate change, everyone needs to feel part of a collective effort \u2013 so that means the rich consuming less to set an example to poorer people.\nHe continued: \u201cRich people who fly a lot may think they can offset their emissions by tree-planting schemes or projects to capture carbon from the air. But these schemes are highly contentious and they\u2019re not proven over time. \nThe wealthy, he said, \u201csimply must fly less and drive less. Even if they own an electric SUV that\u2019s still a drain on the energy system and all the emissions created making the vehicle in the first place\u201d.\nSam Hall, from the Conservative Environment Network, told BBC News: \"It\u2019s right to emphasise the importance of fairness in delivering (emissions cuts) - and policy could make it easier for people and businesses to go green - through incentives, targeted regulation and nudges. \n\u201cBut encouraging clean technologies is likely to be more effective, and more likely to enjoy public consent, than hefty penalties or lifestyle restrictions.\"\nBut Prof Newell said existing political structures allowed wealthy firms and individuals to lobby against necessary changes in society that might erode the lifestyles of the rich. \nThe recent report of the UK Climate Assembly, for example, proposed a series of measures targeting carbon-intensive behaviours such as shifting away from meat and dairy produce; banning the most polluting SUVs; and imposing frequent flyer levies.\nThe Treasury told BBC News that a frequent flyer levy might require the government to collect and store personal information on each passenger. \nThis could raise issues of data processing, handling and privacy issues. It would also be hard to keep track of people with multiple passports.\nBut the commission\u2019s report said: \u201cThe goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change cannot be achieved without radical changes to lifestyles and shifts in behaviour, especially among the wealthiest members of society.\n\u201cIf change across society is to be brought about at the speed and scale required to meet agreed climate targets, we need to shrink and share: reduce carbon budgets and share more equally.\u201d\nThe report is the latest in a long-running dialogue over what it means to be \u201cfair\u201d while tackling climate change.\nPoorer nations such as India have consistently argued that they should be allowed to increase their pollution because it\u2019s so much lower per person than emissions from rich nations.\nThe issue forms part of the tangled tapestry of negotiations behind next week\u2019s climate summit organised by President Biden and the COP climate summit in the UK scheduled for  November. \nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "text": "Trade between the UK and EU partially recovered in February, after a steep drop in January following Brexit. \nOfficial figures show exports to the EU jumped by 46.6%, \u00a33.7bn, to \u00a311.6bn, following January's 42% slump when firms struggled with new trade rules. \nHowever, the Office for National Statistics said exports were still below last year's levels and imports from the EU had seen a weaker recovery.\nOther figures from the ONS showed the UK economy grew by 0.4% in February.\nThe UK's statistics body said the economy was still 7.8% smaller than a year earlier, before the impact of the pandemic.\nLast month's trade figures were the first since new trading rules came into force as a result of Brexit trade rule changes.\nBoth the ONS and business analysts said the drop in trade flows was partly caused by stockpiling in December 2020, as businesses tried to get ahead of the introduction of the new rules, depressing trade in January.\nIn addition, the end of the temporary trading arrangement between the UK and the EU coincided with the discovery of a new strain of Covid-19 in the UK, which caused further complications and delays, after lorry drivers were required to take tests before crossing the border at the English Channel.\nAn ONS spokesperson said: \"Exports to the EU recovered significantly from their January fall, though still remain below 2020 levels. However, imports from the EU are yet to significantly rebound, with a number of issues hampering trade.\" \nThe Federation of Small Businesses said overall sales had dropped by \u00a32.5bn and its members needed more help.\nChairman Mike Cherry said: \"UK exports have tumbled since the end of the [Brexit] transition period. \n\"International sales are way down on where they were at this time last year. A fifth of small exporters have halted sales to the EU temporarily and some have already given up on selling into the bloc on a permanent basis.\"\nBut a government spokesperson said the statistics showed \"welcome growth\" in the value of trade with the EU in February. \n\"This is in line with our predictions last month as we saw increasing volumes of freight traffic to and from the EU.\n\"The vast majority of traders and hauliers have adapted well, and our focus now is on making sure that any business that is still facing challenges gets the support they need to trade effectively with the EU.\"\nUK imports from the EU rose by 7.3%, or \u00a31.2bn in February to \u00a317.1bn, after dropping 29.7% the month before.\nThe ONS said the export increases were driven by machinery, transport equipment and chemicals.\nThe ONS said it was too early to make any conclusions about the impact of the new trading arrangements with Europe.\nTotal imports of goods from non-EU countries rose by 10.2% to \u00a317.9bn in February, while exports fell by 10.5% to \u00a312.7bn.\nMark Callaghan is the chief executive of British Corner Shop, an exporter of British food and drink brands.\nHe says his firm \"battled\" to find a solution to continue to export its products, particularly on the consumer channel into the EU. \nBritish Corner Shop had to cut its product range down from 10,000 to 1,400, and is planning to open its own distribution centre in the EU.\nThis means the loss of 40 jobs in the UK, and the new centre will see 60 new jobs in the EU. \n\"We were jumping with joy when Boris announced in late December that there was a deal with the EU and it would be trade as normal, so we were very excited about that,\" he told the BBC.\n\"[It would mean] minimal disruption for the business, but that hasn't been the case.\n\"We've seen huge disruption, we've seen a massive drop in sales, we've had to reduce our workforce by 40 people and we're moving those jobs into the EU, so I wouldn't say that it's been successful at all.\"\nAfter a 42% plunge in January in sales to the EU, February's bounce back of 46.6% is more the kind of figure the government would like associated with Global Britain's new trading era. \nBut just as the earlier figures weren't conclusive evidence that the new arrangements for trading with Europe posed a widespread sustained problem, the latest ones don't mean it's back to business as usual either. \nMany companies avoided sending goods across the border in the previous month, for fear of disruption or delay, having shipped orders ahead of time where they could. Both January's fall and February's rebound were led by non-perishable items - chemicals, machinery - which are easily stockpiled . That trade resumed in February, while many other exporters managed to get to grips with the new formalities. \nBut export levels remain below where they were for much of 2020, and anecdotal evidence suggests some exporters - particularly those of fresh foods - remain overwhelmed by the new checks and forms. They are urging the government to help simplify processes. Meanwhile the pandemic continues to weigh on demand. \nWith the EU typically buying more than two-fifths of British exports, tackling remaining issues will be instrumental to getting the economy back on its feet. \nCovid restrictions remained in place to varying degrees across all four nations of the UK during January and February. \n\"The economy showed some improvement in February after the large falls seen at the start of the year but remains around 8% below its pre-pandemic level,\" an ONS spokesperson said.\nSarah Hewin, from Standard Chartered Bank, told the BBC's Today programme the outlook for the UK economy was improving.\n\"Confidence does seem to be picking up as vaccinations are spreading. We know households have built up their savings in many cases during lockdown. As lockdown restrictions are eased people are going to be able to go out and spend those savings and that will be a big boost to the economy.\n\"As we saw from the scenes yesterday people are keen to get out and spend when they can. There will be more opportunities for travelling and going on holiday and spending in restaurants and pubs will see people spending to go out and enjoy themselves.\"\nThe latest ONS data also indicated that the economy did not shrink by as much as initially estimated in January. The statistics body said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 2.2% in January, an upward revision from its original estimate of a 2.9% drop.\n\"A slightly improved January data could mark the final contraction in the current crisis, with the economy beginning to gather strength even before the end of the lockdown,\" said Yael\u202fSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK.\nRory Macqueen, principal economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: \"Clearly much of the economy has adapted to cope with Covid-19 restrictions... if the vaccine programme and lifting of restrictions continue on schedule this provides a firm basis for continuing growth in the second quarter and 2021 overall.\""

      "text": "The fatal shooting of a black man by a police officer in the US city of Brooklyn Center in Minnesota was an accident, the police chief has said.\nDaunte Wright, 20, was shot after the officer meant to use a Taser, but mistakenly drew her gun instead, Chief Tim Gannon told reporters.\nThe officer was later named as Kim Potter who has worked for Brooklyn Center Police for 26 years.\nMr Wright's death has sparked protests and a curfew has been declared.\nLate on Monday, crowds defied the curfew to gather for a second night outside Brooklyn Center Police headquarters. Witnesses said some threw fireworks and bottles at officers who responded with tear gas and stun grenades.\nTensions in nearby Minneapolis are high as the trial of an ex-officer accused of killing George Floyd continues.\nDaunte Wright was pulled over on Sunday for a traffic violation, but there was a struggle when he tried to get back into his car.\nAt a news conference on Monday, Chief Gannon played a short video from the body camera worn by a policewoman, which shows Mr Wright trying to get back into his car as officers attempt to handcuff him on the side of the road.\nAn officer can then be heard saying \"Taser, Taser, Taser\" - normal police procedure before firing one of the stun guns. Mr Wright is seen to get into his car and drive away, while the same officer says: \"Holy shit, I just shot him\".\nFatally wounded, Mr Wright crashed a few streets away.\n\"It is my belief the officer meant to deploy their Taser but shot him with a single bullet,\" Chief Gannon said, adding: \"There's nothing I can say to lessen the pain.\"\nThe officer has been placed on administrative leave - meaning she is paid while investigations take place.\nAt the same news conference, Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott said he would do everything in his power to \"ensure justice is done for Daunte Wright\".\n\"Our hearts are aching right now, we are in pain right now. We recognise this couldn't have happened at a worse time. This is happening at a time that all of our community, all of America, indeed all of the world is watching,\" he said.\nAngry protests erupted in Brooklyn Center on Sunday night as news of Mr Wright's death spread.\nHundreds of protesters chanting his name gathered late outside the police headquarters.\nAbout 20 businesses in a nearby shopping centre were later broken into, the StarTribune reported, with sporadic looting spreading to parts of Minneapolis.\nIt prompted authorities to enforce an overnight curfew on Sunday night, and on Monday, the mayors of Minneapolis and neighbouring St Paul declared a local state of emergency. Another curfew is in place from 19:00 to 06:00 local time across the two cities. \nAs darkness fell on Monday, riot police ordered protesters to disperse but the crowd remained, CBS reported. Police then began deploying gas canisters and stun grenades, reporters at the scene said.\nMembers of the Minnesota National Guard, already deployed for the trial on murder charges of Derek Chauvin, have also been sent to Brooklyn Center.\nNational ice hockey, basketball and baseball games that were due to take place on Monday night were postponed.\nBarbara Plett-Usher, BBC News\nOne sign at the protest captured the mood: \"During the trial!!?\" it read in bright orange letters. \n\"It's ridiculous,\" said the young man carrying it. \"They know they have a delicate relationship with the black community right now and they should look to be making amends, not this.\" \nCity officials had said the shooting could not have happened at a worse time, with tensions high over the George Floyd case. \nSome protesters threw bottles and shot fireworks toward police lines. They vented their rage as officers in riot gear stood impassively. \"You took his life, for what?\" screamed a young woman. \n\"He was a son, he was a father, he was a black man that deserved to live.\" \"Do you know the difference between a gun and a taser?\" shouted someone else. \"Hell yeah,\" roared the crowd, scorning the police chief's belief that the shooting was a tragic mistake. \n\"There's no room for accidents,\" said one man. \"The fact is that we lost another young black male to a police officer.' \nMr Wright's mother, Katie, said her heart had been \"broken in a thousand pieces... I miss him so much\".\n\"He was my life, he was my son and I can never get that back,\" she said on Monday. \"Because of a mistake? Because of an accident?\"\nEarlier, she told how her son had called her during the traffic stop. He said he had been pulled over because of \"air fresheners hanging from his rear-view mirror\". She said she then heard scuffling and the phone line was cut.\n\"A minute later, I called and his girlfriend answered, who was the passenger in the car, and said that he'd been shot... and my son was laying there lifeless.\"\nThe trial of Derek Chauvin over the death of George Floyd has been under way in the city for two weeks now.\nMr Chauvin was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest operation in Minneapolis last May.\nThe footage of the incident sparked global protests against racism.\nThe trial is now into its third week and law enforcement officials have been bracing for possible unrest once the jury reaches a verdict.\nGeorge Floyd's death sparked waves of protests around the city, many peaceful but some violent with hundreds of buildings damaged."

      "text": "Reopening pubs too soon could run the risk of \"undoing all the good\" during lockdown, an infectious disease expert has said.\nBeer gardens reopened in England on Monday, but in Wales industry experts have expressed frustration they cannot open until 26 April.\nDr Mike Tildesley said it was important lockdown was eased gradually to stop a spike in coronavirus cases.\nThe Welsh government said it was taking \"a careful step-by-step approach\".\nDr Tildesley, who is part of a modelling group which advises the UK government on the pandemic, said he understood people were \"frustrated\" at the different timetables out of lockdown.\nHowever, he said a cautious approach was needed for the next few weeks to prevent a third wave, in the hope \"we can get back to normal by summer\".\n\"We need to remember that these are paced at a rate that the vaccinations can keep up with us and can help us along the way,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\nMore than half the people in Wales have now had their first Covid-19 vaccination dose, and Covid admissions to hospitals in Wales have hit record low levels.\nDr Tildesley said while things were moving in the right direction, scientists needed to monitor the impact of relaxing other restrictions on case rates, before reopening other parts of life.\nOn Monday shoppers queued as non-essential shops reopened in Wales for the first time since they were forced to close in the run-up to Christmas.\n\"The key thing is we need to take it at a gradual rate so we can ensure that we can reopen safely... we are doing well, but if we go too fast we run the risk of too much mixing, and undoing all the good we have done so far,\" he said.\nWhile he said cases could go up as people began mixing again and going back to their daily lives, the progress of the vaccine should help avoid a \"significant resurgence\".\nDr Tildesley urged people to be cautious for a few more weeks, adding the biggest concern was that if there was a spoke in cases the virus could mutate.\n\"We are not quite out of the woods yet, in the not too distant future we will be in a position where we can meet people... and hug our friends and family again, but we are not there yet,\" he said.\nOne landlord, whose pub is on the border said it was \"frustrating\" remaining closed until 26 April when outdoor hospitality opened on Monday in England.\nJohn Turner said two other pubs in his village - that are technically in England - had now reopened.\nBut Mr Turner, who runs the Dolphin Inn, in Llanymynech, on the Powys-Shropshire border, said Wales was \"always two weeks behind England\" and he was anxious to open again.\nOn Monday, the border reopened between Wales and England and people are now allowed to travel in both directions.\nOnce in England, you can visit a pub or cafe garden with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households.\nHowever, some people have agreed with Dr Tildesley's view and expressed relief pubs remain closed in Wales.\nGarfield Doc Oakleeffe posted on Facebook: \"After seeing the footage of the lack of social distancing when drinking in Soho, I think slow and cautious is better.\"\nSian Louise said: \"I know it's horrible to not be open and I feel for businesses, I really do as I was getting annoyed with it all, but by looking how this last lockdown went and how it started I actually understand why [Mark Drakeford is] doing it slowly, because we don't want another lockdown and we don't want anymore people getting seriously ill either. \n\"Hopefully, in time we will come out better and safer by doing it gradually.\"\nMichelle Murphy commented: \"I am so glad they are still closed. If this is what it is going to be like, no wonder they predict a third wave.\"\nKerry Lea Edwards did not understand the \"urgency to be back in the pub\", adding: \"If it's the social side you can meet outdoors in your garden with your friends and have a drink.\n\"Surely it's not worth the risk - we will be in another lockdown before we know it, very sad.\"\nMr Turner said: \"The firebreak [lockdown] was going to be the saviour for Christmas and then I didn't even imagine we would miss out on Easter as well.\n\"An extra two weeks' trade will be lost once again to England.\" \nHe added that even when pubs in Wales can reopen, it could be a struggle only being able to serve outside because of \"the weather element\".\nWhile he has used some of his government support to put up a marquee, and purchase heaters and furniture, he said other pubs might not be able to keep up.\nHe said he was anxious to make the money back to make the new equipment worthwhile. \n\"People are desperate to get to the pub. I am hopeful we will be full and I'm looking forward to being busy again because otherwise it will be harder and more disappointing,\" he said.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association (WBPA), said pubs across Wales were \"hugely disappointed\" to not open on Monday alongside England.\nShe said pubs in Wales having to wait another two weeks while pubs in England were trading outdoors was \"a bitter pill to swallow\". \nMs McClarkin said: \"Vaccination rates continue to climb while case rates are falling week on week. Even when they will be allowed to open, we still think about 60% of pubs in Wales will be unable to because of a lack of usable outside space.\n\"The Welsh government need to recognise that and bring forward a package of funding as soon as possible that will prevent hundreds of Welsh pubs being lost for good.\"\nThe Welsh government said it had provided more than \u00a32bn of funding to support businesses impacted by the pandemic, safeguarding 165,000 Welsh jobs. \nA spokesperson said tourism and hospitality businesses would continue to receive cash grants this month to help them through until the reopening date in May. \n\"Businesses will therefore see no interruption in the flow of financial support, as we move cautiously to relax public health restrictions,\" they said.\n\"Another \u00a3200m in additional support for business has already been earmarked in the Final Budget 2021-22. \n\"Ministers have had a constructive meeting with representatives from the hospitality sector and Welsh government officials will work with them on options for a further support package to be put to the new government following May's Senedd election.\"\nA Plaid Cymru spokesperson said many would question the decision not to move forward the reopening of beer gardens after scenes like those seen in Cardiff Bay, where crowds gathered to drink over the bank holiday weekend.\n\"A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"Likewise, the lack of clear date on indoor hospitality remains a major problem and at the very least the government should urgently revisit its decision to delay any additional financial support until after election.\"\nLeader of the Welsh Conservative group Andrew RT Davies, said the Welsh government's decision was about politics not science, and lost trade meant \"lost livelihoods in Wales\".\n\"After a crippling 12 months for businesses, Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay seem to have a tin ear to these concerns. Welsh Conservatives would cut the border games, end the confusion, and get Wales on the road to recovery with a safe, consistent and one-nation approach,\" he said.\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said: \"Lockdown is frustrating but we all need to stay safe and follow the regulations. \n\"If we do, we will not need to enter a lockdown again and that is the the most important thing. We've seen before what happened when lockdowns were eased too quickly.\" "

      "tags": "Endangered species,Rhinos,Nepal",
      "text": "The number of one-horned rhinos in Nepal's wildlife sanctuaries has increased by more than a hundred, marking a positive milestone in the Himalayan nation's conservation efforts.\nAccording to the results of the latest census, Nepal's rhino population has risen to 752, from 645 in 2015.\nNepal is among only a few countries where greater one-horned rhinos are found. The animal was close to extinction in the last century, and its revival in Nepal and India is regarded as one of the greatest conservation success stories in Asia.\n\"We are very excited by the rhino survey's findings. After the tigers, now the rhino population has also gone up,\" Haribhadra Acharya, a senior official at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, told the BBC.\nOf the total number of rhinos, more than 90% live in the Chitwan National Park, which is also home to tigers, elephants, leopards and Gangetic gharials (fish-eating crocodiles).\nFollowing the population increase in recent decades, the rhino's status has improved from endangered to vulnerable.\nNepali officials said the coronavirus pandemic had helped the animals and their habitat in some ways, as lockdowns gave the rhinos chance to roam freely without tourists following them.\nOn the other hand, poachers have also exploited the situation by killing four rhinos in the past year.\nThe rhino census was due to be conducted in 2020 but was postponed due to the pandemic. The counting is held once every five years to monitor their status in the wild.\nAround 350 experts and forest department officials travelled deep into the forest for about three weeks to tally the rhinos based on a visual headcount. \nThe estimates are based on unique identifying features like sex, size, horn, ear shapes and skin folds.\nThe census certainly wasn't without its difficulties. The rhino counters ride domesticated elephants to traverse Chitwan National Park, which covers a vast 950 sq km (367 sq mile) area and has very limited roads. Several of the team in Chitwan were injured when a rogue wild elephant pursued and attacked their animals, causing them to panic and run amok.\nThen a few days later at the Bardiya sanctuary, a smaller habitat about 400km (248 miles) west, a tiger killed an elephant trainer who was gathering fodder for the animal at the end of the day's survey. \nBut despite the hardships, the count was concluded.\nWhile the rise in rhino numbers gives something to celebrate, experts note the picture is still fragile.  \n\"From a biological point of view, the percentage of growth of rhinos has decreased in the last six years if you compare it with the previous census period\" said rhino biologist Naresh Subedi, the spokesperson for the National Trust for Nature Conservation.\nThe annual rhino population growth between 2011 and 2015 was 5%. But the latest survey shows the figure has dropped to around 3%.\nExperts attribute this mainly to an unprecedented increase in the number of deaths due to natural causes - like old age, territorial fights, drowning during flooding and disease. Around 160 rhinos have died since 2015. Some rhinos were even swept from Nepal to India by flooding in recent years.\nNepal has worked hard to limit the impact of war and human migration on its precious conservation projects. \nOnce the country was home to a thousand rhinos, but due to political unrest and mass settlement of people around the Chitwan National Park in the 1950s and 60s, their numbers dwindled. Poaching, deforestation and encroachment of habitat led to their decline.\nA decade later, the numbers fell to less than a hundred, triggering alarm.\nThe rhino population started to rise following strict anti-poaching measures and protection of forest areas in the subsequent decades. \nBut the 10-year civil war between Nepal's security forces and local Maoist rebels that ended in 2006 had a devastating impact on the wildlife. Poachers exploited the unrest and killed hundreds of animals for their horns. \nThe World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says the rhinos are hunted because their horn is used in traditional East Asian medicines - though there is no scientific proof of its medicinal value.\n\"We didn't have enough manpower to safeguard the forest and the poachers also had more advanced weapons. Once the civil war ended, we adopted a multi-pronged strategy to curb poaching,\" Ananath Baral, the chief conservation officer at Chitwan Park told the BBC.\nThe government deployed hundreds of Nepali soldiers inside the parks, and local communities were enlisted to disrupt the poaching network. Police also launched a drive against those involved in illegal wildlife trafficking.\nAs rhino numbers increased, tourism also picked up - creating valuable income. The authorities said they had invested up to 40% of the revenue from the park in development projects in nearby villages. \nThen the wildlife department wanted to create a viable rhino population in other parks. From the mid-1980s, they moved more than 80 rhinos from Chitwan Park to the Bardiya sanctuary, but numbers there fell drastically - mainly due to poaching. \nBeyond Chitwan, other sanctuaries have not been so successful in increasing their rhino populations.\nAccording to the latest census, Bardiya is now home to 38 rhinos. Shuklaphanta National Park has 17, and Parsa Park has only three.\nWhile the increasing rhino population is a positive conservation story, concerns remain over how to maintain their numbers in limited forest areas.\n\"It is going to be a huge challenge,\" Gana Gurung, country representative of the WWF for Nepal told the BBC.  \"Both tigers and rhinos need vast areas to roam around as their populations increase. They come to the edge of the park resulting in human-animal conflict.\"\nSometimes rhinos get injured in the illegal electric fences set up by farmers to prevent other wild animals like boars and elephants from destroying their crops. \nIn areas surrounding the Bardiya Park, 10 people have been killed by tigers in the past year, triggering panic among villagers. Sometimes tigers get hit by speeding vehicles on the highways around the sanctuary.\nThe increase in the rhino and tiger populations is a phenomenal achievement for a poor country like Nepal, but experts say pro-active management is required to maintain its conservation success.\nRhino biologist Mr Subedi suggests that more compensation and crop insurance could be offered to villagers living near the parks.\n\"If the rhino population goes beyond the carrying capacity of our parks, we can think about donating some of them to countries like India that wants to revive them in some of the sanctuaries. The private sector can also establish wildlife parks like in Africa,\" said Mr Subedi."

Other people took advantage of England's gyms and zoos reopening.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to \"behave responsibly\".\nNorthern Ireland's \"stay-at-home\" order is ending and some rules are being eased in Scotland and Wales.\nThe PM had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that has been postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday.\nSnow showers and chilly temperatures in parts of southern England appeared to do little to dampen enthusiasm for outdoor pints.\nScott Westlake, landlord of the Myrtle Tavern in Leeds, said the pub had received 5,000 bookings over the next month for his new outside eating and drinking area.\nMr Westlake said: \"If the weather's good, I think most people are optimistic and excited.\n\"Atmosphere, ambience, seeing your mates, I think they (customers) are looking forward to that more than anything - and they'll sit in a blizzard for the first few days at least.\"\nNicholas Hair, landlord and owner of the Kentish Belle pub in Bexleyheath, south-east London, said there was a \"sense of celebration\" in the early hours of Monday as it opened to midnight customers. \n\"I'm hoping that this is a sort of rebirth, and that we are reopen for the foreseeable,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, a town in Lincolnshire has introduced its own European-style pavement cafes to help boost trade.\nSeveral hospitality venues in the market town of Louth have been allowed to put seating and tables outside to serve people during the day.\nLewis Phillips, general manager of the Masons Arms, which is one of the venues involved in the Louth scheme, said: \"We don't have a lovely big beer garden. So what we've got out the front here is absolutely brilliant.\"\nThe prime minister had planned to have a celebratory pint to mark the measures easing, but that was postponed following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. \nHowever, Downing Street confirmed that Mr Johnson did have a haircut before he paid tribute to the duke in the House of Commons.\nMarika Smith, general manager of Hough End Leisure Centre, Withington, Manchester, said all of their swimming times were already fully booked on Monday.\nKelly Boad, owner of the Hair & Beauty Gallery in Warwick, opened her salon at midnight for a symbolic \"first cut\" of 2021, adding she is fully booked for the first few weeks.\nShoppers rushed back to the High Street, as queues formed outside branches of Primark, JD Sports and TK Maxx and retailers extended their opening hours.\nAnother business that reopened in England was Secret Spa, which offers at-home salon and spa treatments in London, Manchester and Brighton.\nCo-owner Emily Ewart-Perks said it had \"been such a long time coming\", saying: \"Everyone has really missed the social contact of the day-to-day job and making clients happy.\"\nThe rule changes in England from Monday include:\nBut the British Beer and Pub Association has estimated that only 40% of licensed premises have the space to reopen for outdoor service.\nIn Northern Ireland, the remaining school year groups 8-11 returned to the classroom. The stay-at-home message has been lifted and up to 10 people from two households can meet in a private garden.\nIn Scotland, pupils at schools in six council areas went back to school but not everyone returned on Monday because differing term times mean some schools are still closed for the Easter holidays.\nAfter a drop in Covid cases prompted the Welsh Government to bring forward some dates for reopening, all students returned to face-to-face teaching on Monday. \nNon-essential shops can also reopen, close-contact services can resume, driving lessons can restart and travel in and out of Wales from the rest of the UK is allowed.\nShoppers, gym fans, domestic holiday makers, outdoor drinkers and diners, plus those in need of a haircut will share the government's hope that Monday is an irreversible step towards old and cherished freedoms. \nSo will the business owners who will be welcoming them back. \nBut this significant easing of lockdown is also an important test. \nWill customers want or be able to return in sufficient numbers for firms to break even and if they don't, what will it take to make the economy work again? \nOnly two in five hospitality venues have any outdoor space and the rules over future inside opening are still unclear. \nThe government and the opposition have distanced themselves from requiring Covid certificates for day-to-day life but the government has also hinted individual businesses may require them if they wish.\nHospitality chiefs have told the BBC they fear having to choose between two different ways to lose money - half-empty venues without certificates or full ones with extra staff and hassle to check Covid status. \nDemand may vary by sector. \nHairdressers are booked solid, retailers are hopeful of high footfall and are welcoming longer opening hours but some holiday parks are reporting subdued bookings as many of their public amenities remain closed. \nIt is a test for everyone - but a welcome one for most. \nIn a statement, the prime minister said the rule relaxations are \"a major step forward in our roadmap to freedom\".\n\"I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed,\" he added.\n\"I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress Covid as we push on with our vaccination programme.\"\nThe rule changes in England marks the third easing since the country's third national lockdown began on 6 January.\nThere is a gap of at least five weeks between each step on the government's \"roadmap\" out of lockdown, to allow the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed.\nThe next significant date is 17 May, when up to six people from different households could be allowed to socialise indoors. \nMore than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine and of those 7.6m have had their second dose, according to the latest government data.\nMeanwhile, 189,665 second doses were administered on Sunday - along with 69,223 first doses.\nSaturday marked a record total for second doses, with 475,230 given, while 111,109 were first doses.\nA further 13 people are reported to have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there have been 3,568 new infections.\nThere can be a lag in reporting coronavirus statistics during weekends.\nMeanwhile, surge coronavirus testing is being rolled out in areas of Wandsworth and Lambeth in south London, where cases of the South Africa variant were found. \nAll identified cases are self-isolating or have completed their isolation, and their contacts have been traced and asked to self-isolate."

      "tags": "Universities in the UK,Students,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Students on all university courses in England will return \"no earlier than 17 May\", the government has announced.\nAbout a million students, taking courses taught online since Christmas, will be able to go back to university campuses.\nSince the start of the year, only students on hands-on courses have been allowed in-person teaching.\nBut the wait of another month to fully open was described as \"hugely disappointing\" by Universities UK.\nUniversities Minister Michelle Donelan, in a written statement, said the timing was a \"cautious approach to the easing of restrictions\" and \"the movement of students across the country poses a risk for the transmission of the virus\".\nUniversity leaders had been lobbying for all students to go back in April - saying it was unfair to keep restrictions on campuses when shops were open.\nStudents would be \"bitterly disappointed\" at  the slow return to university, said Vanessa Wilson, leader of the University Alliance, describing it as \"nonsensical\".\nThe mid-May start is likely to raise further questions about refunds on tuition fees and rent, for a reduced term before the summer break.\nGraham Galbraith, vice chancellor of the University of Portsmouth, said delaying for another month until after 17 May was \"unfathomable\".\n\"That this date is after many universities will have finished their teaching year shows a government with a cavalier disregard for details. This isn't good enough,\" he said.\n\"Students can now buy a book on British history in Waterstones and discuss it with a tattoo artist,\" - but they cannot go into a university and discuss it with their lecturer, said Prof Galbraith.\nAbout half of students have been on courses only being taught online - but from next month all students will return to a mix of face-to-face and online classes.\nHillary Gyebi-Ababio, the National Union of Students' vice president, said: \"We are pleased that the government has finally remembered that students exist.\"\nBut she warned that students would need support after so much disruption - including paying rent on accommodation they were not allowed to use.\nThe UCU lecturers' union, which opposed an earlier return, said it would be more \"honest\" to accept that many courses would stay online until the autumn.\n\"Restarting in-person activities in mid-May, with only weeks of the academic year left, makes absolutely no sense as most lectures and seminars will already have finished,\" said UCU leader, Jo Grady.\nStudents will be offered Covid testing on campus when they return - with an initial three tests under supervision, after which students will be asked to take tests at home.\nThere will also be an additional \u00a315m for student hardship support this year, announced the universities minister.\nThe 17 May timing aligns the return of students with the next phase of ending the lockdown - when pubs will open indoors and cinemas and theatres can open.\nUnlike the mass return of England's school children in March, universities in England have had a patchwork return - prompting criticisms that students were \"forgotten\" in the plans for leaving lockdown.\nStudents on courses which required hands-on training, such as medicine and some sciences, had some face-to-face teaching last term.\nBut students on courses such as the arts, humanities, business and law had been waiting for a return date - which will now be about five months after they left for the Christmas holidays.\nThere are some other universities which have already decided to stay online for all this academic year.\nEven without in-person teaching, many students seem to have gone back to their university accommodation - with a survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute suggesting about two thirds of students had been in their term-time addresses.\nLabour's shadow universities minister, Matt Western, said: \"Just a week before thousands were hoping to return to campus, they have been let down with yet another late announcement and no explanation of the reasons for this delay.\""

Likewise, there's no law requiring club- and festival-goers to show their pass, if they choose not to.\nHowever, the government says it reserves the right to make showing the pass compulsory at a later date.\nYou will still have to self-isolate if you have Covid symptoms, test positive or are told to do so by NHS Test and Trace. \nIn pubs, cafes and restaurants:\nAt music venues/events:\nSome summer festivals are still planning to go ahead as planned, but others have been cancelled altogether, gone online, or been rescheduled.\nOrganisers of the Latitude (late July), Reading and Leeds (late August) festivals say they will \"sell to capacity\" and are not inclined to encourage those attending to wear masks.\nAll parts of Scotland will move to Covid-protection level zero, with a few changes:\nUnder-12s won't count towards group sizes or the number of households.\nThere will be a 400-person limit for indoor events, 1,000 for outdoor standing events and 2,000 for outdoor seated events.\nUntil 19 July, most areas of Scotland are in level 1 or 2. \nLevel two areas:\nLevel one areas:\nScotland is aiming to remove all major legal Covid restrictions by 9 August.\nRestrictions are due to be relaxed on 26 July (subject to approval on 22 July).\nIndoor gigs and concerts will be allowed without noise restrictions, as long as the audience stay in their allocated seats.\nSocial distancing rules will be removed for outdoor events and relaxed indoors.\nUnder current rules:\nAt the moment, up to six people from different households can meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants. \nPeople who do not live together, or are not in bubbles, should remain socially distanced, 2m (6ft) apart.\nBusiness owners are responsible for making their premises as safe as possible:\nThe maximum number of people allowed at outdoor \"regulated gatherings\" - such as festivals and concerts - is 4,000 standing and 10,000 seated. Capacity rules for indoor music and comedy venues have already relaxed a little.\nFrom 17 July, organised indoor events can take place for up to 1,000 seated and up to 200 standing.\nFrom 7 August, if conditions allow, there will be no legal limits on the number of people who can meet others in places like pubs and restaurants. Masks will also no longer be required in hospitality settings. All businesses currently closed - such as nightclubs - will be allowed to reopen subject to ongoing risk assessments. "

      "text": "The outbreak of the Covid-19 variant in south London appears to have been triggered by an individual who travelled from Africa in February, according to documents seen by the BBC.\nSurge testing has begun in Wandsworth and Lambeth after 44 confirmed and 30 probable cases were identified.\nThe country involved was not on the red list for mandatory hotel quarantine at that time, but it is now.\nThe government said \"strong measures\" were in place to find new cases.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman added that the cluster of cases of the South African variant was being taken \"very seriously\" and the \"testing processes that we have in place have been working well\".\nThe link has not been proved beyond doubt, but is the working assumption of contact tracers.\nAn executive summary of the outbreak published on 12 April at 15:00 BST and marked \"Official Sensitive\" said the individual did self-isolate and requested a home test after showing symptoms.\nIt is thought the virus was spread from that individual to members of their household and then to a care home in Lambeth.\nTwenty-three cases of the South African variant were detected in the care home - 13 staff and 10 residents.\nSix of the 10 residents infected had received one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine two or more weeks before their positive test date.\nOne of the 13 infected staff had a single Pfizer vaccine dose two or more weeks before their positive test.\nThe timing may raise questions about the vaccination of care home workers at a time when the government is considering making the jab mandatory for that group.\nOther clusters related to the first outbreak were detected at two primary schools in Wandsworth. \nMore than half of the pupils, teachers and their families who could have taken up extra surge testing made available since the cases came to light have now done so.\nAn examination of wastewater in a small area of nearby Southwark also identified the presence of the South African variant, though that has not yet been linked to the outbreak in Lambeth and Wandsworth. \nTargeted surge testing is expected to be put in place in Southwark as a result.\nThe documents, from the National Covid-19 Response Centre run by the Department of Health, describe the ongoing risk to public health of the outbreak in south London as moderate.\nNHS officials previously described the number of cases identified as \"significant\".\nPeople aged 11 and over who live, work or travel through the affected areas have been urged to take a Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, as well as using twice-weekly rapid testing.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the two boroughs were carrying out the \"largest surge-testing operation to date\", with additional testing sites being opened.\nAccording to government figures, a total of 544 confirmed and probable cases of the variant have been found in the country overall.\nThose living in the affected areas should \"still enjoy the easing of lockdown\", according to the director of public health for Lambeth Council.\nWhen asked on the Today programme whether people in the boroughs should stay at home rather than visit shops or pub gardens, Ruth Hutt replied: \"No, we want everybody to follow the advice that still stands around 'hands, face, space'.\nShannon Katiyo, Wandsworth's director of public health, said it was \"crucial that residents take an asymptomatic PCR test so that we can identify all cases\".\n\"If you test positive by any method, you must isolate in order to prevent passing on the virus,\" she said."

Every day, counter-terrorism teams are identifying and targeting individuals and groups with terrorist intent.\"\nHe added that as coronavirus restrictions were easing and more people were seeing family and friends, going to shops and places to eat, they should be vigilant and report anything suspicious as the threat from terrorism \"has not gone away\"."

He died on 9 March 2021, aged 67. \nHis colleagues thought highly of him, saying: \"We have many happy memories of shifts together, laughs, nights out, and listening to all his stories of his many holidays abroad. We will miss him.\"\nBernadette White, his sister, said he was a caring, gentle and loving man with a wicked sense of humour. \nShe added: \"The last seven years, I would say, is when David started to live his life, doing the things that made him happy without having to worry about anyone else.\"\nStephen Stewart met his future wife, Heather, at a youth club when he was just 14. They got engaged on his 17th birthday and he had just turned 20 when they married. \nThe couple, who lived in Motherwell, came from \"very different\" backgrounds but they grew up together during their 25-year marriage while raising their only child. \nStephen took pride in his work for concrete manufacturer FP McCann, latterly as a lab technician working out what strength the concrete needed to be for certain projects. \nOutside work, he loved fishing, computer games, gadgets and during the first lockdown he managed to build a hot tub shelter with the help of a series of YouTube videos. \nHe died of Covid pneumonia at University Hospital Wishaw on 19 February 2021, aged 45.\nFamily of 45-year-old Covid victim warn of dangers\nNan Douglas worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career. \nShe was already a mother of three when she left her job as a school secretary at West Calder High School to enrol at Moray House in Edinburgh where she qualified as a primary school teacher. \nAfter losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. \nFollowing a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a \"living wake\" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. \nShe lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020.

He retired from his job as a Thomas Cook travel agent and moved to Prestwick in Ayrshire. \nBut he still felt the pull of the Clyde and regularly returned to the city to meet friends and row safety boats at regattas. \nHe died with Covid on 15 February 2021 at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, aged 66, after being admitted for an infection affecting his heart. \nTommy Morrow spent most of his life in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, where he met his partner Jackie and raised their children, Demi and Mark. \nHis family described him as a character and not a day went by without them laughing at his jokes. \nHe loved camping and fishing in places like Stornoway with his friends but the most important people in his life were his family, including grandchildren, Lacey and Louden. \nDuring his career he worked in various well-known hotels and restaurants in Glasgow but he had not worked for some years due to poor health, including COPD. \nHe died with Covid on 15 February 2021, aged 53. \"It was so cruel - he was so close to getting the vaccine,\" his family said. \nTommy Rooney was a bus driver for 36 years and hugely popular with colleagues at First Bus in Larbert. \nOn the day of his funeral they were among dozens of people who lined the streets and applauded as his cortege passed the depot. \nFirst Bus operations manager Jason Hackett told the Falkirk Herald that Tommy was the \"heart and soul\" of the Larbert station. \nMarried to Margaret, the Bonnybridge man had two daughters and a granddaughter who described him as a \"humble but proud family man who put everyone else's needs before his own\". \nAn avid Celtic fan, he spent much of the pandemic driving key workers to their essential duties.

They were tasked to find the most effective way of scaling up action to tackle carbon emissions.\nTheir critics say the best way to cut emissions faster is through technological improvements - not through measures that would prove unpopular. \nBut the lead author of the report, Prof Peter Newell, from Sussex University, told BBC News: \u201cWe are totally in favour of technology improvements and more efficient products - but it\u2019s clear that more drastic action is needed because emissions keep going up.\n\u201cWe have got to cut over-consumption and the best place to start is over-consumption among the polluting elites who contribute by far more than their share of carbon emissions.\n\u201cThese are people who fly most, drive the biggest cars most and live in the biggest homes which they can easily afford to heat, so they tend not to worry if they\u2019re well insulated or not. \n\u201cThey\u2019re also the sort of people who could really afford good insulation and solar panels if they wanted to.\u201d\nProf Newell said that to tackle climate change, everyone needs to feel part of a collective effort \u2013 so that means the rich consuming less to set an example to poorer people.\nHe continued: \u201cRich people who fly a lot may think they can offset their emissions by tree-planting schemes or projects to capture carbon from the air. But these schemes are highly contentious and they\u2019re not proven over time. \nThe wealthy, he said, \u201csimply must fly less and drive less. Even if they own an electric SUV that\u2019s still a drain on the energy system and all the emissions created making the vehicle in the first place\u201d.\nSam Hall, from the Conservative Environment Network, told BBC News: \"It\u2019s right to emphasise the importance of fairness in delivering (emissions cuts) - and policy could make it easier for people and businesses to go green - through incentives, targeted regulation and nudges. \n\u201cBut encouraging clean technologies is likely to be more effective, and more likely to enjoy public consent, than hefty penalties or lifestyle restrictions.\"\nBut Prof Newell said existing political structures allowed wealthy firms and individuals to lobby against necessary changes in society that might erode the lifestyles of the rich. \nThe recent report of the UK Climate Assembly, for example, proposed a series of measures targeting carbon-intensive behaviours such as shifting away from meat and dairy produce; banning the most polluting SUVs; and imposing frequent flyer levies.\nThe Treasury told BBC News that a frequent flyer levy might require the government to collect and store personal information on each passenger. \nThis could raise issues of data processing, handling and privacy issues. It would also be hard to keep track of people with multiple passports.\nBut the commission\u2019s report said: \u201cThe goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change cannot be achieved without radical changes to lifestyles and shifts in behaviour, especially among the wealthiest members of society.\n\u201cIf change across society is to be brought about at the speed and scale required to meet agreed climate targets, we need to shrink and share: reduce carbon budgets and share more equally.\u201d\nThe report is the latest in a long-running dialogue over what it means to be \u201cfair\u201d while tackling climate change.\nPoorer nations such as India have consistently argued that they should be allowed to increase their pollution because it\u2019s so much lower per person than emissions from rich nations.\nThe issue forms part of the tangled tapestry of negotiations behind next week\u2019s climate summit organised by President Biden and the COP climate summit in the UK scheduled for  November. \nFollow Roger on Twitter."

      "text": "Children's Laureate Cressida Cowell has published an open letter asking the prime minister to ringfence \u00a3100m a year to help primary school libraries.\nThe How to Train Your Dragon writer told the BBC she wanted \"something hopeful\" to come out of the \"darkness\" of the pandemic.\n\"If you want to level up, libraries have to be a key part of that.\"\nShe wants funding to be guaranteed for primary school libraries in the way that it is for physical education. \nThe PE premium was introduced in 2013.\n\"It's just as important as sport - it's about children's life chances,\" she said.\n\"Children reading for joy is one of the two key factors in children's future economic success... they will also be healthier and happier.\"\nThe letter has also been signed by former Children's Laureates including Michael Rosen, Quentin Blake and Jacqueline Wilson.\nCowell noted how one in eight primary schools don't have a library. \nThat statistic doubles in schools with a higher proportion of children on free school meals.\nShe also noted that in prisons, libraries are statutory - but not in schools.\n\"Parents don't always realise, it's about awareness. I want all children to have the same chances.\"\nCowell said that pre-pandemic, literacy was \"already a huge problem\" with disadvantaged children being 11 months behind at school.\n\"Post-pandemic, that figure is set to get worse,\" she added.\nIn a statement, Cowell wrote: \"How can a child become a reader for pleasure if their parents or carers cannot afford books, and their primary school has no library, or that library is woefully insufficient?\"\nEarlier this month, Boris Johnson spoke about his concern for thousands of children in the UK who have fallen behind because of lost learning during the pandemic. \nCowell's flagship project during her two-year tenure as Children's Laureate is called \"Life-changing Libraries\".\nOver the course of a year, six primary schools across England - all of which have at least 25% of pupils eligible for free school meals - will be helped to develop a reading for pleasure culture, with the support of Cowell and the charity BookTrust.\nEach school will have a bespoke library space built, with building work set to begin in April ahead of officially opening in June 2021.\nProfessional training will be offered to school staff, and books and other resources will be given including furniture and wall art.\nThe project will monitor the impact on pupils' engagement, attitudes and reading behaviour across 12 months - collecting qualitative stories and case studies.\nCowell said these libraries would be \"like a gold standard... the library that I would really love every school in the country to have\".\nThe schools involved in the project are as follows:\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "US envoy John Kerry is heading to Shanghai to woo China in advance of a climate summit President Joe Biden is hosting next week.\nAfter a major diplomatic row at the UN, both sides hope to co-operate over plans to drastically cut emissions. \nThe US wants China to cease building coal-fired power stations and to stop financing coal ventures abroad.\nChina wants the US to give more cash to developing countries to obtain clean technology and adapt to climate change.\nIt also wants Washington to announce deep cuts in emissions.\nSpeaking to CNN, Mr Kerry said China's co-operation was \"absolutely critical\" to battle the climate crisis.\n\"Yes, we have big disagreements with China on some key issues, absolutely. But climate has to stand alone.\"\nHe is hoping to salvage the superpower relationship to allow progress at President Biden\u2019s virtual summit on 22 and 23 April. \nScientists warn that without an agreement between the world\u2019s great polluters there\u2019s little chance of averting dangerous climate change.\nBernice Lee, a China expert at the UK think tank Chatham House, said: \u201cThis is good news.  At least they\u2019re talking in the run-up to the summit. There will be big issues for both sides to resolve. But they must be resolved.\"\nNeither party has formally declared its climate masterplan to the UN, and each is struggling to coax more concessions from the other.\nThe US was absent from climate negotiations during President Donald Trump\u2019s term of office and it is now being urged to cut emissions to between 57%-63% below 2005 levels this decade. \nPresident Biden is expected to declare the formal US offer before, or at, next week\u2019s summit.\nChina, meanwhile, has pledged to peak its emissions by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 (that means cutting out all carbon emissions from fossil fuels but still allowing farm emissions of methane \u2013 another planet-heating gas).\nIt will be pressed to explain the policies that will achieve those targets.\nByford Tsang from the think tank E3G told BBC News: \u201cThe US has been pushing Japan and South Korea to end overseas coal finance. It will also be pressing the Chinese to stop constructing coal plants in their Belt and Road initiative.\n\"It will also want action on China\u2019s domestic coal use. China is operating half the world\u2019s coal capacity \u2013 and it\u2019s still been expanding despite the pandemic.\u201d\nThe Belt and Road initiative is a sweeping Chinese infrastructure project aimed at expanding global trade links.\nThe US will also hope to persuade President Xi to attend next week\u2019s virtual summit. Forty world leaders have been invited, including Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.\nThe summit is a key milestone ahead of the UN climate Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow this November.\nClimate scientists warn that global heating needs to be kept well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aim for an increasingly ambitious 1.5C goal, to avoid the worst of climate breakdown.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

      "text": "Boris Johnson must launch a \"full\" inquiry into David Cameron's attempts to lobby ministers on behalf of a finance firm, Labour has said.\nThe ex-prime minister's work for Greensill Capital has been heavily criticised, with a government-backed investigation set up.\nMr Johnson said this would have \"carte blanche\" to \"ask anybody\" the questions that needed to be answered.\nBut Labour said the probe had \"all the hallmarks of a Conservative cover-up\".\nMr Cameron, who started work for Greensill Capital in 2018 - two years after leaving Downing Street - contacted several ministers on its behalf, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\nThe contacts related to government loans during the pandemic.\nMr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying - attempts to influence government policy - and that he welcomes the investigation launched by Mr Johnson.\nLawyer Nigel Boardman will step aside from his government job to lead the review, focusing on the government's use of supply-chain finance, a technique in which Greensill Capital specialised. \nA Cabinet Office spokesperson said it would look \"especially\" at the role played in government by the company, and its founder Alexander \"Lex\" Greensill, who gave Mr Cameron a job after he had left office.\nThe review will not have legal powers and is understood to be likely to produce \"findings\" rather than recommendations. It will report back to the PM in June.\nInstead of this, Labour wants 16 MPs from different parties to form a special committee and spend eight months examining Mr Cameron's contact with government, and wider rules on lobbying. \nThe party plans to use a Commons debate on Wednesday to force a vote on the issue. \nThe prime minister said Mr Boardman would be given \"pretty much carte blanche to ask anybody whatever he needs to find out\".\n\"I would like it to done quickly, but I want him to have the maximum possible access so we can understand exactly what's happened,\" he added.\nAsked about Mr Cameron's behaviour, he replied: \"That's a matter for Nigel Boardman.\"\nBusiness Minister Paul Scully answered a Commons question from Labour on Greensill Capital on Tuesday.\nThe government said Mr Scully was appearing before MPs because his department - rather than Mr Sunak's Treasury - was responsible for a loan scheme at the centre of the row.\nLabour accused the chancellor of \"running scared of scrutiny\", but a Treasury source said the opposition had failed to \"grasp how these loan schemes work\". \nGreensill Capital was approved as a lender under the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Scheme, launched at the start of the crisis. \nBut the British Business Bank, which vetted lenders for the scheme, said on Tuesday it had not been approached by Mr Cameron on behalf of the company. \nLabour is pushing ministers to explain Mr Cameron's role in trying to involve Greensill in a separate Covid loan scheme run by the Bank of England.\nMr Cameron texted and phoned Mr Sunak to ask him to broaden the scope of the Covid Corporate Finance Facility (CCFF) so Greensill could be allowed to take part.\nMr Sunak has released two text replies to Mr Cameron, in which he told the former Tory leader that Greensill's proposals were not possible but he had \"pushed\" officials to explore alternatives.\nThe firm's bid to be included in the CCFF scheme was eventually rejected.\nBut Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said Mr Sunak's replies suggested \"the door seemed to be open for Greensill and David Cameron\". \nLabour is also calling on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to reveal all his contact with Mr Cameron, after it was revealed had had met the former PM and Mr Greensill for a \"private drink\" in 2019 to discuss a new payment scheme for the NHS.\nGreensill Capital's app, which allowed staff to be paid early for hours they had already worked, went on to be used by some NHS Trusts.\nMr Hancock said ministers had not been \"involved\" in NHS decisions to use the app and confirmed that he had attended a \"social meeting organised by the former prime minister\" and reported it to officials \"in the normal way\"."

      "text": "Trafalgar Square has been earmarked as the preferred location for a Uefa Euro 2020 fan park.\nLondon will be one of 12 cities hosting the European Championship, which has been delayed by a year because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nPlans include all seven games, to be played at Wembley Stadium, being shown on giant TV screens in central London.\nThere are also outline proposals for screens to show a \"victory parade\" should England win the tournament.\nGareth Southgate's side will play all three group matches at Wembley, the first against Croatia on 13 June.\nFive days later England take on Scotland for the first time since 2017, before hosting the Czech Republic in their final group game on 22 June.\nAll three England group games will be screened in Trafalgar Square, if the Greater London Authority (GLA) plans are approved.\nWembley will also host one last 16 tie, as well as both semi-finals and the final on 11 July.\nShould England progress to the knockout stages, they would play their last 16 and quarter-final ties abroad, but the proposals allow for both to also be screened in Trafalgar Square.\nThe GLA planning application seeks a capacity of up to 12,500 people for the fan park - with free tickets being allocated through a ballot.\nThe plans are subject to a licensing application which will be heard at Westminster City Council later this month.\nAnd despite the easing of Covid restrictions, the GLA accepts that due to uncertainties around the virus, details of the event may change.\nUnder the Prime Minister's roadmap out of lockdown, social distancing measures and limits of people gathering outdoors will still be in place for England's first two group games.\nDiscussions of plans for the fan park began in August 2020 with Westminster City Council. A separate meeting with the Met Police has also taken place, the BBC understands.\nAdditional proposals for a Uefa Euro 2020 Football Village at Potters Fields Park, near City Hall and Tower Bridge, are also being considered.\nPreviously, Greenwich Park was going to be used as the official fan park, had the tournament been able to go ahead as scheduled last year."
