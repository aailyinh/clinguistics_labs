      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The European Commission has published its contract with drug-maker AstraZeneca to buy the company's Covid vaccine, amid a row over supplies.\nThe move, agreed with AstraZeneca, came hours after Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen increased pressure on the firm over its decision to cut supplies.\nThe contract signed in August contained \"binding orders\", she told German radio, and called for an explanation. \nThe vaccine was approved by the EU medicines regulator on Friday.\nThe EU wanted to publish the contract to bolster its argument that the company had reneged on its commitments. \nThe company's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said in an interview earlier this week that the contract obliged AstraZeneca to make its \"best effort\" to meet EU demand, without compelling the company to stick to a specific timetable.\nLarge sections of the contract have been blanked out - redacted - to protect sensitive information.\nThese include some paragraphs dealing with costs, guaranteed delivery dates and intellectual property.\nThe August deal was for 300 million doses for the EU, to be delivered after regulatory approval, with an option for 100 million more. \nBut EU sources say they now expect to get only about a quarter of the 100 million vaccines they were expecting to receive by March, a shortfall of about 75 million jabs.\nThe EU is under pressure after criticism that the pace of vaccinations in several member states has been too slow. \nAstraZeneca says the production problems are at its plants in the Netherlands and Belgium.\nSupplies of another vaccine, produced by Pfizer-BioNTech, have also dropped due to production issues.  \nEU officials say AstraZeneca has been asked to send some doses manufactured in the UK to the continent to make up the shortfall, but the company said on Wednesday that its contract for UK supplies prevented this.\nAn EU source familiar with the talks told the BBC that AstraZeneca's UK facilities were obliged to supply vaccine to the EU.\n\"This is not an option, it is a contractual obligation\u2026 a declaration by AstraZeneca as to where the drug substance manufacturing will take place.\" The UK plants are not back-up facilities; they are part of the main network, the source added.\n\"There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear,\" Mrs von der Leyen said in Friday morning's radio interview. \n\"'Best effort' was valid while it was still unclear whether they could develop a vaccine. That time is behind us. The vaccine is there. \n\"AstraZeneca has also explicitly assured us in this contract that no other obligations would prevent the contract from being fulfilled,\" she said. \nThe BBC's Europe correspondent, Gavin Lee, says it may come down to specialist legal interpretation, and some fine tooth-combing, to understand who's right.\nAstraZeneca has found itself in a deeply uncomfortable position in this fight over vaccine supply.\nThe heavily redacted publication - agreed by both sides - of its contract with the EU does not settle the issue of who is at fault.\nAs one source told me - \"Neither side would have published this if either side thought it was legally conclusive. AstraZeneca are working hard to find a solution to a row that serves no-one\".\nThe problem with vaccine production is that it is a biological process that can't be hurried. \nA source close to the company said they knew vaccine nationalism was a danger. That's why, they claim, different contracts were tied to separate manufacturing bases. That is disputed by the EU. \nSo what happens next? The thought of going to court horrifies everyone involved; a needless and unseemly sideshow in the face of the real battle against the virus.\nBut suggestions that UK manufactured vaccines would be redirected to EU countries were downplayed by company insiders.\nOne final thought expressed was that while it was convenient for the European Commission to cast AstraZeneca as the villain - that would only work for so long, before member states started directing their displeasure at the Commission itself.\nA spokesman for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson would not comment on Friday on any contractual arrangements between the UK and AstraZeneca, or whether they may conflict with the company's agreement with the EU.\nThe spokesman said only that the UK remained \"confident in our supply of vaccines\" and that it was committed to its vaccine rollout plan.\nBut EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders has warned of a \"vaccine war\". \nSpeaking on Belgian radio, he said: \"The EU Commission has pushed to co-ordinate the vaccines contracts on behalf of the 27 precisely to avoid a vaccines war between EU countries, but maybe the UK wants to start a vaccine war?\n\"Solidarity is an important principle of the EU. With Brexit, it's clear that the UK doesn't want to show solidarity with anyone.\"\nOn Friday, the EU confirmed it was introducing export controls on coronavirus vaccines made in the bloc, to try to ease the shortfalls.\nVaccinations in parts of Europe are already being held up and in some cases halted because of a cut in deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Merthyr Tydfil,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 10 cases of the South African coronavirus variant identified in Wales, a senior official has said.\nWales' Chief Scientific Adviser Dr Rob Orford said all had been cases recorded in people who had travelled abroad.\nThere are concerns vaccines may not work as well against the variant.\nIt comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that UK nationals and residents returning from a 'red list' of Covid hotspots will have to quarantine in a hotel.\nThe Welsh Government says the move does not go far enough.\nAt least 77 cases of the South Africa variant have been identified in the UK.\nMeanwhile the overall seven-day coronavirus case rate has fallen in Wales to 203.8 cases for every 100,000 individuals - down from 650 before Christmas.\nIt is the lowest point since late November.\nCovid-19 case rates in south Wales in particular have been showing improvements in the last couple of weeks, as lockdown restrictions appear to be having an effect.\nPublic Health Wales said it was confident there was a \"consistent downward\" trend, although numbers were still high and putting pressures on hospitals.\nThe south Wales valleys, Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot have perhaps seen the most dramatic reductions.\nThese include areas which recorded the highest case rates in the UK before Christmas.\nMerthyr Tydfil continues to fall from a peak of 1,349 cases per 100,000 and the UK's highest a week before Christmas. It now has less than 200 cases per 100,000 for the first time since September.\nThere has been a large fall in case rates in Blaenau Gwent as well - from 1,020 cases per 100,000 in mid-December to its lowest rate since early October.\nThere are also encouraging signs in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), where the case rate has dropped below 200 per 100,000 - also its lowest point since September.\nIn Bridgend, the case rate peaked just before Wales was put into a pre-Christmas lockdown on 18 December.\nBut it has fallen back sharply and is just under 226 cases per 100,000 for the first time since the end of November. Its positivity rate has also dropped to below 17%.\nSimilar patterns can be seen in Neath Port Talbot (NPT) - at its lowest point for case rates since mid-October.\nDespite the figures, Chief Medical Officer Frank Atherton said his current advice is that the headroom to relax restrictions is \"really quite limited\".\n\"The emergence of these new variants pose new challenges for us,\" added Dr Orford at Wednesday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, \"because of their potential to alter the course of the pandemic\".\n\"The concern is that a new variant will emerge that won't respond to treatment and vaccines, putting us back to where we began.\"\nThree variants from South Africa and Brazil are being monitored, he said.\nThe Kent strain - which was identified in the UK and is thought to be more contagious - is the dominant strain across Wales, Dr Orford said.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson had said that early evidence suggested it may be more deadly.\nDr Orford did not refer to the prime minister, but he said three studies looking at death rates had \"not been able to say that definitively\".\nHe also said the Kent variant does not appear to have more impact on young and healthy people.\n\"It doesn't seem to have any difference in the way it infects people across the ages, which is really positive\", he said.\nDr Atherton said it is believed that the R number - the rate that coronavirus reproduces - is below 1 - between 0.7 and 0.9.\nHe said that means the size of the current outbreak is \"shrinking rather than growing\", but he said rates were still \"way too high\".\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford is expected to announce the outcome of a 21-day review of lockdown restrictions on Friday.\nBut Dr Atherton said towards the end of February would be the \"time to think about further relaxations\".\n\"We will look again at where we are with community transmission, where we are with the NHS capacity and the business of the NHS, and where we are with vaccination,\" he said.\nA total of 312,305 people have been given their first dose in Wales - 9.9% of the population.\nDr Atherton said the Welsh Government was on course to meet the target of vaccinating everyone in the four priority groups by mid-February.\nThe medical adviser said lessons had to be learned from how restrictions were eased before.\nDr Atherton added: \"What I do say to the first minister and health minister is that we need to learn from what happened when we came out of previous lockdowns - the first lockdown in March, the firebreak in November.\n\"What we saw there was even though rates had come down quite well when we released things, we released them in a way which allowed the virus to re-establish itself very, very quickly.\"\nThe encouraging news from the scientists is that lockdown is working and infection rates are steadily decreasing - so the sacrifices so many people are making are having an impact.  \nBut Frank Atherton made clear he had told ministers, in advance of the latest lockdown review, that there was little room for manoeuvre.\nWhy? First, although the position is much better now than in the spring, infection rates, and positivity rates are still too high.\nThe other big issue is the prevalence of variants. The so called Kent-variant is now dominant across most of Wales, it spreads more easily.\nAlso 10 cases of the South African variant have been confirmed here, and that's a strain which is also causing a lot of concern internationally. \nThe fear is if restrictions are eased too quickly the presence of these variants could make it even more likely that infection could spiral out of control.\nAsked whether he regretted any of the advise he had given in light of the milestone of 100,000 deaths across the UK, the chief medical officer said: \"It took a while for us to learn about the virus.\"\nDr Atherton said different decisions would have been made on protecting care home residents earlier in the pandemic had it been known Covid-19 behaved very differently from flu.\nBut he said he did not think it \"was a mistake\" but was the \"limits of what we knew\".\n\"We started off treating it rather as we treated pandemic flu,\" he said.\n\"This virus has behaved very differently,\" he said. \"I think, had we known that, we would have made some different decisions about, you know, looking after people in care homes.\""

      "title": "Coronavirus: Virus provides leaps in scientific understanding",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "In January 2020, two scientists published the entire genetic code of a coronavirus that was soon to wreak havoc around the world. It marked the start of a year of intense and rapid scientific endeavour, to work out how we might fight the virus.\nEddie Holmes had the genetic blueprint for the coronavirus in his possession for exactly 52 minutes before he put it online.\nProf Holmes is based at the University of Sydney, where he works on the emergence of infectious disease - an area of research that was suddenly thrust into the spotlight at the beginning of 2020. He has worked closely, for several years, with Prof Yong-Zhen Zhang, who was at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control in Beijing.\nProf Zhang sequenced the genome of the virus that closed down the world. \nHe collected samples taken from some of the first patients in Wuhan Central Hospital, where a cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases had emerged. Many of those patients had a link to a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. \nWhen he examined the code, Prof Zhang immediately saw that this was a coronavirus. It looked very similar to Sars - the respiratory disease that caused a deadly outbreak in Asia in 2002.\n\"That was on 5 January,\" recalls Prof Holmes. \"And we just thought,oh no. It's Sars back again.\"\nBut this code - this virus - was different. It was new. Prof Zhang and Prof Holmes quickly submitted a paper describing what they had seen and, as the week wore on, a buzz of public health speculation about what the novel virus might be started on social media.\n\"I didn't sleep,\" Prof Holmes tells me. \"It was weighing on my conscience.\" In Sydney, it was early on 11 January when Prof Holmes phoned his colleague in China and asked his permission to publish the sequence. \"Zhang was on a plane, strapped into his seat,\" Prof Holmes recalled. \"He told me he needed to think about it - there was some pressure not to release too much information about the outbreak.\n\"He called me back about a minute later and said, 'OK, let's do it.'\"\nA researcher in Prof Zhang's lab emailed the genetic code to Eddie Holmes, who called a colleague in Edinburgh, in the UK. \"It was about 01:00 there,\" Prof Holmes recalls. \nIn the ensuing 52 minutes, the scientists together wrote a brief post explaining that they were \"releasing a coronavirus genome from a case of a respiratory disease from the Wuhan outbreak\" and uploaded the code. Their post said that researchers should please \"feel free to download, share, use and analyse this data\".\nWith that post, the full genome of Sars CoV-2 - the code that makes the coronavirus - was available to any scientist with an internet connection.\nIt set off 12 months of break-neck scientific endeavour. If you search the US National Library of Medicine - a database of published medical science studies - for mentions of Covid-19, you will retrieve more than 90,000 results. \n\"If we didn't collaborate with colleagues in China - if I wasn't working with and talking to Zhang - that sequence wouldn't have gone online as early as it did,\" says Prof Holmes.\nThat same weekend, scientists at a US pharmaceutical company called Moderna, which had never previously brought a product to market, downloaded the genome and started work on their experimental vaccine. Scientists at Pfizer did the same.\nThere are multiple methods - traditional and experimental - for making vaccines, but Moderna and Pfizer use an experimental approach based on something called mRNA (or Messenger ribonucleic acid). The terminology is a mouthful, but it describes a simpler, swifter approach to vaccine production. And it was boosted over the clinical finish line by the pandemic.   \nVaccination is fundamentally based on \"showing\" your immune system the disease-causing agent, so it can form a biological memory and be primed to fight it. For many existing virus vaccines, this has meant producing versions or pieces of the virus itself - often snippets of viral protein stripped of their disease-causing ability. These are grown inside chicken eggs, packaged up and injected.\n\"To grow enough of those things can take a very long time - sometimes years,\" explains Prof Robert Langer, one of the founders of Moderna, and a professor of chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US. \"With mRNA - you use the body as a factory to make that protein. So rather than have a giant plant with all these eggs to grow your proteins, you just make the mRNA, give it to the patient and the patient does everything else.\"\nMessenger RNA is a short sequence of coded genetic instructions for the protein you want a cell to make.\n\"I've been working on this technology for decades,\" says Prof Langer. \"This is actually the ninth mRNA vaccine that Moderna has developed.\" The others, which include vaccines that are designed to prime people's immune systems to fight their own cancer, are still in clinical trials.\n\"But when the pandemic hit, this technology lent itself to doing things as rapidly as possible.\"\nThere are now more than 150 coronavirus vaccines in some stage of development. But Pfizer's mRNA vaccine, which it developed in partnership with the German company BioNTech, was the first to receive emergency authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration. It was quickly followed by Moderna's vaccine - less than a year after scientists first downloaded the genome it was based on.\nIt was not until the end of January that the World Health Organization called the coronavirus outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern\". And it took until March for the WHO to officially declare a pandemic. Efforts to understand the virus - to find out where it came from, how to treat it and learn how it was evolving - were already moving almost as rapidly as the pandemic.\n\"With that genome, we didn't need the actual virus,\" explains Dr Dalan Bailey from the UK's Pirbright Institute. \"We could take that code and actually get the part of the virus that we wanted to study synthesised [using the genome as a blueprint] and have it in our lab within days.\n\"That definitely allowed us to start our research much more quickly.\"\nDr Bailey and his colleagues study how exactly the coronavirus latches on to and hijacks each cell. Key to this are those spikes we now see on every graphic depiction of the spherical coronavirus structure. Not only is the spike protein the key that unlocks viral entry into a cell, it is also the part of the virus that is most frequently recognised by our immune systems, so understanding its shape and its function is critical to optimising vaccines.  \nBy the end of March, with many European countries in lockdown, Chinese scientists had mapped the exact atom-by-atom structure of that spike protein.\nKnowing what the protein physically looks like means researchers can work out how antibodies bind to it. That is critical, because antibodies are the immune system's memory proteins. Immune cells produce antibodies to fit a specific invader - a virus that they have previously encountered in the form of a vaccine, perhaps. The antibodies then latch onto it and tag it for destruction. \"So this ultimately helps us design better vaccines,\" explained Dr Bailey.\nThroughout summer months in the northern hemisphere, lockdowns (temporarily and patchily) eased, but international tension did not. Even as US President Donald Trump sought to blame China for \"unleashing a plague\", scientists in the US and China carried on working together. By June, scientists from both countries had collaborated on more than 120 Covid-19 studies.\nPresident Jair Bolsanaro of Brazil, which remains one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, made baseless, very unscientific claims that Brazilians were somehow \"immune\" to the disease. Meanwhile, scientists there were reported to be subsidising their own Covid research amid a national funding crisis. \nOne large international effort, called the Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative, saw investigators from research centres in Europe, Asia, and North America share data on how our own genes might affect how sick the coronavirus makes us.\nThere is no single, simple answer to the question of why some people have no symptoms at all, while others are made extremely ill by Covid-19. But many of these efforts to solve that puzzle have focused on the \"lock\" on our cells that the virus uses to gain access.\nIt is called the Ace-2 receptor. It is a biological lock that has evolved to be opened by chemical keys that occur naturally. That mechanism is fundamental to the biochemical machinery that is constantly whirring in healthy cells. Ace-2, for example, can be used as a cellular doorway by proteins that regulate our blood pressure. \nThe coronavirus, however, has cleverly (and unfortunately) evolved to fit that same lock.\nLike every building block of our bodies, the exact shape and function of our Ace-2 receptors is written in our genes, giving researchers valuable clues about who is most vulnerable to Covid-19.\nWhile there is no single coded clue to predict how sick we might be made by Covid, several studies of patients have spotted differences in the genetic blueprint for an individual's Ace-2 receptor that might be linked with the severity of their illness.\nOne intriguing genetic study by German and Japanese scientists showed that a gene that we inherited from Neanderthals provides the code for an extra  \"biological doorway\" that the virus can use to hijack our cells.\nExamining the shape of the Ace-2 receptor in other species is also providing clues about other animals that might be susceptible to the coronavirus. That knowledge will be crucial in future efforts to control the disease and prevent new strains, like the one detected in farmed mink in Denmark, from triggering further outbreaks. \nIn the midst of the pandemic, the search for any potential treatments relied, for the most part, on repurposing existing drugs. By examining treatments that were already proven safe, and by looking at the way they worked, researchers had reason to believe they had a good chance of tackling Covid. With no specific treatments available and thousands of patients critically ill, this was emergency medical research. \nIn May, the UK launched the world's largest clinical trial, called Recovery, to test a group of existing treatments.\nThere have been mixed results, but in June, this trial provided a breakthrough - the first evidence that dexamethasone, a cheap and widely available steroid, could reduce deaths from Covid-19. Another trial being carried out in six countries, including the UK, recently revealed another two existing drugs that could save yet more lives.\nIn the long term, many scientists think we face a world where the coronavirus is always present in the global population at some level. \"So we'll also need new drugs to target not only this virus, but other related viruses that could spill over in the same way,\" Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist from the University of Leeds, explains.\nOne line of attack that looks particularly promising is a group of drugs called protease inhibitors.\n\"The main aim every virus has when it enters a cell is to hijack it and use the machinery inside to copy itself thousands and millions of times over,\" explains Dr Griffin. To do this, the virus tricks the cell into making its own viral building blocks, or proteins.\nSome of the most important viral proteins are made as one, long chain - like a long roll of tape. So the virus also makes an enzyme called a protease that snips the sections of tape it needs to build functioning copies of itself.\n\"Protease is critical for the virus to thrive and drugs targeting it prevent some of the earliest stages of infection - stopping the virus from copying itself,\" Dr Griffin explains. Similar drugs are already successfully used against protease enzymes from HIV and hepatitis C.\nFor many countries in the northern hemisphere, outbreaks resurged through autumn and into winter. Scientists have, meanwhile, tracked the virus's every move and every mutation.\nBy taking a swab from an infected patient, the genetic code of the exact version of the virus that has infected them can be extracted, amplified and \"read\" using a sequencer, which is a machine that can translate biological code into a string of letters, or nucleotides. That allows whole genomes to be compared, so specific mutations can be spotted.\n\"There are also huge ongoing efforts to both track mutations and to assess their impact,\" Dr Lucy van Dorp from University College London (UCL) explains. It was \"thanks to these efforts, and to UK testing laboratories, that the recently discovered UK variant was flagged so quickly as a potential cause of concern\".\nViruses mutate all the time, as they make copies of themselves in millions of infected bodies. But understanding which versions of the virus are spreading most quickly - spotting patterns in that spread - has informed public health responses and transformed contact tracing.\nIn countries like New Zealand, where small, specific outbreaks have been found and brought under control, contact tracers can examine and compare genomes for clues. This is how so-called superspreading events are picked up - when a cluster of infections all share the same code.  \nResearchers have now sequenced more than 250,000 Sars-CoV-2 genomes, which have been shared on open data platforms like Next Strain. \"This is all going to feed into the vaccine design, as well,\" says Prof Eddie Holmes, the Sydney-based scientist who put the first viral genome online. The mRNA vaccines, in particular, are easily adaptable with a new set of genetic instructions.\nDespite being able to watch it spread and evolve almost in real time, researchers still have not pinned down where the virus came from.\nScientists agree that, like ebola, Mers and Sars1, the coronavirus originated in wildlife. But most experts also agree that the animal that the virus initially \"spilled over\" from was not in that Wuhan seafood market.  \nProf Holmes now thinks Wuhan was an \"amplification\" point for the virus, rather than being the origin. But there are different expert views on how the virus made the jump from bats to humans, and the lack of direct evidence currently makes solving that epidemiological puzzle almost impossible.\nChinese officials have concluded the outbreak is likely to have begun elsewhere, and that the crowded market simply helped spread the disease from person to person. \"It could have come from almost anywhere in China, quite frankly,\" says Prof Holmes, \"because Wuhan is a major travel hub.\"\nThat outstanding mystery made it all the more disappointing for infectious disease experts when China recently blocked the entry of a WHO team that was poised to spend weeks examining the evidence from those earliest cases. But connecting all the threads - from the earliest known cases of Covid all the way back to the original source of the outbreak - could take years, not weeks. \nWhile the coronavirus genetic code still cannot tell us exactly how the pandemic started, it does show that the virus came from bats. Genetically similar viruses - probable coronavirus ancestors - have been found in colonies of bats elsewhere in China. Emerging disease researchers agree that these animals were the likely original \"reservoir\" for the disease. But there is a gap - possibly of decades of viral mutation and evolution - between those bat viruses and the one that is now still wreaking havoc among humans.\nDr Polly Hayes from the University of Westminster explains that the coronavirus could have been initially harmless when it made the first jump into humans \"then... evolved to become harmful as it passed from person to person\".\nTo answer all of those remaining questions and to have a better chance of preventing the next pandemic, Prof Holmes stresses, channels of communication between scientists in every country must remain open.\n\"Politics can't come into it,\" he adds. \"Otherwise the world will be a far less safe place. I think preventing the next pandemic will be partly about fantastic, whizz-bang technology like genome sequencing and mRNA.\n\"But it's more importantly about people, scientists, talking to each other freely and openly.\"\nAdditional reporting by Helen Briggs.

      "text": "The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000.\nA further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for \"every single life that has been lost\" during the pandemic.\n\"Today we reached a sobering milestone,\" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. \"That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving.\"\nIt comes on the same day as it is confirmed that more than 600,000 people in Wales - 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine.\nThe PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500.\n\"I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,\" said Mr Gething.\nHe said those that died were not \"just numbers\", adding: \"These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind.\"\nHe said there was no \"good\" or \"bad\" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic.\nHe added: \"I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one.\"\nDr Shankar urged everyone \"whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity\" to have the vaccine when offered it.\nVaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about \"good\" and \"bad\" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point.\nIt's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures.\nBut of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. \nInternational comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. \nThere will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns.\nBut with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry.\nThe worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - the worst week was also last month - and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December.\nHospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients.\nWales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October.\nMr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic.\nHe said there were \"different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time\".\nBut he added ministers had \"never said\" that if coronavirus \"arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it\". \nMr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the \"reasonable worst case scenario\" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and \"nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales\".\nMr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that \"individual burial may no longer be possible\" but said \"we haven't reached that scenario in reality\".\nBut he said those plans \"show how much worse this could have been\".\nWelsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a \"grim milestone\", adding: \"We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones.\"\nHe said the \"consistency around the messaging\" was something that he regretted and it wasn't \"clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic\", with some confused by \"unnecessary divergences\" between governments.\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown \"harder and earlier\" in March 2020.\nHowever he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the \"fantastic\" improvement in the vaccination rate.\nThe health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, that more lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlier at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\nOffice for National Statistics (ONS) figures include all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed - and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes.\nPublic Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test.\nUnder the ONS figures, Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago.\nIt is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor.\nThe ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday.\nOf the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay.\nThere were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670.\nMore than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab.\nOf those, 2,792 have had a second dose.\nThe case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months.\nFlintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people.\nWrexham's rate now stands at 229.5.\nThe areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70.\nSince the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Homeschooling,Coronavirus pandemic,Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge",
      "text": "The Duchess of Cambridge has said the challenges of parenting and home schooling during lockdown have left her \"exhausted\". \nDuring a video call with a group of parents Catherine also joked about her three children recoiling in \"horror\" when she had to cut their hair. \nAsked to rate her maths ability, the duchess scored herself minus five. \nShe urged people \"to reach out to loved ones and friends\" if they were struggling or feeling isolated. \nCatherine took part in the discussion with three parents, whose children attend Roe Green Junior School in Kingsbury, north-west London, alongside head teacher Melissa Loosemore, on Tuesday. \nAs part of a \"show and tell\" exercise during the call, Ms Loosemore asked the group to write down \"one word that describes parenting during this pandemic\". \nThe duchess chose the word \"exhausting\", while the other parents had similar feelings, writing \"hectic\", \"patience\" and \"challenging\".\nExplaining her decision, Catherine said: \"I think as parents you've the day-to-day elements of being a parent, but I suppose during lockdown we have had to take on additional roles that perhaps others in our communities, or in our lives, would have perhaps supported us and helped us with.\"\nShe added: \"I've become a hairdresser this lockdown, much to my children's horror, seeing mum cutting hair.\n\"We've had to become a teacher - and I think, personally, I feel pulled in so many different directions and you try your best with everything, but at the end of the day I do feel exhausted.\"\nParent Nicole Seidemann, who has four children aged 11, nine, six and four, agreed with the duchess' comments, saying she was \"definitely a full-time teacher right now and struggling to do much else\".\nIn another exercise, the parents were asked to write down who had been their support during the pandemic, with Catherine choosing her husband, William. \nBack in April, the duchess described home schooling her children - Prince George, seven, Princess Charlotte, five, and Prince Louis, two - as \"challenging\" but said they had kept to a \"strict routine\". \nCatherine has previously highlighted the impact of lockdown on parents through her work on early childhood development, with research from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Royal Foundation finding loneliness among parents of young children had \"dramatically increased\" during the pandemic.

      "text": "Disadvantaged families are being \"locked out\" of education as they cannot afford the costs of online learning, children's charities say.\nBarnardo's chief executive Javed Khan said \"urgent action\" was needed to make internet access more affordable.\nOfcom said 6% of UK families struggled with broadband costs, while 5% could not afford their mobile bills.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) said it had delivered 54,000 4G routers to low-income families.\nA government scheme to distribute one million laptops to schoolchildren had delivered 801,524 machines as of 17 January, but many are still unable to get online while schools are shut during the pandemic.\nAn Ofcom report from 2020 estimates between 1.m and 1.8m children do not have access to a laptop, desktop or tablet at home.\nLow-income households are also less likely to have an internet connection in their home, instead relying on expensive mobile phone data packages at a time when paying for weekly food and heating bills is already extremely challenging. \nMr Khan said: \"With some families facing the choice between heating and eating, and now trying to afford data too - we need urgent action to support those suffering most during the crisis.\"\nKatie Schmuecker, from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: \"For people in poverty, high costs and low incomes can mean internet access is out of reach, or incredibly expensive when accessed through pay-as-you-go [mobile data] tariffs. \n\"This leaves children locked out of an education.\"  \nThe BBC's Make a Difference campaign aims to bring communities together to make a difference closer to home via your local radio stations.\nIts laptop project has seen 17,645 devices donated since its launch on 7 January, with a further 30,000 devices pledged by businesses across England. \nThe campaign has also raised \u00a3700,535 which has been donated to charities and schools, from local businesses, trusts, individuals and foundations.\nTwins Alawia and Khadijia Adam, 10, from Easton in Bristol, said getting online at home during lockdown had been a struggle.\nThey had been relying on paper hand-outs from school but were recently donated a laptop via the BBC's Make A Difference campaign.\nAlawia said: \"It made a big impact on our lives - you can get more work done - live lessons are amazing, actually.\n\"Sometimes we do fun stuff and we can see our teacher on the online lessons.\n\"You get more education and more work done.\"\nKhadijia said: \"I want to be a doctor and so I have to work really hard on focusing more on my work and having these laptops really helps my education.\"\nKhaedra Siyad from Easton, Bristol, said she could not afford the broadband and data needed to home-school her seven children.\nShe said: \"They say 'I'm bored - I don't have anything - I don't have the internet or a computer'.\"\n\"It's very, very hard - the internet is the food money I don't have.\" \nTheir family has since also received a laptop via the scheme.\nIn the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, the dairy-farming Bennett family struggle to connect to the internet.\nFor their children, Drew and Megan, home-schooling is a struggle and they cannot get 4G reception, so live lessons are out of the question.\nMegan, eight, cannot watch any video learning sent by her teachers.\nHer mother Lisa, 38, said: \"We can't get on to a Zoom session so each week both children don't get to do any of the live lessons or links to tutorial videos that they could watch, it's paper printed-out stuff.\"\nSome broadband providers - such as BT, KCOM and Virgin Media - offer cheaper tariffs to help customers on low incomes and there are also efforts to \"zero-rate\" educational websites, so that accessing them does not use up valuable data.\nAnti-poverty charities want more to be done to prevent pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds falling behind in their education. \nVictoria Benson, chief executive of Gingerbread, a charity that supports single-parent families, said: \"Almost half of single-parent families already live in poverty.\n\"This means they simply can't afford costly broadband contracts or additional data for children to take part in online lessons.\" \nHelen Milner, CEO of Good Things Foundation, said: \"Covid-19 has exacerbated a digital divide that was already there - in education, but also for parents and adults. \n\"Devices are important but people also need connectivity and basic digital skills for life and work, with community-based support. \n\"Nine million people are unable to use the internet to its full potential, and are being left behind.\"\nA DfE spokesman said the government had partnered with leading mobile network operators to provide free data to low-income families.\nHe added: \"The country's major telecommunications providers are also working to make it easier for families to access selected educational resources by temporarily exempting them from data charges\n\"Where pupils continue to experience barriers to digital remote education, we expect schools to work to overcome these barriers.\n\"This could include distributing school-owned laptops and providing printed resources, such as textbooks and workbooks, to structure learning, supplemented with other forms of communication to keep pupils on track or answer questions about work.\"\nA number of charities and groups are collecting unwanted laptops and tablets for schoolchildren to use at home.\nMany schools are accepting equipment directly, but local BBC radio stations are also helping to coordinate donations by liaising with organisations across the UK.\nTo donate a device, visit the Make a Difference website and click \"Give A Laptop\" where you will find an ever-growing list of charities that can help."

      "text": "Most curbs to people's daily lives have been lifted as Wales moves to the lowest level of Covid rules.\nRules limiting socialising in pubs, bars and restaurants have been removed, while nightclubs are able to reopen for the first time since measures brought in to tackle the spread of Omicron were introduced after Christmas.\nSocial distancing rules were also scrapped as Wales moved into alert level zero on 28 January.\nPeople who test positive for Covid must now isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nHowever masks are still required to be worn in most public places in Wales, including shops, hospitals and on public transport. \nBut they are no longer needed for bars and restaurants, and changes to rules due to be announced later, mean they will also no longer be needed when visiting someone in their own room at a care home.\nWhat do the changes mean for people and businesses in Wales, and what can you do and when?\nChanges to rules have been made over the last two weeks, after First Minister Mark Drakeford laid out his plan to ease restrictions by the end of January.\nThe changes saw:\nFrom Thursday, 10 February Wales returns to a three-week review cycle as the country is at alert level zero\nThe lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic, we were last in alert level zero at Christmas.\nUnder it most curbs to our daily life are removed, all businesses are allowed to reopen, but people still have to wear face masks in many public places, and self isolation rules still apply.\nSince 22 December, fully vaccinated adults, children aged between five and 18 and vaccine clinical trial participants identified as a close contact of a positive case of Covid-19 in Wales do not need to self-isolate. \nInstead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests.\nFrom 28 January people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests will be required on day five and six.\nUntil then, the self-isolation period was seven days, down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on day six and seven. \nThe Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive.\nIt is advising meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated.\nPeople, it said, should leave at least a day between social events.\nFrom 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. \nBut under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January.\nThe rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended.\nPeople are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped.\nWhile wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nLimits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August.\nFor important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures.\nAll guests will need to take a lateral flow test.\nPeople attending weddings, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or reception, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero.\nHowever the Welsh government says it strongly advises people to wear a face covering indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing.\nYou can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply.\nOn 25 January 2022, the Welsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidays for the first time since the start of the pandemic. \nNightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four stage plan, they have been allowed to open from 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. \nHowever, Covid passes are still needed for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. \nFrom 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500.\nOn 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. \nPupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January.\nA legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with \u00a360 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, has been scrapped from 28 January.\nHowever, the Welsh government has said it will remain important to work from home if you can.\nYou have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations.\nIt also means people from other parts of the UK can come here.\nAll holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May."

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The rollout of Covid vaccines in European Union (EU) countries is picking up speed, with more than 300 million jabs  administered.\nAs of 20 June, nearly half of the EU's adult population have had at least one one dose, while 28% have been fully vaccinated.\nEarlier this year, the rollout was hit by delays in production and distribution and vaccine hesitancy in some countries.\nIn the week to 20 June 2021, Germany administered an average of 1 dose per 100 people a day, with Italy and France close behind on  0.9 dose per 100 people - all higher than the UK's 0.6 per 100.\nHungary - which is using Russian and Chinese vaccines as well as the EU-approved ones - has fully vaccinated 46% of its population, the same proportion as the UK. \nIn France, children who are 12 and over can be vaccinated, with parental consent. The government is hoping to avoid class closures when schools reopen after the summer holidays. \nThe EU authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12-15 at the end of May. \nGermany said it would give it to those aged 12-17 with pre-existing conditions while a number of other EU countries said they would vaccinate children before the start of the next academic year.\nIn June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.\nHowever, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.\nIts deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.\nIn February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" \nIn January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.\nFrance and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for 65-74 year olds at the beginning of March.\nThey were again among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again later in March, following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. \nOn 7 April, the EMA said there was a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and the clots, although it is still recommended the jab for all age groups. \nSeveral EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands now say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether. \nThe headlines surrounding AstraZeneca led to a drop in confidence in the jab. In March, the polling company YouGov suggested that only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents considered it safe.\nThe EU took AstraZeneca to court to force it to deliver more doses of vaccine. The company blamed production problems but said it had \"fully complied\" with its contract.\nThe EU lost its legal battle. It had wanted AstraZeneca to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June but a court ruled that the company must instead provide 80 million doses by the end of September. \nThe EU said the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.\nEU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.\nInstead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export.\nThe EU says that by 1 June 2021, it had exported 245 million doses to 46 different countries. \nUnder the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement, but they can make separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.\nHungary has been using Russia's Sputnik vaccine for months and and Slovakia has also bought doses of it.\nGermany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it would buy one million doses, but only once the EU's medicines agency approves the jab for use in the EU. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland have entered talks with both Russia and China.\nThe UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. \nThe government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area. \nHowever, the UK's approval of the vaccine would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.\nThe UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. \nIf it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."

      "text": "The number of Covid infections remained virtually unchanged in the week to 23 January, Office for National Statistics figures suggest.\nIts survey suggests the epidemic is levelling off or perhaps very slightly falling - but not at the rate hoped.\nThe R number for the UK is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.1. A figure below one means the epidemic is shrinking.\nInfections remain high in England, with London continuing to have the worst epidemic, the ONS said.\nBut the virus appears to be levelling off throughout the rest of the UK.\nThe ONS tests a random sample of people in private residences across the UK for Covid weekly, whether they have symptoms or not.\nThis means the survey is among the best sources for understanding what's really happening to the virus.\nAccording to ONS estimates, one in 55 people in England were estimated to have the virus, one in 70 in Wales, one in 110 in Scotland and one in 50 in Northern Ireland. \nIn England and Wales, this proportion is unchanged compared with the week before. \nScotland has seen a small fall, and Northern Ireland a small rise in their infection rates. \nInfections are lower than levels seen in early January but now appear to be flattening at what is still a high level.\nThis pattern is in contrast with the confirmed cases published on the government's dashboard, which show a dramatic spike followed by a very steep fall after the beginning of the year. \nThese figures may be skewed by people coming forward for testing in large numbers around the Christmas period, with numbers of tests conducted falling after the first week of January. \nThe ONS's data published on Friday broadly echoes the findings from other surveillance studies, which are not influenced by who comes forward for testing in the same way.  \nThe latest figures from Imperial College London's React study - one data source used by the government to judge the progress of the epidemic - suggested infections were moving in the right direction but \"not fast enough\" and \"by no means as fast as in lockdown one\".\nThis could be for reasons including a new, more transmissible variants of the virus, the looser lockdown restrictions or the time of year.  \nThe ZOE app's symptom study had suggested a larger fall in previous weeks but its data suggested this decline was slowing and infections remained high. \nGovernment data shows the number of new patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus is gradually falling, but the total number of Covid patients remains high and has not yet really begun to come down.\nEven after infections and, a little later, hospitalisations fall, Covid patients can remain sick for some time and so the pressure on the NHS isn't beginning to ease just yet.

      "text": "Most pupils in Northern Ireland will not return to school until Monday 8 March at the earliest, the Stormont Executive has agreed.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said the ongoing public health situation meant remote learning must continue.\nIt may also be the case that only some year groups go back to school on 8 March, if a return then is possible.\nMrs Foster said she recognised it would come as a \"disappointment\" for many parents and pupils.\n\"The kitchen table is no substitute for the school desk,\" she said, giving details of the decision at a news conference in Dungannon.\n\"It is also important though that we give people a clear view of what is happening so we thought it was important to indicate today that we would not be back before 5 March in schools.\"\nThe recommendation had been made \"relucantly\" by Education Minister Peter Weir due to the ongoing public health situation.\nSpecial schools remain open to all pupils, but only vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers are able to attend mainstream nursery, primary and post-primary schools at present.\nThat means that about 9% of all pupils are in school, with the vast majority learning and being taught remotely.\nIt was originally planned that pupils could return to pre-school, primary and nursery schools following the half-term break in mid-February.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill described the decision as \"difficult\" but urged people to \"stay the course\".\n\"We wish we could be more certain about a definitive date, but we will keep it under review,\" she added.\nThe executive's next review of the lockdown restrictions is scheduled for 18 February.\nMs O'Neill said evidence that the new variant of coronavirus detected in Great Britain was \"more common\" in Northern Ireland had contributed to the executive's decision to extend remote learning.\nAlthough the new variant was confirmed in a small number of cases before Christmas, Mrs Foster said latest estimates showed that \"about 40 to 50%\" of coronavirus cases in NI are now linked to the variant.\nOn Thursday, a further 13 coronavirus-related deaths in Northern Ireland were reported by the Department of Health, taking its total to 1,792.\nA further 592 people have tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. \nThere are 768 people being treated in hospital for Covid-19. Sixty-seven of them are intensive care and 57 patients are receiving ventilation.\nMrs Foster said Northern Ireland's R-number - or rate of infection of the virus - was continuing to fall, with the rate in the community currently sitting between 0.65 and 0.8.\nBut she warned that the number of Covid patients in intensive care units has doubled in the past month, reaching its highest-ever level this week.\nMs O'Neill said she was \"encouraged\" by the progress made in the vaccination programme, with 175,284 people in Northern Ireland now having received their first dose.\nThe online booking system for the 65-69 age group opened last night and vaccinations for those people will be available at regional centres.\nOn Thursday, the executive also discussed a proposal that staff in special schools should be prioritised for vaccination - but ministers have requested further work between officials take place on the issue.\nIf it is not possible for all pupils to return on 8 March, priority will be given to pupils in exam years, BBC News NI understands.\nThat would include pupils taking GCSEs, AS and A-level and BTecs - but it is not clear if it would also include Primary Six pupils who may want to sit the transfer test in the autumn.\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said schools in England would not be able to reopen to all pupils after the February half-term, but could do so from 8 March.\nOn Thursday, another 47 Covid-19-related deaths were recorded in the Republic of Ireland, taking its total to 3,167.\nThe Irish health department also recorded another 1,466 confirmed cases of the virus."

      "text": "The once-mighty iceberg A68a looks to be in its death throes.\nThe largest fragment from a block of Antarctic ice that originally measured some 5,800 sq km (2,240 sq miles) in area has suffered another major split.\nSatellite imagery shows at least two segments drifting close together about 135km south-east of the British territory of South Georgia. They will no doubt soon move further apart.\nFor more than three years, A68a was the biggest iceberg in the world.\nAt its greatest extent, it was about a quarter of the size of Wales - or New Jersey or Israel. \nBut warmer climes and more aggressive seas gradually pulled it apart as it moved northwards away from Antarctica into the South Atlantic.\nIcebergs are named in sequence, with the prefix letter denoting the quadrant of the white continent from where they calved, with the number recording their position in that sequence. \nEach subsequent major fragment to come off the original block then gets a lettered suffix. \nBefore Thursday, this nomenclature process had got up to A68f. After this latest split, the larger portion will retain the name A68a with the smaller one getting the new name of A68g.\nThe US National Ice Center, which oversees the naming system, issued a release on the topic late on Thursday.\nTowards the end of last year, A68a looked from space like a huge pointing hand. Its still significant bulk prompted fears that it could disrupt life on South Georgia should it become grounded just offshore in shallow water.\nThe concern was that the presence of such a large obstacle might disrupt the foraging behaviour of the island's many penguins and seals.\nWith the latest disintegration event, the danger of this scenario seems to have passed.\nA major question now is whether the scientific expedition that was aiming to study the iceberg will have anything left to observe by the time it arrives on site.\nResearchers will soon board the British Royal Research Ship James Cook in the Falkland Islands and sail east towards South Georgia.\nThey have other, unrelated investigations to pursue as well, but they were hoping to place some autonomous vehicles around A68a to learn more about its impacts on the environment. \nTheir study subject has got considerably smaller since the expedition was announced in mid-December."

      "tags": "France",
      "text": "A man held for the murders of a job centre adviser and a human resources manager in south-eastern France is being linked to earlier attacks on HR managers elsewhere.\nThe suspect in the killings of the two women on Thursday in and around Valence was arrested soon afterwards.\nTwo days earlier, another HR manager was shot dead in a car park more than 500km (310 miles) away.\nAnother human resources worker survived an attack at his home in a town nearby.\nValence prosecutor Alex Perrin said initially that the 45-year-old suspect's motives for Thursday's murders were unclear, but they were linked to his earlier employment and his route had been carefully planned. The man is described as an unemployed engineer from Nancy in eastern France who was unmarried and unknown to the police but keen on shooting.\nPrime Minister Jean Castex said the killings had left the whole country in mourning and 900 job centres across France closed on Friday as a mark of respect and staff held a minute's silence.\nJob centre staff elsewhere posted on social media their \"support and solidarity\" in honour of their dead colleague.\nAt 08:30 on Thursday, the gunman burst into a job centre just after it opened in Valence and fatally shot a 53-year-old woman working there as an adviser. The victim was a mother of two children. \"I can't say if he knew the unfortunate victim... did he target the first person he saw?\" asked the prosecutor. It later emerged the suspect had been on the job centre's books up to 2013.\nAs the gunman left, a colleague noted down the licence plate on his red Honda car and contacted police. The attacker then drove to the Faun refuse collection company where he once worked in the neighbouring town of Guilherand-Granges. He shot a 51-year-old woman who was human resources manager at the firm. She later died of her wounds. \nThe suspect had reportedly worked there for two years before losing his job some time ago. He was detained on a bridge over the River Rh\u00f4ne linking the two towns when he drove into a police car trying to stop him at around 09:15.\nSoon the two murders were being linked to earlier attacks several hours' drive to the north-east.\nA 39-year-old woman was found dead on Tuesday evening in her car outside the company where she worked in Wolfgantzen, around 150km from the suspect's home. A man in his 50s was later attacked at his home in Wattwiller but survived. \nThe two victims had previously worked together in a human resources department, local reports said, and had been involved in project affecting a company where the suspect had worked several years ago. Police said on Friday they had established a DNA link between the Wattwiller attack and the two murders in the south but the suspect was refusing to talk.\nPolice are also investigating a 2018 social media campaign under the hashtag \"balancetonDRH\" - or \"expose your HR manager\" - where names had been posted of people condemned as \"mercenaries\" and \"killers\"."

I was put in touch with experts who took it from there.\"\nThe dinosaur which left it was described as \"a slender animal\" which would have walked on its two hind feet and actively hunted other small animals and insects.\nSimilar footprints in the USA are known to have been made by the dinosaur Coelophysis.\nSpecimens found at Bendricks Bay in the past are thought to be from more crocodilian-type reptiles rather than dinosaurs.\nSpecial permission had to be sought from Natural Resources Wales to legally remove the footprint, with the fossil extracted this week and taken to National Museum Cardiff where it will be preserved.\nDinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago, with the footprint shedding light on an early point in their evolution, when the different groups of dinosaurs were first diversifying. \n\"Its spectacular preservation may help scientists establish more about the actual structure of their feet as the preservation is clear enough to show individual pads and even claw impressions,\" National Museum Wales said in a statement.\nThe Bendricks is a stretch of coastline between Barry and Sully in the Vale of Glamorgan.\nIt is an important palaeontologist site and a site of special scientific interest. \nThe south Wales group of the Geologists' Association called it \"the best site in Britain for dinosaur tracks of the Triassic Period\".\nIt said: \"The footprints can be difficult to see. Many are covered at high tide so it is best to go after high tide when the tracks may retain small puddles of water. \n\"It is also easier to spot the footprints when the sun is low in the sky as longer shadows will help throw the footprints into relief.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Financial Conduct Authority (FCA),Personal finance,Reddit,GameStop",
      "text": "Regulators have fired warning shots over frenzied share dealing in GameShop and other firms fuelled by social media chat on sites like Reddit and Facebook.\nWatchdogs in the US and UK said they were monitoring activity and potential lawbreaking, and warned traders they risked facing huge losses.\nTraders should ensure they are familiar with all rules, \"including market abuse\", the UK's regulator said.\nGameStop is the focus of a trading war between amateurs and Wall Street pros.\nShares in the US bricks-and-mortar video games retailer surged again on Friday, ending 68% higher. Another stock in the traders' sights, AMC Entertainment, jumped 54%.\nThat bucked broader market trends, which saw all three main US indexes fall roughly 2%. For the week they were down more than 3% - the biggest weekly decline since October. \nSome share trading firms temporarily halted dealings on Thursday amid extreme volatility in GameStop, which has soared as much as 700% in the past week. AMC Entertainment and Blackberry, which have also seen huge trading activity, were among the other companies also hit by the restrictions.\nUK traders have also been sharing their thoughts and tips on trading chat forums amid mounting concerns about misinformation and share ramping. \nLondon-listed companies have also been the focus of social media attention, including publisher Pearson and cinema operator Cineworld, although the share price movements were minimal compared with the GameStop surge.\nIn a statement on Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said: \"The FCA is aware of the situation and continues to closely monitor trading in UK markets. UK investors should take care when trading shares in highly volatile market conditions that they fully understand the risks they are taking. This applies to UK investors trading both US and UK stocks.  \n\"Firms and individuals should also ensure they are familiar with, and abiding by, all regulations including the market abuse and short selling regimes in the jurisdiction they are trading in.\"\nIn the US, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned against illegal \"manipulative trading activity\". \nThe regulator added: \"Our core market infrastructure has proven resilient under the weight of this week's extraordinary trading volumes.\n\"Nevertheless, extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence.\"\nThe SEC also said it would review actions that could \"unduly inhibit\" and \"disadvantage investors\".\nThe war between amateur private investors and heavyweight firms like hedge funds centres on so-called short selling. Over recent months, hedge funds had made big bets that shares in loss-making GameStop would fall. \nBut an army of private investors, swapping tips on social media, spotted a chance for a buying frenzy that would push up the price and \"squeeze\" the hedge fund short sellers. \nMany private traders made profits - and losses - along the way, but their actions also dealt a big financial blow to hedge funds that spent billions of dollars gambling GameStop's shares would tumble.\nThe decision on Thursday by several brokerages to halt purchases of shares in Gamestop and some other firms  sparked outrage among investors, who accused the companies of working on behalf of traditional Wall Street investors who were losing out to the army of amateurs. Some disgruntled investors said they were preparing legal action.\nInvestor anger over their temporary ban from trading spread beyond the investment community, with rappers and US politicians on both sides of the Washington divide joining the backlash against Wall Street.\n\"This is unacceptable,\" tweeted Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat. \"We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit.\"\nHer tweet was shared by Republican Senator Ted Cruz who commented \"fully agree.\" Tesla founder Elon Musk, whose shares have also been a retail favourite, also commented on Ms Ocasio-Cortez's tweet, saying \"Absolutely\".\nMuch of the anger was directed atRobinhood, a new breed of broker popular among a new generation of younger, tech-savvy investor, but which has been accused of \"gamifying\" share trading. \nOn Friday, a Robinhood chat forum on Facebook was also removed for breaking its Community Standards rules, although the social media giant did not expand on the reasons.\nAfter the backlash, Robinhood late Thursday said it would ease the restrictions. The firm also said it had raised more than $1bn from existing investors to bolster its finances amid questions about strains caused by the buying frenzy.\nBut Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat known as a supporter of tougher financial rules, said the chaos was another sign of \"years of distortion in securities markets that have allowed the wealthy few to artificially inflate and deflate share prices and reap short-term profits while exacerbating wealth inequality\".\nShe said regulators must review the trades and make changes to ensure that markets \"reflect real value, rather than the highly leveraged bets of wealthy traders or those who seek to inflict financial damage on those traders\".\nKey to what's going on is \"short selling\" or \"shorting\", where a big investment firm such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall.\nThe hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit.\nGameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as \"failing\" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street.\nBut in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price.\nIf the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses - a process known as covering.\nHowever, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still."

      "text": "More than 6,000 people have now died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Scotland since the pandemic began.\nA further 70 deaths have been recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total by that measure to 6,040.\nHowever, separate figures released by the National Records of Scotland earlier this week showed that the virus has been mentioned on 7,902 death certificates in Scotland. \nA total of 177,688 people have now tested positive in Scotland.\nThe whole of the Western Isles is likely to be moved into level four restrictions later on Friday amid concern over a rise in the number of cases.\nBut the overall number of people in hospital with the virus across the country has been falling in recent days. \nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman told the Scottish government's daily coronavirus briefing that the 6,000 deaths milestone was \"another distressing reminder of the toll this virus has taken\". \nA total of 515,855 people across Scotland had received their first dose of vaccine by Friday morning. \nThe figures include about 96% of care home residents and 68% of people over the age of 80.\nBut there have been concerns from GPs and opposition parties that the vaccine roll-out in Scotland has been lagging behind England. \nDaily figures released on Friday showed that a further 24,197 people had been vaccinated in Scotland - which was fewer than the 29,566 recorded on Thursday and lower than last week's peak of 25,327.\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the figures showed that the rollout continued to be \"sluggish\" in Scotland, and said the government appeared to be pinning its hopes on a \"last-minute rush to get mass vaccination centre open\". \nThe Scottish government has insisted that it is on track to meet its target of having vaccinated everyone over the age of 80 by the end of next week, and the over-70s by the middle of February.\nMs Freeman said two further mass vaccination centres would open in Aberdeen and Edinburgh on Monday, in addition to the one that is already operating in Glasgow. \nThe site at the Edinburgh EICC will be able to vaccinate more than 21,000 a week, while the Aberdeen facility at P&J Live will vaccinate about 6,000 people every week.\nThe Louisa Jordan mass vaccination centre in Glasgow has been operating since 8 December.\nIt has been carrying out between 1,000 and 5,000 vaccinations daily, and has the capacity to move to 10,000 per day.\nThe Scottish government's vaccine deployment plan, which was published on 14 January, said the mass centres in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen would be \"capable of administering in excess of 20,000 vaccinations per week each\".\nIt also said vaccination facilities with similar capacities would open in Bathgate, Musselburgh and Ravenscraig in Motherwell.\nThe Scottish government said the Musselburgh site will open on 10 February and Bathgate on 15 February, but no opening date has yet been given for Ravenscraig. \nNHS Lothian has told BBC Scotland that the Bathgate and Musselburgh sites will be able to carry out about 14,000 and 8,000 vaccinations per week respectively when they are fully operational.\nSmaller vaccination centres are also opening across the country, many of which are located in community facilities such as village halls and sports centres as well as GP surgeries. \nScottish Conservative health spokesman Donald Cameron said: \"There's no doubt mass centres will give the SNP's rollout a shot in the arm, so to speak, but it remains to be seen if they will still be lagging behind.\n\"Worryingly, today the health secretary couldn't give many answers about further opening dates and, all on her own, she created confusion about what even constitutes a mass vaccination centre.\"\nMs Freeman said everyone aged 70 to 79, and extremely clinically vulnerable adults, should receive an invitation letter for a vaccination by the end of this week.\nShe added: \"Subject to supplies, all of them will have received their first dose of the vaccine by mid-February.\"\nThe health secretary also said the opening of the mass vaccination centres meant that invitation letters would start going out next week to 65 to 69-year-olds in the Lothian, Grampian and Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board areas.\nMs Freeman said planning was \"well advanced\" in other areas, where letters would be sent out within the next two weeks - although most of those letters are expected to arrive in the coming days. \nShe also said it was \"no longer tenable\" for the Scottish government to hold off on publishing vaccine supply data.\nEarlier this month, the government removed its vaccine rollout plan from its website after the UK government raised concerns about the level of detail it gave about how many vaccine doses the UK was due to receive.\nThe UK government said the information was commercially sensitive and could threaten future supplies of the vaccine.\nMs Freeman apologised to her UK counterpart Matt Hancock at the time, saying she regretted that it had caused \"some upset\".\nHowever, on Thursday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government could start publishing details of coronavirus vaccine supplies next week.\nMs Freeman said the UK government had \"repeatedly briefed key statistics\" about how much vaccine had been allocated and delivered to Scotland.\n\"So it's not credible for them one day to tell journalists... what these figures are and another day tell us that putting out these figures is a matter of national security,\" she said.\n\"That circle really doesn't square. We've held off publication in the past at their request but that's no longer tenable. The public have a right to clarity and we will give them that.\n\"We're not talking about future supplies, we're talking about known supplies - and I think that's exactly the right thing for us to do.\"\nMeanwhile, Police Scotland issued a record 355 fines last week under the lockdown travel regulations.\nThe statistics for the week ending 27 January represented a 23% increase on the previous week's total of 288.\nThe figures were included in the overall total of 604 Covid-related fixed penalty fines."

      "tags": "Acting,Film,United States",
      "text": "Pioneering Hollywood actress Cicely Tyson - who was known for portraying strong African-American characters - has died aged 96, her manager has said.\nNo cause of the death was given. The former fashion model had a career that spanned seven decades. \nTyson won two Emmys for her performance in the 1974 civil rights-era film The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.\nShe also became the first black woman to take on a main role in the TV drama East Side/West Side in the 1960s.\nPresenting Tyson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, the then US President Barack Obama said that apart from her achievements as an actress, she had also shaped the course of history.\nTyson turned down stereotypical roles for black women, agreeing only to play characters that were strong, positive and realistic.\n\"I have managed Miss Tyson's career for over 40 years, and each year was a privilege and blessing,\" her manager Larry Thompson said in Thursday's statement announcing her death.\n\"Cicely thought of her new memoir as a Christmas tree decorated with all the ornaments of her personal and professional life. Today she placed the last ornament, a star, on top of the tree,\" the manager said, adding that she died peacefully.\nTyson's memoir Just As I Am was published on Tuesday and Vulture wrote about seven highlights from the book, including her accidentally hanging up on Mr Obama's aide ringing to tell her she had won the prestigious medal. \n\"'Oh please,' I said laughing, feeling sure it was a prankster talking some foolishness,\" she recalled. \"How did you even get this number? She tried to persuade me that her declaration was true, but I wouldn't hear of it'.\"\nIt also mentioned how she met her future husband, trumpeter Miles Davis, in the 60s after he knocked on the door of his neighbour Diahann Carroll's house, where Tyler was a guest. He appeared in just a robe, to ask for some sugar. \nVulture said the book later went on to detail the couple falling out after their marriage, after Tyson first sniffed out \"the stench of Miles's philandering\". They were married from 1981 to 1988.\nBorn in New York's Harlem, she was raised by her devoutly religious parents from the Caribbean island of Nevis.\nAfter being discovered by a fashion editor at Ebony magazine her modelling career took off. By 1957, she was acting in off-Broadway productions and went on to gain small roles in feature films before she was cast as Portia in The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter in 1968.\nAfter paying tribute, US broadcaster and actress Oprah Winfrey said: \"She used her career to illuminate the humanity of black people. The roles she played reflected her values; she never compromised.\"\nTyson recently told CBS interviewer Gayle King: \"I had no idea I would touch anybody.\"\nMichelle Obama added she would \"miss her dearly\", saying: \"I smile knowing how many people she inspired, just like me, to walk a little taller, speak a little more freely, and live a little bit more like God intended.\"\nTyson was nominated for a best actress Oscar and Golden Globe in 1973 for Sounder, about a family of poor black sharecroppers in the midst of the Great Depression in 1933 Louisiana. \nIn 1973, Tyson told the BBC's Film Programme she hoped the acclaim for her role in Sounder \"allows me to be considered for roles simply because I'm a good actress rather than because I'm a black actress, which limits my ability to work. \n\"And if that happens then I will be extremely grateful because that will mean that when a good role comes up that I will be considered and that I will not have to wait until a role is written for a back actress.\"\nThe Tony Awards also nominated her in 2013 for lead actress for the play The Trip to Bountiful, about an unhappy, elderly woman desperate to visit her girlhood home before she dies.\nTyson also appeared in 2011 film The Help and TV shows including 1977's Roots, season four of House of Cards andthe recent How to Get Away with Murder, which starred Viola Davis.\nOscar-winning actress Davis said Tyson had \"made me feel loved and seen and valued in a world where there is still a cloak of invisibility for us dark chocolate girls\".\nTV producer Shonda Rhimes, whose shows include How to Get Away with Murder and Bridgerton, paid tribute to \"an extraordinary person\", and said \"her power and grace will be with us forever\", while actress and presenter Whoopi Goldberg praised \"a tower of power, a pillar of strength, CLEAR about who she was, and how she was to be treated... and that never wavered\".\nFilmmaker Ava DuVernay, whose films include Selma, the documentary 13th and TV drama When They See Us, remembered Tyson's warm embrace, saying: \"Your hugs I'll remember. How your petite arms wrapped around me like mighty branches of a sunlit tree, strong and warm. Your love I'll remember. You loved me for some reason and told me often.\"\nSinger Mariah Carey called the actress \"a queen who graced the world with her beauty, strength and talent\" while actress Jada Pinkett Smith simply called Tyson a \"legend\"\nSinger Rihanna added her voice  by calling Tyson \"a true legend\" and Euphoria star Zendaya tweeted that \"this one hurts, today we honour and celebrate the life of one of the greatest to ever do it. Thank you Cicely Tyson. Rest in great power\".\nKerry Washington, the actress, producer and director, paid tribute by saying: \"Thank you for blessing us and for lighting way. I miss you already. So so much.\" \nBryce Dallas Howard, who was in The Help, called Tyson a \"pioneer and enlightened genius\", adding: \"To have been in her presence was a privilege. Thank you for your light, leadership, and legacy.\"\nUSA Today said Tyson's book talked about her having a baby girl called Joan at 17, and raised her largely out of the spotlight. \nTyson was also godmother to the singer Lenny Kravitz, having been friends with his mother, as well as to Denzel Washington's daughter Katia and actor, director, producer and writer Tyler Perry's son Aman. She also had an early marriage to Kenneth Franklin which was later dissolved.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

It is not known how the refugee family got there, but they had previously been held at Rivesaltes camp, a military facility in southern France used to intern civilians, before its closure in 1942.\nRecords suggest Mr Schwam's parents returned to Austria after the war but he moved to Lyon in 1950 to study pharmacy.\nIt was there he met, married and lived with his future wife. According to local reports, the couple did not have children and he was a widower before his death on 25 December.\nMayor Jean-Michel Eyraud told AFP that Mr Schwam's fortune would be used to fund education and youth initiatives.\nLe Chambon-sur-Lignon has a population of only about 2,500 people but has a reputation as a place of refuge dating back to the French Protestant Huguenots who fled religious persecution during the 17th Century.\nDuring WW2, a local pastor and his wife led calls to protect Jewish refugees from the occupying Nazis and Vichy French collaborators. Word spread through human rights groups and word of mouth and the village became a hub of the resistance movement, with ordinary residents taking in and hiding those who fled. \nLe Chambon-sur-Lignon was later recognised by Israel for its extraordinary effort."

A figure below one means the epidemic is shrinking.\nInfections remain high in England, with London continuing to have the worst epidemic, the ONS said.\nBut the virus appears to be levelling off throughout the rest of the UK.\nThe ONS tests a random sample of people in private residences across the UK for Covid weekly, whether they have symptoms or not.\nThis means the survey is among the best sources for understanding what's really happening to the virus.\nAccording to ONS estimates, one in 55 people in England were estimated to have the virus, one in 70 in Wales, one in 110 in Scotland and one in 50 in Northern Ireland. \nIn England and Wales, this proportion is unchanged compared with the week before. \nScotland has seen a small fall, and Northern Ireland a small rise in their infection rates. \nInfections are lower than levels seen in early January but now appear to be flattening at what is still a high level.\nThis pattern is in contrast with the confirmed cases published on the government's dashboard, which show a dramatic spike followed by a very steep fall after the beginning of the year. \nThese figures may be skewed by people coming forward for testing in large numbers around the Christmas period, with numbers of tests conducted falling after the first week of January. \nThe ONS's data published on Friday broadly echoes the findings from other surveillance studies, which are not influenced by who comes forward for testing in the same way.  \nThe latest figures from Imperial College London's React study - one data source used by the government to judge the progress of the epidemic - suggested infections were moving in the right direction but \"not fast enough\" and \"by no means as fast as in lockdown one\".\nThis could be for reasons including a new, more transmissible variants of the virus, the looser lockdown restrictions or the time of year.  \nThe ZOE app's symptom study had suggested a larger fall in previous weeks but its data suggested this decline was slowing and infections remained high. \nGovernment data shows the number of new patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus is gradually falling, but the total number of Covid patients remains high and has not yet really begun to come down.\nEven after infections and, a little later, hospitalisations fall, Covid patients can remain sick for some time and so the pressure on the NHS isn't beginning to ease just yet.

      "tags": "China,Taiwan,United States",
      "text": "China has warned Taiwan that any attempt to seek independence \"means war\".\nThe warning comes days after China stepped up its military activities and flew warplanes near the island. \nIt also comes after new US President Joe Biden reaffirmed his commitment to Taiwan, and set out his stance in Asia. \nThe US has called China's latest warning \"unfortunate\", adding that tensions did not need to lead to \"anything like confrontation\".\nChina sees democratic Taiwan as a breakaway province, but Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, with its own constitution, military, and elected leaders.\nAnalysts say Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned that Taiwan's government is moving the island towards a formal declaration of independence and it wants to warn President Tsai Ing-wen against taking steps in that direction.\nPresident Tsai, however, has repeatedly said that Taiwan is already an independent state, making any formal declaration unnecessary.\nOn Thursday, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian defended the recent military activities near Taiwan, saying they were \"necessary actions to address the current security situation in the Taiwan Strait and to safeguard national sovereignty and security\".\n\"They are a solemn response to external interference and provocations by 'Taiwan independence' forces,\" he added.\n\"We warn those 'Taiwan independence' elements - those who play with fire will burn themselves, and Taiwan independence means war.\"\nThe US responded later on Thursday. \n\"We find that comment unfortunate,\" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters, in the first statement by the new administration on China-Taiwan relations. \nMr Kirby added that the Pentagon \"sees no reason why tensions over Taiwan need to lead to anything like confrontation\".\nThe new US administration is expected to maintain pressure on China over a wide range of issues including human rights, trade disputes, Hong Kong and Taiwan, amid the deteriorating relationship between the two powers.\nTaiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, meanwhile, said China should \"not underestimate\" the island's determination to defend its sovereignty and uphold freedom and democracy.\nChina's official spokespeople try not to talk about war. They almost always emphasise that theirs is a peace-loving country. \nChina is not a nation with a history of expeditionary military confrontation far beyond what it regards as its borders.\nHowever, under Xi Jinping's leadership, China has repeatedly said that it would use military force to prevent any move towards formal independence by Taiwan, which it regards as a renegade province. \nThreatening a war isn't as nuanced as talk of military intervention. It's blunt, more frightening. It is different too. Military intervention could come in a multitude of ways; not necessarily an out-and-out war between two competing sides and their allies. \nBut Taiwan's status is a red line for Beijing, a part of what it regards as its unimpeachable territorial integrity. An \"internal affair\", alongside Hong Kong. \nThe language deployed by the government spokespeople may not always be this provocative but when it comes to Taiwan it's fair to assume this is what China is, ultimately, willing to resort to.\nIn January 2020 Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen told the BBC that China needed to respect the will of Taiwanese people. \"We don't have a need to declare ourselves an independent state,\" she said."

      "tags": "Balloch,Renton",
      "text": "A Scottish luxury hotel has been fined half a million pounds over a fire that claimed the lives of two guests.\nCameron House has been ordered to pay \u00a3500,000 after admitting to breaches of fire safety rules.\nA hotel porter has also been given a community payback order to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work.\nRichard Dyson, 38, and his partner Simon Midgley, 32, died in the hotel blaze on the banks of Loch Lomond in December 2017.\nThe fire started after night porter Christopher O'Malley, 35, placed a plastic bag of ash in a cupboard containing kindling and newspapers.\nO'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act.\nSheriff William Gallacher said the families of Mr Dyson and Mr Midgley will \"always endure the heartbreak\" caused by the fire.\nCameron House previously pleaded guilty to two charges of failing to take fire safety measures which were necessary to ensure the safety of staff and guests.\nSurvivor Hannah Munns, who was in the room next to the couple, said she felt \"ignored and angry\" after the sentencing.\nMs Munns told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: \"Two men have lost their lives, many families have been impacted and they (Cameron House) continue to trade. They are barely going to notice it.\"\nShe also criticised the lack of communication since the blaze and said she could not make sense of O'Malley's \"ridiculous\" actions.\nBut Ms Munns added she felt more aggrieved at the fine handed down to Cameron House.\nShe said: \"That's nothing. No lessons will be learned from that. Nothing will change as a result of that.\n\"It just feels like no-one has taken it very seriously. I am just in shock, really. It is almost saying our lives don't matter.\"\nDumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie said the fire had been devastating for the victims' families.\nThe Scottish Labour interim leader spoke to Mr Midgley's mother, Jane, after the sentencing and said she remains \"heartbroken\".\nMs Baillie added: \"What we heard today, in the context of two young men losing their lives, does not seem enough to her.\n\"We have a major hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond that failed to heed the advice given to them by the fire brigade and others.\n\"The deaths of these two young men did not need to happen at all.\"\nDumbarton Sheriff Court heard staff were not properly trained in the safe disposal of ash and no written procedures were in place.\nThat was contrary to recommendations made in two fire risk assessments carried out by an independent company in 2016 and 2017.\nThere was no safe system for emptying the ash bins outside the hotel, which is next to Loch Lomond.\nThe day before the fatal fire, O'Malley had discovered they were both full. They had not been emptied since October 2017, two months before the 18 December blaze.\nIn August 2017, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service told managers not to store combustibles - like kindling and newspapers - in the concierge cupboard, but staff continued to do so.\nPeter Gray QC, acting for Cameron House, said the failings were not deliberate breaches but occurred \"as a result of genuine errors\".\nHe also told the court the fire had gone undetected for a long period before being discovered, and that the hotel had a \"suite of measures in place\" to deal with fire safety.\nSheriff William Gallacher also heard of an incident three nights before the fatal fire, when O'Malley and another night porter were told not to put ash into plastic bags because it was a fire hazard.\nMr Gray said it was therefore \"extremely difficult to understand\" why O'Malley did not follow this guidance on the night of the fire.\nAfter the sentencing, Alistair Duncan, head of the Health and Safety Investigation Unit, said: \"The failings on the part of Cameron House Resort and Christopher O'Malley led to the deaths of Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson.\n\"This incident should serve as a reminder to other companies that failure to implement the necessary fire safety measures can have terrible consequences.\"\nStuart Stevens, assistant chief officer of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said the \"needless loss of two lives\" could have been prevented.\nDet Insp Stuart Grainger from Police Scotland said: \"While nothing will ever diminish the pain of their loss, we hope that the conclusion of this case brings at least a small measure of comfort.\"\nThe court was previously told O'Malley, of Renton, West Dunbartonshire, deeply regretted his actions and they were not deliberate.\nMore than 200 guests were staying in the hotel when an initial fire alarm sounded at about 06:40. \nO'Malley opened the door and flames took hold, spreading to the hall.\nHe and two others tried to fight the blaze with fire extinguishers, but were overcome by the flames.\nFirefighters arrived within 10 minutes to find a \"well-developed\" fire in the mansion, which is near Balloch in West Dunbartonshire.\nIt was after 08:00 when it was discovered that Mr Dyson, 38, and Mr Midgley, 32, were missing. \nFirefighters wearing breathing apparatus found Mr Dyson on a landing at the top of a staircase. \nMr Midgley was lying in a fire escape passageway. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene.\nMr Dyson was taken to hospital, where he was also pronounced dead.\nPost-mortem examinations said the men's causes of death had been inhalation of smoke and fire gases. \nThe couple had travelled from London, and were staying at the five-star resort as the final stop on their winter break to Scotland.

      "tags": "Stock markets,Reddit,GameStop",
      "text": "Amateur investors are responding with outrage after trading platforms curbed buying of shares in the US games firm GameStop and other companies.\nThe moves by Robinhood and Interactive Brokers follow days of frenzied trading that led to massive gains for some stocks. \nShares in GameStop dived by as much as 55% after the restrictions.\nIt is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants.\nMajor hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. \nBut they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites such as Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week.\nOther firms, such as AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry, also saw sharp gains. They were embraced by day traders after hedge funds bet against them.\nThe activity has drawn questions from regulators, who are monitoring trading amid fears of illegal actions.\nHowever, the amateur investors say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game.\nIn online forums they discussed legal action and accused Robinhood and other brokerages enacting their own form of market manipulation by restricting purchases of certain shares.\nRobinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev tweeted that the firm had taken its decision based on regulatory requirements, and said limited buys of the restricted stocks would be allowed from Friday.\n\"They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money,\" said 18-year-old Myron Sakkas of Coventry, a student at Warwick University.\nMyron, who has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year, said he had lost \u00a330 on Gamestop shares, which he owned for \"a couple of hours\" and sold when he saw what was happening.\nMyron said he had since been locked out of his account and unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the \u00a31,000 he has in it and call a halt.\nThough hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree, he said he was disillusioned by what he sees as \"market manipulation\" directed against people like him. \n\"When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,\" he added. \"I've got other stuff to do.\"\nKey to what's going on is \"short selling\" or \"shorting\", where a big investment company such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall.\nThe hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit.\nGameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as \"failing\" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street.\nBut in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. \nIf the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses  - a process known as covering.\nHowever, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still.\nAnd amateurs aren't the only ones getting in on the action.\nThis week, for example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\nIn the US, anger over the trading restrictions united politicians whose stances typically sharply diverge.\nSenator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is taking over as chair of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing about the \"state of the stock market\".\n\"People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they're the ones getting hurt,\" he said.\nRep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known for her leftist views, called the restrictions \"unacceptable\" and expressed support for a hearing, to which Sen Ted Cruz, a staunch Republican, replied on Twitter, \"Fully agree\".\nDave Portnoy, founder of the Barstool Sports blog, who has emerged as one of the most high-profile amateur traders during the pandemic, also attacked the restrictions, singling out Robinhood, which has cast itself as a platform aimed at making Wall Street more accessible.\nThe firm also makes money through fees paid by Wall Street firms that execute trades for its users.\n\"'Democratizing finance for all' except when we manipulate the market, cause too many ordinary people are getting rich,\" he wrote.\nAnalyst Neil Wilson said that Reddit chat threads, suggest the day traders' battle with Wall Street is personal. \n\"Among the many aspects of this story that are strange, what is so unusual is the peculiar vigilante morality of the traders pumping the stock. They seem hell-bent on taking on Wall Street, they seem to hate hedge funds and threads are peppered with insults about 'boomer' money. \n\"It's a generational fight, redistributive and all about robbing the rich to give to the millennial 'poor'.\"\nElon Musk, who has a history of feuding with short sellers, also joined the fight, tweeting: \"Here come the shorty apologists. Give them no respect. Get Shorty.\"\nA one-word tweet by the billionaire entrepreneur on Tuesday - he tweeted \"Gamestonk!!\" - had been seen as giving Gamestop shares an extra boost.\nThe fracas follows a jump in casual investing during the pandemic, which saw people stuck at home with time on their hands and limited places to spend pour money into the market.\nThe surge has produced ripples of worry on Wall Street, including concerns that inexperienced investors could cause bubbles in certain stocks or were dabbling in investments with risks they did not fully understand.\nRobinhood - which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new interest in investing - has faced particular scrutiny for the way its app has made investment seem like a game. \nLast year, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint accusing the company of marketing to inexperienced users and failing to protect them.\nOfficials said this week they were following the market battle.\nPress secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday President Joe Biden\u2019s economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was \u201cmonitoring the situation\u201d.\nMassachusetts state regulator William Galvin called on the New York Stock Exchange to suspend GameStop for 30 days to allow a cooling-off period. \"This isn't investing, this is gambling,\" he said in an interview. \"This is obviously contrived.\""

      "tags": "Johnson & Johnson,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new single-dose vaccine has shown to be 66% effective against Covid-19, and offered complete protection against hospitalisation and death in trials.\nHowever, there are signs the jab, made by Belgian pharmaceutical firm Janssen, is less effective against the new variant spreading in South Africa.\nThe Johnson & Johnson-owned company is looking at whether two doses will give stronger or longer-lasting protection.\nIt aims to make one billion doses this year.\nThe UK has ordered 30 million doses, the US 100 million and Canada 38 million.\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said if the jab was approved by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) it could \"significantly bolster\" the country's vaccine programme.\nCrucially, no one needed hospital treatment or died from coronavirus after the Janssen vaccine took effect in the international trial.\nThe news comes shortly after Novavax announced their jab was 89% effective overall in the UK and 60% in South Africa. Both new vaccines will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. \nMeanwhile, the EU's drugs regulator has approved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged over 18. \nIt comes amid an ongoing dispute over whether AstraZeneca is breaking its vaccine delivery commitments to the bloc, which has seen the EU confirm that it will bring in export controls on Covid vaccines made in the bloc.\nThe EU has temporarily overridden a section of the Brexit deal in relation to Northern Ireland, over concerns the country could become a backdoor for vaccines from the EU to be sent into the wider UK.\nArlene Foster, DUP leader and Northern Ireland's first minister, called the move \"an incredible act of hostility\" by the EU.\nIt comes as the UK reported a further 29,079 new coronavirus cases on Friday, and 1,245 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the government's daily figures, bringing the total deaths by that measure to 104,371.\nCrucially, the Janssen trial looked at giving just one dose of the vaccine, which makes it significantly easier to roll out than those requiring two.  It is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. \nThe fact it works as a single dose and can be kept in a standard fridge, while others need super-cold storage, means the vaccine could have a significant role around the world. \n\"A one-shot vaccine is considered by the World Health Organization to be the best option in pandemic settings,\" said Dr Paul Stoffels, the chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson.\nHe added the vaccine could \"potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of Covid-19\". \nIt is easy to become complacent after the astounding success of the first vaccines to go through trials.\nBut having another two effective vaccines is a cause for massive celebration.\nIt will take vast quantities of vaccine to immunise the world - remember this is a pandemic - and the more options we have available, the better.\nHowever, there is also a warning sign in the new data from the Janssen and Novavax trials.\nBoth showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.\nThe results from South Africa were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all.\nBut they do emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target and that we may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.\nThe Janssen vaccine uses a common cold virus that has been engineered to make it harmless. \nIt then safely carries part of the coronavirus's genetic code into the body. This is enough for the body to recognise the threat and then learn to fight coronavirus. \nThis trains the body's immune system to fight coronavirus when it encounters the virus for real. \nThis is similar to the approach used by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. \nDr Mathai Mammen, from Janssen, said: \"A single dose regimen with fast onset of protection and ease of delivery and storage provides a potential solution to reaching as many people as possible. \n\"The ability to avoid hospitalisations and deaths would change the game in combating the pandemic.\"\nThe results are based on nearly 44,000 people who took part in the trial and 468 cases of Covid-19.\nHowever the vaccine was just 57% effective in the South African part of the trial, where a new version of the coronavirus is spreading, compared with 72% in the US.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said that the results from the early trials were \"very encouraging\", and if the vaccine was approved doses should be available later this year.\nMr Hancock said the Janssen announcement was \"yet more good news\". \n\"If this jab is approved this could significantly bolster our vaccination programme, especially as a single-dose vaccine,\" he said.\n\"Once the full data has been submitted [to the MHRA], they will consider the evidence to determine whether the vaccine meets robust standards of safety, effectiveness & quality.\"\nIn the UK, the latest estimate for the R rate from the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1.\nThe number of coronavirus cases in the UK remained virtually unchanged in the week to 23 January, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data.  Its survey suggests the epidemic is levelling off or perhaps very slightly falling - but not at the rate hoped.\nMore than 7.8 million people in the UK have so far received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest government figures.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "Debate about Britain's imperial past and the Black Lives Matter movement has a \"cartoon-like view\" of history, Kwasi Kwarteng has told the BBC.\nThe business secretary, the first black MP to head a department, told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking the Empire must be seen in its 400-year context and arguments fully explored.\nCalls to \"de-colonise\" the curriculum were not the way forward, he added. \n\"I'm saying the opposite - that you've got to learn more about colonialism.\"\nBritish institutions have faced growing calls in recent years to account for their colonial links and wealth they accrued directly as a result of the British Empire and the Atlantic Slave trade. \nDuring anti-racism protests last summer following the death of George Floyd in the US, the statue of slave trader and philanthropist Edward Colston was toppled by protesters in Bristol and a number of others were removed.\nMr Kwarteng, whose parents moved from Ghana to the UK in the 1960s, said \"ripping down\" statues was counter-productive, as well as illegal, and people should \"learn more\" about the British Empire in all its various facets.\n\"I'm not someone who is obsessed with trying to correct history. I think you've got to understand history and understand that it's very complex and there are different arguments that are presented and I have a plea to understand the arguments and the context of the British Empire,\" he said.\n\"Even when you say the phrase the British Empire, you're talking about something that lasted more or less 400 years and covered a huge expanse of territory. \n\"So within that time and geography there's a huge amount of variety, different cultures and different time periods and getting a sensitivity to that is hugely important.\n\"I think a lot of the debate around Black Lives Matter and imperialism or colonialism has a very kind of cartoon-like view of what was happening over centuries across a quarter of the world.\"\nHe said he did not understand what those calling for university and school curriculums to be \"de-colonised\" were trying to achieve. \n\"Is the implication that it's a colonial relic and that you've got to try and decolonise it? I'm saying the opposite - that you've got to learn more about colonialism.\"\nDuring the interview, Mr Kwarteng also explained why he put a stop to a post-Brexit review of workers' rights and employment practices when he took over at the business department three weeks ago. \n\"I don't think that's a constructive thing to do. I don't think the opportunities of Brexit are about whittling away workers' rights or trying to have a race to the bottom or trying to reduce wages. On the contrary, a lot of people in my constituency voted for Brexit because of a stagnation of wages.\"\nMr Kwarteng was one of the authors of a 2012 series of essays, called Britannia Unchained, which suggested the UK did not encourage risk-taking and must strive to emulate the work ethic and low-tax culture of Singapore and other Asian successful economies.\nPressed on whether he still holds to pro-free market views on deregulation or whether he supported a more interventionist role for the state, Mr Kwarteng said 2021 was very different from 2012, let alone previous decades. \n\"We've had a huge amount of money spent rightly to support businesses and people in employment. We've got a net zero agenda, which says we've got to decarbonise our economy in 30 years, and we've got a Brexit deal which is going to set us on a totally different course in terms of international trade. \nAll of these mean that we can't simply apply the orthodoxies of 30 or 40 years ago to the context in which we now live or even five or six years ago.'\nHe added: \"You can't simply go back to the Milton Friedman and Margaret Thatcher playbook of the 1970s and 1980s of deregulation and apply that.'\nThe full podcast will be published today and Political Thinking will also be on Radio 4 tomorrow (Saturday) at 5.30pm."

      "text": "The government has withdrawn a social media advert urging people to \"Stay Home. Save Lives\" after it was criticised for stereotyping women.\nThe image showed women home schooling children and doing domestic chores, while the only man featured was depicted relaxing on a sofa.\nThe infographic was withdrawn after going viral on social media and facing criticism for being \"sexist\".\nThe government said the ad did \"not reflect\" its \"view on women\".\nCarrying the slogan \"Stay Home, Save lives. The new Covid-19 variant is spreading fast\", it was widely shared on social media earlier this week.\nThree scenes showed women cleaning, ironing and teaching children.\nAnother depicted a family on a sofa, mother and daughter curled up beside a man who has his feet on the ground.\nCommenting on Instagram, Lorraine Candy, former editor of Sunday Times Style Magazine who reported on the advert, along with Glamour magazine, said: \"Are there no intelligent, smart women advising the government about this? I am perplexed by the lack of awareness.\" \nParenting blogger Anna Whitehouse said: \"Showing a man lounging about while women (and girls) 'do it all' may bear some truth but it can't be the blueprint from the top. How did this get signed off in 2021?\"\nFor Labour, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson said the advert put \"women back 'in their place'\", adding: \"How out of touch can this government get?\"\nConservative former minister Caroline Nokes, chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, also criticised the image, tweeting: \"Someone signed this off.\"\nThe prime minister's spokesman said : \"We have provided information for the public throughout the pandemic.[The advert] does not reflect our view on women and we have removed it.\"\nThe Advertising Standards Authority stipulates that campaigns \"must not include gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence\".\nAmong scenarios it deems \"likely to be unacceptable\" is one \"that depicts a man with his feet up and family members creating mess around a home, while a woman is solely responsible for cleaning up the mess\".\nAnother is an \"ad that belittles a man for carrying out stereotypically 'female' roles or tasks\". \nA report last November by the Fawcett Society, a charity campaigning for equal rights, found the pandemic was having a \"devastating\" effect on gender equality in the workplace, with women more likely than men to lose their jobs or be left dealing with childcare."

      "text": "Two-fifths of people say they are doing less exercise in this lockdown than during the first one in spring 2020, a large UK survey suggests. \nAbout a fifth of people say they are watching more TV, streaming more films and gaming more.\nMeanwhile a third of respondents are working more, but volunteering and time spent on hobbies has decreased. \nScientists suggest people have found this period tougher and are more focused on coping with their lives. \nLead researcher, Dr Daisy Fancourt, from University College London, said: \"It is not surprising that the current lockdown has seen fewer people exercising than the first, taking place as it does during the winter months.\n\"But this is still a cause for concern, as exercise can boost not just physical, but also mental, wellbeing.\n\"The reduction in time spent on hobbies and volunteering can partially be explained by the increased time spent working,\" she added.\n\"It also hints that the novelty of increased free time that came with the first lockdown has worn thin among much of the population, with many turning towards television and gaming to fill their time.\"\nThe study, conducted by University College London, and funded by the Nuffield Foundation think tank, has followed 70,000 people for more than 40 weeks. \nParticipants were asked how they spent their past week, and to compare this to how they spent their time in the first lockdown. \nResearchers say the overall trends suggest the levels of satisfaction with life has deteriorated in recent weeks.\nCheryl Lloyd, at the Nuffield Foundation, said some groups of people, including women and those on lower incomes, were more at risk from the mental health impacts of lockdowns.\nShe added: \"With lockdown set to continue for the foreseeable future, it is crucial that efforts are made to ensure people know how to access mental health support, and that this support is available to those who need it.\"\nThe government acknowledged last year had been \"exceptionally challenging\", and had impacted on many people's mental health. \nA spokesperson said: \"Mental health services have remained open during the pandemic, and the recently-launched Every Mind Matters campaign raises awareness of the guidance and support available to those who need it.\"\nMeanwhile Rosie Weatherley, at the charity Mind, said the organisation's own surveys had shown people's mental health had worsened during the first lockdown, with some people developing problems for the first time. \nShe added: \"If you notice changes to your feelings, thoughts and behaviours that last longer than two weeks, keep returning or are having an impact on your daily life, talk to your GP who can help outline the support that's available.\"\nParticipants in the ongoing study by University College London were recruited through adverts and social media posts, as well as from organisations representing a range of communities.

      "text": "A man said he felt degraded after being detained in a police car when challenged on his way to work by an officer citing Covid legislation.\nHis video of the events in Solihull on Wednesday has been viewed more than a million times on Twitter.\nIt shows Nino Romano, 21, questioned on his plans, before he is called an idiot and threatened with \"locking up\".\nWest Midlands Police said the officer's actions were \"unacceptable\" and there was no suspicion of any offence.\nMr Romano accused him of being \"power-hungry\".\nThe force said it had reviewed both the footage and police camera video of the challenge to Mr Romano and concluded \"conduct fell far below what we would expect\".\nA spokesperson added: \"[The officer's] manner was not acceptable, not the face of [the force] and we will deal with the situation.\"\nThe male officer was with a colleague and their duties were to ensure people adhered to Covid restrictions, police said. \nFootage shows him asking Mr Romano what he is up to and where he lives - information readily shared by the 21-year-old, who says he is going to work.\nBut matters take a turn when Mr Romano - on his way to catch a train to his job in nearby Birmingham - refuses to give police his name.\nThe government's website says police might stop members of the public to ask their name, their purpose in the area and where they are going, but people do not have to stop or answer.\nIt adds not giving the detail cannot be used as a basis for search or arrest if there is no other reason to suspect a person.\nThe officer can be heard saying that as Mr Romano had refused to give his name, he had \"reasonable suspicion\" he was \"telling lies\".\nWest Midlands Police said: \"[Mr Romano] explained he was heading to work - that's clearly a justifiable reason to be out and about and there was no suspicion he had committed any offences.\"\nMr Romano said when put into the police car he eventually gave his name, and was released without being formally arrested.\nBut he said the episode had left him \"annoyed\", and accused the officer of being \"power hungry\".\nHe said: \"I've just got used to it, that's how the police act to the younger generation.\n\"I think they targeted me because of the clothes I was wearing - a tracksuit and a coat.\n\"I'm going to carry on going to work, but the fact they feel entitled to stop people [is] a bit degrading; it's not nice at all.\n\"There were so many people around, why pick me?\"\nIn the video, the officer says that under virus legislation Mr Romano must provide his details, otherwise he will be arrested. He is then threatened with \"locking up\".\nMr Romano accuses the officer of harassment, and suggests he has been targeted due to his hoodie, and adds he takes issue with someone pulling him over.\n\"We're the police, we're not just someone, you idiot,\" the officer says.\nMr Romano then states \"just 'cause you're the police that gives you the right to stop anyone you want and get their details?\", to which the officer says \"yes\".\nOn saying the officer needed to be \"re-informed\" about the law, Mr Romano is put into a police car and told the matter will be settled in a police station.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "'Stansted 15' win appeal against conviction for deportation flight protest",
      "tags": "London Stansted Airport,Deportation,Stansted",
      "text": "Protesters who broke into Stansted Airport to stop a plane deporting people to Africa have won an appeal against their convictions.\nThe group, known as the Stansted 15, cut through the perimeter fence and locked themselves together around a Boeing 767 jet in 2017.\nThey were convicted of the intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome.\nThe Lord Chief Justice said they \"should not have been prosecuted for the extremely serious offence\".\nA spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"We will consider the judgment carefully in the next 28 days.\"\nThe jet they surrounded in March 2017 had been chartered by the Home Office to transport people from UK detention centres for repatriation to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone.\nThe protesters put their arms inside pipes which were then filled with expandable foam, and secured themselves around the nose wheel and wing of the aircraft, the court was told during their trial.\nThey were convicted under the Aviation and Maritime Security Act (Amsa) 1990.\nIn February 2019, three were given suspended jail sentences, and the other 12 were handed community orders.\nSitting with Mr Justice Jay and Mrs Justice Whipple, Lord Burnett said the protesters' \"conduct did not satisfy the various elements of the offence\".\n\"There was, in truth, no case to answer,\" he said.\n\"We recognise that the various summary-only offences with which the appellants were originally charged, if proved, might well not reflect the gravity of their actions.\n\"That, however, does not allow the use of an offence which aims at conduct of a different nature.\n\"All the appellants' convictions must be quashed.\"\nAt the appeal hearing in November, lawyers for the activists argued the legislation used to convict the 15 is rarely used and not intended for this type of case.\nThe Stansted 15's barristers argued that the Amsa law is intended to deal with violence of the \"utmost seriousness\", such as terrorism, not demonstrators.\nLord Burnett said in the judgement that it could not be established on the evidence in the case that the group's actions caused disruption which was \"likely to endanger\" the safe operation of the airport or the safety of people there.\nAfter the judgment was published, one of the protesters, Lyndsay Burtonshaw, tweeted: \"We got the judgement from our appeal for our terrorism-related conviction for the #Stansted15 action. WE WON!\" \nThe Court of Appeal's judgment in favour of the 15 underlines a fundamental safeguard in the law: You can only be prosecuted for something you've actually done - and that means the evidence has to fit the wording of the offence. \nThe crime the 15 were charged with had its genesis in the need to protect airports from terrorism - yet the prosecution didn't suggest at the trial that the incident was remotely that kind of attack. \nAnd the protesters insisted that despite their plan to stop the flight, they never intended to do anything that was likely to endanger safety at the airport. The three senior judges agreed that this critical test had not been met and so the prosecution was unjustified. The 15 may have created a health-and-safety risk by going onto the airport tarmac - but that was well below a genuinely dangerous situation that would have justified charging them with this very serious offence. \nIn a statement on behalf of the group, May MacKeith, one of the protesters, said: \"The nightmare of this bogus charge, a 10-week trial and the threat of prison has dominated our lives for four years.\n\"Despite the draconian response we know our actions were justified.\n\"Eleven people, including survivors of trafficking, who would have been deported that night are still in the UK.\n\"Mothers, fathers, colleagues, friends and family members are rebuilding lives the Government attempted to destroy.\"\nThe 15 are: Helen Brewer, 31; Lyndsay Burtonshaw, 30; Nathan Clack, 32; Laura Clayson, 30; Melanie Evans, 37; Joseph McGahan, 37; Benjamin Smoke, 29; Jyotsna Ram, 35; Nicholas Sigsworth, 31; Melanie Strickland, 37; Alistair Tamlit, 32; Edward Thacker, 31; Emma Hughes, 40; May MacKeith, 35; and Ruth Potts, 46.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

      "tags": "Companies,Fraud,Klarna",
      "text": "Last year, Glasgow-based Stephanie McDaid was surprised by a phone call out of the blue from her mum and dad.\nShe was puzzled when they said a parcel for her had been delivered to their house, her former address. The 26-year-old accountant hadn't done any clothes shopping online recently.\nShe arrived to find a Topshop parcel containing a black \"going out\" dress - not in her size - as well as an unexpected \u00a330 bill from buy now, pay later firm Klarna.\n\"I've never used any services like Klarna, so I was wondering what on earth had happened,\" she says.\nStephanie phoned the firm immediately and after a couple of questions, it was confirmed she was a victim of identity fraud.\nShe is not alone. BBC News spoke to two other people who faced similar situations but did not want to be named, and campaigners have raised concerns about how easy it may be to sign up for buy now, pay later services in other people's names.\nTo use Klarna's pay later service, which defers payments for up to 30 days, shoppers only have to provide a name, email, date of birth, mobile number and billing address.\nFraudsters had signed up for the service using some of Stephanie's details - but forgot to change the delivery address to their own.\n\"I was really lucky. Klarna told me [fraudsters] would normally try to order one smaller item as a test to see if they would get away with it,\" she says.\n\"Unless I had intercepted it, they might have carried on ordering more items and racking up debt in my name.\"\nWhile Stephanie was pleased that Klarna shut the fraudulent account quickly, she feels \"frustrated\" that this was allowed to happen.\nWhen signing up for Klarna's pay later service, customers undergo a soft credit check.\n\"I would have thought a search would highlight the fact they were using a previous address of mine,\" she says. \"I definitely think more protections could be put in place.\"\nIn recent years, the Swedish financial services company has boomed. Big retailers like New Look, H&M and Asos now offer Klarna as a payment method at online checkouts.\nCustomers can choose to pay for their goods in 30 days, split their payments, or they can pay with a credit or debit card which is processed by Klarna's software on a shop's behalf.\nBut critics of buy now, pay later services say such companies make it too easy for customers to fall into debt.\nAlice Tapper has been campaigning for tougher regulation of the industry, and is concerned about the levels of fraud she has come across.\n\"Since launching the campaign, these cases of fraud have been worryingly common,\" she says.\n\"This is largely thanks to just how easy it is to use these products and the little information required to access them. It's a honeypot for fraudsters and it simply shouldn't be this easy.\"\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is currently reviewing how the deferred payment market is regulated in the UK. Ms Tapper has submitted evidence to the review, which included concerns from several shoppers around identity fraud.\nKlarna declined to tell BBC News how many incidents of fraud its customers had reported in 2020, but a spokeswoman said that the rates were \"extremely low\".\n\"We work closely with authorities, merchants and logistics partners to combat any potential fraud that we identify,\" she said.\n\"We are constantly enhancing our anti-fraud measures and security,\" she added, citing the recent introduction of \"one-time passwords\" sent to a customer's mobile to verify some payments.\nKlarna also pointed out that for its instalments payment option, shoppers must supply a valid payment card.\nAmber Burridge, from fraud prevention service Cifas, says it is \"critical\" that shoppers stay on their guard when it comes to fraud, particularly in light of the coronavirus crisis.\n\"The continuing challenges around the pandemic and economic uncertainty have presented new opportunities for criminals to steal money and information from innocent members of the public,\" she says.\nThe organisation, which runs the National Fraud Database, says that identity fraud accounted for 60% of cases recorded in 2020. Victims under the age of 21 were also more likely to be impersonated for online retail products.\nSource: Action Fraud\nKlarna also said that shoppers are covered by its buyer protection policy, which means that any money is refunded to fraud victims.\nIt recommends that customers report any suspicious incidents to Action Fraud, as well as its own team.\nBut campaigner Alice Tapper is calling for more to be done. She wants to see buy now, pay later services regulated by the FCA. That would mean that customers could contact the Financial Ombudsman Service to resolve disputes with a company over fraud, for example.\nThe results of the FCA's review into buy now, pay later services are expected next week.\nBut that has proven too late for Stephanie McDaid, who says she would be hesitant to use any buy now, pay later firm in the future.\n\"I feel the whole process would just be tainted for me.\"\nHave you had issues relating to buy now, pay later firms?

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The EU is introducing controls on vaccines made in the bloc, including to Northern Ireland, amid a row about delivery shortfalls.\nUnder the Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to Northern Ireland without checks.\nBut the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson called for the EU to \"urgently clarify its intentions\".\nNI First Minister Arlene Foster described the move as \"an incredible act of hostility\" by the EU.\nThe EU invoked Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally overridden.\nIn a new regulation, the European Commission stated: \"This is justified as a safeguard measure pursuant to Article 16 of that Protocol in order to avert serious societal difficulties due to a lack of supply threatening to disturb the orderly implementation of the vaccination campaigns in the Member States.\"\nThe move comes amid a dispute over vaccine producer AstraZeneca's delivery commitments to the EU.\nThe bloc agreed to buy up to 400m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine last year, and on Friday the EU's drugs regulator approved their use for all adults.\nBut the firm said that due to problems at one of its EU factories, supplies would be reduced by about 60% in the first quarter of 2021.\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The UK government is urgently seeking an explanation from the European Commission about the statements issued by the EU today and assurances as to its intentions.\n\"The UK has legally-binding agreements with vaccine suppliers and it would not expect the EU, as a friend and ally, to do anything to disrupt the fulfilment of these contracts.\n\"The UK government has reiterated the importance of preserving the benefits of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement and the commitments that have been made to the two communities.\"\nThe prime minister spoke with Taoiseach (prime minister) Micheal Martin on Friday night and stressed the need for the EU to clarify its intentions.\nAn Irish government spokesman said Mr Martin was currently in discussions with European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen to express Dublin's concerns.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is a special deal to prevent the re-emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nArticle 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, agreed in the original withdrawal agreement, is essentially a safeguard that would allow the UK or EU to act unilaterally if measures imposed as a result of the protocol are deemed to be causing \"serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nUnionist politicians in Northern Ireland have been agitating for the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.\nThe government has been resisting this, insisting the new arrangements are not creating serious difficulties.\nThe EU's actions are seen as an audacious move. Unionist politicians are incredulous. \nThroughout the Brexit process the EU vehemently insisted there could be no border on the island of Ireland. For a while the entire trade deal hinged on this. \nBut now, to critics, it appears that principle has vanished over vaccines.\nIt begs the question, if the EU can decide to push this button on this, what else might they use it for in future? \nThose who strongly oppose the Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland will be pushing even harder now for the UK to use Article 16 to override parts of the deal for its own purposes, too.  \nThe EU's move should not directly disadvantage Northern Ireland, which gets its vaccine supplies through the UK procurement system.\n\"The government has contracts with AstraZeneca & others to ensure vaccines are delivered on schedule & guarantee reliable vaccine provision across the whole of the UK,\" tweeted Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. \nPoliticians who support the Northern Ireland Protocol have reacted with dismay, fearing the EU move could undermine the whole deal.\nLouise Haigh MP, Labour's Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, said the move was \"deeply destabilising and undermines the huge efforts being made to make the Protocol work\".\nFor her part, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the EU had placed a \"hard border\" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\"By triggering Article 16 in this manner, the European Union has once again shown it is prepared to use Northern Ireland when it suits their interests but in the most despicable manner - over the provision of a vaccine which is designed to save lives,\" she said.\n\"At the first opportunity the EU has placed a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland over the supply chain of the coronavirus vaccine.   \n\"With the European Union using Article 16 in such an aggressive and most shameful way, it is now time for our Government to step up.\"  \nArticle 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol is a safeguard mechanism. Similar measures are often found in a variety of trade agreements.\nIt allows either the UK or the EU to take unilateral action if the application of the protocol leads to serious 'economic, societal or environmental difficulties' which are liable to persist.\nIt doesn't define what 'serious' means, but Article 16 is only meant to be used in an emergency. So, the fact that the EU has chosen to invoke it shows just how seriously it is taking its vaccine shortages. \nBut how will the UK respond? If Northern Ireland could become a backdoor for vaccines to be taken from the EU into the UK, couldn't the same point be argued the other way round?\nArlene Foster clearly expects something to be done.\n\"I will be urging the Prime Minister to act,\" she says, \"and use robust measures including Article 16 to advance the interests of Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\"\nThe intriguing thing is that Article 16 doesn't, of course, apply only to vaccines.\nThere have been plenty of people calling on the government to invoke Article 16 to help alleviate the trade problems that have arisen between Great Britain and Northern Ireland since the beginning of the year. \nThat's because Great Britain is now outside the EU single market, but Northern Ireland is still following many single market rules.\nThis latest development means the plot thickens even further.\nSinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald described the EU's use of Article 16 as a \"grave error\".\n\"Our citizens need timely access to lifesaving vaccines not trade disputes,\" she tweeted. \"Now is a time for cool heads and solidarity.\"\nUlster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said the UK government should now invoke Article 16 in response to the EU's actions.\nAlliance Party leader Naomi Long said what was needed was \"maximum co-operation\", rather than \"obstructive behaviour\" from the EU.\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the European Commission's decision to invoke Article 16 was \"disproportionate\".\nLast week AstraZeneca said vaccine supplies would be reduced because of problems in one of its EU factories.\nThe shortfall is expected to be about 60% in the first quarter of 2021. The EU has also received fewer than expected doses of the two other vaccines it has approved - from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.\nThe EU has said AstraZeneca must honour its commitments and deliver the jabs it ordered by diverting doses manufactured in the UK. The company said its contract for UK supplies prohibits that, since it must fulfil Britain's order before it can send supplies made there abroad.\nBut an EU source familiar with the matter told the BBC that AstraZeneca's UK facilities were legally obliged to do so, saying: \"This is not an option, it is a contractual obligation.\"\nThe UK plants are not back-up facilities; they are part of the main network, the source added.\nThe company's CEO Mr Soriot said earlier this week that the contract obliged AstraZeneca to make its \"best effort\" to meet EU demand, without compelling it to stick to a specific timetable - an assertion disputed by the EU.\n\"There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear,\" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in an interview with German radio on Friday morning.\n\"'Best effort' was valid while it was still unclear whether they could develop a vaccine. That time is behind us. The vaccine is there.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Financial Conduct Authority (FCA),Personal finance,Reddit,GameStop",
      "text": "Regulators have fired warning shots over frenzied share dealing in GameShop and other firms fuelled by social media chat on sites like Reddit and Facebook.\nWatchdogs in the US and UK said they were monitoring activity and potential lawbreaking, and warned traders they risked facing huge losses.\nTraders should ensure they are familiar with all rules, \"including market abuse\", the UK's regulator said.\nGameStop is the focus of a trading war between amateurs and Wall Street pros.\nShares in the US bricks-and-mortar video games retailer surged again on Friday, ending 68% higher. Another stock in the traders' sights, AMC Entertainment, jumped 54%.\nThat bucked broader market trends, which saw all three main US indexes fall roughly 2%. For the week they were down more than 3% - the biggest weekly decline since October. \nSome share trading firms temporarily halted dealings on Thursday amid extreme volatility in GameStop, which has soared as much as 700% in the past week. AMC Entertainment and Blackberry, which have also seen huge trading activity, were among the other companies also hit by the restrictions.\nUK traders have also been sharing their thoughts and tips on trading chat forums amid mounting concerns about misinformation and share ramping. \nLondon-listed companies have also been the focus of social media attention, including publisher Pearson and cinema operator Cineworld, although the share price movements were minimal compared with the GameStop surge.\nIn a statement on Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said: \"The FCA is aware of the situation and continues to closely monitor trading in UK markets. UK investors should take care when trading shares in highly volatile market conditions that they fully understand the risks they are taking. This applies to UK investors trading both US and UK stocks.  \n\"Firms and individuals should also ensure they are familiar with, and abiding by, all regulations including the market abuse and short selling regimes in the jurisdiction they are trading in.\"\nIn the US, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned against illegal \"manipulative trading activity\". \nThe regulator added: \"Our core market infrastructure has proven resilient under the weight of this week's extraordinary trading volumes.\n\"Nevertheless, extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence.\"\nThe SEC also said it would review actions that could \"unduly inhibit\" and \"disadvantage investors\".\nThe war between amateur private investors and heavyweight firms like hedge funds centres on so-called short selling. Over recent months, hedge funds had made big bets that shares in loss-making GameStop would fall. \nBut an army of private investors, swapping tips on social media, spotted a chance for a buying frenzy that would push up the price and \"squeeze\" the hedge fund short sellers. \nMany private traders made profits - and losses - along the way, but their actions also dealt a big financial blow to hedge funds that spent billions of dollars gambling GameStop's shares would tumble.\nThe decision on Thursday by several brokerages to halt purchases of shares in Gamestop and some other firms  sparked outrage among investors, who accused the companies of working on behalf of traditional Wall Street investors who were losing out to the army of amateurs. Some disgruntled investors said they were preparing legal action.\nInvestor anger over their temporary ban from trading spread beyond the investment community, with rappers and US politicians on both sides of the Washington divide joining the backlash against Wall Street.\n\"This is unacceptable,\" tweeted Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat. \"We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit.\"\nHer tweet was shared by Republican Senator Ted Cruz who commented \"fully agree.\" Tesla founder Elon Musk, whose shares have also been a retail favourite, also commented on Ms Ocasio-Cortez's tweet, saying \"Absolutely\".\nMuch of the anger was directed atRobinhood, a new breed of broker popular among a new generation of younger, tech-savvy investor, but which has been accused of \"gamifying\" share trading. \nOn Friday, a Robinhood chat forum on Facebook was also removed for breaking its Community Standards rules, although the social media giant did not expand on the reasons.\nAfter the backlash, Robinhood late Thursday said it would ease the restrictions. The firm also said it had raised more than $1bn from existing investors to bolster its finances amid questions about strains caused by the buying frenzy.\nBut Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat known as a supporter of tougher financial rules, said the chaos was another sign of \"years of distortion in securities markets that have allowed the wealthy few to artificially inflate and deflate share prices and reap short-term profits while exacerbating wealth inequality\".\nShe said regulators must review the trades and make changes to ensure that markets \"reflect real value, rather than the highly leveraged bets of wealthy traders or those who seek to inflict financial damage on those traders\".\nKey to what's going on is \"short selling\" or \"shorting\", where a big investment firm such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall.\nThe hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit.\nGameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as \"failing\" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street.\nBut in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price.\nIf the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses - a process known as covering.\nHowever, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still."

      "text": "Online fashion retailer Boohoo is in \"exclusive\" talks to buy the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton brands from failed retail group Arcadia.\nSir Philip Green's Arcadia group fell into administration in November last year casting doubt over the future of its brands and 13,000 jobs.\nAny deal would be for the brands, and not the High Street shops.\nRival online fashion chain Asos is the frontrunner to buy Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands.\nIn a short statement to shareholders, Boohoo said the talks with Arcadia's administrators \"may or may not result in agreement of a transaction\".\n\"A further announcement will be made when appropriate,\" it added.\nEarlier this week, Boohoo sealed a deal to buy the Debenhams brand and website for \u00a355m. However, the price tag did not include any of the retailer's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce, resulting in up to 12,000 job losses.\nLast year, Boohoo bought the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse for \u00a35.25m. That added to its portfolio, which included the Karen Millen and Coast brands, which it bought from administrators in 2019.\n''Fresh from its shopping spree, snapping up the Debenhams brand and website, Boohoo is rifling through the bargain bins once more, this time at Arcadia,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\nShe said Asos had \"turned its nose up\" at Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton, leaving them for Boohoo to bid for.\n\"As an online-only fashion giant, Boohoo would be only interested in the brands, seeing little value in the store estate as the shift to digital sales intensifies,\" she said.\n\"So the rescue of the famous names, wouldn't throw a lifeline to the thousands of shop workers who are very likely to still face redundancy.'' \nArcadia's administrators had requested that final bids for the group's assets be submitted last Monday, with the auction expected to conclude at the end of January.\nArcadia's Evans brand was sold by the administrators to Australia's City Chic for \u00a323m last month.\nSir Philip Green is under pressure to use his own money to plug an estimated \u00a3350m hole in Arcadia's pension fund, which has about 10,000 members.\nLast year the retail tycoon had an estimated fortune of \u00a3930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\nArcadia employed about 13,000 people and had 444 shops at the time of its collapse."

      "text": "Scotland's finance secretary has defended her pay rise for public sector workers after unions called it a \"slap in the face\".\nIn her budget on Thursday, Kate Forbes announced a 3% rise for people earning under \u00a325,000, with 1% for people earning up to \u00a380,000 a year.\nShe said it was a \"progressive and restorative approach\".\nBut unions called the offer a disappointment after a year of working through the pandemic.\nThe awards announced during the budget speech for 2021-2022 were:\nSpeaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Ms Forbes answered angry criticism from various public sector unions.\nShe said: \" Our public sector pay policy is fair but is also affordable. I strongly rejected the chancellor's decision to freeze public sector pay in Sept but his decision has a material impact on the budget.\n\"In Scotland, we have taken a far more progressive approach to increase pay by 3% for the lowest paid and a smaller increase for those earning up to 80,000.\"\nShe added that other workforce deals were to be negotiated in the coming months, including  for teachers and NHS workers. \nShe said the award announced \"set the benchmark\" to say the Scottish government was grateful and thankful for the work of front-line public sector workers.\nShe added: \"We are recognising it in the form of a pay increase but we also have to balance it within our overall budget which is equally trying to provide support to business, keep the health service running and ensure our transport services are still running.\"\nShe said she would \"love to go further in many ways\" but that she could not overspend or borrow more. She said the pay deal \"had to be affordable\".\nSenior public servants' union, the FDA was quick to respond to Thursday's pay announcement.\nNational officer for Scotland, Allan Sampson, said: \"Faced with an opportunity to reward and repay public servants for their heroic efforts over the past year, the Scottish government has instead chosen to mirror the UK government's approach of restriction and restraint.\n\"Whilst we welcome the targeted support for those on the lowest incomes, this pay policy will create expectations of a 1% pay rise for many staff, and will be seen as a slap in the face to the very workers this government has publicly applauded.\" \nGMB Scotland said it \"would not amount to more than a tenner a week for most\".\nUnison Scotland welcomed the recognition for those on the lowest pay but said it fell short of a decent pay rise for public sector workers.\nTeaching union the EIS said it would seek further talks on pay, calling for recognition of the effort of teachers during the pandemic.\nGeneral Secretary Larry Flanagan said: \"Today's announcement of an effective pay freeze will be met with deep disappointment by Scotland's teachers, who have been working flat-out throughout the pandemic to offer as much support as possible to young people.\"\nHe said that politicians of all parties had repeatedly lauded the efforts of teachers during the pandemic.\nHe said: \"It appears, however, that the Scottish government is failing to match that rhetoric and instead is effectively seeking to freeze the pay of the teachers, rather than properly recognising their value.\"\nMr Flanagan added, \"Teachers' pay is negotiated via the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT), however, and as we have only recently submitted a pay claim for this year, calling for proper recognition of the value of teachers, we will be seeking further discussions in that forum.\" "

      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised the EU's announcement of export controls on vaccines produced within the bloc, saying such measures risked prolonging the pandemic.\nThe EU introduced the measure amid a row with vaccine manufacturers over delivery shortfalls.\nBut WHO vice-head Mariangela Simao said it was a \"very worrying trend\".\nEarlier WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said \"vaccine nationalism\" could lead to a \"protracted recovery\".\nSpeaking at the Davos Agenda - a virtual version of the global summit - he said vaccine hoarding would \"keep the pandemic burning and... slow global economic recovery\", in addition to being a \"catastrophic moral failure\" that could further widen global inequality.\nThe European Union is introducing export controls on coronavirus vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. \nThe so-called transparency mechanism gives EU countries powers to deny authorisation for vaccine exports if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU.\n\"The protection and safety of our citizens is a priority and the challenges we now face left us with no choice but to act,\" the European Commission said.\nThe controls will affect some 100 countries worldwide - including the UK, the US, Canada and Australia - but many others, including poorer nations, are exempt.\nHowever, the EU has been forced to backtrack on plans to impose restrictions on the export of vaccines across the border on the island of Ireland after outcry from Dublin and London.\nThe EU insists its controls are a temporary scheme, not an export ban.\nThe news comes with the EU in a very public dispute with drug-maker AstraZeneca over supplies, and under growing pressure over the slow pace of vaccine distribution.\nEarlier on Friday the Commission made public a confidential contract with AstraZeneca, the UK-Swedish company behind the Oxford vaccine, to bolster its argument that the firm has been failing to fulfil its promises to deliver to the bloc.\nThe contract stipulates that the pharmaceutical company would commit its \"best reasonable efforts\" to manufacture and distribute doses.\nAstraZeneca has blamed the delays on production glitches at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as the late signing of contracts.\nUnder the EU's new rule, vaccine firms will have to seek permission before supplying doses beyond the EU. Its 27 member states will be able to vet those export applications. \nVaccines produced by Pfizer in Belgium are currently being exported to the UK, and the EU insists that some of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced in England is destined under contract for EU citizens. \nThe EU is also in a supply dispute with Pfizer, which is set to fall short of the contracted vaccine volume for the EU by the end of March. Pfizer says the reason for that is the urgent expansion of its facility in Puurs, Belgium.\nThe EU is allowing some 92 exemptions from the export control regime, including: vaccine donations to Covax, the global scheme to help poorer countries; and exports to Switzerland, countries in the western Balkans, Norway and North Africa. Other Mediterranean countries such as Lebanon and Israel are also exempt.\nBut on Saturday WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told the BBC vaccines should be given to all vulnerable groups and health workers across the globe before each country starts giving the jabs out more widely.\nThis would mean wealthy nations, such as the UK, halting immunisations at home once priority groups had been vaccinated and instead helping with vaccinations elsewhere.\n\"We're asking all countries in those circumstances to do that - hang on, wait for those other groups. Rather than rushing to vaccinate one country, we need to be doing the lot and we need to be doing it together,\" she said.\nSo far 95% of all vaccinations had taken place in just 10 countries, Ms Harris said, while only two low and middle income countries had even begun immunisation programmes.\nThe EU is contracted to receive the following vaccine doses: \nThe BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says some EU governments are beginning to show impatience with Brussels, which had hoped its vaccination purchasing scheme would be a beacon of European solidarity and strength.\nThe Commission's laboured negotiating process, the tardy approval of vaccines by the EU's medical regulator and delays now in vaccine deliveries have left EU citizens demanding answers and action, our correspondent says.\nMarkus S\u00f6der, the Bavarian premier and Germany's possible future chancellor, told ZDF television on Friday that it was his impression that the commission \"ordered too late, and only bet on a few companies, they agreed on a price in a typically bureaucratic EU procedure and completely underestimated the fundamental importance of the situation.\"\nOn Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron questioned the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine, describing it as \"quasi-ineffective\" for the over-65s.\nThe claim was rejected by Sir John Bell, an Oxford University professor who was part of the team behind the vaccine.\n\"I suspect this is a bit of demand management from Mr Macron,\" Sir John told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. Asked if he thought Mr Macron was trying to reduce demand for the jab, he added: \"Well, if he didn't have any vaccine the best thing you could do is reduce demand.\"\nEarlier this week the EU indicated this proposal was coming down the track. It would be a \"notification system\" officials said. Nothing more than a way of showing transparency. \nThat has now turned into an export control policy, partly because of Germany's insistence that EU governments should be the ones to decide whether EU-based companies can export vaccines elsewhere. \nEU officials tell me that it's also been partly triggered by the deep suspicion of the \"vague justification\" given by AstraZeneca this week, when their chief executive insisted that the production problem was down to \"lower productivity\" at its Belgian plant. \nThis new system of export control could well affect British vaccine deliveries.\nPfizer currently dispatches doses from the Puurs site here to the UK. In future, Pfizer would have to fill in an export form and wait up to 48 hours for their export request to be accepted or rejected by the Belgian government. That decision would be based on whether the company could prove that taking that batch of vaccine to the UK would not affect the existing EU agreement."

      "text": "France has imposed new Covid-19 border restrictions, but has once again resisted a new nationwide lockdown.\nAll but essential travel from outside the EU has been banned, while testing requirements on travellers from within the EU has been tightened. \nPM Jean Castex said France's night curfew would be more tightly enforced and large shopping centres would close.\nBut the measures were seen as mild and favouring the economy. Some doctors fear they will not curb infections.\nThe new border restrictions will affect the UK, now no longer in the EU, but the French transport minister clarified on Twitter that hauliers transporting goods to or from the UK would not be affected. \nMr Castex said that from Sunday, apart from exceptional reasons, \"any entry into France and any exit from our territory to or from a country outside the European Union will be prohibited\".\nA number of countries are exempted, as they are not considered at risk. They are Australia, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore and Thailand.\nIn addition, arrivals from inside the EU, and several other neighbouring states - Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, the Vatican and Switzerland - will have to present a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.\nAll arrivals, not just by air and sea, but by land too, must comply with the test rule.\nThere are exemptions, including cross-border workers and hauliers, and other groups such as students, health workers and diplomats, although the list is not fully defined.\nThe new Covid variants are the main motivating factor, and travel to the UK, which has been hit by the UK - or Kent - variant, is \"strongly discouraged\".\nThere were few specific details about how the measures would be enforced, particularly on those arriving by road and having to provide test results.\nThe shopping centre rule affects some 400 malls and 25,000 businesses. Small traders were relieved not to be be included.\nThe other measures appeared more general, with French media saying they were fairly mild and an attempt to slow the virus without harming the economy further.\nFor now, schools remain open across the country.\nSome health sector experts were unconvinced the measures would be of use in controlling rising infections.\nMahmoud Zureik, professor of public health at the University of Versailles-Saint-Quentin, told French news network BFMTV: \"Unfortunately I fear it is too late. It is not enough.\"\nThe threat of a third national lockdown in France has loomed large all week, following warnings by top health officials that one would be needed amid high hospital rates and the spread of new variants.\nBut there is a lot of public opposition - more than 50% in an Elabe Institute poll oppose a strict lockdown, compared to 93% support last spring.\nMr Castex said in his televised statement on Friday a lockdown could still be prevented.\n\"We know the grave impact [of a lockdown]. Tonight, looking at the data of the past few days, we consider that we can still give ourselves a chance to avoid one,\" he said.\n\"The coming days will be decisive. Let's be very vigilant.\"\nFrance reported 820 new deaths on Friday, taking the total recorded nationally to more than 75,000. It has recorded the sixth highest number of infections in the world.\nMore than 25,000 people are in hospital with the virus - including more than 3,000 in intensive care - but Mr Castex said the health situation was \"better controlled in France than in many of our neighbours\".\nHealth Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran warned this week that the new, more transmissible variants were now \"actively spreading\" in France, despite the current restrictions.\nFriday's announcement also comes amid a growing row between the EU and vaccine companies about supply shortfalls. \nFrench officials say they have given first doses to 1.45m people so far, but delivery shortages from Pfizer and Moderna are further slowing their rollout. \nFrom Saturday, Germany has banned most travellers from countries hit hard by new variants. The countries are the UK, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini. \nThe move is expected to last until 17 February.\nAlso from Saturday, the Czech Republic has banned non-essential entry into the country, again to try to curb the new variants.\nPortugal on Thursday banned non-essential overseas travel by air, land or sea for its citizens for a fortnight.\nBelgium on Wednesday banned non-essential trips out of the country until 1 March.\nIn contrast, Italy said on Friday it would move more areas into less-restrictive rules from Monday, despite health officials warning it was risky. No areas would be classified as \"red\", which brings tough travel and business restrictions."

      "text": "The prime minister and Public Health England have both defended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, after Germany recommended that it should only be given to people aged under 65.\nDr Mary Ramsay of PHE said the jab offers \"high levels of protection\" against Covid-19, particularly against severe illness.\nBoris Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation.\nAstraZeneca said the jab's trial data supported efficacy in the over-65s.\nGermany's vaccine committee said the AstraZeneca vaccine should only be given to people aged under 65, citing a lack of sufficient data to recommend use among older age groups. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) is to decide on Friday whether to approve the vaccine for use across the EU.\nBut Dr Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: \"Both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19, particularly against severe disease. \n\"There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring.\"\nMr Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation, adding that the UK's watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), had \"made it very clear\" that the AstraZeneca vaccine is \"very good and efficacious\" and gives a \"high degree of protection after just one dose, and even more after two doses\".\nSpeaking during a visit to Scotland, the prime minister added: \"The evidence that they've supplied is that they think it is effective across all age groups [and] provides a good immune response across all age groups, so I don't agree with that [Germany's recommendation].\"\nAn AstraZeneca spokesperson said the latest analyses of clinical trial data for its vaccine \"support efficacy in the over 65 years age group\", adding that the firm was awaiting \"a regulatory decision on the vaccine by the EMA in the coming days\".\nAll of the regulators and experts in different countries have been looking at the same data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThat data comes from clinical trials, and those did recruit fewer elderly people overall. \nThat's because they started off first with younger volunteers to get results as quickly as possible, given the urgency to find out if a vaccine would work well enough to help get us out of the pandemic.\nThe scientists who ran the trials have always been upfront about this. \nBut they say there is other evidence to suggest the vaccine will work well in older adults. \nStudies show the over-65s have a strong immune responses to the vaccine. After receiving the shots their blood has plenty of the required antibodies that can fight coronavirus.\nThe UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now and should soon have more proof from the real world setting about how much protection the shots give.  \nProf Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the elderly should not worry about receiving the jab.\nHe said: \"I'm almost 65 myself and I would happily take any of the vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. We do know that it is safe in people over 65. \n\"They have much fewer side effects than younger people and it almost certainly provides substantial benefits in terms of preventing severe disease and reducing the chances of going into hospital.\"\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC's Radio 4's PM programme that Germany's recommendation \"just reflects different levels of caution\", adding: \"What they are basically doing is saying 'We'd like to wait a big longer and know a bit more before we move.\"\nProf Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: \"We have no concerns about the safety of the vaccine in any age group\".\nDr Doug Brown, chief executive of the British Society for Immunology, said the MHRA would have \"carefully scrutinised the evidence\" on the AstraZeneca jab before making their recommendation, and referred to its original report which stated that there is \"there is limited information available on efficacy in participants aged 65 or over, although there is nothing to suggest lack of protection\".\nHe said this reflected a \"need for more data\" on the effectiveness of the jab in this age group, but noted the jab had shown a \"good safety profile\" in all published reports.\nProf Jim Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, said German scientists had \"not said the vaccine is ineffective for over-65s\".\nHe added: \"Scientists often disagree about how much evidence is needed for any new advance and there is always more data to be secured.\n\"Normally this all happens out of sight of the glare of the media and not in a pandemic, but such debates are an important part of the scientific process that is familiar to anyone who has ever been through peer review.\" \nMeanwhile, the EU and AstraZeneca are involved in a row over vaccine supply shortages. \nAstraZeneca has previously said it could deliver only a fraction of the doses between January and March that it had promised to the bloc, blaming production issues at EU plants for a reported 50 million-dose shortfall.\nThe EU has demanded that UK-made jabs are diverted to mainland Europe to fulfil contractual obligations.\nHowever, both sides pledged to work together to resolve the crisis.\nBut Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said there would \"be no interruption\" to UK vaccine supplies.\nIt comes as the UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday, according to government figures.

      "text": "A man has admitted killing his mother by stabbing her 33 times in the family home in Aberdeen.\nJordan Milne, 26, attacked 59-year-old Carol Milne in Clifton Road in July 2019.\nHer body was found by her husband Norman, who was suffering from a terminal brain tumour and later died.\nMilne, who was initially charged with murder, admitted culpable homicide at the High Court in Glasgow due to diminished responsibility.\nThe court heard that in the weeks beforehand Mrs Milne feared for her safety because of her son's aggressive behaviour and constant demands for money.\nShe called police on 22 June 2019 as she was also worried he might damage her car or the house after she refused him cash.\nMilne told officers that his mother was overreacting to a minor argument over him drinking the last of the milk.\nTwo days later she phoned the police again.\nProsecutor Angela Gray said: \"She told the operator her son had mental health problems and that she needed to go to a psychiatric hospital, but nobody was listening to her.\"\nShe was told to contact NHS 24 and to dial 101 as \"on the information provided, it wasn't a life-threatening situation\".\nPolice spoke to Milne and his mother and it was agreed he could stay if he stopped playing loud music and helped around the house.\nThe court was told Milne and his parents watched a wildlife programme on 10 July, 2019.\nNorman Milne left his wife and son watching the television and went to bed and took a sleeping tablet.\nThe next morning, he found his wife's body lying on the floor at the bottom of the bed with a knife next to her. She had 33 stab wounds and had been scalded with water from a kettle.\nWhen quizzed by police Milne told them his mother was evil.\nMilne was examined psychiatrists and it was agreed he suffered from a \"mental disorder that had the effect of diminishing responsibility.\"\nJudge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Milne, who appeared via a video link, and sent him to the State Hospital under an interim compulsion order.\nDefence QC Brian McConnachie will give his plea in mitigation when the case next calls in April.\nMrs Milne's son Curtis said in a statement: \"The last 19 months have been harrowing. So many questions and not enough answers. How do you explain the feeling of having my mother taken away? Words will never explain the heartache, the anger, the pain and the sadness this has been left behind.\n\"I have lost my mum and my best friend. We love and miss her so, so much every day. I will never forget how amazing she was as my mum, as a wife, a sister and as a friend - and we want everyone to know what a special person she was and that she was taken from us all far too soon.\n\"My father dealt with a terminal illness. Following the tragic incident, he declined both physically and mentally and had no will to live. Sadly, he passed away this month and did not get the chance to see any justice.\""

      "title": "Covid: EU approves AstraZeneca vaccine amid supply row",
      "tags": "European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The EU's drugs regulator has approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine for all adults.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the AstraZeneca vaccine was about 60% effective in the trials on which it based its decision.\nThe move comes amid a dispute over whether AstraZeneca is breaking its vaccine delivery commitments to the EU.\nThe European Commission has published its contract with the Anglo-Swedish drug-maker, hoping to show a breach.\nThe bloc agreed to buy up to 400 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine last year.\nIn a press conference later on Friday, Astra-Zeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot conceded that it had \"teething issues\" in the yield of vaccine at some production sites.\n\"We're talking about biology manufacturing here,\" he said, adding - \"it's not like doing an orange juice.\"\nMr Soriot said AstraZeneca had millions of doses ready to ship to the EU, and was working 24/7 to increase capacity. \nThe European Commission has now given final approval for the vaccine.\nIt would have been very surprising if EU regulators had not given the go-ahead for this vaccine that they have been pre-ordering hundreds of millions of doses of. The UK approved it weeks ago, and millions of people in Britain have already received their first shot that should give them protection very soon. \nTrials show it is highly effective at preventing severe illness and deaths from coronavirus. But there have been questions about how well it works in people aged 65 and above, because there isn't as much data for that age group - fewer than 10% of the trial volunteers were in this age bracket. However, there is other evidence to suggest the vaccine works very well in older adults. \nStudies show that, like other age groups, the over-65s have a strong immune response to the vaccine. After receiving the shots their blood has plenty of the required antibodies that can fight the coronavirus. It will be up to individual countries to decide who - including which age groups - to offer the shots to. \nThe bigger question will be how soon EU nations can get large deliveries of the vaccine. Supplies of this and other Covid vaccines are in huge demand, but there is a limit to how much can be manufactured at pace. \nLast week AstraZeneca said vaccine supplies would be reduced because of problems in one of its EU factories.\nThe shortfall is expected to be about 60% in the first quarter of 2021. The EU has also received fewer than expected doses of the two other vaccines it has approved - from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.\nThe EU has said AstraZeneca must honour its commitments and deliver the jabs it ordered by diverting doses manufactured in the UK. The company said its contract for UK supplies prohibits that, since it must fulfil Britain's order before it can send supplies made there abroad.\nBut an EU source familiar with the matter told the BBC that AstraZeneca's UK facilities were legally obliged to do so, saying: \"This is not an option, it is a contractual obligation.\"\nThe UK plants are not back-up facilities; they are part of the main network, the source added.\nThe company's CEO Mr Soriot said earlier this week that the contract obliged AstraZeneca to make its \"best effort\" to meet EU demand, without compelling it to stick to a specific timetable - an assertion disputed by the EU.\n\"There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear,\" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in an interview with German radio on Friday morning.\n\"'Best effort' was valid while it was still unclear whether they could develop a vaccine. That time is behind us. The vaccine is there.\"\nThe European Commission said on Friday it had agreed a plan to introduce export controls on coronavirus vaccines. This means individual member states will decide whether to allow the export of vaccines produced in the territory. It will be in place until the end of March.\nThe controls will affect some 100 countries worldwide - including the UK, the US, Canada and Australia - but many others, including poorer nations, are exempt.\nEU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides told a news conference the aim was to ensure all EU citizens had access to vaccines, and to make sure all parties played by the rules.\n\"This approach is built on trust, transparency and responsibility,\" she said.\n\"Commitments need to be kept, and agreements are binding. Advance purchase agreements need to be respected.\"\nThe World Health Organization's Mariangela Simao, assistant director for access to medicines and health products, described the export controls as a worrying trend. \nThe EU also suspended terms of the Brexit deal allowing goods to flow across the Northern Irish border, arguing it could be used as a back door to the rest of the UK. \nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster branded the move an \"incredible act of hostility\".\nGermany's vaccine commission has said it cannot recommend the use of the jab in people aged over 65, citing a lack of data on how it affected this age group.\nIndividual EU countries are free to decide who vaccines should be given to, once they have been approved. \nHowever, the UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now, and public health officials say it is safe and provides \"high levels of protection\".\nResearch has shown it is highly effective. No-one who received the Oxford vaccine in trials was hospitalised or became seriously ill due to Covid.\nThe vaccine is given via two injections to the arm, the second between 4 and 12 weeks after the first.\nConfirming it had approved the AstraZeneca vaccine, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said that most participants in the test studies were between 18 and 55 years old. It said that while there were not yet enough results to show how the vaccine will work in older people, \"protection is expected, given that an immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines.\"\nAstraZeneca has said a US study will shortly provide additional data on the vaccine's efficacy in older adults.

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Has the European Commission failed EU voters in its all-for-one and one-for-all approach to procuring coronavirus vaccines? Are member countries now regretting they didn't go it alone?\nAs things stand, according to EU sources, the bloc looks sets to receive only a quarter of the 100 million doses it had been expecting from pharma company AstraZeneca by the end of March - putting millions of lives at risk. \nVaccine deliveries from another pharma giant, Pfizer, have also slowed down temporarily, while the firm says it's adjusting production methods.\nDwindling supplies of coronavirus vaccines have seen Madrid cancelling first dose injections for two weeks.\nRegional hospitals in Paris say they're in a similar position. They said they're delaying first dose appointments in order to ensure already-vaccinated citizens their second jab. \nPortugal has warned it could take up to two months longer than initially planned to complete the first phase of its vaccinations. \nAngela Merkel has scheduled a Monday video conference with Germany's regional leaders and representatives of vaccine manufacturers, after her Health Minister Jens Spahn warned of \"at least another 10 weeks of shortages\".\nCharles Michel, the president of the European Council (the man who represents EU countries in Brussels) said on Thursday he hoped delays in vaccine deliveries could be solved. If not, he said he supported the use of \"all legal means and enforcement measures to ensure effective vaccine production and supply for our population\".\nIn the meantime, the EU is trying to get some control over the number of vaccine doses leaving the bloc from pharmaceutical company sites. New powers for EU members to restrict exports of vaccines are expected to be made public later on Friday. \nAstraZeneca, BioNTech and Pfizer have EU production sites. Moderna completes its vaccines for countries other than the US in Spain, although the vaccine itself is produced in Switzerland, which is not an EU member.  \nBasically, Brussels wants to know if pharmaceutical companies are exporting vaccines or components needed to produce vaccines from EU production sites, in order to fulfil orders elsewhere, when those same companies have delayed supplies to the EU.\nOfficially, Brussels insists it doesn't intend to ban vaccine exports in the future. It claims the new powers for members states are for the purpose of transparency. But the situation is evolving.\nEU suspicions led it to ask Belgian investigators to inspect a factory - part of the AstraZeneca production chain - this week, to look into the company's claims that the dramatic delay in vaccine supply for the EU was due to production problems.\nBrussels also asked AstraZeneca whether vaccines produced, or partially produced, in the EU were delivered to the UK. The EU has also demanded the company divert vaccines made at its UK production sites to boost the supply to the EU.\nIn what at first seemed an extremely emotional attack on AstraZeneca, Brussels threw at the company the fact that it had invested more than \u20ac300m (\u00a3265m; $364m) to help it develop the vaccine and to produce it in mass quantities. \nIn reality, Brussels has yet to hand over a substantial lump of the promised amount.\nAnd some EU accusations just don't add up. \nTake the complaint that the bloc is being treated as \"second class\" by AstraZeneca. The fact is, when it comes to honouring its contract with the UK, for example, the EU signed its AstraZeneca vaccine contract three months later than Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. \nAstraZeneca has also claimed that it has a \"best effort\" agreement with the EU, rather than a 100% commitment that the desired amount of vaccines would be delivered by the end of March.\nThe UK has tried to stay out of the Astra Zeneca row, with the government focusing instead on the content of their contract with the pharmaceutical company. There have been public assurances from cabinet ministers that the UK supply agreed with AstraZeneca will not be affected. That was the really important thing, said UK cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, on Thursday, also adding: \"We will want to talk to and with our friends in Europe to see how we can help.\" \nSome EU figures bridled at comments by Mr Johnson this week that he didn't want to see restrictions on vaccines or their ingredients across borders. \nThey took it as criticism of the discussion in EU circles - originally championed, but later stepped away from, by Germany - of a possible export ban.\nPost-Brexit, relations are sensitive between the EU and UK - but by Thursday the European Commission was keen to spell out that its beef was with the pharmaceuticals, not with Downing Street.\nBut while there's clearly been bad luck with vaccine supplies so far, the finger of blame has also been pointed squarely - from inside the EU - at the European Commission itself.\nBrussels had hoped the EU's vaccination procurement scheme would be a beacon of European solidarity and strength. A stark contrast to the \"each country for itself\" impression given off by member states at the start of the pandemic, when EU countries closed off national borders, and Germany and France initially blocked exports of PPE equipment, much needed elsewhere in the bloc.\nA stark contrast too, according the EU, to the \"vaccine nationalism'\" it believed it saw in the US under President Donald Trump.\nEU diplomats say the bloc was \"desperate\" to avoid having one EU member state pitted against the other in an \"ugly\" national scramble to secure vaccine contracts for their own populations.\nBut the Commission's ensuing three-pronged attempt to sign a number of contracts with different pharmaceutical companies, at lower prices, ensuring more legal liability on the companies themselves, undoubtedly slowed the process down.\nThe EU is also accused of not investing enough in expanding production capacity.\nAn added complication was the initial suspicion from some member states of the motives of others, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands that are homes to big vaccine producers. Were they keen for the EU to spend more on vaccine procurement, so companies on their soil could benefit?   \nThe EU got there in the end with its contracts, amounting to 2.3bn doses, it says, but an online article from Belgium's RTBF describes the current vaccine situation as politically humiliating for the EU, especially after Brexit. \nIt says even though the EU managed to negotiate vaccine contracts as a bloc, even though it played a major role in the research and development of a Covid vaccine, it ultimately failed to achieve \"vaccine sovereignty\".\nEU defenders say it's a question of perspective and that smaller, less well-off member states are still relieved the EU negotiated on their behalf as they would have probably found themselves far nearer the back of the vaccine queue had they been trying to go it alone.\nEU officials also make the argument that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has been slower to approve new vaccines in order to be extra sure of their safety. \nDespite a week of rowing with AstraZeneca, for example, the EU has yet to actually approve the company's vaccine. By contrast, the UK government approved the vaccine a month ago. An EMA announcement is expected on Friday afternoon.\nDiplomats point to lowering levels of vaccine scepticism amongst the EU public this year, compared with 2020, for example in France, which has a pretty high level of anti-vaxxers. They attribute that to public confidence in the EMA.\nBut EU vaccine problems don't just lie in Brussels. \nSome member countries have been far more efficient at rolling out the vaccines they have so far received, than others. Denmark is held up as a poster child, for example, whereas Germany's popular Bild newspaper has criticised Angela Merkel's government for being a \"vaccination snail\".\nAnd that, coupled with a steadily climbing Covid death toll, has a definite impact on national politics - and EU solidarity.\nThis is election year in Germany. Under fire for the slow rate of getting vaccines into arms compared with the UK, the German government felt forced to admit it had negotiated a separate vaccine contract with Pfizer back in September.\nMs Merkel is obliged to wait with using those additional vaccines until all EU countries have received their allotted doses under the EU-Pfizer contract, but still...\nHungary, meanwhile, has agreed to purchase two million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. Since the EU has no contract with Moscow, Prime Minister Viktor Orban is legally free to start rolling out those jabs whenever he wants.\nPharmaceutical companies promised vaccine deliveries to the EU will greatly increase after March - but EU citizens look at the advanced rate of vaccinations in the UK, the US, never mind Israel, and right now the mood is fearful and sceptical.\nIn the initial race to find a vaccine, most countries spoke of the need for fairness. \nGlobal pledging conferences emphasised the importance of everyone getting the vaccine, rich or poor; wherever they live.\nBut now vaccines are available and with Covid still a huge health threat, the rush for jabs is proving rather messier than was hoped. At least in the immediate term."

      "text": "Pupils in England who have lost out on significant learning time due to the pandemic should be allowed to repeat a year, say education policy experts.\nCertain pupils should get the right to repeat a year of school, if their parents or carers agree, suggests the Education Policy Institute (EPI).\nHead teachers expressed interest in the idea but said it could only be open to \"small numbers\" to avoid a \"logjam\".\nIt comes after the prime minister said schools will not reopen before 8 March.\nAll primaries and secondaries in England were closed a day after the start of the spring term, except for the children of key workers and vulnerable students.\nThis move followed a patchy autumn term where thousands of pupils were forced to self-isolate at any one time, and schools were shut to most pupils during the spring-summer lockdown last year. \nSome areas have been affected worse than others by Covid cases, leading to varying access to education for pupils.\nAnd certain pupils groups, including those with limited access to digital devices and some with special educational needs, have struggled with remote learning from home.\nEPI chief executive Natalie Perera said: \"We are concerned that some pupils will have missed out on a significant amount of learning time because of the lockdown and issues with accessing learning from home. \n\"The government needs to consider urgently how it will support these students and, in doing so, it should also look at whether they should be allowed to repeat the school year if it's in their best interest.\"\nIt is not yet clear how long remote learning will continue as the re-opening of schools to all pupils depends on Covid-19 cases dropping significantly.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"We are interested in the EPI's idea of the right to repeat a year for students who have experienced extreme learning loss. \n\"In principle, this is worth consideration, but in practical terms it would need to be confined to small numbers or otherwise it would create a logjam in the system which would leave schools with more pupils than they could accommodate.\"\nThe EPI made the proposal in response to the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofqual's consultation on how exams will be run this year.\nIn early January, education secretary Gavin Williamson announced the cancellation of annual public exams, saying that grades would be awarded via teacher assessments instead.\nThe EPI called the government's plan for exams the \"least bad\" option but added there were still risks associated with the approach.\n\"Left unmitigated, these risks could lead to a serious failure of public policy, damage to the reputation of England's qualification awarding process, and harm to young people,\" explained the EPI's response to the consultation.\nThe EPI highlighted three main risks to the Ofqual/DfE exam plan:\nAs of 26 January, more than 70,000 people have taken part in the consultation, according to the DfE. \nA DfE spokesman said: \"Fairness to young people has been and will continue to be fundamental to every decision we take on these issues. \n\"We know how important this is to teachers, parents and students, which is why we have made sure everyone is able to have their say in our exams consultation.\""

      "tags": "Roman Catholic Church",
      "text": "The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland has said he would support a public inquiry into what happened at mother and baby homes across NI.  \nA Department of Health report on the homes was published on Tuesday.\nArchbishop Eamon Martin was speaking on BBC NI's The View programme on Thursday night.\nHe also agreed that victims of mother and baby homes should be entitled to compensation. \nArchbishop Martin appealed to anyone in Northern Ireland who has information on what happened to women and children at the homes to \"lift the lid on this stark reality and let the glaring light of truth shine in\".\nThe research into the homes was commissioned by the Department of Health and carried out by Queen's University and Ulster University. \nIt examined eight mother and baby homes, a number of former workhouses, four Magdalene Laundries and sought personal testimony from women and children with \"lived experience\" of the institutions.\nMother-and-baby institutions housed women and girls who became pregnant outside marriage and the laundries were Catholic-run workhouses that operated across the island of Ireland. \nIt examined a number of issues including whether a public inquiry should be held.\nThe findings of the research included details of how some were the victims of sexual crime, including rape and incest.\nRead more on the report's contents here.\nSpeaking on The View, Archbishop Martin said any inquiry \"will require a very firm legislative and statutory framework... in order to help these people understand their story\".\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster has said that there would be a \"new independent investigation\" .\nMeanwhile Judith Gillespie, who chaired the executive's independent inter-departmental working group on the issue, said a public inquiry was \"not off the table\" and insisted survivors would have \"agency in the process\".\nA man who was placed in a mother-and-baby home in north Belfast in 1945 has said Archbishop Eamon Martin's apology \"helps so much\". \nPeter Quigley was taken to the home shortly after his birth in Bethany Home orphanage in Dublin.\nWhen he was 42, he managed to trace his birth mother and met up with her on Mother's Day in 1987. \n\"It was quite an emotional experience, and such a joy to put all those pieces together,\" Mr Quigley told BBC Radio Ulster. \n\"I sent her flowers in advance for Mother's Day, my stepdad met me in the train station at Bognor Regis and we walked up the Linden Road together and I met my mum for the very first time.\n\"There was no recrimination, there was no regret, it wasn't perfect but it was just normal, healthy and good.\"\nMr Quigley said a full inquiry would be \"tremendously helpful\" because many people, like himself, need to get information and \"want to fill in the blanks\". \nA Londonderry man who was also born in a mother-and-baby home echoed that call and said there needed to be an investigation into how babies were transported across the border without \"questions being asked\".  \nBilly Scampton was born in Marianvale in Newry, County Down, in the 1960s and was then adopted from the Nazareth House in Donegal in 1962.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Mr Scampton said in the last couple of years he has tried to track down his biological family, but has never met his birth mother.   \n\"What still gets me to this day, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was very much a fixed entity in the 1960s, even before that, when we were born.\n\"To move even as much as a cow or a chicken you needed the proper paperwork, yet there was the likes of us being moved freely back and forward on what was an international frontier by individuals.\n\"There were more checks-and-balances put in place to move livestock across than there were to move babies.\"\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster told Good Morning Ulster that Peter Quigley's testimony of being placed in a mother-and-baby home was \"moving\".\nShe said it was important that people like him were involved in the design and structure of an inquiry.\n\"It will need statutory powers and a legislative framework to ensure we have access to everything we need,\" she said. \nHowever, she added that the form and function should be \"decided by the victims and facilitated and chaired by Victims Commissioner Judith Thompson\". \n\"It is important that victims must have ownership of everything going forward given that they were not in that position either as young women or the children of those women,\" she added.\nFollowing publication of the research earlier this week, Archbishop Martin apologised to victims on behalf of the church and asked for their forgiveness. \nHe reiterated his apology on The View on Thursday night, saying: \"I'm deeply sorry for the way you were treated. As a church leader in Ireland today, it is I who feels the shame that was placed on your shoulders.\"\nHe said the Catholic Church \"lost sight of the merciful Christ\" when they mistreated mothers and babies at the homes.\n\"The gospel I follow is about the dignity of every person, a gospel that calls me to reach out to the vulnerable and the marginalised.\"\nHe added: \"We clearly had obscured the light of the gospel underneath a fixation with a judgemental, authoritarian approach to our faith and it is extremely sad that at the brunt of that were often women and vulnerable, those who society was perhaps also rejecting and who perhaps would have wanted to find in their church some refuge, some solace in their church and didn't find it.\" \nArchbishop Martin also said the Catholic Church \"cannot shirk its responsibility for this, which is why I very humbly and sincerely offer that apology\".\nAsked if compensation should be paid to victims, Bishop Martin said \"definitely\".\nHe added: \"Victims will require practical support.  What I have found from talking survivors, often they aren't seeking money but answers denied to them in decades previously\".\n\"We have to find maybe a multitude of ways or memorialisation, recognition.\n\"If that means financial reparation and it is possible to do that in a way which is just and proportionate and takes account of the findings, I think all of us have to step up and play our part.\" \nThe publication of the report in Northern Ireland comes after a similar investigation into mother-and-baby homes and laundries in the Republic of Ireland, which prompted an apology from Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) M\u00edche\u00e1l Martin."

      "text": "The UAE, Burundi and Rwanda have been added to the \"red list\" of countries from where travel to the UK is banned.\nThe measure, aimed at stopping the spread of the South African variant, comes into force from 13:00 on Friday.\nBritish, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK will be allowed to enter but must self-isolate for 10 days at home.\nA number of social media influencers have visited Dubai in recent weeks despite the UK's ban on leisure travel.\nThey have insisted their trips are for work purposes, but the Department for Transport said any travel exemptions usually in place will not apply, including for business travel.\nThere will also be a flight ban on direct passenger flights from the UAE.\nThe UAE was the most popular long-haul destination in November 2020, with 84,500 passengers travelling to and from the country, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. Other popular destinations were India (54,000), Qatar (38,000) and Vietnam (36,000).\nThe new additions to the UK's \"red list\" means travel is now banned from 33 countries. \nFrom 04:00 on Friday all arrivals who have in the 10 days before their arrival in the UK been in these countries will have to self-isolate immediately, along with their households, and will not be eligible to use test to release - where people can leave quarantine early with a negative test after five days. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said passengers allowed to enter the UK would need proof of a negative test and a completed passenger locator form before arrival, or could face two \u00a3500 fines. \nBritish nationals currently in the UAE should make use of the commercial options available if they wish to return to the UK, the Department for Transport said. \nIndirect commercial routes that will enable British and Irish nationals and residents to return to the UK continue to operate.\nDubai Airport said all direct flights due to arrive in the UK after 13:00 GMT on Friday had been suspended and it told passengers booked on those flights not to travel to the airport. \nEtihad Airways also said all its passenger flights to the UK would be suspended from that time until further notice and it was working with affected customers to rearrange their travel plans. \nIt comes after the government announced a tightening of travel rules on Wednesday. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel said that people wishing to travel out of the UK will first be required to declare their reason for travel and prove it is essential.\nPolice checks at home addresses will be increased to ensure arrivals are complying with self-isolation rules.\nThe home secretary criticised influencers for \"showing off about which parts of the world they are in\", along with people who turned up at London's St Pancras station with skis.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson also announced that UK nationals and residents returning from red list countries would be required to quarantine in government-provided hotels, though the policy has not yet been implemented.\nOn Thursday, a further 1,239 deaths in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were recorded.

      "text": "Two-fifths of people say they are doing less exercise in this lockdown than during the first one in spring 2020, a large UK survey suggests. \nAbout a fifth of people say they are watching more TV, streaming more films and gaming more.\nMeanwhile a third of respondents are working more, but volunteering and time spent on hobbies has decreased. \nScientists suggest people have found this period tougher and are more focused on coping with their lives. \nLead researcher, Dr Daisy Fancourt, from University College London, said: \"It is not surprising that the current lockdown has seen fewer people exercising than the first, taking place as it does during the winter months.\n\"But this is still a cause for concern, as exercise can boost not just physical, but also mental, wellbeing.\n\"The reduction in time spent on hobbies and volunteering can partially be explained by the increased time spent working,\" she added.\n\"It also hints that the novelty of increased free time that came with the first lockdown has worn thin among much of the population, with many turning towards television and gaming to fill their time.\"\nThe study, conducted by University College London, and funded by the Nuffield Foundation think tank, has followed 70,000 people for more than 40 weeks. \nParticipants were asked how they spent their past week, and to compare this to how they spent their time in the first lockdown. \nResearchers say the overall trends suggest the levels of satisfaction with life has deteriorated in recent weeks.\nCheryl Lloyd, at the Nuffield Foundation, said some groups of people, including women and those on lower incomes, were more at risk from the mental health impacts of lockdowns.\nShe added: \"With lockdown set to continue for the foreseeable future, it is crucial that efforts are made to ensure people know how to access mental health support, and that this support is available to those who need it.\"\nThe government acknowledged last year had been \"exceptionally challenging\", and had impacted on many people's mental health. \nA spokesperson said: \"Mental health services have remained open during the pandemic, and the recently-launched Every Mind Matters campaign raises awareness of the guidance and support available to those who need it.\"\nMeanwhile Rosie Weatherley, at the charity Mind, said the organisation's own surveys had shown people's mental health had worsened during the first lockdown, with some people developing problems for the first time. \nShe added: \"If you notice changes to your feelings, thoughts and behaviours that last longer than two weeks, keep returning or are having an impact on your daily life, talk to your GP who can help outline the support that's available.\"\nParticipants in the ongoing study by University College London were recruited through adverts and social media posts, as well as from organisations representing a range of communities.

      "tags": "Stock markets,Reddit,GameStop",
      "text": "Amateur investors are responding with outrage after trading platforms curbed buying of shares in the US games firm GameStop and other companies.\nThe moves by Robinhood and Interactive Brokers follow days of frenzied trading that led to massive gains for some stocks. \nShares in GameStop dived by as much as 55% after the restrictions.\nIt is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants.\nMajor hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. \nBut they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites such as Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week.\nOther firms, such as AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry, also saw sharp gains. They were embraced by day traders after hedge funds bet against them.\nThe activity has drawn questions from regulators, who are monitoring trading amid fears of illegal actions.\nHowever, the amateur investors say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game.\nIn online forums they discussed legal action and accused Robinhood and other brokerages enacting their own form of market manipulation by restricting purchases of certain shares.\nRobinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev tweeted that the firm had taken its decision based on regulatory requirements, and said limited buys of the restricted stocks would be allowed from Friday.\n\"They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money,\" said 18-year-old Myron Sakkas of Coventry, a student at Warwick University.\nMyron, who has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year, said he had lost \u00a330 on Gamestop shares, which he owned for \"a couple of hours\" and sold when he saw what was happening.\nMyron said he had since been locked out of his account and unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the \u00a31,000 he has in it and call a halt.\nThough hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree, he said he was disillusioned by what he sees as \"market manipulation\" directed against people like him. \n\"When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,\" he added. \"I've got other stuff to do.\"\nKey to what's going on is \"short selling\" or \"shorting\", where a big investment company such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall.\nThe hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit.\nGameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as \"failing\" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street.\nBut in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. \nIf the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses  - a process known as covering.\nHowever, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still.\nAnd amateurs aren't the only ones getting in on the action.\nThis week, for example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\nIn the US, anger over the trading restrictions united politicians whose stances typically sharply diverge.\nSenator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is taking over as chair of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing about the \"state of the stock market\".\n\"People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they're the ones getting hurt,\" he said.\nRep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known for her leftist views, called the restrictions \"unacceptable\" and expressed support for a hearing, to which Sen Ted Cruz, a staunch Republican, replied on Twitter, \"Fully agree\".\nDave Portnoy, founder of the Barstool Sports blog, who has emerged as one of the most high-profile amateur traders during the pandemic, also attacked the restrictions, singling out Robinhood, which has cast itself as a platform aimed at making Wall Street more accessible.\nThe firm also makes money through fees paid by Wall Street firms that execute trades for its users.\n\"'Democratizing finance for all' except when we manipulate the market, cause too many ordinary people are getting rich,\" he wrote.\nAnalyst Neil Wilson said that Reddit chat threads, suggest the day traders' battle with Wall Street is personal. \n\"Among the many aspects of this story that are strange, what is so unusual is the peculiar vigilante morality of the traders pumping the stock. They seem hell-bent on taking on Wall Street, they seem to hate hedge funds and threads are peppered with insults about 'boomer' money. \n\"It's a generational fight, redistributive and all about robbing the rich to give to the millennial 'poor'.\"\nElon Musk, who has a history of feuding with short sellers, also joined the fight, tweeting: \"Here come the shorty apologists. Give them no respect. Get Shorty.\"\nA one-word tweet by the billionaire entrepreneur on Tuesday - he tweeted \"Gamestonk!!\" - had been seen as giving Gamestop shares an extra boost.\nThe fracas follows a jump in casual investing during the pandemic, which saw people stuck at home with time on their hands and limited places to spend pour money into the market.\nThe surge has produced ripples of worry on Wall Street, including concerns that inexperienced investors could cause bubbles in certain stocks or were dabbling in investments with risks they did not fully understand.\nRobinhood - which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new interest in investing - has faced particular scrutiny for the way its app has made investment seem like a game. \nLast year, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint accusing the company of marketing to inexperienced users and failing to protect them.\nOfficials said this week they were following the market battle.\nPress secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday President Joe Biden\u2019s economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was \u201cmonitoring the situation\u201d.\nMassachusetts state regulator William Galvin called on the New York Stock Exchange to suspend GameStop for 30 days to allow a cooling-off period. \"This isn't investing, this is gambling,\" he said in an interview. \"This is obviously contrived.\""

Good man. To be safe, he probably needs to pull it down a touch tbh...\"\nThe 235ft (72m) figure on the hillside above the village of Wilmington can be seen from the A27 which passes alongside it.\nSgt Carter said the carving is protected by law as a Scheduled Ancient Monument for its historical significance.\nHe added: \"On top of this, the figure is well known and enjoyed by the local community, and this criminal damage is an affront to those who work to maintain this heritage asset for the enjoyment of all.\"\nMark Harrison, from Historic England, said the organisation was working with police to identify the offenders, and would provide advice and guidance to the owners on restoring the carving.\nSimon Dowe, chief executive of Sussex Archaeological Society, said: \"We're incredibly saddened that someone has deliberately damaged the Long Man of Wilmington, this Scheduled Ancient Monument which has been in place for centuries.\"\nHe said the society was working closely with police and had already sent a team to try to rectify the damage.\nThe monument was given to the Sussex Archaeological Society by the Duke of Devonshire in 1925. \nAccording to the society, the Long Man has baffled experts for many years with theories about its identity ranging from a fertility symbol to an ancient warrior.\nDuring Word War Two, the outline of the figure was painted green to blend in with the hillside, as it was feared German pilots were using it as a landmark.\nIn 2015, it was targeted by anti-fracking campaigners."

      "text": "Most pupils in Northern Ireland will not return to school until Monday 8 March at the earliest, the Stormont Executive has agreed.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said the ongoing public health situation meant remote learning must continue.\nIt may also be the case that only some year groups go back to school on 8 March, if a return then is possible.\nMrs Foster said she recognised it would come as a \"disappointment\" for many parents and pupils.\n\"The kitchen table is no substitute for the school desk,\" she said, giving details of the decision at a news conference in Dungannon.\n\"It is also important though that we give people a clear view of what is happening so we thought it was important to indicate today that we would not be back before 5 March in schools.\"\nThe recommendation had been made \"relucantly\" by Education Minister Peter Weir due to the ongoing public health situation.\nSpecial schools remain open to all pupils, but only vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers are able to attend mainstream nursery, primary and post-primary schools at present.\nThat means that about 9% of all pupils are in school, with the vast majority learning and being taught remotely.\nIt was originally planned that pupils could return to pre-school, primary and nursery schools following the half-term break in mid-February.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill described the decision as \"difficult\" but urged people to \"stay the course\".\n\"We wish we could be more certain about a definitive date, but we will keep it under review,\" she added.\nThe executive's next review of the lockdown restrictions is scheduled for 18 February.\nMs O'Neill said evidence that the new variant of coronavirus detected in Great Britain was \"more common\" in Northern Ireland had contributed to the executive's decision to extend remote learning.\nAlthough the new variant was confirmed in a small number of cases before Christmas, Mrs Foster said latest estimates showed that \"about 40 to 50%\" of coronavirus cases in NI are now linked to the variant.\nOn Thursday, a further 13 coronavirus-related deaths in Northern Ireland were reported by the Department of Health, taking its total to 1,792.\nA further 592 people have tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. \nThere are 768 people being treated in hospital for Covid-19. Sixty-seven of them are intensive care and 57 patients are receiving ventilation.\nMrs Foster said Northern Ireland's R-number - or rate of infection of the virus - was continuing to fall, with the rate in the community currently sitting between 0.65 and 0.8.\nBut she warned that the number of Covid patients in intensive care units has doubled in the past month, reaching its highest-ever level this week.\nMs O'Neill said she was \"encouraged\" by the progress made in the vaccination programme, with 175,284 people in Northern Ireland now having received their first dose.\nThe online booking system for the 65-69 age group opened last night and vaccinations for those people will be available at regional centres.\nOn Thursday, the executive also discussed a proposal that staff in special schools should be prioritised for vaccination - but ministers have requested further work between officials take place on the issue.\nIf it is not possible for all pupils to return on 8 March, priority will be given to pupils in exam years, BBC News NI understands.\nThat would include pupils taking GCSEs, AS and A-level and BTecs - but it is not clear if it would also include Primary Six pupils who may want to sit the transfer test in the autumn.\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said schools in England would not be able to reopen to all pupils after the February half-term, but could do so from 8 March.\nOn Thursday, another 47 Covid-19-related deaths were recorded in the Republic of Ireland, taking its total to 3,167.\nThe Irish health department also recorded another 1,466 confirmed cases of the virus."

The tournament begins on 8 February.\nUnlike other returning travellers who stay full-time in hotel rooms, players were allowed out of their rooms for five hours a day to practice on court and exercise.\nA smaller group of 72 players were fully confined to their rooms in Melbourne, however, after coronavirus cases were discovered on their flights.\nEight cases have been linked to the event so far, including Spanish tennis player Paula Badosa.\nThe quarantine policy had prompted criticism from several players who were concerned about how it would impact their preparation.\nUS tennis player Tennys Sandgren and Georgian player Oksana Kalashnikova continued this criticism on Thursday, after saying they had learned their confinement would be extended by another day.\n\"It's also another day we can't practice,\" Sandgren wrote on social media.\nHe said he would have only three days of practice outside the room before playing a competitive match.\nMelbourne endured one of the world's longest lockdowns last year and many locals have concerns about the potential Covid risk posed by the tournament.\nSome players have acknowledged what Melburnians went through last year, and expressed thanks to Australian authorities for facilitating the event.\n\"Conditions were great for us, considering the circumstances,\" said Djokovic in Adelaide on Friday. \nEarlier this month, the men's world number one lobbied Tennis Australia for better conditions for players in hard lockdown. \nOn Friday, he said he had gone for a walk in a park: \"Just putting feet on the ground... just having the space, I think, that's what we all kind of missed.\"\nHe initially missed the first half of an exhibition match in Adelaide, after he pulled out citing blisters on his hands. However, he later returned to play the second set. The match had been part of a deal to allow him to quarantine in Adelaide.\nAt the same press briefing earlier, Williams said she was \"so glad\" her quarantine had ended.\n\"To be in a room with a three-year-old and being her best friend is definitely difficult especially after training and working out... it's like, oh my gosh, it never ends,\" she joked to reporters.\n\"We had a calendar in our room and every day we marked an X on the day that went by and a big circle on the quarantine ending day.\""

      "text": "The whole of the Western Isles has moved up to level four lockdown restrictions as part of efforts to suppress the spread of Covid-19.\nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman said \"quick and decisive\" action was needed following new cases on the islands.\nBarra and Vatersay were already under level four restrictions. The rest of the isles moved up from level three at 00:01 on Saturday.\nOne of the outbreaks is affecting Western Isles Hospital in Lewis.\nMs Freeman said the hospital, the largest on the island, was reaching full capacity and the isles had seen six new Covid cases on Friday and nine on Thursday.\nSome non-urgent procedures will be rescheduled but the hospital in Stornoway will maintain a full emergency service.\nThe Scottish government said lockdown was necessary to avoid the NHS becoming overwhelmed.\nIslands MSP Alasdair Allan said the new cases in the Western Isles included the UK variant of Covid, which has been \"accelerating spread\" of the infection in Scotland, and widely across the UK. \nIn the Scottish government's daily Covid briefing Ms Freeman said the numbers were high in proportion to the population of the Western Isles. The islands are home to almost 27,000 people.\nShe appealed to all islanders to stay at home and only leave for essential reasons.\nMs Freeman said: \"These cases follow on from quite a high number of cases two weeks ago including a significant community outbreak in Barra.\n\"All of that is placing significant strain on hospital capacity in the Western Isles health board area.\"\nIn her appeal to islanders, Ms Freeman said: \"Please don't wait for us to reach a view on whether or not we should act to move to level four. Please behave now as if that is the case.\"\nThe outbreak at Western Isles Hospital involves both patients and staff. \nThere are pressures on the hospital due to numbers of patients affected and the impact on staff, including close contacts also having to self isolate.\nNHS Western Isles has been offered support from NHS Highland and NHS Golden Jubilee in Clydebank to manage the situation.\nBarra, along with neighbouring Vatersay, entered level four this month following rising cases in an outbreak on Barra.\nThe number of cases recently reached 50.\nOn Thursday, NHS Western Isles said a new cluster of three cases had also been identified in Benbecula.\nIslands MSP Mr Allan said: \"This continues to be a an extremely concerning situation in the islands with six new cases linked to the outbreak at Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway - including the new UK variant of Covid.\n\"I have made the case to the government for the need to ensure adequate arrangements are in place while the hospital outbreak is dealt with.\"\nHe added: \"More hopefully, it is clear that vaccination is proceeding well locally, with the Western Isles one of the first parts of the country already giving first doses to the over 70s.\" \nRoddie Mackay, leader of Western Isles local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, said moving up to level four was \"disappointing but not entirely unexpected\".\nHe said: \"Our communities continue to make stringent efforts to protect themselves and others and it is imperative, now more than ever before, that we maintain and indeed - wherever possible - increase these efforts.\n\"While this will inevitably cause concern in our communities, we are confident in local resilience and commitment which will help us get through this challenging period.\"\nThe Western Isles along with Orkney, Shetland and some islands in Highland and Argyll have been under level three restrictions since Boxing Day, when mainland Scotland went into lockdown.\nUnder level three, six people from up to two separate households can meet indoors in a public place such as a caf\u00e9 or restaurant, and outdoors in a private garden or in a public place such as a park or an outdoor area of a pub. \nBut under the tighter level four restrictions, a maximum of two people, aged 12 and over, can meet outdoors for a permitted purpose if they are not from the same household.\nUnder both levels, children under 12 do not count towards the total number of people allowed to gather.\nFor large parts of last year, the Western Isles had recorded the lowest number of Covid-19 cases in Scotland.\nSeptember saw an outbreak affect South Uist, Eriskay and Benbecula. It was declared over at the end of October.\nThis month's outbreak in Barra was linked to socialising not permitted under level three rules.\nScotland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said earlier this month: \"What we are seeing in Barra is a good example of what happens when people let their guard down and come together.\""

While the UK may be in dire need of talents and capital, it should not have made use of the BNO passport as a 'political cover-up'.\"\nChina has also said the BNO passport will not be accepted as proof of identity and they \"reserve the right to take further measures\".\nHong Kongers use their own Hong Kong passport or ID card to leave the city. To enter mainland China, they need to use their Home Return Permit, issued by Chinese immigration, unless they use a full foreign passport and apply for a visa to enter as a foreigner. \nThe only time they might use a BNO is upon arrival into the UK, or another country that recognises the document.\nOn one level the row between China and the UK over British National Overseas passports is symbolic. \nBeijing dislikes Britain making it easier for BNOs to come to live in the UK.\nIt promised retaliation. So it is refusing to recognise BNO passports.\nBut many BNOs also hold Hong Kong passports and anyway, they don't need a BNO passport to apply for the new UK visa, just BNO status.\nSo, inconvenient but not game changing.\nBut on another level, the row could be the start of things to come.\nThere are reports that BNOs could be banned from holding public office.\nCould their voting rights be curbed? Could further measures be put in place that do make it harder to leave Hong Kong?\nChina's foreign ministry spokesman said it reserved the right to take further actions, so the chances of this row intensifying are real.\nThe British government is determined to live up to what it sees as a moral duty to protect BNOs.\nAnd the Chinese government is determined to prevent a potentially damaging emigration from Hong Kong. \nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the special visa honoured the UK's \"profound ties of history and friendship\" with the ex-British colony.\nAbout 7,000 people from Hong Kong have already been allowed to settle in the UK since July, the Home Office said.\nAlthough there are 2.9 million citizens eligible to move to the UK, with a further estimated 2.3 million dependants, the government expects about 300,000 people to take up the offer in the first five years. \nThe 7,000 who have already arrived were allowed to settle before the scheme began by being granted Leave Outside the Rules, which gives the government discretion over immigration rules on compassionate grounds.\nThose eligible for the new visa can apply online and will need to book an appointment to attend a visa application centre.\nAnd from 23 February, BNO status holders who hold an eligible biometric passport will be able to use an app to complete their application from home.\nThe visa fee to stay for five years will be \u00a3250 per person - or \u00a3180 for a 30-month stay - and there is an immigration health surcharge of up to \u00a3624 every year.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said the mobile phone app was to give applicants greater security amid fears they could be identified and targeted by the authorities.\n\"Safeguarding individuals' freedoms, liberty and security is absolutely vital for those individuals that go through this process,\" she said.\nThe BNO status was created before the UK handed responsibility for Hong Kong back to China in 1997.\nBefore Hong Kong was returned, the UK and China made an agreement to introduce \"one country, two systems\", which meant, among other things, rights such as freedom of assembly, free speech and freedom of the press would be protected.\nThe agreement signed in 1984 was set to last until 2047.\nBut the UK has said this agreement - known as the Joint Declaration - is under threat because the territory passed a new law in June that gives China sweeping new controls over the people of Hong Kong.\nChina has said the law is necessary to prevent the type of protests seen in Hong Kong during much of 2019. However, the law has caused alarm both in Hong Kong and abroad, with opponents saying it erodes the territory's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region of China."

      "tags": "Novavax,Coronavirus vaccines,Stockton-on-Tees,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new coronavirus vaccine has been shown to be 89% effective in large-scale UK trials.\nThe Novavax jab is the first to show in trials that it is effective against the new virus variant found in the UK, the BBC's medical editor Fergus Walsh said.\nThe UK has secured 60 million doses of the jab, which will be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England.\nMeanwhile, a single-dose vaccine developed by Janssen is 66% effective, trial results have shown.\nJanssen, a company owned by Johnson & Johnson, is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection.\nThe company said its initial findings showed one dose prevented 85% of severe cases.\nBoth the Novavax and Janssen jabs will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used.\nThe PM welcomed the \"good news\", with doses of the Novavax jab expected to be delivered in the second half of this year if approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the government said.\nThe UK has so far approved three coronavirus vaccines for emergency use - one from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, another by Pfizer and BioNTech, and a third from drug firm Moderna.\nThe Novavax jab, which is given in two doses, was shown to be 89.3% effective at preventing Covid-19 in participants in its Phase 3 clinical trial in the UK, and around 86% effective at protecting against the new UK variant. The jab's efficacy against the original Covid-19 strain was calculated to be 95.6%.\nThe Phase 3 trials - the final stage before a vaccine is looked at by a regulator - enrolled more than 15,000 people aged between 18-84, of whom 27% were older than 65, US firm Novavax said.\nIn the South African part of the trial, where most of the cases were the South African variant of the virus, the vaccine was 60% effective among those without HIV. \nStan Erck, chief executive of Novavax, said the results from the UK trial were \"spectacular\" and \"as good as we could have hoped\", while the efficacy in South Africa was \"above people's expectations\". \nHe told the BBC the manufacturing plant in Stockton-on-Tees should be up and running by March or April, with the company hoping to get approval for the vaccine from the MHRA around the same time. \nMinister Lucy Frazer told BBC Breakfast the government could not put an exact timeframe on when the Novavax jab might be approved as the regulation process is \"out of our control\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the new vaccine would be \"another weapon in our arsenal to beat this awful virus\", if approved.\nProf Paul Heath, chief investigator of the UK Novavax trial, said the trial findings were \"enormously exciting\", particularly because of the jab's efficacy against the UK variant.\nThese extremely encouraging trial results suggest another powerful vaccine against coronavirus could soon be within reach. \nIt works in a slightly different way to the ones that are already available - but does the same job of teaching the body's immune system to recognise and fight the pandemic virus. \nWhat is more, it appears to be effective against emerging and more infectious variants of coronavirus too - something scientists have feared might not be possible because the vaccines were all designed to match the original virus, not these new, mutated versions. \nProtection against illness from the new UK variant was high - around 86%.\nEven with the South Africa variant, which has undergone the most worrisome changes, it offered a level of protection similar to that given by flu shots against influenza.\nEngland's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said, if the jab is approved, it \"increases our future resilience\" against the virus.\nNadhim Zahawi, the UK minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said he was \"particularly thrilled\" to see the positive results as he had taken part in Novavax's trials himself.\nIn total, the UK has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 40 million of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - both are currently being rolled out in the UK. \nAnother 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which was approved by the MHRA in early January, are expected in the spring. \nThe aim is to give everyone in the top four priority groups - up to 15 million people - a first dose by mid-February.\nPfizer and Moderna vaccines rely on technology that has not been used in previous vaccines, but the Novavax jab uses a more traditional method of recreating part of the spike protein of the virus to stimulate the immune system.\nLike the Oxford vaccine, the Novavax jab can be stored at regular fridge temperature - which means it can be distributed more easily.\nMore than 7.4 million people in the UK have so far received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest government figures.\nMeanwhile, the latest estimate for the UK's R rate from the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1.\nThe latest growth rate range is between -5% and 0%, indicating that the number of new infections is broadly flat or shrinking by up to 5% every day. \nSeparately, the EU's vaccine contract with AstraZeneca has been published, in a growing row over reduced supplies of their jab.\nKate Bingham, who used to chair the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, said the reason the UK had a good supply of vaccines compared with other countries was because of its ability to get clinical trials completed quickly and at a high standard through the NHS's registry - with some 400,000 volunteers signing up \"before the US even started their Phase 3 studies\".\nThe UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday. There have also been another 28,680 new infections.\nHow have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

      "text": "More than 60 suspected Covid outbreaks in offices were recorded in the first two weeks of the current lockdown in England, a BBC investigation has found.\nUnder England's lockdown rules, in force since 6 January, people should work from home if they can.\nPublic Health England figures, obtained via a Freedom of Information request, suggests offices have had more outbreaks compared to other workplaces. \nThe government has urged firms to help employees work from home.\nIt said it has worked with trade unions, businesses and medical experts to  produce \"comprehensive guidance\" to help firms that are permitted to stay open and it has introduced rapid testing of employees.\nThe data from Public Health England, obtained by the 5 Live Investigations team, lists the different types of workplaces where there have been clusters of cases.\nThe figures reveal for the first time which are the most susceptible to Covid outbreaks, with offices coming top.\nThe data showed there were more than 500 outbreaks, or suspected outbreaks, in offices in the second half of 2020 - more than in supermarkets, construction sites, warehouses, restaurants and cafes combined.\nThis has prompted calls for curbs on employers bringing non-essential staff into offices as well as demands from unions for tougher safety rules.\nThe rules for England state that \"you may only leave your home for work if you cannot reasonably work from home\".\nThe list of people who may still travel to work includes healthcare professionals, teachers, childcare providers, transport workers, people who work in construction or manufacturing, funeral directors, and essential retail workers.\nHowever, the Health and Safety Executive received nearly 4,000 Covid-related complaints about workplaces in January. \n\"It's likely I got ill at work,\" says call centre worker Dan, not his real name, who contracted Covid this month and passed the virus to his girlfriend.\nHe works in the Bristol office of outsourcing firm Woven - where he says up to 30 people can work on his floor.\nHe says they hot-desk, share toilets and the windows are always closed.\nMany of his colleagues have worked in the office throughout the pandemic and several have had Covid, Dan says.\n\"We've had five or six cases in the office and still everybody is being asked to come into work to answer calls,\" he says.\nWoven said it had been working on its IT infrastructure for several months to allow more employees to work from home.\n\"Our primary concern is the health and wellbeing of our colleagues,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"We have worked closely with Public Health England since the start of the pandemic to implement extensive safety measures in line with government advice.\"\nAlthough clinically vulnerable workers have been told not to attend work, their family members have no such protection.\nMichelle, not her real name, works in an office for Greater Manchester Police, where she says there have been multiple Covid cases.\n\"If I bring Covid into my house, there's a very real chance that my partner wouldn't survive,\" says Michelle, whose husband is vulnerable.\n\"It's extremely stressful for him as well as for me.\"\nThe office she works in is small and stuffy, she says, with police officers coming in and out throughout the day.\n\"I just stepped out of the office, and when I came back, somebody was sitting at the workstation on the computer and using the phone with no mask,\" Michelle says.\n\"I was really angry and very upset.\"\nMichelle, who was not expected to come in during last year's first national lockdown - when people could only travel to work if it was \"absolutely necessary\" - cannot do her job from home.\nShe feels it is unfair that she is made to work in the office because of the risk posed to her husband.\n\"I perceive myself to be vulnerable due to the fact that I have a vulnerable partner,\" she says.\nIn a statement, Greater Manchester Police said the health safety of its workers was a priority and it had taken a \"proactive approach to keep our officers and staff safe in the workplace\".\nThe force said it follows the latest government advice regarding staff living with vulnerable people and is doing all it can to try to support them.\nAll of its buildings are \"Covid-secure\", the statement added, and staff can raise any concerns in a number of ways. \nProf Phil Taylor, who has spent years researching call centre and office work, says offices provide the perfect environment for Covid to spread.\n\"They have high occupational densities with little social distancing and are often sealed, with air con just recirculating pathogens like Covid,\" said Prof Taylor, from the University of Strathclyde.\n\"Hot-desking is commonplace and cleansing is hit and miss. It's a toxic combination.\"\nIn a modern building where the windows are sealed, occupants rely on a ventilation system in which stale air is extracted from the rooms and piped to an air handling unit, often on the roof.\nThere, fresh air can be pulled in from outside and mixed with the old inside air, before being sent back into the building.\nThe professional advice is to maximise the fresh supply - but the mix of outside and inside air will be determined by the building's managers.\nProf Cath Noakes, who sits on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee, said poorly ventilated offices could increase the chances of contracting Covid from tiny airborne particles by up to 70%.\nTUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"Everyone has the right to be safe at work. But Boris Johnson and his ministers have failed to get a grip on Covid safety in workplaces.\"\nLabour called on the government  to \"urgently\" strengthen workplace safety rules.\n\"To help prevent the spread of the virus, the government must clarify the stay at home message, rewrite outdated workplace safety rules and strengthen health and safety enforcement,\" Labour's shadow secretary for employment rights and protections Andy McDonald said.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We continue to reinforce the stay at home messaging to businesses and the overwhelming majority are doing the right thing, but we need all employers to act responsibly and take every possible step to help their employees work from home.\"\nHow have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The European Commission has published its contract with drug-maker AstraZeneca to buy the company's Covid vaccine, amid a row over supplies.\nThe move, agreed with AstraZeneca, came hours after Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen increased pressure on the firm over its decision to cut supplies.\nThe contract signed in August contained \"binding orders\", she told German radio, and called for an explanation. \nThe vaccine was approved by the EU medicines regulator on Friday.\nThe EU wanted to publish the contract to bolster its argument that the company had reneged on its commitments. \nThe company's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said in an interview earlier this week that the contract obliged AstraZeneca to make its \"best effort\" to meet EU demand, without compelling the company to stick to a specific timetable.\nLarge sections of the contract have been blanked out - redacted - to protect sensitive information.\nThese include some paragraphs dealing with costs, guaranteed delivery dates and intellectual property.\nThe August deal was for 300 million doses for the EU, to be delivered after regulatory approval, with an option for 100 million more. \nBut EU sources say they now expect to get only about a quarter of the 100 million vaccines they were expecting to receive by March, a shortfall of about 75 million jabs.\nThe EU is under pressure after criticism that the pace of vaccinations in several member states has been too slow. \nAstraZeneca says the production problems are at its plants in the Netherlands and Belgium.\nSupplies of another vaccine, produced by Pfizer-BioNTech, have also dropped due to production issues.  \nEU officials say AstraZeneca has been asked to send some doses manufactured in the UK to the continent to make up the shortfall, but the company said on Wednesday that its contract for UK supplies prevented this.\nAn EU source familiar with the talks told the BBC that AstraZeneca's UK facilities were obliged to supply vaccine to the EU.\n\"This is not an option, it is a contractual obligation\u2026 a declaration by AstraZeneca as to where the drug substance manufacturing will take place.\" The UK plants are not back-up facilities; they are part of the main network, the source added.\n\"There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear,\" Mrs von der Leyen said in Friday morning's radio interview. \n\"'Best effort' was valid while it was still unclear whether they could develop a vaccine. That time is behind us. The vaccine is there. \n\"AstraZeneca has also explicitly assured us in this contract that no other obligations would prevent the contract from being fulfilled,\" she said. \nThe BBC's Europe correspondent, Gavin Lee, says it may come down to specialist legal interpretation, and some fine tooth-combing, to understand who's right.\nAstraZeneca has found itself in a deeply uncomfortable position in this fight over vaccine supply.\nThe heavily redacted publication - agreed by both sides - of its contract with the EU does not settle the issue of who is at fault.\nAs one source told me - \"Neither side would have published this if either side thought it was legally conclusive. AstraZeneca are working hard to find a solution to a row that serves no-one\".\nThe problem with vaccine production is that it is a biological process that can't be hurried. \nA source close to the company said they knew vaccine nationalism was a danger. That's why, they claim, different contracts were tied to separate manufacturing bases. That is disputed by the EU. \nSo what happens next? The thought of going to court horrifies everyone involved; a needless and unseemly sideshow in the face of the real battle against the virus.\nBut suggestions that UK manufactured vaccines would be redirected to EU countries were downplayed by company insiders.\nOne final thought expressed was that while it was convenient for the European Commission to cast AstraZeneca as the villain - that would only work for so long, before member states started directing their displeasure at the Commission itself.\nA spokesman for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson would not comment on Friday on any contractual arrangements between the UK and AstraZeneca, or whether they may conflict with the company's agreement with the EU.\nThe spokesman said only that the UK remained \"confident in our supply of vaccines\" and that it was committed to its vaccine rollout plan.\nBut EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders has warned of a \"vaccine war\". \nSpeaking on Belgian radio, he said: \"The EU Commission has pushed to co-ordinate the vaccines contracts on behalf of the 27 precisely to avoid a vaccines war between EU countries, but maybe the UK wants to start a vaccine war?\n\"Solidarity is an important principle of the EU. With Brexit, it's clear that the UK doesn't want to show solidarity with anyone.\"\nOn Friday, the EU confirmed it was introducing export controls on coronavirus vaccines made in the bloc, to try to ease the shortfalls.\nVaccinations in parts of Europe are already being held up and in some cases halted because of a cut in deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine:"

      "text": "A visa scheme to allow Hong Kong residents to come to the UK opens on Sunday, with some 300,000 people expected to apply. \nThe visa, which is open to holders of a British National (Overseas) passport and their immediate dependents, will offer a fast track to UK citizenship.\nBut the Chinese foreign ministry said it would no longer recognise the BNO passport as a travel document.\nThe UK launched the new visa after China imposed a new security law.\nThose who apply and secure the visa will be able to apply for settlement after five years and then British citizenship after a further 12 months.\nBeijing has previously warned the UK not to meddle in domestic issues.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the move honoured the UK's \"profound ties of history and friendship\" with the ex-British colony.\nAbout 7,000 people from Hong Kong have already been allowed to settle in the UK since July, the Home Office said.\nAlthough there are 2.9 million citizens eligible to move to the UK, with a further estimated 2.3 million dependents, the government expects about 300,000 people to take up the offer in the first five years. \nThe 7,000 who have already arrived were allowed to settle before the scheme began by being granted Leave Outside the Rules, which gives the government discretion over immigration rules on compassionate grounds.\nMr Johnson said: \"I am immensely proud that we have brought in this new route for Hong Kong BNOs to live, work and make their home in our country.\n\"In doing so we have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy - values both the UK and Hong Kong hold dear.\" \nChinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian called the scheme a violation of China's sovereignty and gross interference in Hong Kong and China's internal affairs, the country's state-affiliated news website The Paper reported.  \n\"The British side disregarded the fact that Hong Kong returned to China 24 years ago,\" he said. \nChina will no longer recognise the BNO passport from Sunday. It is not yet clear what this move will mean. \nHong Kongers use their own Hong Kong passport or ID card to leave the city. To enter mainland China, they need to use their Home Return Permit, issued by Chinese immigration, unless they use a full foreign passport and apply for a visa to enter as a foreigner. \nThe only time they might use a BNO is upon arrival into the UK, or another country that recognises the document.\nThe new visa system helping British nationals escape Hong Kong is perhaps the clearest example yet of the government's promise to be a force for good in the world.\nIt is one thing to condemn oppression. It is another to do something about it.\nAnd here the UK is delivering on a promise made more than two decades ago to those it has a duty to protect.\nBut there are questions.\nWhat support are these migrants going to have?\nIn the long term they may well enrich Britain's economy and culture, but in the short term, they will need help.\nWhere are they going to live? Where are they going to find jobs? What if more than the predicted 300,000 or so come in the first five years? How will people in Britain respond to seeing their borders opened up?\nAnd above all, how will China retaliate, as they have promised? Will Beijing ban BNOs from public office, from voting or even from leaving? What will the UK do then? \nThose eligible for the new visa can apply online and will need to book an appointment to attend a visa application centre.\nAnd from 23 February, BNO status holders who hold an eligible biometric passport will be able to use an app to complete their application from home.\nThe visa fee to stay for five years will be \u00a3250 per person - or \u00a3180 for a 30-month stay - and there is an immigration health surcharge of up to \u00a3624-a-year.\nNathan Law, a pro-democracy campaigner who fled Hong Kong and now lives in exile in the UK, welcomed the announcement. \n\"It's a commitment to the historical agreement to Hong Kong and I think it's important that we offer safe exit for the people who are facing political suppression in Hong Kong,\" he told the BBC.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said this was to give applicants greater security amid fears they could be identified and targeted by the authorities.\n\"Safeguarding individuals' freedoms, liberty and security is absolutely vital for those individuals that go through this process,\" she said.\nThe BNO status was created before the UK handed responsibility for Hong Kong back to China in 1997.\nBefore Hong Kong was returned, the UK and China made an agreement to introduce \"one country, two systems\", which meant, among other things, rights such as freedom of assembly, free speech and freedom of the press would be protected.\nThe agreement signed in 1984 was set to last until 2047.\nBut the UK has said this agreement - known as the Joint Declaration - is under threat because the territory passed a new law in June that gives China sweeping new controls over the people of Hong Kong.\nChina has said the law is necessary to prevent the type of protests seen in Hong Kong during much of 2019.

The Kremlin denies involvement. \nAn associate of Mr Navalny's has released a list of eight individuals drawn up by the opposition leader whom he says should face sanctions in order to put pressure on President Putin. \nMr Abramovich, who bought Chelsea in 2003, and former Arsenal shareholder Mr Usmanov, who owns a company that sponsors Everton, and who has links with the club's majority shareholder, were both included. \nThey were described in the list as being among \"key enablers and beneficiaries of Russian kleptocracy, with significant ties/assets in the West\".\nDuring an emergency debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge said: \"The best way we can show our support for Alexei Navalny is not by words but by actions.\"\n\"Navalny himself has said he wants the international community to use sanctions against complicit Russian kleptocrats who live outside Russia.\n\"He has named Abramovich and Usmanov, both of whom have significant wealth, property and links to English football clubs. \n\"But on Facebook Navalny has said that the sanctions haven't worked, because the West has refrained from sanctioning the people with the money.\"\nAsked to comment, a spokesman for Mr Abramovich said there was \"no foundation\" to Mr Navalny's claims.\nForeign Office Minister Wendy Morton said: \"We continue to work and protect human rights and civil society in Russia. We are considering all options for further action... it would be inappropriate for me to speculate on any future listings.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats have urged the government to consider sanctions. \nLayla Moran, the party's foreign affairs spokesperson, said: \"Navalny's team have released a list of names drawn up by Navalny just days before his return and arrest, which included Abramovich and Usmanov.\"\n\"Both individuals were described as key enablers with significant ties and assets in the West.\"\nRepresentatives for Mr Usmanov declined to comment. \nBoth men have always insisted their businesses are legitimate.

      "text": "A major search operation for three men missing on a fishing boat off north Wales has been called off \"pending further information\".\nThe crew, missing since Wednesday, has been named as Alan Minard, Ross Ballantine and skipper Carl McGrath.\nThe three men were working on the Nicola Faith, which failed to return from a fishing trip in the Irish Sea.\n\"I just want him to be home and safe,\" Mr McGrath's girlfriend Amy Lamb told the Conwy Nub News.\nSpeaking after the search was called off on Friday, HM Coastguard's Rob Priestley said: \"We have carried out highly-concentrated and thorough searches of wide areas off the north coast of Wales to locate this vessel - using all available resources - but, sadly, nothing has been found so far.\n\"Our thoughts are with the family and friends and the wider community at this difficult time.\"\nMr Priestley thanked all agencies and people involved in the search, including people who used their private vessels to help.\nThe 10m (33ft) fishing vessel was expected back at Conwy port late on Wednesday night.\nThe coastguard said the alarm was raised on Thursday at 10:00 GMT and a major operation, including seven RNLI lifeboat crews and three coastguard search teams, was launched.\nRescue teams said the fishing vessel was last seen at 22:00 on Wednesday night off Rhos-on-Sea - east of Conwy and Llandudno in Liverpool Bay.\nThe search - covering hundreds of square miles - resumed off the north Wales coast at first light on Friday after it was suspended overnight.\n\"I don't think anybody understands until they are put into that situation,\" added Ms Lamb.\n\"I'm heartbroken. I just want him to come back. He usually goes out between Rhos and Conwy.\n\"He's been doing the job for about four years now, so he is very handy. He knows exactly what he's doing and he's absolutely fantastic at his job. He is probably one of the best fishermen in Conwy.\n\"He was a builder originally and he built the boat himself and then became a fisherman and just excelled from there really.\n\"He's experienced in these situations. I'm so confused of where he would be as he would know what to do.\"\nRelatives and friends of Mr McGrath, 34, Mr Minard, 20, and Mr Ballantine, 39, who are all from the Conwy area, had been keeping a vigil at Llandudno's RNLI lifeboat station.\nMs Lamb's sister Hannah said it had been \"the worst three days ever\" for the fishermen's family and friends.\n\"We don't know what to do with ourselves - we feel helpless,\" she said.\nCoastguard rescue teams from Bangor, Llandudno, Flint and Rhyl helped in the sea search along with two lifeboats from both Rhyl and Llandudno stations and another RNLI boat from Hoylake, Wirral.\nLlandudno RNLI lifeboat operations manager Marcus Elliot said conditions for lifeboat crews had been \"cold and wet\".\n\"The weather has not been good and it just brings it home what these boys will do, and unfortunately, their efforts this time have not so far resulted in any positive information.\"\nFriends of the missing crew had been helping scour the local coastline for any possible debris that may have drifted ashore.\nThe family of Mr Minard, from Penmaenmawr, said he had been working in Devon as an apprentice ship's engineer. \nHe had only been working on the Nicola Faith for a few weeks, having moved home because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMr Minard's family said they believed the crew were dropping lobster pots when they went fishing on Wednesday.\nThey hoped the boat had broken down and merely drifted beyond the search area.\nAs well as a coastguard search and rescue helicopter from Caernarfon, a fixed-wing coastguard aircraft also took part in the operation.\nThe RNLI lifeboat from Beaumaris also searched around the Puffin Island area off the Anglesey coast on Thursday. \nRhyl RNLI volunteer Paul Frost said the search operation covered a huge area, adding: \"It is literally hundreds of square miles, the area searched is something like 30 miles across by about 15 miles out as well. \n\"That's why so many resources have been utilised to try and search the area adequately.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nA new coronavirus vaccine has been shown to be 89.3% effective in large-scale UK trials and is the first to show its effectiveness in trials against the new variant found in Britain. The UK has secured 60 million doses of the Novavax jab which, if approved by regulators, would be produced in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England, with the expectation of being rolled out in the second half of the year. Novavax's Prof Paul Heath said the findings of the trials were \"enormously exciting\".\nSome primary school children in Wales could begin a phased return to school from 22 February, if Covid rates continue to fall, First Minister Mark Drakeford is expected to say later. A Welsh Government statement said he would \"indicate that the youngest learners in primary school\" could start going back after February half term. Meanwhile, a think tank says pupils in England - where schools will not reopen before 8 March - should be allowed to repeat a year.\nMore than 60 suspected Covid outbreaks in offices were recorded in the first two weeks of the current lockdown in England, figures obtained by BBC Radio 5 Live reveal. Public Health England also logged more than 500 suspected or confirmed office outbreaks in the second half of 2020 - more than in supermarkets, construction sites, warehouses, restaurants and cafes combined. See our full investigation for first-hand accounts from concerned workers.\nVolunteers being trained to help the NHS with the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine will now be given the jab themselves. St John Ambulance says this is because, in helping, they have become front-line health workers.\nLong-forgotten maths, DIY haircuts, general chaos... it seems parenting during lockdown is tough even if you're royalty. The Duchess of Cambridge has been sharing her woes with fellow parents during a video call, and wrote \"exhausting\" when they were asked to pick a word that summed up the experience. Now she's urging people \"to reach out to loved ones and friends\" if they are struggling or feeling isolated. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nIf you're wondering when you might get vaccinated, check out our explainer.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "title": "Coronavirus vaccines: The plan for Northern Ireland",
      "tags": "Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's biggest ever vaccination programme is being rolled out weeks ahead of schedule, Health Minister Robin Swann has said.\nThe first vaccine was approved for UK use in early December and within days it was being given to vaccinators in NI, as well care home residents and staff.\nSince then, two more vaccines have also been approved by UK regulators.\nPeople in groups most at risk of dying or becoming seriously ill as a result of Covid are being given priority.\nThree vaccines have been approved for use in the UK: \nThe first two are already in use in Northern Ireland, but supplies of the Moderna vaccine are not expected to arrive in the UK until the spring. \nEach of the approved vaccines is given to patients in two doses, a number of weeks apart.\nPatients are being offered vaccines in order of priority, based on age and clinical vulnerability, as Covid-19 poses most danger to people who are elderly or who have underlying health problems.\nOn 12 January, Northern Ireland's Department of Health published a detailed timetable for delivering vaccinations to prioritised groups:\nOn Friday February 19, the department announced that carers over the age of 18 could also now book their vaccine appointment.\nPrioritisation was decided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments on immunisation.\nIt is expected that mass vaccination will only become available to the general population from the summer of 2021.\nThe latest available figures from the Department of Health show a total of 418,209 vaccines had been administered by 17 February. \nOf that figure, 29,476 jabs were second doses.\nAs of 16 February the following had received first doses:\nBy 4 February every one of Northern Ireland's 483 care homes had been visited by mobile vaccination teams, while 90% of homes had been visited for second doses.\nEarlier, the Department of Health said there had been an uptake level of more than 90% among residents - and about 80% among staff.\nOn 2 December, the UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nSix days later, Belfast nurse Joanna Sloan became the first person in Northern Ireland, and indeed on the island of Ireland, to be vaccinated.\nThe 28-year-old leads the Belfast Health Trust's vaccination programme.\nLater on 8 December, the first care home residents in Northern Ireland were vaccinated at Palmerston residential home in east Belfast.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was approved for use in the UK on 30 December 2020.\nOn 4 January 2021, 94-year-old Eileen Lynch became Northern Ireland's first recipient.\nThe pensioner said she felt \"delighted and privileged\" after getting the injection at her GP surgery on the Falls Road in west Belfast.\nThe UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), confirmed the US-made Moderna vaccine was safe and effective to use on 8 January.\nThe UK has pre-ordered 17m doses, but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring 2021.\nPfizer-BioNTech, which produced its vaccine in Belgium, has reported 95% protection against Covid-19.\nThe Moderna vaccine offers similar protection at nearly 95%, while trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine showed it was between 62% and 90% effective.\nResearch from Oxford University found the AstraZeneca vaccine offered 76% effective protection from a single dose for three months.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech product is an RNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.\nAn RNA vaccine had never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received such a vaccine in clinical trials.\nThe Moderna vaccine uses the same RNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and reported similar effectiveness.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. \nIt has been modified to look more like the coronavirus, but cannot cause illness.\nThe jab prompts the immune system to start making antibodies and primes it to attack any coronavirus infection.\nAll the approved vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection.\nInitially, the strategy for the Pfizer vaccine was to offer people the second dose 21 days after their initial jab - full immunity starts seven days after the second dose.\nBut when approval was announced for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 30 December, it was also announced that the new priority would be to give as many people a good level of protection with the first shot of either vaccine, rather than providing the required two doses to a smaller number of people in as short a time as possible.\nEveryone will still receive their second dose, but this will now be within 12 weeks of their first. \nThe US regulator and some UK experts have questioned the policy, saying it is premature without more trial evidence, but the UK's MHRA says it is a pragmatic decision that will protect more people.\nAn Oxford University study has suggested that, with no fall in protection during the three-month period following the first jab, research supported gaps between first and second doses of between four and 12 weeks.\nThe official guidance states that every person should get the same vaccine for both doses.\nHowever, in the very rare circumstance in which only one vaccine is available at a vaccination site or it's unknown which product an individual received for their first dose, Public Health England has advised a different vaccine could be administered. \nBut this advice does stress \"this option is preferred if the individual is likely to be at immediate high risk or is considered unlikely to attend again\". \nExperts have concluded that both vaccines are very effective, and have not stipulated a preference for either one in any specific population.\nIn Northern Ireland, care home residents were given the Pfizer jab, while other people aged 80 and over were called to their GP surgery to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Housebound patients have also received this vaccine.\nIn January, the Department of Health announced a new twin-track approach for younger groups.\nThis allowed people aged 65-69 to book slots at their local vaccination centres, where they received the Pfizer jab.\nPeople aged over 70 were to attend their GP and receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nHowever on 17 February it was announced that any over-70s who had not yet been contacted by their GP to come for vaccination could book a slot for the Pfizer vaccine at a local centre. \nThe Pfizer jab at the vaccine centres is also being given to people in NI who received a shielding letter as they are clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) as well as carers who are in receipt of caring benefits, are registered care home partners or whose illness would jeopardise the welfare of the person they care for.\nMeanwhile people aged 18-64 with underlying health conditions - as well as their carers - will be contacted by GPs for an Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. \nThere are some questions over when exactly people with asthma will get vaccinated as some will be in the 18-64 group with underlying conditions, some in the CEV group and some will not fall into any group.\nTheir GP will assess the severity of their condition and they will then be assigned to a group for vaccination priority.\nThe eventual aim is that as many people as possible over the age of 18 receive a Covid-19 vaccine. \nIt won't be compulsory, though - no other vaccines in the UK are - as experts say this wouldn't help create confidence in the vaccine.\nThe government has so far ordered seven different types of vaccine and expects to receive 367 million doses.\nIf everyone needs two doses, that would certainly be enough for every adult in the UK.\nAnyone with a previous history of allergic reactions to the ingredients of the vaccine should not receive it, but those with any other allergies such as a food allergy can now have the vaccine. \nA severe allergic reaction - known as anaphylaxis - is a very rare side-effect with any vaccine, but it can happen in those at risk. Most people, however, will not be affected in any way.\nThe medical regulator, the MHRA, says anyone due to receive their vaccine should discuss any medical history of serious allergies with their healthcare professional beforehand.\nVaccination with either vaccine should only be considered for pregnant women when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks - for instance where the risk of exposure to coronavirus is high and cannot be avoided, or where the woman has underlying health conditions that put her at high risk of complications of Covid-19.\nWomen should discuss the benefits and risks of having the vaccine with their healthcare professional and reach a joint decision based on individual circumstances. \nWomen who are breastfeeding can be given the vaccine. \nThere are no specific safety concerns with the vaccines - but they were not tested on pregnant women during the trials.\nPregnant women are likely to be low down the list of priority groups because of their age, and may only be offered a vaccine in the second phase in 2021.\nNo - this vaccine is being rolled out free to people via the NHS.\nYou can't jump the queue by paying for it but there should be plenty of vaccine to go round.\nIf you're eligible for a flu vaccine, you should get it as soon as possible, particularly if you will also be in a high-risk priority group for a Covid jab.\nHaving both illnesses at once this winter could be dangerous. \nAt its last meeting, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended leaving at least seven days between the vaccines.\nSome people have mild symptoms, such as muscle aches or a bit of a temperature, after being vaccinated.\nThis is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients will be listed.\nRussia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics. \nBoth work in a similar way to the Oxford vaccine.\nHere are some of your questions about the roll-out of the vaccination, new international travel rules and school closures."

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "People may soon be offered a \"spit in a pot\" coronavirus test, after promising trial results. \nThe LampORE test checks for the virus in saliva samples, and work carried out with the help of more than 1,000 NHS volunteers shows it is good at finding cases, even if someone has no symptoms. \nPop-up labs that can process up to 2,000 tests a day have been set up in trucks that could travel the country. \nFour have already been deployed, says the government. \nThese mobile units are located in Aberdeen, Telford, Brent and Newbury. They will continue testing people in the coming weeks and the results will be evaluated to see how helpful the service is.\nIn the trials done so far, the LamPORE Covid-19 test, produced by Oxford Nanopore, was accurate and sensitive enough to identify people - in this instance, NHS staff - who were infected, with or without symptoms. \nAs well as detecting coronavirus, it could be used at the same time to spot other respiratory viruses, such as flu.\nThe test also has the advantage of not needing a swab up the nose or down the throat, which some people find uncomfortable.\nThe \"gold standard\" test for checking for coronavirus is still the one used by the Test and Trace service - a check called PCR, which does require a swab. \nIf you think you might have coronavirus, you should get checked.\nIn the UK, you can order a test online at gov.uk or call 119. \nHealth Minister Lord Bethell said: \"With one in three people not displaying symptoms of Covid-19, broadening asymptomatic testing is critical to protect those at highest risk. \n\"The LamPORE mobile laboratories provide a new way in which we can respond to testing demand where there is most need.\""

      "tags": "Johnson & Johnson,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new single-dose vaccine has shown to be 66% effective against Covid-19, and offered complete protection against hospitalisation and death in trials.\nHowever, there are signs the jab, made by Belgian pharmaceutical firm Janssen, is less effective against the new variant spreading in South Africa.\nThe Johnson & Johnson-owned company is looking at whether two doses will give stronger or longer-lasting protection.\nIt aims to make one billion doses this year.\nThe UK has ordered 30 million doses, the US 100 million and Canada 38 million.\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said if the jab was approved by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) it could \"significantly bolster\" the country's vaccine programme.\nCrucially, no one needed hospital treatment or died from coronavirus after the Janssen vaccine took effect in the international trial.\nThe news comes shortly after Novavax announced their jab was 89% effective overall in the UK and 60% in South Africa. Both new vaccines will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. \nMeanwhile, the EU's drugs regulator has approved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged over 18. \nIt comes amid an ongoing dispute over whether AstraZeneca is breaking its vaccine delivery commitments to the bloc, which has seen the EU confirm that it will bring in export controls on Covid vaccines made in the bloc.\nThe EU has temporarily overridden a section of the Brexit deal in relation to Northern Ireland, over concerns the country could become a backdoor for vaccines from the EU to be sent into the wider UK.\nArlene Foster, DUP leader and Northern Ireland's first minister, called the move \"an incredible act of hostility\" by the EU.\nIt comes as the UK reported a further 29,079 new coronavirus cases on Friday, and 1,245 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the government's daily figures, bringing the total deaths by that measure to 104,371.\nCrucially, the Janssen trial looked at giving just one dose of the vaccine, which makes it significantly easier to roll out than those requiring two.  It is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. \nThe fact it works as a single dose and can be kept in a standard fridge, while others need super-cold storage, means the vaccine could have a significant role around the world. \n\"A one-shot vaccine is considered by the World Health Organization to be the best option in pandemic settings,\" said Dr Paul Stoffels, the chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson.\nHe added the vaccine could \"potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of Covid-19\". \nIt is easy to become complacent after the astounding success of the first vaccines to go through trials.\nBut having another two effective vaccines is a cause for massive celebration.\nIt will take vast quantities of vaccine to immunise the world - remember this is a pandemic - and the more options we have available, the better.\nHowever, there is also a warning sign in the new data from the Janssen and Novavax trials.\nBoth showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.\nThe results from South Africa were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all.\nBut they do emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target and that we may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.\nThe Janssen vaccine uses a common cold virus that has been engineered to make it harmless. \nIt then safely carries part of the coronavirus's genetic code into the body. This is enough for the body to recognise the threat and then learn to fight coronavirus. \nThis trains the body's immune system to fight coronavirus when it encounters the virus for real. \nThis is similar to the approach used by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. \nDr Mathai Mammen, from Janssen, said: \"A single dose regimen with fast onset of protection and ease of delivery and storage provides a potential solution to reaching as many people as possible. \n\"The ability to avoid hospitalisations and deaths would change the game in combating the pandemic.\"\nThe results are based on nearly 44,000 people who took part in the trial and 468 cases of Covid-19.\nHowever the vaccine was just 57% effective in the South African part of the trial, where a new version of the coronavirus is spreading, compared with 72% in the US.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said that the results from the early trials were \"very encouraging\", and if the vaccine was approved doses should be available later this year.\nMr Hancock said the Janssen announcement was \"yet more good news\". \n\"If this jab is approved this could significantly bolster our vaccination programme, especially as a single-dose vaccine,\" he said.\n\"Once the full data has been submitted [to the MHRA], they will consider the evidence to determine whether the vaccine meets robust standards of safety, effectiveness & quality.\"\nIn the UK, the latest estimate for the R rate from the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1.\nThe number of coronavirus cases in the UK remained virtually unchanged in the week to 23 January, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data.  Its survey suggests the epidemic is levelling off or perhaps very slightly falling - but not at the rate hoped.\nMore than 7.8 million people in the UK have so far received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest government figures.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US has pledged to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to poorer nations from next year - bringing its total commitment to more than one billion.\n\"To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,\" US President Joe Biden told a virtual Covid-19 summit.\nThe donation will be routed through Covax - the international scheme designed to ensure low-income countries aren't left behind in the fight against Covid.\nIt came amid growing warnings over the pace of global vaccinations, and inequity of access.\nCovax was created last year to ensure that Covid vaccines are made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations.\nThe scheme hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the population in 92 low- or medium-income countries - starting with healthcare workers and the most vulnerable groups.\nIts initial goal was to provide two billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 poorer countries by early 2022. \nCovax is run by a number of international organisations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's charity, Unicef. \nGhana was the first country to receive Covax vaccines in February. \nSince then, more than 303 million doses have been shipped through Covax to 142 countries around the world, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Fiji. \nMost doses are going to poorer countries, but some have been sent to wealthier countries such as Canada, which defended its request.\nCovax works with with governments and vaccine manufacturers around the world. Supporters include the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UAE, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Portugal.  \nCountries have pledged to donate both money and surplus doses from their own vaccine supplies.\nThe UK, Japan, Canada and the European Union are among those to have committed to supplying tens of millions of doses.\nWHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously criticised wealthier nations for \"gobbling up\" the global vaccine supply. \nG7 countries have purchased over a third of the world's vaccine supply, despite making up only 13% of the global population.\nSix vaccines have been given \"emergency use authorisation\" by the WHO, meaning they can be shared via Covax: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and Sinovac.\nHowever, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses have been delivered so far. \nModerna has agreed to supply 500 million doses at its \"lowest-tiered price\", but most won't be available until 2022. \nCovax has been criticised for being slow. Some initial targets were missed, partly as a result of the poor health infrastructure in many of the recipient countries, and partly because of vaccine hesitancy. \nDeliveries were also delayed because of the deteriorating situation in India. Officials there restricted exports to protect their own population amid soaring infection rates. These are set to resume from October. \nCovax has told the BBC that too many donations have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. This makes it very hard to get them to where they are needed. \nRepresentatives of the scheme also note that only a small percentage of the pledges made earlier this year have turned into actual doses. \nUnicef executive director Henrietta Fore said countries needed to \"accelerate their donation plans\", with low-income nations unable to wait any longer. \nWhile many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford.\nCovax says it is now expecting to hit its \"key milestone\" of releasing two billion doses for delivery some time early next year. \nIn total, some six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 195 countries worldwide.\nHowever, while some countries have fully vaccinated a large amount of their population, many others have only just begun, or in some cases are still waiting for their first doses to arrive.\nCovax aims to close that gap. \"With a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe,\" the WHO says on its website. \nBut even if Covax meets its goal to vaccinate 20% of the population in its 92 target countries, that's well short of the level of immunity that experts say is needed to end the pandemic.\nThe WHO has suggested that figure is at least 70%. People may also need booster doses to remain protected. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe EU has announced controls on vaccines made in the bloc to prevent their export to Northern Ireland, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under the Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to Northern Ireland without checks. But the EU believes this could be used to circumvent export controls, with Northern Ireland becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster described the EU's move as \"an incredible act of hostility\". It comes amid a dispute over whether AstraZeneca is breaking its vaccine delivery commitments to the EU.\nThe Covid-19 vaccine developed by Janssen is 66% effective, the Belgian company has announced. No one needed hospital treatment or died from coronavirus after the vaccine took effect in the international trial. Having to give just one dose of the vaccine makes it easier to roll out than those that require two. However, there are signs it is less effective against the new variant spreading in South Africa. The UK has ordered 30 million doses of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen jab. It comes after the Novavax vaccine was shown to be 89.3% effective in large-scale UK trials. And in more vaccine news, the EU's drugs regulator has approved the use of the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine for people aged over 18. There's been a continuing dispute over whether the Anglo-Swedish drug company is breaking its vaccine delivery commitments to the EU. \nThe number of Covid infections remained virtually unchanged in the week to 23 January, according to Office for National Statistics figures. Its survey suggests the epidemic is levelling off or perhaps very slightly falling - but not at the rate hoped. The UK's R number is now estimated at between 0.7 and 1.1 - a figure below one would mean the epidemic is shrinking. Infections remain high in England and are highest in London  but the virus looks like its levelling off throughout the rest of the UK.  The figures come from a random sample of people in private residences, whether they have symptoms or not.   \nLong-running TV entertainment show Britain's Got Talent has been postponed until next year because of concerns it wouldn't be safe enough to film during the pandemic. Filming for the ITV programme - judged by Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, Simon Cowell and David Walliams - was due to start this month but was pushed back three weeks ago, due to the rise in cases in England and the current lockdown. On Friday, the talent show producers said that \"safety has to come first\" because performers like choirs, orchestras and dance groups wouldn't be able to rehearse and audition safely. \nA woman who met her baby for the first time after 76 days in hospital with coronavirus has thanked the doctors who saved her life. Eva Gicain, 30, was initially admitted to Basildon Hospital - where she works as a nurse - but later needed to be transferred to critical care at Royal Papworth in Cambridge. She has no memory of giving birth to daughter Elleana, who arrived about a month early by C-section. Both mother and baby are doing well now at home. \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nTo read about what home-schooling technology help you may be able to get.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The practical and economic consequences of Brexit will become real when the transition period ends at 23:00 GMT on Thursday.\nBut because of special arrangements for Northern Ireland, it will have a different experience from the rest of the UK.\nPeople born in Northern Ireland have the right to Irish as well as British citizenship.\nThose who exercise that right will retain their EU citizenship, something not available to people elsewhere in the UK who may have only British citizenship. \nThe consequences of this range from the mundane to the profound.\nPeople travelling on Irish passports will be able to use EU/EEA lanes and e-gates at airports.\nThose with British passports will not.\nMore fundamentally people with Irish passports keep their right to freedom of movement within the EU.\nThat means they can live, work and study in an EU country without a visa and with no time limit.\nThese rights extend to their spouses and dependent children.\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier explained this during a speech in Belfast in 2020.\n\"Whilst Northern Ireland will no longer be part of the EU, people born and raised here that choose to be Irish citizens will still be EU citizens,\" he said.\n\"This means they can continue to move and reside freely within the EU.\"\nThe UK will no longer be participating in Erasmus, the EU student exchange scheme.\nInstead, the UK government is setting up its own scheme, known as Turing.\nHowever, students at Northern Ireland's universities will still be able to take part in Erasmus due to funding and administrative assistance from the Irish government.\nIreland's Higher Education Minister Simon Harris said: \"The government of Ireland made a very solemn commitment to Northern Ireland that, even after Brexit, we would make sure that there were still ways for us to co-operate and collaborate in relation to higher education.\"\nFunding will be available to all full-time students attending third level institutions in Northern Ireland.\nIt will not be limited to those with an Irish passport, so British passport holders will also qualify.\nBusinesses across the UK will still be able to sell their goods to the EU without tariffs being imposed.\nThis is due to the trade deal reached between the EU and UK on Christmas Eve.\nBut businesses in GB will face a range of new non-tariff trade barriers such as paperwork, certifications and checks on goods as they enter the EU.\nNorthern Ireland will not face these non-tariff barriers as it will effectively remain within the EU's single market for goods.\nThis is a consequence of the NI Protocol, a special deal to prevent the re-emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nAs an example, a lorry load of Northern Ireland meat products could board a ferry at Dublin port and disembark at a French port with no new paperwork or checks.\nHowever, if a similar load was travelling from Scotland to France it would need to be accompanied by new export health certificates and the authorities would need advance notice of its arrival.\nIt would have to go to a border control post where the load may be physically examined.\nThere is a significant flipside to this: new trade barriers within the UK.\nThat lorry load of Scottish meat could be driven to Cardiff or London without any new checks or controls.\nBut when entering Northern Ireland it is as if it is entering the EU.\nSo it will need to undergo all the same bureaucracy and checking as when it was entering a French port."

      "text": "Primary school children could begin a phased return to school just after half-term if Covid rates continue to fall, Wales' first minister has said.\nMinisters have been under pressure to set out plans for a return to face-to-face teaching after weeks of lockdown.\nMark Drakeford said the tough \"alert level four\" restrictions would remain for another three weeks.\nHowever, from Saturday people will be able to meet one other person from another household to exercise.\nAnd changes to rules on bubbles would allow people \"to dissolve the bubble they're in at the moment and reform it with another household, provided there's a 10-day gap between the two,\" he added.\nMr Drakeford told the Welsh Government's Friday coronavirus briefing if infections continued to fall the youngest primary school pupils may be able to return from 22 February.\nThe BBC was later told this would be children in the foundation phase of primary school.\n\"Our children and young people have had a torrid time, over the last 12 months, they are missing out on education, every week,\" said Mr Drakeford.\nHe added he hoped older pupils and college students who had to do vocational examinations could also have a phased return to schools and colleges after half-term.\nMr Drakeford said he wanted \"everything to be on the table\", including whether having smaller groups of children in school - or having pupils go in for part-weeks - would be possible.\nHowever, he warned things could still change, adding \"things we don't know about today could emerge, even before half-term\".\nFor mum-of-two Charlotte Harding, from Ferndale, Rhondda Cynon Taf, the possibility of the youngest years returning to school is \"positive\" news.\nShe said home-schooling her sons, six-year-old Harrison and eight-year-old Ethan, has been \"hard to navigate\" and \"difficult\".\n\"My eight-year-old has been emotionally drained, I think it is related to having a lack of routine and structure,\" she said.\n\"It is the fact they aren't integrating with children their own age, that they are mentally missing out.\"\nHowever, Tasha Hughes, from Neath Port Talbot, who has a six-year-old child, said she did not understand the decision.\n\"I'm just not understanding, one minute it's not safe and the next it is but as far as children and teachers are concerned nothing has changed,\" she said.\n\"Why are teachers not getting the vaccine if they are made to open back up? They also have families to protect.\"\nMother-of-four Jo Herschell from Swansea, who has eight-year-old twins, a six-year-old and 11-year-old, said that although it was \"devastating they've missed so much school\", it feels too soon to be going back.\n\"I also feel that we've made these sacrifices and if we go back too soon we'll just keep repeating the cycle over and over,\" she said. \n\"It's more disruptive, I feel, in the long term than if we kept it a few more weeks, we were a bit more sure and then we had a chance of it being the last time that schools are going to have to close.\"\nWith two of her children having been diagnosed with additional learning needs, routine is essential, she added.\n\"Every time they go back to school that's really difficult and every time they're off that's difficult. Last term, between different isolations, they only attended seven days of school from October 22 'til Christmas and so that's really disruptive for the children and for myself and as a family,\" she added.\nThe first minister told Friday's briefing he wanted to give \"two clear weeks' notice\" about plans for a phased return.\nHe added that while the situation in Wales was improving, lockdown restrictions must continue for another three weeks \"to allow the NHS to recover\".\nWales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton said on Wednesday the headroom to relax restrictions was \"really quite limited\".\nThe Welsh Government decided to close schools to the majority of pupils as concerns grew about the new variant of coronavirus, which was blamed for the rise in cases seen before Christmas.\nSchools remained closed except to vulnerable children, and those whose parents are key workers.\nMr Drakeford said he \"understands the anxieties\" teaching staff might have in returning back to the classroom.\nHe told Friday's briefing the Welsh Government would do everything it could to work with teachers and unions to ensure the workplace was \"as safe as it can be\" before they return to school. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said 8 March was the earliest date schools in England could reopen and that \"depends on lots of things going right\".\nIn Northern Ireland pupils will not return to school until 8 March at the earliest, while rules on lockdown restrictions in Scotland are to be reviewed on 2 February.\nWith regard to a four nations approach to schools reopening, Mr Drakeford said the falling numbers of Covid cases in Wales had allowed him to make the move.\nMr Drakeford told Friday's briefing there was \"unlikely to be much headroom\" for further coronavirus restrictions in Wales to be lifted at the time of the next review. \nHe said: \"If things were to continue in the direction they are now, where things are going well, then more headroom may emerge in the month of March.\"\nAlert level three would allow the reopening of schools, higher education, pubs and hospitality businesses - with rules on alcohol sales and opening times - and non-essential retail, among others.\nHe told the briefing that his government would not rely on a \"crude\" single piece of data to decide whether to confirm the plans for schools.\nMr Drakeford said a \"combination of factors\" would be considered before children could begin returning to schools in Wales including the rate of cases per 100,000 people, Covid test positivity rate, hospital numbers and \"the mitigation measures that we are able to put in place in schools\".\n\"The key thing is the trend - those numbers need to continue to fall,\" he said.\nWhen asked whether the Welsh Government would prioritise vaccinating teachers and school staff, after the first four priority groups set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) have been vaccinated, he said he would \"follow the advice of the JCVI\".\nDeputy head teacher Rachel Antoniazzi, at Thornhill Primary School in Cardiff, said the announcement was a \"welcome return\" and parents in Wales would be \"breathing a huge sigh of relief\".\n\"The bigger concern is that parents take this seriously and that when children return to school, that it's not like a return to normality, so they don't begin play dates and sleepovers, thinking it's normal,\" she said.\nLaura Doel, director of school leaders' union NAHT Cymru, said there were \"still too many unknowns\" - such as vaccine efficacy and infection rates - to put the 22 February date \"firmly in the diary yet\". \nMs Doel added the teaching workforce should also be prioritised for vaccinations.\nEithne Hughes, director of the association of schools, colleges and leaders in Wales (ASCL Cymru), described the plan to allow the youngest school pupils to return as a \"sensible first step\" as school learning is \"so important to their development\".\nSally Holland, the children's commissioner for Wales, urged ministers to set out the \"milestones\" needed to be reached before children returned.\nOn Wednesday, Dr Atherton said the outbreak was \"shrinking rather than growing\", but rates were still \"way too high\".\nHowever, Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast there would be \"minor adjustments\" to lockdown rules - including bubbles and exercise.\nFrom Saturday people will be allowed to meet one person from another household to exercise in a public outdoor place.\nRunner Michelle Graham from Cardiff said: \"This is such good news. It's been really, really hard to keep training, just to keep running, when all you can do is go out and run on your own.\n\"I'm supposed to be training for an ultramarathon in June and a couple of marathons later on in the year, fingers crossed, if everything goes ahead. \n\"But just getting out there on your own, day in day out - it's going to be so great to be able to run with someone else. Really, really excited about today's news.\"\nIn Friday's briefing, Mr Drakeford said the change was in response to \"messages we've heard from women about not feeling safe\" when exercising at this time of year.\nHe added they would still have to leave from \"your own front door and return to your own front door\".\nThe Welsh Government said social distancing must be maintained and children under 11 were allowed to accompany adults.\nMr Drakeford said changes to rules on bubbles from tomorrow would allow people \"to dissolve the bubble they're in at the moment and reform it with another household, provided there's a 10-day gap between the two\".\nHe said \"weeks into this some people will have moved, some relationships will have changed.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies has called for a \"route map out of lockdown\" which included \"crucial targets concerning the roll-out of coronavirus jabs, falling numbers of infections and the reopening of schools and businesses\".\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price urged a raft of new measures, including making medical grade masks compulsory for everyone and increasing the level and flexibility of the self-isolation support.\nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nThe postcode search has been updated to replace data for health boards in Scotland with data for local councils.

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,European Union,Brexit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The EU has reversed its decision to trigger an emergency provision in the Brexit deal to control Covid vaccine exports from the EU.\nThe move could have seen checks at the border of Ireland and Northern Ireland to prevent shipments entering the UK.\nThe Brussels U-turn came hours after it was announced, following condemnation from London, Dublin and Belfast.\nThe plans had been part of the EU's new export controls on vaccines, to combat delivery shortfalls.\nIt is the latest development in a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the EU.\nThe Brexit deal guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. \nHowever, Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nOn Friday evening the EU announced it would trigger the clause and introduce the export controls on its vaccines entering Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent the region becoming a backdoor for jabs to be sent to the UK mainland. \nIt said the actions were \"justified\" to avert problems caused by a lack of supply.\nBut the proposals sparked concern from Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin as well as all five parties in Northern Ireland's devolved government.\nNorthern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster described it as \"an absolutely incredible act of hostility\" that created a hard Irish border, while Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said in a tweet: \"The [Northern Ireland] Protocol is not something to be tampered with lightly, it's an essential, hard-won compromise, protecting peace and trade for many.\"\nLater on Friday evening, following talks with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that the UK and EU had \"agreed on the principle that there should not be restrictions on the export of vaccines by companies where they are fulfilling contractual responsibilities\".\nShe said the backtrack, which was outlined in a European Commission statement, came after \"constructive talks\" with Mr Johnson in which he had expressed \"grave concerns\" about the initial plan. \nThe BBC's Brussels correspondent, Kevin Connelly, said Ms von der Leyen's midnight tweet seemed to \"wind down\" the idea that there could be a \"vaccine war\" where jab supplies are prevented from reaching the UK.\n\"Mistake,\" \"misjudgement,\" \"blunder.\" \nThese are just some of words EU insiders have been using privately to describe the European Commission's initial decision on Friday to suspend areas of the Brexit deal dealing with Northern Ireland, a part of its Covid vaccine row. \nAlthough it then U-turned on those plans, critics say the damage was already done. \nBrussels previously lectured the UK government about respecting the Irish Protocol - which was painfully and carefully drafted during Brexit negotiations. \nNow the EU seemed quick to undermine the agreement. \nMember state Ireland felt stung that it hadn't been consulted. This all adds to the impression of chaos surrounding the EU's vaccine rollout. \nBrussels was already under fire from a growing number of EU countries for having been slow to sign vaccine contracts with pharmaceutical companies. \nThis \"mishap\" over the Irish Protocol, as Spain's Foreign Minister called it, hasn't exactly helped the commission's reputation. \nJulian Smith, Conservative MP and former Northern Ireland secretary, said the EU had \"pulled the emergency cord\" without following the proper processes that had been agreed over years of negotiations.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move came \"without anywhere near the level of understanding of the Good Friday Agreement, of the sensitivities of the situation in Northern Ireland\". \n\"It was an almost Trumpian act - I'm very pleased that they've changed their minds,\" he said, adding that the EU's \"major issue\" with its Covid vaccine rollout \"does not excuse\" their actions.\nBBC business correspondent Katie Prescott said firms in Northern Ireland were stunned that the European Commission could trigger a change that was only meant for the \"most egregious circumstances\" - just one month after the UK's post-Brexit transition period with the EU ended.\nConservative MP and former international trade secretary, Dr Liam Fox, said the EU had shown it was \"willing to impose [a] hard border on Northern Ireland\" despite the \"precious\" agreements in place to prevent such a situation, with \"very little requirement and no notice\".\n\"It was like an episode of Carry On at the [European] Commission yesterday, except that it wasn't funny,\" he told BBC News.\nMr Martin welcomed the EU's reversal, describing it as a \"positive development given the many challenges we face in tackling Covid-19\".\nIt was not thought that the move would have directly disadvantaged Northern Ireland, which gets its vaccine supplies through the UK procurement system.\nThe Department of Health confirmed Health Secretary Matt Hancock had a \"constructive discussion\" on the supply of vaccines with his Northern Ireland counterpart Robin Swann, who tweeted it was \"essential\" confidence and trust were rebuilt after the EU's actions.\nThe Irish government and its diplomats have spent a huge amount of time and energy educating their EU partners on the nuances of the Irish border.\nDuring the Brexit negotiations there was a slick operation where visiting dignitaries and camera crews were whisked up the road from Dublin airport to see the border in County Louth.\nThis paid dividends for Ireland: its concerns remained top of the EU's priorities during the negotiations.\nSome of the European Commission's most talented officials were deeply involved in the Irish elements of the Brexit deals.\nBut something clearly went badly awry on Friday.\nThe use of the Article 16 mechanism, to override part of the Brexit deal, caught the Irish government by surprise.\nThose Commission officials with special knowledge of Ireland were either not consulted or not listened to.\nDick Roche, Ireland's former Europe minister, told the BBC the government had been \"blindsided\" and \"embarrassed\".\nHe said the Taoiseach had been \"very annoyed\" and made \"very strong representation\" to urge the Commission to change its mind.\nDespite later backtracking on Article 16, the EU is still introducing new controls giving its member states the power - should they want to - to block exports of the coronavirus vaccine to countries including the UK, if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU.\nThe European Commission said the temporary mechanism is to combat \"the current lack of transparency\" over vaccine exports outside the EU, and is not an export ban.\nBut the World Health Organization is among those criticising the move, saying \"vaccine nationalism\" could prolong the pandemic and further widen global inequality.\nLast summer the EU agreed to buy up to 400m doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and on Friday the EU's drugs regulator approved the vaccine's use for all adults.\nBut the firm said that due to problems at one of its EU factories, supplies would be reduced by about 60% in the first quarter of 2021."

      "text": "Primary school children could begin a phased return to school just after half-term if Covid rates continue to fall, Wales' first minister has said.\nMinisters have been under pressure to set out plans for a return to face-to-face teaching after weeks of lockdown.\nMark Drakeford said the tough \"alert level four\" restrictions would remain for another three weeks.\nHowever, from Saturday people will be able to meet one other person from another household to exercise.\nAnd changes to rules on bubbles would allow people \"to dissolve the bubble they're in at the moment and reform it with another household, provided there's a 10-day gap between the two,\" he added.\nMr Drakeford told the Welsh Government's Friday coronavirus briefing if infections continued to fall the youngest primary school pupils may be able to return from 22 February.\nThe BBC was later told this would be children in the foundation phase of primary school.\n\"Our children and young people have had a torrid time, over the last 12 months, they are missing out on education, every week,\" said Mr Drakeford.\nHe added he hoped older pupils and college students who had to do vocational examinations could also have a phased return to schools and colleges after half-term.\nMr Drakeford said he wanted \"everything to be on the table\", including whether having smaller groups of children in school - or having pupils go in for part-weeks - would be possible.\nHowever, he warned things could still change, adding \"things we don't know about today could emerge, even before half-term\".\nFor mum-of-two Charlotte Harding, from Ferndale, Rhondda Cynon Taf, the possibility of the youngest years returning to school is \"positive\" news.\nShe said home-schooling her sons, six-year-old Harrison and eight-year-old Ethan, has been \"hard to navigate\" and \"difficult\".\n\"My eight-year-old has been emotionally drained, I think it is related to having a lack of routine and structure,\" she said.\n\"It is the fact they aren't integrating with children their own age, that they are mentally missing out.\"\nHowever, Tasha Hughes, from Neath Port Talbot, who has a six-year-old child, said she did not understand the decision.\n\"I'm just not understanding, one minute it's not safe and the next it is but as far as children and teachers are concerned nothing has changed,\" she said.\n\"Why are teachers not getting the vaccine if they are made to open back up? They also have families to protect.\"\nMother-of-four Jo Herschell from Swansea, who has eight-year-old twins, a six-year-old and 11-year-old, said that although it was \"devastating they've missed so much school\", it feels too soon to be going back.\n\"I also feel that we've made these sacrifices and if we go back too soon we'll just keep repeating the cycle over and over,\" she said. \n\"It's more disruptive, I feel, in the long term than if we kept it a few more weeks, we were a bit more sure and then we had a chance of it being the last time that schools are going to have to close.\"\nWith two of her children having been diagnosed with additional learning needs, routine is essential, she added.\n\"Every time they go back to school that's really difficult and every time they're off that's difficult. Last term, between different isolations, they only attended seven days of school from October 22 'til Christmas and so that's really disruptive for the children and for myself and as a family,\" she added.\nThe first minister told Friday's briefing he wanted to give \"two clear weeks' notice\" about plans for a phased return.\nHe added that while the situation in Wales was improving, lockdown restrictions must continue for another three weeks \"to allow the NHS to recover\".\nWales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton said on Wednesday the headroom to relax restrictions was \"really quite limited\".\nThe Welsh Government decided to close schools to the majority of pupils as concerns grew about the new variant of coronavirus, which was blamed for the rise in cases seen before Christmas.\nSchools remained closed except to vulnerable children, and those whose parents are key workers.\nMr Drakeford said he \"understands the anxieties\" teaching staff might have in returning back to the classroom.\nHe told Friday's briefing the Welsh Government would do everything it could to work with teachers and unions to ensure the workplace was \"as safe as it can be\" before they return to school. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said 8 March was the earliest date schools in England could reopen and that \"depends on lots of things going right\".\nIn Northern Ireland pupils will not return to school until 8 March at the earliest, while rules on lockdown restrictions in Scotland are to be reviewed on 2 February.\nWith regard to a four nations approach to schools reopening, Mr Drakeford said the falling numbers of Covid cases in Wales had allowed him to make the move.\nMr Drakeford told Friday's briefing there was \"unlikely to be much headroom\" for further coronavirus restrictions in Wales to be lifted at the time of the next review. \nHe said: \"If things were to continue in the direction they are now, where things are going well, then more headroom may emerge in the month of March.\"\nAlert level three would allow the reopening of schools, higher education, pubs and hospitality businesses - with rules on alcohol sales and opening times - and non-essential retail, among others.\nHe told the briefing that his government would not rely on a \"crude\" single piece of data to decide whether to confirm the plans for schools.\nMr Drakeford said a \"combination of factors\" would be considered before children could begin returning to schools in Wales including the rate of cases per 100,000 people, Covid test positivity rate, hospital numbers and \"the mitigation measures that we are able to put in place in schools\".\n\"The key thing is the trend - those numbers need to continue to fall,\" he said.\nWhen asked whether the Welsh Government would prioritise vaccinating teachers and school staff, after the first four priority groups set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) have been vaccinated, he said he would \"follow the advice of the JCVI\".\nDeputy head teacher Rachel Antoniazzi, at Thornhill Primary School in Cardiff, said the announcement was a \"welcome return\" and parents in Wales would be \"breathing a huge sigh of relief\".\n\"The bigger concern is that parents take this seriously and that when children return to school, that it's not like a return to normality, so they don't begin play dates and sleepovers, thinking it's normal,\" she said.\nLaura Doel, director of school leaders' union NAHT Cymru, said there were \"still too many unknowns\" - such as vaccine efficacy and infection rates - to put the 22 February date \"firmly in the diary yet\". \nMs Doel added the teaching workforce should also be prioritised for vaccinations.\nEithne Hughes, director of the association of schools, colleges and leaders in Wales (ASCL Cymru), described the plan to allow the youngest school pupils to return as a \"sensible first step\" as school learning is \"so important to their development\".\nSally Holland, the children's commissioner for Wales, urged ministers to set out the \"milestones\" needed to be reached before children returned.\nOn Wednesday, Dr Atherton said the outbreak was \"shrinking rather than growing\", but rates were still \"way too high\".\nHowever, Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast there would be \"minor adjustments\" to lockdown rules - including bubbles and exercise.\nFrom Saturday people will be allowed to meet one person from another household to exercise in a public outdoor place.\nRunner Michelle Graham from Cardiff said: \"This is such good news. It's been really, really hard to keep training, just to keep running, when all you can do is go out and run on your own.\n\"I'm supposed to be training for an ultramarathon in June and a couple of marathons later on in the year, fingers crossed, if everything goes ahead. \n\"But just getting out there on your own, day in day out - it's going to be so great to be able to run with someone else. Really, really excited about today's news.\"\nIn Friday's briefing, Mr Drakeford said the change was in response to \"messages we've heard from women about not feeling safe\" when exercising at this time of year.\nHe added they would still have to leave from \"your own front door and return to your own front door\".\nThe Welsh Government said social distancing must be maintained and children under 11 were allowed to accompany adults.\nMr Drakeford said changes to rules on bubbles from tomorrow would allow people \"to dissolve the bubble they're in at the moment and reform it with another household, provided there's a 10-day gap between the two\".\nHe said \"weeks into this some people will have moved, some relationships will have changed.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies has called for a \"route map out of lockdown\" which included \"crucial targets concerning the roll-out of coronavirus jabs, falling numbers of infections and the reopening of schools and businesses\".\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price urged a raft of new measures, including making medical grade masks compulsory for everyone and increasing the level and flexibility of the self-isolation support.\nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nThe postcode search has been updated to replace data for health boards in Scotland with data for local councils.

      "text": "A major search operation for three people missing on a fishing boat from Conwy will resume on Friday morning, the coastguard has said.\nThe Nicola Faith vessel was expected back in the port at midnight on Wednesday.\nBut the fishing boat was reported missing to the HM Coastguard shortly after 10:00 GMT on Thursday.\nA search involving seven RNLI lifeboats, a helicopter and fixed-wing plane was suspended at about 21:00 GMT.\nRescue teams from Rhyl, Bangor and Llandudno Coastguard Rescue Teams were sent to assist the search, along with seven RNLI lifeboats from Rhyl, Llandudno and Conwy. \nAs well as the coastguard search and rescue helicopter from Caernarfon, a fixed-wing coastguard aircraft also took part in the operation.\nAt about 20:00, the Beaumaris, Conwy and Llandudno inshore lifeboats returned to their stations having been stood down, with the all-weather boats from Rhyl, Llandudno and Hoylake remaining at sea a while longer. \nThe entire search was then suspended for the night, with \"a further search planned for first light\" on Friday, the coastguard said.\nAn RNLI spokesman told BBC Wales: \"Absolutely every effort is being made to find the missing vessel and our thoughts are clearly with the family, who are clearly worried about their loved ones at this time.\"\nRhyl RNLI volunteer Paul Frost said the 10m (33ft) fishing vessel was last seen at 22:00 on Wednesday night, off Rhos-on-Sea.\nHe added the search operation was being heavily-resourced as it covered a huge area.\n\"It is literally hundreds of square miles, the area searched is something like 30 miles across by about 15 miles out as well. That's why so many resources have been utilised to try and search the area adequately,\" he said.\n\"It's very, very cold but the sea conditions aren't too bad. But the problems now are exacerbated by the oncome of night which makes searching more difficult.\"\nNorth Wales Police was also involved and an alert was sent to other boats in the nearby area, a coastguard spokeswoman said.\nAs it grew dark, duty controller for HM Coastguard Rob Priestley said: \"We are continuing to search a wide area to try and find this vessel with all the assets we have at our disposal. We're also asking other vessels in the area to keep a look out for anything that might also assist the search.\"\nThe boat was said to have left Conwy yesterday to go fishing and hadn't returned. \nIt was due to return at midnight last night, but the alarm was raised round about 10am this morning when the emergency services were contacted.\nHolyhead coastguard have been coordinating the search during the course of the day. \nThey've had a quite considerable number of resources - we're talking about three coastguard team volunteers on the land, searching the coast, out at sea; seven lifeboats, which lifeboat crews say is a very unusual amount of lifeboats all at one time, all on the same job, all out searching a very wide area; and then up in the air above there's been a coastguard helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft as well.\nIt's covering a very large area, as far east as Rhyl where, off the coast there, people have spotted search activity going on, and as far west as Beaumaris and Puffin Island, that area just off the coast of Anglesey was brought into the search area this afternoon."
