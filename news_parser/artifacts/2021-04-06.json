      "tags": "Social media,Lil Nas X,LGBT,Music",
      "text": "Lil Nas X has shared a defiant message for his \"haters\" after reaching number one with his new single, Montero (Call Me By Your Name).\nThe track, which is a celebration of gay sexuality, has been criticised by conservatives in the US, who have called it \"depraved\" and \"evil\".\nBut the song has topped the charts in the US and UK, thanks in part to the spotlight his critics have shone on it.\n\"I hope my haters are sad,\" he said in response. \"I hope they are crying.\"\nReferring to the his chances at the prestigious Grammy Awards, he added: \"I want your tears to fill my Grammy cup.\"\nIt is the star's second number one after Old Town Road, the country-rap crossover that spent a record 19 weeks at the top of the US chart in 2019.\nMontero has caused a stir with its high-concept video, which sees Lil Nas X descending to hell on a stripper pole and lapdancing for the devil - before killing him, stealing his horns and claiming them for himself.\nThe 21-year-old simultaneously released a limited edition range of sneakers, dubbed Satan Shoes, which featured a drop of human blood in the sole.\nBoth the video and the merchandise were condemned by some commentators. \nCandace Owens accused the rapper of \"keeping black America behind\", while author and former US marine Matthew Betley described the video as a \"sick and depraved and an attempt to destroy our society\".\nNike also intervened, filing a trademark infringement claim against the art collective MSCHF, who used modified Nike Air Max 97s to create the Satan Shoes.\nThe critics played into Lil Nas X's hands, as he waited by his keyboard with an arsenal of barbed responses.\nWhen the governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem, criticised the Satan sneakers, Lil Nas X replied: \"ur a whole governor and u on here tweeting about some damn shoes. do ur job!\"\nThen the rapper Joyner Lucas suggested the Montero video was unsuitable for children. Lil Nas X shot back: \"I literally sing about adultery in old town road. u decided to let your child listen. blame yourself.\"\nFox News dedicated a segment to the rapper's video, so he reposted the clip in celebration. \"I thought y'all didn't like political correctness. what happened?\" he added.\nLater, he posted a fake apology video on YouTube, which slam-cut into Montero's infamous lap-dancing scene.\nAnd he issued a separate \"censored\" version of the music video, which consisted of a single still image of a public toilet, captioned \"Montero but ur in the bathroom of hell while lil nas is giving satan a lap dance in the other room\".\nIn stoking the fires of the trending topic pages, the rapper was drawing on his experience of running a Nicki Minaj \"stan\" account in his teens.\nWhat makes him special, wrote internet culture analyst Brian Feldman is the \"versatility\" and the \"variety to his approach\". \nThat approach is \"one that can be inherently understood as someone adapting on the fly and deploying different strategies as needed\", he added. \"It's not a brute force approach, or a stubborn one. It's very canny.\"\nAbsolutely. The furore surrounding Montero is at least partly deliberate. \nLil Nas X's video is teasing and camp - but it also knows the history of moral panic when musicians mix sexuality and religion, from the backwards messages supposedly hidden in songs by The Beatles and Judas Priest, to Madonna's Like A Prayer video.\nBut there's a serious side to this too.\nThe rapper says Montero was inspired by a man he met and fell for last summer. In a more reflective moment on Twitter, he wrote: \"I spent my entire teenage years hating myself because of the [things] y'all preached would happen to me because i was gay. So i hope u are mad, stay mad, feel the same anger you teach us to have towards ourselves.\"\nIn the UK, Montero was streamed 6.8 million times last week - 2.5 million of which were plays of the video. It is the second single to debut at number one this year, after Olivia Rodrigo's Drivers Licence.\nIn the US, Montero drew 46.9 million streams and and sold 21,000 downloads. Lil Nas X was in a jubilant mood after finding out - recalling how he'd been branded a one hit wonder after the success of Old Town Road.\n\"Y'all told a 19 year old who had just escaped the lowest point of his life that he would never have a hit again,\" he tweeted.\n\"You told him to stop while he's ahead. he could've gave up. But 4 multi platinum songs and 2 #1's later, he's still here.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "text": "Town centres are to be the focus of the Welsh Government's \"mission\" for post-Covid economic recovery.\nAn extra \u00a3270m is to be made available to offer long-term financial help to businesses.\nHowever firms that are given government support will be expected to reduce carbon use and be fair employers.\nDeputy Minister Lee Waters said Wales must set out a \"green, prosperous and a fairer\" economic recovery from the pandemic.\nIn its Economic Resilience and Reconstruction Mission, the Welsh Government has spelt out how it aims to strengthen businesses and help those firms that innovate, to offer skilled jobs.\nEmployers will be encouraged to show how their organisations are reducing their impact on the environment and promise permanent work.\n\"If businesses want support from the government they have to sign up to give something back as well - an economic and social contract which respects fair work, respects the environment and can harness and support workers mental health, I think that's a fair deal,\" said Mr Waters. \nWith high streets in Wales already changing, the mission said Covid has increased the speed of that change - as seen with the closure of Debenhams and Topshop stores, among others. \nThe Welsh Government said different departments are working to help towns have a new future, by repurposing buildings and encouraging hubs where people can work closer to home rather than commuting.\nThe public sector in Wales spends around \u00a36bn a year and the plan is for more to be spent within Wales, to help jobs and prosperity.\nNHS Wales, for example, spends \u00a322m a year on food - 48% of which is being spent with businesses outside Wales.\nHowever, the Welsh Government claimed efforts to combat Covid and effects of Brexit have reversed the last decade's progress in reducing unemployment and economic inactivity.\nYoung people, women, disabled people and ethnic communities are being hit hardest with job losses and working fewer hours because of Covid, ministers say.\nThe mission also wants business success to be measured by the percentage of people in permanent employment, narrowing the gender pay gap, household incomes, air pollution levels, greenhouse gas emissions and the percentage of companies carrying out research and development. \nWelsh Conservative economy spokesman, Russell George MS, welcomed the additional support but said it is \"disappointing Labour ministers continue to drag their heels\" on extending the business rates holiday.\n\"We now face a huge challenge to rebuild Wales after the pandemic, and Welsh Labour's dismal track record has stifled economic growth to the extent where ministers have admitted they don't know what they've been doing on the economy,\" he said.\nPlaid Cymru's economy spokeswoman, Helen Mary Jones, said the Welsh Government's plan was \"a pale imitation\" of her party's \u00a36bn Welsh Green Deal, which claims to see 60,000 jobs created.\n\"Twenty years of a Labour government in Wales has been characterised by a failure of delivery,\" she said.

We'll have another update for you on Wednesday morning. \nBoris Johnson has said the public should continue to get a coronavirus vaccine when they are offered it, amid concern over potential side-effects of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The PM said getting vaccinated was \"the key thing\" and the advice from the UK's medicines watchdog was to keep giving the jab. Inquiries by regulators into whether there is a link between the jab and rare blood clots are ongoing. A number of countries have suspended the use of the jab among younger people, including in Germany and Canada. Read more about the blood clot risk here.\nA stronger economic recovery for this year and next is being forecast by the International Monetary Fund, in an upgrade of its UK and global forecasts compared with its projections in January. The British economy is still predicted to return to its pre-pandemic level of activity only in late 2022. The new UK forecast is for growth of 5.3% this year and 5.1% in 2022. Both figures are upgrades, though the latter is only marginally higher than the January forecast.

Students will no longer have to follow the two-metre social distancing rule when they return, but they will have to wear face coverings at all times and all age groups will be offered access to twice-weekly Covid lateral flow testing. Pupils who are shielding are advised to remain at home until 26 April. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said that secondary school pupils in England must continue to wear face masks in class after the Easter holidays.\nThe NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app for England and Wales will soon ask users to share details of venues they have checked in to if they test positive for coronavirus. Officials will be able to use the information to alert other visitors as to whether they need to be tested for Covid. The Department of Health and Social Care insisted a \"privacy-protecting\" approach is being taken. The updates to the app come ahead of the reopening of non-essential shops in both nations on 12 April, in addition to outdoor hospitality in England.

      "text": "Secondary schools in Scotland will reopen full time as planned after the Easter holidays, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.\nPupils will no longer have to follow strict two metre physical distancing rules when they return, and must wear face coverings throughout the school.\nMs Sturgeon said \"virtually all\" secondary pupils would be back in the classroom after the holidays.\nThe only exception is for those pupils in the shielding category.\n\"We are continuing to recommend that they stay at home until 26 April, and that's in line with the advice already received from the chief medical officer,\" said Ms Sturgeon.\nPrimary schools had already resumed full-time teaching before the holidays, but a part-time blended learning system had been used in secondary schools.\nThe first minister said the return to in-person, full-time learning would be \"a huge relief\" to many children and parents.\nShe acknowledged that there would be some \"concern and anxiety\" about the move, but said safety would be \"paramount\"\n\"The return to school will involve the removal, where necessary, of strict two metre distancing between pupils, but we are asking schools to consider how they strengthen their mitigations,\" she said.\nSecondary pupils will have to wear face coverings at all times, and all age groups will be able to access twice-weekly lateral flow testing.\nDuring the coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon was asked about the assessment system for senior pupils following concerns that some would be sitting \"exams by another name\" in coming weeks.\nShe said: \"There is no requirement to replicate a full exam or prelim this year. Teacher judgement is at the centre of this.\"\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats' Alex Cole-Hamilton said he had \"some real concerns\" that the assessments were exams by another name.\nHe said this would put \"tremendous pressure\" on teachers and pupils, adding: \"We have to make sure young people have every support they need.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the full-time return of pupils would bring \"a sense of relief\" for parents.\nBut he added: \"Now we have a ramping up of the vaccine supply, we should be looking at rolling out those vaccines for teachers to give them a sense of confidence, and to pupils and parents as well.\"\nLarry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teachers' union, said there needed to be \"great caution\" over the return of pupils to school.\n\"It will undoubtedly lead to an increase in school Covid outbreaks, which will require to be dealt with quickly, particularly for senior pupils who will be in the final stages of their qualification work,\" he said.\n\"If we had made more progress on the EIS demands of ventilation, vaccination and facemasks, we would be in a stronger position. Improving such mitigations is still possible.\"\nThe first minister also told the briefing that the first batch of the newly-approved Moderna vaccine had arrived in Scotland.\nScotland is due to receive more than one million of the 17 million doses ordered by the UK.\n\"The fact that we now have three vaccines in use is clearly very welcome and it does give us greater security of supply which is welcome,\" she said.\nResponding to questions about the prospect of introducing vaccine passports for those who have had their jab, Ms Sturgeon said it was important \"not to close our minds\" to the idea.\nShe said that if the public are to have confidence in any future certification process, time must be taken to \"air all of the challenges\".\n\"We all want to get back to normal, so anything that can play a part in getting us back to normal is something we should think about very carefully,\" she said.\n\"But nor should we gloss over the practical and ethical issues.\"\nThe UK government has said the introduction of certificates which could show vaccination, test or immunity status is one option currently being considered.\nAlison Johnstone, from the Scottish Green Party, said she had not been convinced that widespread use of vaccination passports would be a good thing.\n\"There may be some cases where this is appropriate, but I would be extremely concerned about the introduction of a vaccine passport at a domestic level,\" she said.\nA total of 2,577,816 people in Scotland have now received their first dose and 463,780 have received their second dose.\nThere were 259 positive cases of Covid reported in the last 24 hours, a positivity rate of 2%. No further deaths were recorded.\nMs Sturgeon said routine testing will be expanded to enable everyone to take a lateral flow test twice a week. A similar move was announced in England on Monday.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the figures indicated that things were moving in the right direction.\nHe said this meant there were \"a number of reopenings that can be safely and cautiously brought forward\" - such as allowing alcohol to be served with a meal indoors in pubs and restaurants."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Apps,NHS,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "As the UK gets closer to easing its coronavirus lockdowns, attention is turning to how we might safely mix again and what role tech might play.\nAnd despite previous denials that a \"Covid passport\" app was being considered, it is now on the agenda.\nAfter all the hoo-ha and costs involved in creating the contact-tracing apps last year, you might think that a very brave decision.\nBut earlier this week The Times reported that the facility would be built into the existing NHS app used to access health services in England.\nIt is distinct from the NHS Covid-19 app used by England and Wales to warn people if they might have recently been infected, and fewer people have downloaded it.\nBut according to Google's own figures, it has been installed on more than one million Android devices (Apple does not share stats for iOS), which represents a decent start.\nOfficially, Downing Street says the matter is still under review and it does not want to pre-empt anything by speculating on the subject.\nBut it's clear there would be several benefits.\nFirstly, the NHS app, which serves patients in England only, already links up to users' GP services to give smartphone owners access to their medical records.\nIn fact, it can already provide a record of whether some people have been given one of the coronavirus jabs, if the GP surgeries involved have shared the information.\n(Confusingly, this sometimes appears under the Medicines tab rather than the Immunisations one if you've had an injection and want to check yourself).\nSo health chiefs would not need to build new IT infrastructure to get at the information.\nSecondly, the app has already tackled many of the security issues involved.\nTo set it up you must provide your NHS number, email address, phone number and then upload either an image of your passport or driving licence.\nThe smartphone then takes a scan of your face to check it matches the characteristics on the image on your official identification.\nAnd then, as a supplement to the automated checks, a human review takes place before you are granted access.\nHowever, there are still issues to be addressed.\nPeople would need to get to the certificate without having to hunt around several menus - possibly via a button at the bottom of the screen.\nAnd then the information would have to be presented in a format that someone else could verify quickly and easily.\nAnother health pass app points the way to how that might be done.\nTested.me displays a scannable barcode over an image of the user's face to provide employers with a means of keeping track of the health status of their staff.\nOf course, if the NHS app adopts a similar scheme, it will require other software to be developed so that establishments can verify a person's barcode when they present it.\nAnd there are further hurdles to overcome to prevent people who have yet to be vaccinated from simply passing off a screenshot of someone else's code, with their own face edited in, to access a venue.\nThat presupposes that it would be acceptable for businesses and other organisations to deny people access to a venue or their workplace if they have not been vaccinated.\nAnd one must bear in mind that while vaccines reduce the risk of someone getting seriously ill from at least some of the Covid-19 variants, it is still unknown how much impact they will have on people becoming infected and passing the virus on.\nSo the point of having such an app might only be to demonstrate that you would be unlikely to get seriously ill by entering an area, rather than proving you do not pose a threat to others.\nA further consideration is that these \"passports\" would probably not be used for travel abroad.\nThe World Health Organization is exploring what specifications an international scheme would require to work across borders and support different countries' immunisation programmes. \nIt already oversees an International Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate.\nAnd the requirements of such a scheme might be different from those used by the NHS app.\nOne last issue is whether the government would allow third-party apps to tap into its system to offer specialised vaccine certificates of their own. \nThese would be customised for use in certain workplaces or leisure activities, where the details could be stored alongside ticketing or other relevant non-health-related data.\nIdentity-check technology provider iProov, whose face-scanning software is already integrated into the NHS app, is among those keen to do this.\nIts chief executive, Andrew Bud, pointed out that the NHS already had a mechanism to allow private apps to tap into GP records subject to strict security requirements.\nBut whether ministers would want to complicate matters by allowing there to be multiple ways to present a vaccine passport is another matter.\nIn any case, speaking to sources within NHSX - the division likely to be responsible for any digital certificate involving the NHS app in England - one thing becomes apparent: discussions about what would be involved are at a very early stage. \nAnd that means it will be many months before the idea of presenting an app to door staff to prove you have been jabbed has any chance of becoming a reality."

There were reports of minor trouble in nearby Linn Road in the town.\nDuring the disturbances on Monday night, police said petrol bombs and masonry were thrown at officers \"as they worked to restore order in the areas\".\nA stretch of the M2 in Ballymena was also closed for a time after debris and bins were thrown onto it.\nIn Derry, a group of about 20 young people were involved in setting a car on fire in Sperrin Park, a seventh night out of eight in which there has been violence in the city. \nDetectives are also investigating parades in Portadown and Markethill on Monday.\nSocial media footage showed a number of masked men taking part in a loyalist band parade in the Jervis Street area of Portadown.\nThe police and political parties have repeatedly called for calm, with the disturbances blamed on loyalist frustrations over a PPS (Public Prosecution Service) decision not to prosecute people who attended the large-scale funeral of republican Bobby Storey in June 2020, as well as concerns about the NI Protocol in the Brexit deal.\nThe leaders of the DUP, UUP and TUV have called for Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign over the PSNI's handling of the funeral, which was attended by a number of senior Sinn F\u00e9in politicians, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.\nThe NI Protocol has increased checks and caused disruption for some goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nThere has been a concern that loyalist anger would eventually make its way onto the streets.\nYou could say the writing was on the wall - literally - since January and growing tension over the Irish Sea border.\nBut there is a melting pot of grievances, largely bottled up by lockdown.\nThis ranges from policing, to politics to societal problems.\nThe rioting was low-level, relatively scattered and localised - there is no sense of a broader, joined-up orchestration.\nAnd then there were incidents - unlawful marches - where there was no violence at all.\nIn short, no one reason sparked successive days of unrest.\nSeveral agendas are at play, including the South East Antrim UDA kicking back at the PSNI after a clampdown on its criminality.\nOnce on the streets, will things gather momentum?\nOr will a combination of police action against rioters and a de-escalation of tension and political rhetoric calm things down?   \nCh Supt Davy Beck said he believed there were a number of \"small disaffected groups that are linked to criminality that are involved in orchestrating and promoting this violence\".\nHe said while there were tensions across communities there was \"no justification for violence and attacks on police officers and members of public\".\n\"When our officers have arrived to deal with situations they are met with petrol bombs, debris, wheelie bins and that takes a degree of orchestration - which is evidence this is not spontaneous,\" he added.\nThe senior police officer said he did not want to see young people being criminalised.\n\"Not only did their reckless and criminal behaviour place the lives of our officers in danger, but such senseless behaviour shows the blatant disregard those responsible have for the safety of others by throwing debris onto a motorway. \n\"It is extremely fortunate no one was seriously injured, or worse.\"\nThe assembly is to be recalled on Thursday morning to discuss the violence.\nThe Alliance party secured the 30 signatures needed for the recall.\nLast week, the assembly was recalled early as MLAs debated a motion of censure against Sinn F\u00e9in politicians in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey.\nDuring the Easter weekend, officers were injured during violence in Belfast, Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Derry.\nThe Police Federation said some of those who were hurt had potentially \"career-impacting\" injuries.\nPolice said the officers injured in Ballymena on Monday were expected to be able to return to duty on Tuesday."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pubs and restaurants serving outside can reopen as planned next Monday, along with non-essential shops, gyms and hairdressers, as England's lockdown is further eased, the PM has said. \nBut Boris Johnson urged caution, saying: \"We can't be complacent.\"\nOfficials were examining the potential role of Covid status certificates, he told a Downing Street briefing.\nPilot events will take place from mid-April to trial the system, with later events checking vaccinations.\nSpeaking in Downing Street, the prime minister also said the government was \"hopeful\" international travel could resume in the next stage of lockdown easing on 17 May, but cautioned against the effects of the surge of coronavirus in other parts of the world.\nHe said the government would set out \"well before 17 May what is reasonable\" and aim to give the aviation industry \"as much notice as possible\".\nIt comes as the government has published an update on a series of reviews into Covid certificates, the safe return of mass events, international travel and social distancing rules.\nIn the document, the government says it cannot yet confirm international travel can resume on 17 May \"given the state of the pandemic abroad\", and advises people not to book summer holidays abroad \"until the picture is clearer\".\nIt also confirms further details on a risk-based \"traffic light\" system for foreign travel will be published in a report later this week.\nOn Covid status certification, the paper says this could have an important role to play both domestically and internationally and \"is likely to become a feature of our lives\" while the pandemic continues.\nA certification scheme could record whether people had been vaccinated, recently tested negative or had natural immunity.\nThe NHS is working on digital and non-digital ways for individuals to demonstrate their Covid status, according to the government paper, but there were no details on whether this might include using an app.\nMore than 40 Conservative MPs have signed a cross-party letter opposing the use of vaccine passports for access to jobs or services, with critics calling such a move \"discriminatory\".\nThe BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said vaccine passports had managed to \"achieve the remarkable political feat of uniting a former Labour leader and a former Conservative leader against them\", as he asked the prime minister if there would be a vote in Parliament on their introduction.\nMr Johnson said the question of a Commons vote was \"taking too many fences at once\", and that the government needs to work out its proposal.\nHe stressed that certification would not be introduced either for the 12 April lockdown easing or for the planned further changes from 17 May that would see pubs and restaurants serving customers indoors.\nBut he said \"all countries\" were looking at vaccination status for international travel, adding: \"I do think that's going to be part of the way people deal with it and we need to think about that.\"\nThe government's review said that public transport and essential shops and services would never require Covid status certification, but it could play a role in allowing people to return to theatres, nightclubs, and events such as festivals or sports fixtures.\nIt is also possible that requiring customers to prove their status could \"play a role in reducing social distancing requirements in other settings\" such as pubs and restaurants, the document states.\nThe government said this would be considered in consultation with the industry, and that businesses should continue to plan to reopen in line with the latest guidance.\nLabour has backed the move to proceed as planned on 12 April, but shadow health minister Justin Madders told the BBC the party had concerns about how vaccine passports could affect \"liberties and freedoms\".\nMeanwhile, Tory former chief whip Mark Harper, leader of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptics, has called for Parliament to be given a vote on vaccine passports, warning they would lead to a \"two-tier Britain\".\nAnd the Confederation of British Industry said firms would need help to navigate \"ethical, legal and practical implementation challenges\" around status certificates.\nThe further easing of lockdown was expected given the data is perhaps as positive as it possibly could be.\nHospital admissions and deaths have fallen sharply. Even infection rates - that some warned would start rising quickly with the reopening of schools - have continued to drop.\nWith the vaccination programme going well, the UK is certainly in a strong position compared to most.\nWhat's more, the steps being taken from 12 April are not considered particularly high risk.\nIt's the return of indoor mixing in May that is more of a worry - and then how to allow foreign travel and big events like live sport and music concerts.\nThe prime minister was careful not to make any promises on these.\nGovernment modelling suggests a resurgence of hospital cases and deaths is still \"highly likely\" in the future.\nThat's because the vaccine does not work for everyone and not all those in the at-risk groups have come forward for a jab.\nThere's good reason to believe this resurgence will be limited - perhaps no worse than a bad flu season - but it's the possibility it could be much worse that is causing the concern.\nSpeaking alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, Mr Johnson said the decision to proceed with the rule changes was \"fully justified by the data\".\nHe said the government could see nothing in the present data to make it deviate from its roadmap, with \"things still seem set fair\" for the next step along on 17 May.\nBut he added: \"We can't be complacent, we can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries.\"\nMr Johnson encouraged people to use free NHS tests, as everyone in England is to be given access to two rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday.\nMeanwhile, Prof Whitty warned \"this virus will be with us for the foreseeable future\", and Sir Patrick suggested the pandemic could result in long-term changes in behaviour.\nSeparately, the government's scientific advisers have said the next phase of unlocking is \"highly unlikely\" to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. \nHowever, later steps such as indoor mixing are \"highly likely\" to lead to a resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths, SPI-M - a subgroup of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - has predicted.\nTravel industry leaders expressed frustration at the lack of \"clarity\" in the latest update on foreign travel. \nClive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, called for \"a clear pathway to international travel and trade\", adding: \"The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement.\"\nMeanwhile, Airport Operators Association chief executive Karen Dee said the update \"continues to suggest significant barriers to international travel and may push back the date of restart beyond 17 May\", while Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK said it \"does not provide the clarity we were seeking\"."

      "text": "Boris Johnson says any testing regime for international travel should be easy and cheap, after the boss of EasyJet criticised new government plans.\nThe prime minister also said vaccine passports would be a \"fact of life\" for people travelling internationally in future.\nThe government hopes to reopen international travel on 17 May, but is yet to make a final decision. \nHowever, the prime minister said he had \"not given up\" on the idea.\nUnder plans outlined on Sunday, destinations would be classed as green, amber or red based on their Covid infection rates and vaccination coverage. \nNo isolation would be necessary on return to the UK from green countries, but pre-departure and post-arrival tests would be required, potentially costing up to \u00a3200 each.\nBut earlier on Tuesday, EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren told the BBC this would make travel too expensive, with the tests costing as much or more than a flight in some cases.\nAsked about the comments, and whether cheaper lateral flow tests could replace PCR tests in the plans, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"I do think we want to make things as easy as we possibly can.\n\"The boss of EasyJet is right to focus on this issue, we're going to see what we can do to make things as flexible and as affordable as possible.\"\nMr Lundgren told the BBC that if costs were not reduced, the government \"wouldn't open up international travel for everyone, but only those who can afford it.\n\"If you are ticking all of those boxes to become a green destination\u2026 [multiple tests] don't make sense to me and it would add to cost and complexities.\"\nScientists and ministers recently warned that holidays to destinations such as France, where Covid cases are rising, are \"unlikely\". But Mr Johnson said he \"had not given up\" on the idea that non-essential foreign travel could begin again on 17 May.\nHowever, other travel industry figures called for clarity following the prime minister's latest announcement on lockdown restrictions easing.\nThe Business Travel Association said the announcement was \"beyond disappointing\" and called for \"a clear pathway to international travel and trade\".\nIts chief executive, Clive Wratten, said moves to open borders had \"once again been kicked down the road\".\n\"The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement,\" he added.\nThe boss of travel firm Thomas Cook, Alan French, also told the BBC's Wake Up to Money that a lack of clarity around what type of tests might be required for passengers and when they would need to be taken was a let-down.\nHe said that overall, there were \"glimmers of good news\", in that the earliest date for travel resuming on 17 May was not pushed back. \"But actually, the details were missing and that was disappointing,\" he said.\nOn Monday, Mr Johnson said he did not want to see coronavirus re-imported from abroad and urged people to wait for a report from the Global Travel Taskforce on 12 April.\nBut Gemma Antrobus, owner of independent travel company Haslemere Travel, warned that business owners like herself faced a difficult path.\n\"Disappointed is putting it mildly. Where we hoped confidence would start to pick up, and more people would be interested in booking holidays\u2026 that just won't come this week.\"\nShe added that some customers had now moved bookings for holidays five times amid changing restrictions.\n\"Every week we don't have that confidence from consumers, business owners like myself just wonder what lies ahead.\""

      "text": "Mental health \"hubs\" for new, expectant or bereaved mothers are to be set up around England. \nThe 26 sites, due to be opened by next April, will offer physical health checks and psychological therapy in one building.\nNHS England said these centres would provide treatment for about 6,000 new parents in the first year.  \nFive years ago, 40% of areas in England had no dedicated maternal mental health services.\nThings have improved since then with some specialist services available in each of the 44 local NHS areas in England. \nBut in the NHS's Long Term Plan, published in 2019, the health service pledged to offer more \"evidence-based\" support, including to partners and families through these hubs or \"outreach clinics\".\nThe NHS hopes to offer services to people with moderate-to-severe difficulties, whereas earlier investment focused on the most acutely unwell mothers.\nThese clinics will \"integrate maternity, reproductive health and psychological therapy for women experiencing mental health difficulties directly arising from, or related to, the maternity experience,\" NHS England said.\nOne of the new sites, in Devon, opened in January this year. \nLizzie, who experienced low mood and nightmares during her pregnancy having previously suffered a miscarriage, was referred to the service for some support.\nShe was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and offered a therapy called Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), which is designed to help people cope with distressing memories.\nAfter the treatment and having had her baby girl Enfys, Lizzie said: \"I feel unbelievably better after this pregnancy and birth compared to how I felt after my experience with my first child, when there wasn't any support available to me; even with the added distress of having a miscarriage, the pressures of Covid-19 restrictions and not being able to see my family. \n\"I feel happier, more confident and much better in my mental health. I feel fully recovered.\"\nIn 2019-20, more than 30,000 women were seen by specialist perinatal mental health community services. \nNHS England has made a commitment to offer specialist care to at least 66,000 people with mental health difficulties related to pregnancy, birth or parenthood by 2023-24. \nEmily Slater, CEO of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, said: \"For the more than one in 10 expectant and new mothers experiencing mental health problems, and the increased numbers as a result of the pandemic, there needs to be a system of care available to support them. \n\"These new services will enable more women than ever to access vital perinatal mental health care.\"\nHelp will be available from before conception - for those with pre-existing mental health conditions who want to get pregnant - until the baby's second birthday, whereas currently these services are available for the first year of a child's life. \nNHS England said care would be provided for a \"wide range of mental health issues from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after giving birth to others with a severe fear of childbirth,\" for 1,001 days from conception. \nClaire Murdoch, NHS England's national mental health director, said: \"Every woman has a unique experience with pregnancy and motherhood and some will need extra support to cope with mental health issues that can range from anxiety to severe depression. \n\"I would encourage any mum who needs this support to come forward safe in the knowledge that her mental health and wellbeing are of paramount importance and she should not feel ashamed of accessing the help she needs.\"\nThe clinics will also train maternity staff and midwives as well as providing psychological therapies to people during pregnancy and after giving birth.\nThe first 10 sites will open around England \"within months\", in:\nThe rest are expected to be up and running by April 2022, with plans for all 44 local NHS areas to have one of these hubs by April 2024.

      "tags": "Anxiety,Psychiatry,Dementia,University of Oxford,Psychosis,Mental health,Strokes,Neurology,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People diagnosed with Covid-19 in the previous six months were more likely to develop depression, dementia, psychosis and stroke, researchers have found.\nA third of those with a previous Covid infection went on to develop or have a relapse of a psychological or neurological condition. \nBut those admitted to hospital or in intensive care had an even higher risk.\nThe study authors pointed to both the effects of stress, and the virus having a direct impact on the brain.\nUK scientists looked at the electronic medical records of more than half a million patients in the US, and their chances of developing one of 14 common psychological or neurological conditions, including:\nAnxiety and mood disorders were the most common diagnosis among those with Covid, and these were more likely to be down to the stress of the experience of being very ill or taken to hospital, the researchers explained.\nConditions like stroke and dementia were more likely to be down to the biological impacts of the virus itself, or of the body's reaction to infection in general.  \nCovid-19 was not associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a risk from flu).\nThe study, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, was observational. So the researchers couldn't say whether Covid had caused any of the diagnoses - and some people would have had a stroke or depression in the next six months regardless.   \nBut by comparing a group of people who had had Covid-19 with two groups - with flu and with other respiratory infections respectively - the researchers at the University of Oxford concluded Covid was associated with more subsequent brain conditions than other respiratory illnesses.\nThe participants were matched by age, sex, ethnicity and health conditions, to make them as comparable as possible.\nSufferers were 16% more likely to develop a psychological or neurological disorder after Covid than after other respiratory infections, and 44% more likely than people recovering from flu. \nOn top of this, the more severely ill with Covid the patient had been, the more likely they were to receive a subsequent mental health or brain disorder diagnosis\nMood, anxiety or psychotic disorders affected 24% of all patients but this rose to 25% in those admitted to hospital, 28% in people who were in intensive care and 36% in people who experienced delirium while ill. \nStrokes affected 2% of all Covid patients, rising to 7% of those admitted to ICU and 9% of those who had delirium. \nAnd dementia was diagnosed in 0.7% of all Covid patients, but 5% of those who'd experienced delirium as a symptom.\nDr Sara Imarisio, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Previous studies have highlighted that people with dementia are at higher risk of developing severe Covid-19. This new study investigates whether this relationship may also hold in the other direction.\n\"The study doesn't focus on the cause of this relationship and it is important that researchers get to the bottom of what underlies these findings.\"\nThere is evidence the virus does enter the brain and cause direct damage, neurology professor Masud Husain at the University of Oxford, explained.\nIt can have other indirect effects, for example by affecting blood clotting which can lead to strokes. And the general inflammation which happens in the body as it responds to infection can affect the brain.\nFor just over a third of people developing one or more of these conditions, it was their first diagnosis.\nBut even where it was a recurrence of a pre-existing problem, researchers said this did not rule out the possibility that Covid had caused the episode of illness.\nProf Dame Til Wykes, at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, said: \"The study confirms our suspicions that a Covid-19 diagnosis is not just related to respiratory symptoms, it is also related to psychiatric and neurological problems.\n\"Looking over six months after diagnosis has demonstrated that the \"after-effects\" can appear much later than expected - something that is no surprise to those suffering from Long Covid.\n\"Although as expected, the outcomes are more serious in those admitted to hospital, the study does point out that serious effects are also evident in those who had not been admitted to hospital.\""

      "text": "More than one million people in Wales have received both doses of their Covid vaccine, official data shows.\nPublic Health Wales (PHW) has confirmed that 1,000,706 people have had the full dose of the coronavirus vaccine - almost a third of the Welsh population.\nFigures also show that 2,091,824 in Wales have now had their first jab - that's two-third of the population.\nTwo further Covid deaths were reported in Wales, both in the north, on Sunday while PHW confirmed 46 new Covid cases.\nWales' weekly infection rate stands at 9.7 cases for every 100,000 people.\nThe overall Covid death toll in Wales, according to PHW figures, is 5,566 people since the start of the pandemic.\nFigures released on Sunday cover 24 hours up to 09:00 BST on Friday as data is no longer published on Saturday. \nThe confirmation that one million people - or 31.7% of the population - are fully vaccinated in Wales comes as studies show the Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines are highly effective against the variant identified in India after two doses.\nSome 66.3% of the Welsh population have had at least one vaccine but a Public Health England report said two jabs of either vaccine give a similar level of protection against symptomatic disease from the Indian variant as they do for the Kent one.\nHowever, both vaccines were only 33% effective against the Indian variant three weeks after the first dose. This compared with 50% effectiveness against the Kent variant.\nLatest data showed the number of people with the Indian variant of concern had risen to 28 in Wales.\nPHW have said that the \"majority\" of Indian variant cases in Wales are \"associated with travel or with known contacts\" and added \"robust contact tracing processes are in place.\"\nHealth officials say they do \"expect this number to go up\" as it \"may be slightly more transmissible\" than the dominant Kent variant in Wales.\nPHW's coronavirus incident director has said \"most health boards\" have seen cases of the Indian variant of concern and added it \"underlines the message\" to get vaccinated as soon as people are asked.\n\"We are seeing cases of the new variant in Wales but the numbers are small so far,\" said Dr Eleri Davies.\n\"We are seeing an increase in those as we investigate and follow up the contacts and of course, you have seen the figures from England and the fast rise there so we are expecting to see more.\n\"I think with the latest information about the effectiveness of the vaccines, then we are in a good position in Wales with the success of the vaccine programme. \n\"It's clear that, to date, the Kent variant is covered by the vaccine and also the other variants that we are following closely, there is still retained efficacy.\n\"So I think the fact that we are progressing well with our vaccine programme in Wales is very heartening under the circumstances. \"\nThe local authority with the highest rolling case rate for the last seven days is Newport with a case rate of 33 per 100,000 people, followed by Cardiff and Wrexham.\nThere were seven Welsh counties with no new Covid cases while Denbighshire (3.1), Rhondda Cynon Taf (3.3) and Gwynedd (4) and had the lowest infection rates. Wales' rolling average for deaths is 0.6 daily deaths.\nOn the case rates, when broken down into communities, 94% have had two or fewer positive tests in the last week.\nA total of 2,043,254 people have been tested for the virus since the start of the pandemic, with 3,536,315 tests taken. There have been 12,413 tests since the last report. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nThe postcode search has been updated to replace data for health boards in Scotland with data for local councils. In England, data for county councils has been replaced with data for district councils. Figures for boroughs and unitary authorities remain unchanged. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People should get their Covid-19 jab when invited, the PM has said, amid concerns about potential side effects of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nBoris Johnson said getting vaccinated was \"the key thing\" and the regulator's advice was to keep giving the jab.\nIt comes after a European Medicines Agency official, speaking in a personal capacity, said there appeared to be a link with the jab and rare blood clots.\nMore than 31.6 million people in the UK have had a first vaccine dose.\nA total of 5.4 million people have received a second dose.\nTwo vaccines - developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNtech - are being used in the UK, while A third - from Moderna - has been approved.\nThe European Medicines Agency's (EMA) safety committee has been reviewing very rare cases of unusual blood clots in people vaccinated with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt said that the committee had \"not yet reached a conclusion and the review is currently ongoing\", but it is expected to announce findings on Wednesday or Thursday.\nThe UK regulator the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says the benefits of the jab continue to outweigh any risk.\nDuring a visit to the AstraZeneca manufacturing plant in Macclesfield, Cheshire, Mr Johnson defended its vaccine.\n\"On the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the best thing people should do is look at what the MHRA say, our independent regulator - that's why we have them, that's why they are independent,\" said Mr Johnson, who has received the first dose of the vaccine himself.\n\"Their advice to people is to keep going out there, get your jab, get your second jab.\"\nThe prime minister added: \"The best thing of all is to vaccinate our population, get everybody out getting the jab, that's the key thing and that's what I would advocate, number one.\"\nSpeaking to an Italian newspaper in a personal capacity, Marco Cavaleri, head of vaccines at the EMA, is reported to have suggested a clear link between the jab and rare blood clots, though admitted there was uncertainty how the vaccine would cause the complication.\nThe EMA has previously said that there was \"no evidence\" to support restricting the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in any population.\nDr Rogerio Pinto de Sa Gaspar, director of regulation and prequalification at the World Health Organization, said there was \"no link for the moment\" between the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots.\nThe MHRA is investigating reports of a very rare and specific type of blood clot in the brain, known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), occurring together with low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) following vaccination.\nA number of countries have suspended the use of the jab among younger people, including in Germany, which has paused it for people aged below 60, and Canada, where the jab is not being given to those under 55.\nIn total, the UK has secured 457 million Covid vaccine doses, of which 100 million are from AstraZeneca. Vaccines from Moderna will be deployed in the UK \"around the third week of April\", Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi has said.\nThe MHRA has said it identified 30 cases of rare blood clot events out of 18.1 million doses of the jab administered up to and including 24 March. There have been seven deaths among the 30 cases.\nBut the regulator's chief executive Dr June Raine said: \"People should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so.\n\"Our thorough and detailed review is ongoing into reports of very rare and specific types of blood clots with low platelets [the cells involved in clotting] following the Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca.\n\"No decision has yet been made on any regulatory action.\"\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the UK government, told the BBC there was \"a lot of uncertainties around\" and more information was \"desperately\" needed.\nBut, he said, there were some \"clear certainties around\" including the facts that both of the vaccines used in the UK were \"highly effective against Covid\" while the risk of getting sick or dying with Covid for those who are currently being offered doses, \"are far and away greater than any small theoretical risk that may exist relating to these cases\".\nThere have been a further 2,379 coronavirus cases in the UK and another 20 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to the latest government figures."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nadhim Zahawi,Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Mark Harper,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It would be \"remiss\" of the government not to consider Covid certification as a way of fully reopening the economy, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi says.\nAmid criticism of the plans, Mr Zahawi said: \"It's only right that we look at all these options that are available to us to take our lives back.\"\nThe government said certificates showing vaccination, test or immunity status could \"provide reassurance\".\nBoris Johnson said they could help signal a person is not contagious.\nSpeaking on a visit to an AstraZeneca factory in Macclesfield, Cheshire, Mr Johnson said Covid certificates - also referred to as passports - would not be rolled out until well after indoor hospitality reopens from 17 May.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was open-minded about using certificates to allow certain activities to resume, and called for an open debate. \nBut many MPs have criticised the plans, with senior Tory backbencher Mark Harper warning it could lead to a \"two-tier\" Britain, demanding a vote on the issue.\nMr Zahawi was keen to point out that the concept of using Covid certificates to allow international travel was distinct from a review of using them within the UK.\n\"But I think it would be remiss and irresponsible for us to not look at all these things,\" he told BBC Breakfast, adding that any certificate would show test results because testing is available to all, unlike vaccines.\nBut he stressed they would not be needed for the reopening of outdoor hospitality or non-essential retail on 12 April or indoor hospitality from 17 May.\nMr Zahawi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the use of certificates domestically \"does raise a number of ethical issues\".\nGovernment scientific advisers have warned indoor mixing later in the year would be \"highly likely\" to lead to a resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths.\nMr Zahawi said the prediction - by SPI-M, a group that feeds into the government's scientific advisory group, Sage - was why England's roadmap out of lockdown had five-week intervals.\nThe UK government said it was working with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to seek a \"consistent approach\".\nMr Johnson has the power to set public health regulations for England, but it is a devolved power in the other UK nations.\nA government review is currently being carried out to see how certificates that show testing status could work in England - and they are going to be trialled at upcoming events including the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium.\nA series of trials - including comedy nights and a large nightclub event - are also planned in Liverpool to see whether requiring participants to have a negative test can allow big indoor gatherings to be held more safely.\nNo decision has yet been made on whether Covid status certificates will be introduced, but the government has now published an update on its review.\nIt said they could play a role in allowing people to return to theatres, nightclubs and mass events like festivals, and could allow social distancing to be relaxed in hospitality venues.\n\"Even without government intervention, Covid status certification is likely to become a feature of our lives until the threat from the pandemic recedes,\" it added.\nOn the face of it, the UK seems to be in a very strong position. The vaccine rollout is going very well and infection levels, hospitalisations and deaths are all low.\nAnd yet modelling done for the government suggests once all restrictions are lifted the country could be heading for a devastating resurgence in the virus similar to that seen in January.\nHow can this be? First of all, the models are not a prediction. They are an example of what could happen under certain assumptions, including how many do not take up the offer of the vaccines, how much vaccines stop infections and serious illness and how much people mix.\nThe idea of returning to January levels of deaths is at the pessimistic end of those models - and comes with huge caveats. A more optimistic scenario is that deaths are no higher than a bad flu season.\nThe problem the decision makers face is that there are so many unknowns and it is very easy to find yourself playing catching up. Working out what is a proportionate response is the key.\nA recent opinion poll of more than 8,000 UK adults suggested there was strong public support for the use of \"vaccine passports\" in certain situations. \nMore than three-quarters (78%) of those surveyed by Ipsos Mori supported their use for international travel and care home visits, while 74% supported them for visiting relatives in hospital, and 68% to attend the theatre.\nBut opposition to Covid passports being used within the UK has mounted - with a group of more than 70 cross-party MPs criticising the plan last week.\nThey said demanding medical proof in order to take part in local community life, for example going to venues like pubs, is discriminatory and divisive.\nMark Harper, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs, which is against lockdown restrictions, said it was not acceptable for the end of social distancing to depend on certificates.\nHe said it was \"crucial\" that MPs are allowed to vote on the issue. \n\"Trying to introduce these domestic vaccine passports by the back door by linking them to removing social distancing rules just won't be acceptable either,\" he said.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth did not rule out voting for the policy in Parliament, but said he would not support certificates for activities like clothes shopping.\nThe government has said certificates to permit access to essential public services, public transport and essential shops should \"never be required, in order to ensure access for all\".\nMr Zahawi said MPs would \"absolutely\" be offered a vote on Covid certification.\nBehavioural scientist Prof Stephen Reicher, who advises the government as part of SPI-B, which feeds into Sage, criticised ministers for \"very mixed\" messaging that could affect the take-up of jabs.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: \"I think even to talk about vaccine passports, even to talk about the possibility that participating in everyday social life, you will have to get vaccinated is counterproductive at this stage where we'd need to convert and convince those who have doubts.\"\nThe government's certificate review is not expected to be finalised until the summer. \nIt comes as several countries implement their own passport schemes, including Israel.\nMeanwhile, Mr Zahawi confirmed a third vaccine, made by Moderna, would be deployed in the UK \"around the third week of April\". \nMore than 5.4 million people in the UK have been fully vaccinated, with a total of more than 31.6 million first doses given.\nAnother 2,379 cases were reported on Tuesday alongside a further 20 deaths within 28 days of testing positive.\nEngland's next step of lockdown easing is to go ahead as planned on 12 April."

      "tags": "Wales business,GDP,Wales economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " The Welsh economy was in decline even before the pandemic hit, according to new official figures.\nGross domestic product (GDP) - the value of goods made and services delivered in Wales - fell by 2.4% between January and March, the Office for National Statistics said.\nThat followed a decline of 1.1% between October and December 2019.\nScotland, Northern Ireland and every region of England also saw falls to their GDP.\nGeneral Secretary of union Wales TUC Shavanah Taj said: \"This data is a good reminder that Covid isn't the only challenge facing our economy. \n\"The ongoing Brexit negotiations have made many employers reluctant to invest, and the growth in precarious work was already the reality for one in 10 workers before the pandemic.\n\"The challenges facing manufacturing are particularly alarming... this is why we have consistently pushed government to do all it can to retain jobs as we work our way out of this crisis.\"\nWales, along with the rest of the UK, went into lockdown in late March as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.\nSchools, workplaces, shops, gyms and hair and beauty salons closed while sport and leisure activities ceased.\nPublic transport use dropped off dramatically as people were asked to stay home and work from there, or placed on furlough if their workplaces had shut.\nLooking at different industries in Wales , the ONS says education experienced the steepest fall in business.\nIt contracted by 18% between January and March, followed by transport with a fall of just more than 10% and arts and entertainment falling just less than 10%. \nThe average decline across the UK between January and March was 2.5%, slightly steeper than in Wales.\nThe economies of England and Scotland also declined by 2.5% while in Northern Ireland the economy contracted by 4.5%.  \nEvery region of England also saw business decline.\nThe battle against the impact of the pandemic in both health and economic terms has perhaps led us to forget the fragility of the Welsh and UK economies as 2020 began.\nLooking at the UK as a whole, 2019 had seen the economy contract between March and June 2019 , it picked up little over the summer and then went flat again. \nIn fact the GDP figures for October to December 2019 showed a fall of 1.12% with economists blaming the uncertainty around Brexit and what it might mean in practise along with a slowdown globally.\nFrom a Welsh perspective such decrease in economic activity is worrying since the Welsh economy tends to linger at the bottom of the table of nations and regions of the UK in terms of GDP, the value of the goods made and services delivered. \nIn December, Wales was no longer at the bottom , the north east of England was , but Wales performed only slightly better. \nThese new figures for the first three months of the year show how much the Welsh economy, and the UK as a whole , was weakened as Covid restrictions began to impact the economy. \nWe can easily imagine the effect of closed cafes and pubs but the majority of sectors were hit. \nThe 17.8% fall in the value of the education sector between January and March is a reflection of the large number of hours of teaching that were cancelled because of Covid, either with individual teachers not being able to work or schools closing entirely because of lockdown.     \nA reminder of how the world of work was before the lockdown in March is useful . \nIt explains why some businesses and some sectors are finding it hard to operate now with fewer customers .

      "tags": "Jordan,Royalty",
      "text": "The former crown prince of Jordan has pledged allegiance to King Abdullah, two days after he said he was placed under house arrest and accused of trying to destabilise the country.\nPrince Hamzah bin Hussein, 41, issued a statement hours after mediation, saying he was committed to the constitution.\nOfficials said the king had asked his uncle, Prince Hassan, to help resolve the unprecedented tensions.\nThe prince denies the allegations of conspiracy.\nIn a signed letter quoted by the palace on Monday, Prince Hamzah said: \"I place myself in the hands of his majesty the king... I will remain committed to the constitution of the dear Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\"\nThe prince has not spoken publicly since sending videos to the BBC at the weekend.\nMalik Dahlan, a professional mediator and a friend of the family, issued a separate statement, saying the mediation had been \"successful\" and that he expected a resolution \"shortly\", according to the Associated Press news agency.\nPrince Hamzah was first in line to succeed his half-brother, King Abdullah, as Jordan's head of state until 2004, when he was removed as crown prince. King Abdullah designated his son as heir instead.\nThe public rift between Prince Hamzah and King Abdullah is unprecedented. Tensions within the royal household, however, have reportedly been present for some time.\nOn Tuesday, the prosecutor general in the capital, Amman, banned the publication of any information - on media or social media - about tensions between King Abdullah and Prince Hamzah.\n\"In order to keep the security services' investigation into Prince Hamzah and the others secret, [it is decided] to ban the publication of anything related to this inquiry at this stage,\" prosecutor Hassan al-Abdallat said in a statement shown on television.\nOn Saturday, Prince Hamzah released two videos to the BBC in which he claimed he had been placed under house arrest. He said a senior official had told him he was not allowed to go out or communicate with people because of criticisms of the government or king voiced at meetings where he had been present.\nThe apparent arrest is thought to have followed a visit by the prince to tribal leaders, where he is said to have garnered some support.\nOn Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi said the prince had been liaising with foreign parties about destabilising the country and had been monitored for some time.\nHe accused the prince of seeking to mobilise \"clan leaders against the government\". Mr Safadi said officials had tried to discourage the prince rather than take legal action, but Prince Hamzah had \"dealt with this request negatively\".\nHe added that at least 16 people, including a former adviser to King Abdullah and another member of the royal family, had been arrested over the plot. But no members of the armed forces were said to be among those detained.\nAlso on Sunday, Jordan's opposition released a recording in which a defiant Prince Hamzah said he would not obey orders from the authorities.\nJordan confronts a series of crises which are closely entwined: an unprecedented royal rift, an alleged plot involving \"foreign entities\" and growing discontent as a deepening economic crisis bites. \nFor now, the Hashemite royal family appear to have closed ranks. The family elder, Prince Hassan, threw his weight behind the scenes to achieve a public show of unity, bound by loyalty to the king.  But there are still Prince Hamzah's accusations and activities, including meetings with prominent tribes said to have voiced criticism of government and king, which rang alarm bells. \nMany holes in the alleged plot remain. The identities and ambitions of all people detained have not been made public. Nor is it clear which foreign entities may have wanted to destabilise the kingdom. \nWhatever happened was serious enough for Jordan's allies and neighbours, including other Arab monarchies, to race to express full support for King Abdullah. This crisis is not over. \nThe oldest son of the late King Hussein and his favourite wife Queen Noor, Prince Hamzah is a graduate of the UK's Harrow School and the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. He also attended Harvard University in the US and has served in the Jordanian armed forces.\nHe was named crown prince of Jordan in 1999 and was a favourite of King Hussein, who often described him in public as the \"delight of my eye\". However, he was seen as too young and inexperienced to be named successor at the time of King Hussein's death in 1999. \nInstead his older half-brother, Abdullah, ascended the throne and stripped Hamzah of the title of crown prince in 2004, giving it to his own son. The move was seen as a blow to Queen Noor, who had hoped to see her eldest son become king.\nHigh-level political arrests are rare in Jordan. The country's powerful intelligence agency, however, has gained extra powers since the pandemic began, drawing criticism from rights groups.\nA key Western ally, Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, but the royals play a major role in public life and King Abdullah has extensive powers. He can appoint governments, approve legislation and dissolve parliament."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "A trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine on children has stopped giving out jabs while the UK's medicines regulator investigates a possible link with rare blood clots in adults.\nProf Andrew Pollard from the University of Oxford told the BBC there were no safety concerns with the trial itself, but its scientists were waiting for further information.\nAround 300 volunteers signed up.\nEarlier, PM Boris Johnson said people should get their jab when invited.\nMore than 31.6 million people in the UK have had a first vaccine dose and a total of 5.4 million people have received a second dose.\nTwo vaccines - developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNtech - are being used in the UK, while a third - from Moderna - has been approved.\nThe trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on children, which started in February, is assessing whether the jab produces a strong immune response in those aged between six and 17.\nIts suspension comes after a European Medicines Agency (EMA) official, speaking in a personal capacity, said there appeared to be a link with the jab and rare blood clots.\nConfirming that the trial on children was being paused, Prof Pollard said: \"Whilst there are no safety concerns in the paediatric clinical trial, we await additional information from the MHRA on its review of rare cases of thrombosis/thrombocytopaenia that have been reported in adults, before giving any further vaccinations in the trial.\"\nParticipants are advised to continue to attend all scheduled visits and can contact the trial sites if they have any questions.\nUpdates from the EMA and the UK's regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), are expected in the coming days.\nThe EMA said its safety committee had \"not yet reached a conclusion and the review is currently ongoing\".\nThe MHRA says the benefits of the jab continue to outweigh any risk.\nAll medicines, from vaccines to paracetamol, have the potential to cause severe side effects.\nThe seasonal flu jab has around a one-in-a-million chance of causing the nerve disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome, for example.\nThe key question is whether the risks are worth the benefits.\nEven if the vaccine was the cause, and this is still not proven, the numbers suggest around one death in every 2.5 million people vaccinated in the UK.\nFor everyone over the age of 75 infected there is one death per eight Covid infections.\nFor those in their 40s it is one death per 1,000.\nSo on the face of it, the risk-benefit ratio is clearly in favour of vaccination - if you assume you are going to be infected at some point.\nBut what is needed now is more information about who has been suffering from these rare blood clots. How old are they? Do they have any underlying health conditions that could explain what happened?\nThis will help narrow down the scale of any potential risks.\nAn update from the UK regulator - as well as the European one - is expected in the coming days.\nDuring a visit to the AstraZeneca manufacturing plant in Macclesfield, Cheshire, earlier on Tuesday, Mr Johnson defended its vaccine.\n\"On the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the best thing people should do is look at what the MHRA say, our independent regulator - that's why we have them, that's why they are independent,\" said Mr Johnson, who has received the first dose of the vaccine himself.\n\"Their advice to people is to keep going out there, get your jab, get your second jab.\"\nThe prime minister added: \"The best thing of all is to vaccinate our population, get everybody out getting the jab, that's the key thing and that's what I would advocate, number one.\"\nThe MHRA is investigating reports of a very rare and specific type of blood clot in the brain, known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), occurring together with low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) following vaccination.\nA number of countries have suspended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab among younger people, including in Germany, which has paused it for people aged below 60, and Canada, where the jab is not being given to those under 55.\nIn total, the UK has secured 457 million Covid vaccine doses, of which 100 million are from AstraZeneca. Vaccines from Moderna will be deployed in the UK \"around the third week of April\", Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi has said.\nThe MHRA has said it identified 30 cases of rare blood clot events out of 18.1 million doses of the jab administered up to and including 24 March. There have been seven deaths among the 30 cases.\nBut the regulator's chief executive Dr June Raine said: \"People should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so.\n\"Our thorough and detailed review is ongoing into reports of very rare and specific types of blood clots with low platelets [the cells involved in clotting] following the Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca.\n\"No decision has yet been made on any regulatory action.\"\nOne of the members of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - which advises the government on the jab rollout - told the BBC's Newsnight that the issue was being taken seriously and \"we do need to get to the bottom of this\".\nProfessor Adam Finn, who was speaking in a personal capacity, said the trial of the jab on children was paused as a \"precautionary measure\" while they wait for clearer information, rather than because any problems had occurred.\nAsked if his opinion on the vaccine had changed in the last fortnight, Prof Finn cited thromboses being associated with low platelet count and a lack of associated cases with the Pfizer vaccine as being of particular concern.\n\"So those two things do raise the serious possibility that this could be a causal link and certainly means we need to take it very seriously and understand it more clearly,\" he said.\n\"I think personally it's surprising that we haven't seen any cases with Pfizer if it's simply uncausal so that's one of the reasons we're concerned about this.\" \nThere have been a further 2,379 coronavirus cases in the UK and another 20 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to the latest government figures."

      "text": "Two Aboriginal-Australian TV stars have alleged they witnessed racist incidents while working on the set of the popular soap opera Neighbours.\nShareena Clanton alleged \"multiple racist traumas\" during her time on the show in an Instagram post on Monday. \nA day later, former Neighbours actor Meyne Wyatt said he too had experienced racism on set in a tweet.\nThe actors, both Australians of indigenous descent, said they heard other cast members use racist slurs.\n\"It's been lonely, triggering and traumatising to work in such a culturally unsafe space,\" wrote Ms Clanton, who has guest starred in yet-to-be-aired episodes of Neighbours.\nIn response to Ms Clanton's allegations, the show's producer, Fremantle Media, said it would do more to promote inclusion.\n\"Neighbours strives to be a platform for diversity and inclusion on-screen and off-screen,\" a spokesperson for Fremantle Media told the BBC. \"Our quest is always to continue to grow and develop in this area and we acknowledge that this is an evolving process.\"\nFirst broadcast in 1985, Neighbours follows the lives of the residents of Ramsay Street, in a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The soap was a launch pad for numerous pop and Hollywood stars, including Kylie Minogue and Russell Crowe.\nBut the soap has been criticised for failing to reflect Australia's ethnic diversity in its casting of actors.\nMr Wyatt was the first indigenous actor to be added to the main cast when he appeared on the show from 2014 to 2016.\nA spokesperson for Channel 5, which airs the soap in the UK, said it \"condemns racism and takes all allegations of discrimination seriously\".\nBest known for her role in Australian drama series Wentworth, Ms Clanton was hired to play a character named Sheila in upcoming episodes of Neighbours.\nIn her Instagram post, Ms Clanton said she was \"navigating ongoing counselling\" from her stint on what she called a \"highly problematic show\".\nShe made her allegations in a list of seven bullet points, without naming any individuals. One alleged that \"overt and covert levels of racism were rife\" on set.\nShe cited several alleged examples of white actors using racist slurs, including two instances where she claimed the \"n-word\" was openly used.\nShe alleged that she was told to \"go somewhere else\" when she confronted an actor who had used the slur \"because I was making others 'uncomfortable'\".\n\"The retaliation for calling out this misconduct and racism often left me ostracised and further marginalised,\" Ms Clanton wrote.\nMr Wyatt expressed similar sentiments in his posts on Twitter. He said he walked in on someone using a racist insult, \"called it out and it didn't happen around me again\".\nMr Wyatt said it was \"disappointing but not at all surprising\" to hear about Ms Clanton's allegations five years after he had left the show.\nIn its statement, Fremantle Media did not address Mr Wyatt's remarks.\nBut the company said Ms Clanton's involvement in Neighbours was \"hugely educational and will benefit the series moving forward\".\n\"There have been significant and lengthy discussions with Shareena during her time on Neighbours and we will continue to work with all cast and crew to ensure Neighbours continues to be a fully inclusive environment,\" a company spokesperson said."

      "text": "Small towns are set to benefit from a post-pandemic recovery as more people work from home and support independent businesses, a retail expert has said. \nProf Cathy Parker said larger cities in Wales such as Cardiff and Swansea could also recover well with the right planning and resources.\nBut she warned middle-sized towns could face the biggest challenges.\nThe Welsh government has a target of 30% of people working \"at or near home\" after the pandemic is over.\nThat could mean working at home or a co-working office where space is rented by the day or month.\nThat may change depending on the outcome of the Senedd election on 6 May.\nMany people are expected to adopt \"hybrid\" working after the pandemic is over - working some days at home, others in the office.\nBut more people working from home raises questions, including whether people can easily adapt their homes for work, the standard of broadband across Wales and the potential impact on shops and cafes.\nOn the other hand, fewer people travelling to and from work could help tackle congestion and benefit the environment.\nA recent report by the Senedd's economy committee warned the effects of remote working would need to be monitored to ensure they did not increase inequality by \"favouring more highly-skilled and affluent workers\".\nIt also called for a retail strategy to address the challenges faced by businesses and workers in light of more remote working. \nProf Parker, of Manchester Metropolitan University, said it was not an argument about towns versus cities, but rather about each place having an individual recovery plan based on data which showed what worked best for them.\n\"Small places, if they are serving the needs of the small catchment that's around them, can be very resilient and very sustainable,\" she explained.\n\"It's not all about growing, it's about serving the people that live around your town so small places have got it a little bit easier.\"\nShe pointed to places such as Porthcawl in Bridgend county which had seen a 20% drop in footfall last year compared with much larger drops in other places, because it was serving a local community.\nCities have traditionally relied on lots of workers coming into the centre and spending money in businesses there, Prof Parker said.\n\"The larger places will have more adjusting to do but they've probably got the resources to do it.\n\"It's probably perhaps some of those medium-sized places that might struggle more because they are affected by the changes in commuting patterns, and perhaps they haven't got the partnerships there to sort of manage that over the next few years.\"\nMore people are setting up small businesses and large companies are looking for smaller offices, or deciding what to do with surplus space once workers return for only part of the week.\nWork will be more about \"flexibility\" after the pandemic, according to Gareth Jones, chief executive of the co-working offices business Town Square Spaces.\n\"Now we've all had this experiment [of] working from home, we realised working from home is great a couple of days a week, but it's not always ideal, especially if you've got cats jumping on your Zoom and things like this,\" he said.\n\"We're finding a lot of demand is not people wanting to come in five days a week, it's one or two days here and there.\n\"And the demand from the corporate side is interesting because there are companies saying: 'We've got more space than we need, how can we use this in a different way'?\"\nCredit reference company Creditsafe manages offices in 14 countries from its Cardiff headquarters. \nStaff have been largely working from home and have told bosses they want a 50:50 split between working at home and the office after the pandemic.\n\"A lot of people were spending an hour each way to work. So, you know, their lives changed. There are lots of positive to this as well,\" said chief executive Cato Syversen. \nThe planned expansion of the company's Cardiff offices will not now go ahead. \nEmma Jones, a graphic designer from Wrexham, gave up her full-time job to set up her own business in February 2020 - just before the pandemic hit. \nShe is looking forward to going back to a co-working hub in the town in order to be surrounded by a support network. \n\"I can't wait to get out the house,\" she said, adding it was important for workers to return to towns like Wrexham to \"help the economy\" and \"help each other sort of get back into the swing of things\"."

      "text": "Boris Johnson says any testing regime for international travel should be easy and cheap, after the boss of EasyJet criticised new government plans.\nThe prime minister also said vaccine passports would be a \"fact of life\" for people travelling internationally in future.\nThe government hopes to reopen international travel on 17 May, but is yet to make a final decision. \nHowever, the prime minister said he had \"not given up\" on the idea.\nUnder plans outlined on Sunday, destinations would be classed as green, amber or red based on their Covid infection rates and vaccination coverage. \nNo isolation would be necessary on return to the UK from green countries, but pre-departure and post-arrival tests would be required, potentially costing up to \u00a3200 each.\nBut earlier on Tuesday, EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren told the BBC this would make travel too expensive, with the tests costing as much or more than a flight in some cases.\nAsked about the comments, and whether cheaper lateral flow tests could replace PCR tests in the plans, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"I do think we want to make things as easy as we possibly can.\n\"The boss of EasyJet is right to focus on this issue, we're going to see what we can do to make things as flexible and as affordable as possible.\"\nMr Lundgren told the BBC that if costs were not reduced, the government \"wouldn't open up international travel for everyone, but only those who can afford it.\n\"If you are ticking all of those boxes to become a green destination\u2026 [multiple tests] don't make sense to me and it would add to cost and complexities.\"\nScientists and ministers recently warned that holidays to destinations such as France, where Covid cases are rising, are \"unlikely\". But Mr Johnson said he \"had not given up\" on the idea that non-essential foreign travel could begin again on 17 May.\nHowever, other travel industry figures called for clarity following the prime minister's latest announcement on lockdown restrictions easing.\nThe Business Travel Association said the announcement was \"beyond disappointing\" and called for \"a clear pathway to international travel and trade\".\nIts chief executive, Clive Wratten, said moves to open borders had \"once again been kicked down the road\".\n\"The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement,\" he added.\nThe boss of travel firm Thomas Cook, Alan French, also told the BBC's Wake Up to Money that a lack of clarity around what type of tests might be required for passengers and when they would need to be taken was a let-down.\nHe said that overall, there were \"glimmers of good news\", in that the earliest date for travel resuming on 17 May was not pushed back. \"But actually, the details were missing and that was disappointing,\" he said.\nOn Monday, Mr Johnson said he did not want to see coronavirus re-imported from abroad and urged people to wait for a report from the Global Travel Taskforce on 12 April.\nBut Gemma Antrobus, owner of independent travel company Haslemere Travel, warned that business owners like herself faced a difficult path.\n\"Disappointed is putting it mildly. Where we hoped confidence would start to pick up, and more people would be interested in booking holidays\u2026 that just won't come this week.\"\nShe added that some customers had now moved bookings for holidays five times amid changing restrictions.\n\"Every week we don't have that confidence from consumers, business owners like myself just wonder what lies ahead.\""

      "text": "Secondary school pupils in England must keep wearing face masks in class after the Easter holidays, said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.\nFace masks would remain as a \"precautionary measure,\" he said.\nMr Williamson had promised to review the wearing of masks, which have been required since schools reopened fully last month.\nBut head teachers say masks can disrupt learning and should not be used any longer than is \"absolutely necessary\".\nAnnouncing the decision to retain masks in the classroom, at least until 17 May, the Department for Education (DfE) said: \"This cautious approach will help limit the risk of transmission and enable continued monitoring of the effect of school and college returns.\"\nBut the latest DfE guidance says: \"It is expected that face coverings will no longer be required to be worn in classrooms, or by students in other communal areas, at step three of the roadmap, which will be no earlier than 17 May.\"\n\"Schools and students have done a great job adapting to Covid secure guidance and working hard to make sure it doesn't impact learning,\" said Mr Williamson.\n\"We obviously all want to get back to facemask-free classrooms and we will do this in line with the latest scientific data while balancing the interests of students, teachers and the wider community.\"\nHowever, Geoff Barton, head of the school leaders' union ASCL, said that while his union would support the department's new guidance,  masks in class were \"not ideal\".\n\"The use of face coverings is clearly not ideal in a classroom setting, as it has the capacity to disrupt education and it is not something we want to see going on any longer than is absolutely necessary. \n\"We hope that the continued excellent progress with vaccinations will mean it is no longer necessary for students to wear face coverings in lessons when the government announces the next stage in the easing of restrictions in May.\"\nBut Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, welcomed the move.\n\"Relaxing the rules in schools would send a message to pupils and parents that the threat of Covid has passed at a time when extreme caution is still needed.\n\"We are not out of the woods yet and maintaining the highest levels of Covid security in our schools is critical as we move into the new term in order to protect the safety and health of teachers and learners.\""

Elections for the Scottish Parliament will take place in Scotland."

I felt like I was going to be followed and shouted at. I'm used to that when on a night out in town, but not in my home in Cardiff Bay.\"\nBarriers have also been put across the steps to the Senedd, but Ms Head said this was not a solution:  \"The barriers are around two of the biggest seating areas in the bay. \n\"If they weren't up, people would be able to sit down and socially distance, but what they've done is made a forced crowd, they'd usually spread out.\"\nOver the weekend, officers arrested a 20-year-old man for a public order offence, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and possession of a Class A substance and a 35-year-old-man was also arrested for possession of a Class A substance.\nIllegal partygoers were also seen urinating on a memorial to merchant seamen in the area.\nAt the weekend, Cardiff council leader Huw Thomas said people who took part should be \"deeply ashamed of themselves\".\nHe said it a was a \"clear abuse of the rules\", adding: \"I worry about a spike in cases after this.\"\nSouth Wales Police said the Section 35 dispersal order for Cardiff Bay remained in force and would continue to do so until further notice.

      "text": "A decade-long battle over copied code in Google's Android operating system has ended in the US Supreme Court.\nOracle, another tech titan, had sued Google in 2010 for copyright infringement over what it said was copied computer code.\nAndroid is now used in an estimated 70% of global smartphones, and damages could have run into the billions.\nBut the Supreme Court let Google off the hook, overturning a lower court's decision it had infringed copyright.\nThe court ruled six to two in favour of Google.\nAt issue was whether Google's use of Oracle's Java API - a widely-used \"building block\" for programmers - counted as \"fair use\" under US copyright law. \nIf it was, the fact that Google was accused of copying more than 11,000 lines of code would not matter.\nJustice Stephen Breyer, in his written opinion, said that \"to allow enforcement of Oracle's copyright here would risk harm to the public\".\nSo many programmers used and had deep knowledge of Oracle's building blocks that such a move would turn computer code into \"a lock limiting the future creativity of new programs\". \n\"Oracle alone would hold the key,\" he warned.\nOracle made clear that it firmly disagreed with the court's judgement, saying that it had increased Google's power further and damaged other companies' ability to compete.\n\"They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can,\" said Dorian Daley, the company's general counsel, in a statement.\n\"This behaviour is exactly why regulatory authorities around the world and in the United States are examining Google's business practices.\"\nGoogle, meanwhile, painted the decision as a victory for the software industry as a whole.\n\"Today's Supreme Court decision in Google v Oracle is a big win for innovation, interoperability and computing,\" wrote Ken Walker, the company's senior vice president for global affairs.\n\"Thanks to the country's leading innovators, software engineers and copyright scholars for their support.\"\nThe majority of judges agreed that Google's copying of the Java code - in the particular way it was used - was \"a fair use of that material\".\nBut the judges disagreed on how to apply traditional copyright law to computer code.\nJustice Breyer, writing for the majority, acknowledged that it is \"difficult to apply traditional copyright concepts in that technological world\".\nBut in a dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that allowing fair use simply because it allows new products to be created effectively redefines the idea. \n\"That new definition eviscerates copyright,\" he warned.\nHe also lamented that the majority had decided not to rule on whether code was copyrightable, instead saving the question for another day and relying on fair use instead.\n\"The majority cannot square its fundamentally flawed fair-use analysis with a finding that declaring code is copyrightable,\" he wrote of his peers."

      "text": "Claims all over-50s and at-risk adults with underlying health conditions have been offered a Covid vaccine in Wales have been disputed.\nSome people in those groups have said they are still waiting to be contacted to have their jab.\nIt comes after the Welsh government said on Monday it had already met the mid-April milestone target set for all UK governments.\nOn Tuesday, it said \"plans are in place to make sure no-one is left behind\".\nPublic Health Wales (PHW) has said people should contact their health board.\nGarry Edwards, 51, from Anglesey, is registered as asthmatic and said he was still waiting for his invitation.\nHe said he was previously told by his surgery only second jabs were being given, so he called Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board which confirmed he was on the list and would be called.\n\"I know a lot of people who have had, and a lot of people younger than me who have had it - I know people in their 40s who have had it,\" Mr Edwards said on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers.\n\"It's going to be done when it's done but when you are told you are going to be invited to have it... and it hasn't happened, then the statistics are wrong somewhere.\"\nOther listeners to the programme messaged to say they were also still waiting for a first vaccine. \nBeverley Williams, 57, from Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she was still waiting to hear about her vaccine through Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board.\n\"I've had Covid before so I'm a bit stressed,\" she said.\n\"I rang them this morning and they are going to send me another letter and if I don't hear anything by next week, I've got to ring them again.\n\"My husband's [vaccine] was late and he only found out he missed his because they rang him to find out why he hadn't turned up.\"\nShe added he was then booked in for the jab the same day as the call.\nGraham Thomas said it was \"really annoying\" his 84-year-old mother Marion Price was still waiting for her vaccine in Caerphilly.\n\"She has asthma and [lung disease] COPD. She's disabled and can't get out of the house.\"\nHe said she had received an offer to come to the surgery, but it was known she was housebound: \"She has to have a home visit. She's got a letter saying she is on the priority list but she hasn't had a vaccine.\"\nSonja Milano's mother Manuela Levi moved to Bangor, Gwynedd, last summer from Italy.\nThe 50-year-old is registered with a GP but has been told to wait two more weeks for news of a vaccine appointment.\nMs Milano said: \"I phoned her GP surgery today and was told if nothing has happened by then, to call again.\n\"Everybody else around us over 50 has been offered one. I just want to make sure she will get a call.\"\nDr Giri Shankar, incident director for the Covid-19 response at PHW, said vaccinations were delivered by health boards.\n\"I can't think of any systematic issue that would have led to several people having not received their vaccinations,\" he said.\n\"There may be isolated cases where that has happened, which obviously needs to be looked into, and the health boards are best placed to do that.\n\"Without looking into the specific details of each of those cases, it's difficult to say what might have happened, but I think the main thing to say is it's never too late. \n\"If you feel you haven't been given an appointment, you should immediately make contact with the health board.\"\nIn a statement, the Welsh government said: \"Any person aged 50 or over will have had at least their first vaccination or been sent an appointment, and plans are in in place to make sure no-one is left behind. \n\"If health boards have been unable to contact someone on the list, or if an appointment has been missed, systems are in place to go back and check and re-arrange a new appointment for anyone who wants to be vaccinated.\"\nInformation is available on the Welsh government website for people who think they should have had an appointment but have not received one.\nDr Mair Hopkin, joint chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners Wales, said she did not think there was \"potentially a problem\" with delivering the vaccine. \nShe said she had heard cases of people not being offered the vaccine were \"few and far between\".\n\"There may be very many reasons why people have been left off a list,\" Dr Hopkin said, citing people moving house and records not being updated.\nDr Hopkin expressed concern younger people could be harder to reach for vaccination since they could be in education or at work and not \"sitting there waiting for that phone call\".\nShe said it was important the young were vaccinated even if they thought they were not at risk. \n\"You have to remember that you are putting everyone one else at risk,\" she said. \nOn Monday, PHW said 1,493,192 people had received a first dose of the vaccine and 469,251 people were fully vaccinated, having had both jabs.\nThe Welsh government also said on Monday it had achieved its \"second milestone\" of offering a vaccine to everyone over the age of 50 and those with underlying health issues.\nBut Hywel Dda University Health Board, which covers Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, said it was on track to meet the UK's mid-April target by 18 April.\nChief executive Steve Moore encouraged people to get in touch to secure their first vaccine dose if they have not yet had an appointment.\nHe added: \"We have seen an overwhelming response from our wonderful communities across the three counties who have turned up in storms, snow, rain and sunshine to receive their vaccine.\"\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board's primary and community care boss, Dr Chris Stockport, said the \"vast majority\" of appointments for unvaccinated people in groups five to nine were now booked. \nInvitation letters, he said, were \"sent in the post last week\". \n\"Most of these letters have been delivered, but a small number may arrive in the coming days, because of bank holiday postal arrangements,\" Dr Stockport said.\nA \"significant number\" of invitations had also been sent to people in their 40s, he said. \n\"We are determined to not leave anybody behind,\" he said.\nThe uptake of first doses of those in their early 50s across Wales on average was up to 67.2%, while for those in their late 50s, the figure stands at more than 84%.\nThe top four priority groups in Wales, which is made up of all over-70s, including care home residents, were offered a jab by mid-February."

      "tags": "Minneapolis,United States",
      "text": "A police trainer has testified that ex-officer Derek Chauvin was not trained to use his knee in a neck restraint as he did during George Floyd's arrest.\nMinneapolis use-of-force expert Lt Johnny Mercil said Mr Chauvin should also have later moved the prone Mr Floyd to a different position.\nMr Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd for over nine minutes during Mr Floyd's arrest last May.\nMr Chauvin is on trial for murder and has denied the charges against him.\nThe footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on African-American Mr Floyd's neck sparked global protests against racism.\nWith the trial in its second week, jurors have now heard from more than 20 witnesses, including four police training experts on Tuesday. The trial is expected to last for at least one month.\nAs police officers are rarely convicted or charged at all for deaths that occur in custody, the verdict in this trial is being seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future.\nProsecutors are seeking to prove that Mr Chauvin's actions violated his training and have focused their questions on police guidelines and strategies taught to help officers de-escalate situations.\nMr Chauvin's defence attorneys have argued that Mr Floyd's efforts to resist arrest necessitated the restraint, and that the \"hostile\" crowd surrounding Mr Chauvin required \"unique situational awareness\".\nNo witnesses at the scene were arrested, and several of them have testified that they urged officers to check Mr Floyd's pulse and provide him with medical care.\nSpeaking at a group prayer session outside the heavily fortified courthouse on Tuesday, Mr Floyd's brother Philonise Floyd, said \"after we get the verdict and we get this conviction, we'll be able to breathe\".\nMinneapolis Police Department (MPD) training coordinator Mr Mercil told the court that officers are taught to use force in proportion to a suspect's level of resistance and it was \"very important to be careful with the person\".\n\"We tell officers to stay away from the neck when possible,\" he said, adding that officers are told to place body weight on a suspect's shoulders when reasonable.\nMr Mercil testified that based on the training that officers receive, Mr Chauvin should only have used that manner of neck restraint if there was \"active aggression\" involved. \nHe said that Mr Floyd had no ability to resist or show aggression once he was face down on the ground. \nMr Mercil told the court that Mr Chauvin should have recognised that it was \"time to de-escalate the [level of] force\" once Mr Floyd fell unconscious, and that Mr Floyd should have been moved into a different position to avoid asphyxiation.\nEarlier in the day, Sgt Ker Yang, a crisis intervention training coordinator, confirmed that Mr Chauvin had completed the department's 40-hour practical training course and his \"ultimate goal\" should have been to assess Mr Floyd's medical condition during his arrest.\nProsecutors have suggested that asphyxiation was the cause of Mr Floyd's death - contrasting with the ruling of the medical examiner who said Mr Floyd died of \"cardiopulmonary arrest\", which means a person's heart and lungs have stopped.\nMr Chauvin's defence team has contended that alleged drug use and an underlying heart condition contributed to Mr Floyd's death.\nSgt Jody Stiger, a use of force expert for the Los Angeles Police Department, testified that officers were initially justified in their actions because Mr Floyd was \"actively resisting\" arrest as he was being placed in the patrol car. \n\"However, once he was placed in the prone position on the ground, he slowly ceased his resistance and at that point the officers - ex-officers I should say - they should have slowed down or stopped their force as well,\" he testified.\nNicole Mackenzie, a Minneapolis police officer who trains officers on medical first aid, agreed with Mr Chauvin's defence, saying that \"if the environment was determined to be not safe, you may not start [CPR] right away\".\nProsecutors and fellow officers have criticised Mr Chauvin and the other arresting officers for not providing Mr Floyd with medical assistance before ambulances arrived.\nAnalysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Minneapolis\nWhen prosecutors questioned Johnny Mercil, one of several officers who have been called to the stand, on Tuesday, they asked about the way that officers are taught to use force on suspects during an arrest, and the practice of \"neck restraints\".\nThe use of force, as it is known, lies at the heart of the prosecutors' strategy. They are trying to show that Mr Chauvin broke rules, and was a rogue officer.\nOne of their key witnesses, police chief Medaria Arradondo, testified on Monday that Mr Chauvin violated policies regarding the use of force.\nMr Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson has fought against that notion by emphasising that officers have to consider different factors while using force, such as potential threats from a nearby crowd.\nMr Nelson granted that, occasionally, an officer might \"look bad\" while restraining a suspect, but the officer could still be following the law, and the policies, on the use of force.\nMr Nelson's main argument - that Mr Floyd died largely because of alleged drug usage and a weak heart, not because of the way Mr Chauvin treated him - will be ramped up in the coming days, as medical evidence about his death is presented.\nBefore testimony began, lawyers argued over whether a man who was with Mr Floyd at Cup Foods on the day of his death should be forced to speak during the trial.\nMorries Hall and his lawyer appeared in court via video link to say that he would refuse to testify, in order to avoid possibly incriminating himself in Mr Floyd's death with details on illicit drug use.\nThe judge said he would push the decision until next week, and asked Mr Chauvin's defence lawyer to prepare a list of possible questions for Mr Hall."

Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "text": "Wales is set to become the first UK nation to have offered a first Covid-19 jab to over-50s and at-risk adults with long-term health conditions, the Welsh government has said.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said everyone in the top nine priority groups would be offered a first jab by Sunday.\nAll four UK governments had promised to reach the milestone by mid-April.\nHe paid tribute to front-line staff for helping to reach the target early.\n\"This is a truly remarkable effort and is down to the hard work of thousands of people who are working tirelessly on the NHS front line across Wales to make this happen,\" he said.\n\"I want to thank each and every one of them.\n\"And it is because of those efforts that I am able to say today that we will meet our next vaccine milestone early. \n\"By Sunday we will have offered a vaccine to everyone in the first nine priority groups - that's everyone over 50; all adults with an underlying health condition and a great many unpaid carers. \n\"By Sunday, a minimum of 75% of those in each priority group will have received a first vaccination.\"\nData on vaccinations will not be published by Public Health Wales on Easter Sunday.\nThe news comes as Mr Drakeford announced a series of lockdown easing measures, including plans for pubs, restaurants and hotels to reopen indoors in time for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May.\nEarlier on Thursday, he told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"The presence of the virus in Wales is the lowest in the United Kingdom, the rate of vaccination in Wales is the highest in the United Kingdom.\"\nThe announcement follows concern about a slow-down in vaccine supplies and people not attending appointments.\nOn Monday the Welsh Government's Chief Pharmacist said second Covid-19 vaccine doses will be prioritised during the expected supply slowdown of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab with Wales receiving 250,000 fewer Oxford-AstraZeneca jab doses than expected.\nBut Andrew Evans insisted the shipping delay not affect Wales hitting its targets. \nThe NHS has also been urging people to attend vaccine appointment after hundreds failed to show up for their jabs.\nIn the Swansea Bay area almost 500 people did not attend on Monday.\nAt a mass vaccination centre in Bangor in Gwynedd, almost 200 people failed to show up over a three-day period.\nIn February it was announced that Wales became the first UK nation to offer a first dose to the top 4 priority groups.\nThe next target is to offer at least a first jab to every adult by the end of July.\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats' health spokeswoman Jo Watkins said: \"This is good news and our thanks go out to everyone working on this programme and those who will be working over the Easter break.\n\"We must continue this rollout to ensure everyone in Wales is vaccinated as quickly and safely as possible.\"\nWelsh Conservative health spokeswoman Angela Burns said: \"The milestone that is expected to be met in Wales on Sunday has been made possible because of the strength of our United Kingdom, where the UK government made the swift decision to place orders for vaccines, and the superb work of NHS staff, volunteers and all others involved in the rollout of the programme in Wales.\""

      "tags": "International Monetary Fund (IMF),Global economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The International Monetary Fund is now forecasting a stronger economic recovery this year and next.\nThe IMF has upgraded both its UK and global forecasts compared with what it projected in January.\nBut the British economy is still predicted to return to its pre-pandemic level of activity only in late 2022. \nThe agency also warns that recoveries are diverging dangerously within and between countries. \nThe new UK forecast is for growth of 5.3% this year and 5.1% in 2022. Both figures are upgrades, though the latter is only marginally higher than the January forecast.\nThe recovery follows last year's pandemic driven contraction of 9.9% which was the deepest of any of the G7 major developed economies.\nBringing in the two predicted recovery years, the UK's performance over 2020 to 2022 would be ahead of one of the G7 countries, Italy. \nThe new global forecasts are growth of 6% and 4.4% this year and next. Both are upgrades, a fairly modest one for 2022.\nThat mainly reflects up-rating to the forecast for developed economies, especially the United States.   \nIn a blog on the forecasts, the IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath says a way out of the health and economic crisis is increasingly visible. Vaccinations, she writes, are likely to power recoveries in many countries in 2021.\nBut she is also concerned about how those recoveries are diverging. \nCountries with slower vaccine rollouts, more limited support from economic policy, and those more reliant on tourism are likely to do less well. \nThe first two of these are particular issues for developing countries. Many have less access to vaccines, and they also tend to find it more difficult to finance economic and health policy actions.\nAmong emerging and developing economies, China has already returned to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity. But many others in the group are not expected to do so until well into 2023.\nThe report says the cumulative losses in income per person over the period 2020 to 2022 are likely to be 20% for those countries, compared with a less severe but still large figure of 11% for the developed world. \nThe report also says that gains in poverty reduction have been reversed. It says people counted as extremely poor are likely to have increased by 95 million last year, with a rise of 80 million in the number who are undernourished.  \nThe IMF says the divergences are occurring not just between but also within countries. Income inequality is likely to increase as young people and those with relatively low levels of skills have been harder hit in both developed and developing countries.  \nWomen have already been affected as they account for a large share of employment in some sectors, such as tourism, where there is a lot of personal contact. \nThe pandemic has also had an impact on workers whose jobs are vulnerable to automation. That is a process that has been accelerated as a result of the health crisis. "

      "tags": "Alcoholism,Addiction,Hunter Biden,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Hunter Biden, the son of US President Joe Biden, has reflected on his public struggle with drug and alcohol addiction, saying his life \"is not a tabloid\".\n\"I don't belong to an administration, I belong to a family,\" he told the BBC.\nHe took responsibility for \"creating a story... that anyone conscious would know would be a tabloid sensation\".\nHe also addressed the scrutiny he and his father faced over his work with Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\nMr Biden was a director on the board of Burisma while Joe Biden was US vice-president and the Obama administration's point man on US-Ukrainian relations. \nSpeaking to US broadcaster CBS, he also said he was confident that he would be cleared of any wrongdoing over his business affairs by an ongoing US Department of Justice investigation. \nThe business dealings in Ukraine made him a frequent target of Republican criticism during the 2020 election campaign, and were at the centre of former US President Donald Trump's first impeachment. \nThe impeachment inquiry focused on a conversation Mr Trump had with Ukraine's president in which he appeared to pressure him to open an inquiry into the Bidens. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. \nWhile defending his qualifications for the position at Burisma, Mr Biden said that, in retrospect, he had \"missed... the perception that I would create\".\n\"I know that it is hard to believe with 20/20 hindsight how I could possibly have missed that,\" the 51-year-old told the BBC in an interview.\nHe added that Burisma saw his name \"as gold\" and that it played a large part in his appointment to the board. \nWhile no criminal activity by the Bidens has been proven, a senior US state department official raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest as far back as 2015. \nAn investigation by US Republican lawmakers last year found that Hunter Biden's work for the Ukrainian firm was \"problematic\" but concluded there was not evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. The report also claimed that Biden relatives \"cashed in on Joe Biden's vice presidency\". \nThe report was slammed by Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney, one of Mr Trump's most vocal critics in Congress, who described it as a \"political exercise\". \nMr Biden acknowledged that his father's name had \"opened doors that wouldn't be opened up to other people\". But he said this had been \"both a privilege and a burden\". \nAsked by CBS about the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into his financial dealings, the president's son said: \"I can say this, I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing.\" \nUS media quote sources saying the investigation relates to business dealings with foreign countries including China.\nSpeaking to the BBC ahead of the release of his new memoir Beautiful Things, Mr Biden said he wanted to write about \"the love of a family and how it saved me\".\n\"And, you know, we're going through two pandemics right now... there's the pandemic of coronavirus, and there's a pandemic of addiction too,\" he said.\nMr Biden's mother and sister died in a car accident in 1972 that he and his brother survived. In the interview, he talked about the links between the trauma he has suffered and his drug and alcohol addiction. \n\"There's something at the centre of each addict that's missing, that they feel that they need to fill... Nothing can possibly fill it. And so you numb yourself,\" he said.\nAfter his brother Beau died of cancer in 2015, he said he \"descended into a really dark, dark place\".\n\"My brother had just died, I'd separated with my wife, I was in an apartment by myself, and I was basically drinking myself to death. It was awful. I mean, grief does funny things. And combine that with addiction and it is a really hard thing to overcome,\" he said.\nHe added that while his struggle with addiction made him a target for tabloid stories and political attacks, it was also something that people across the country could relate to.\n\"I think what people see in the Biden family is their family. I think that they see all of the tragedy in loss, but they see all the love and sincerity. And I think that they see that we're not much different than any other family out there,\" he said. \nIn anticipation of Mr Trump raising his addiction in the first election debate, Mr Biden said both he and his father \"intuitively knew what to say\".\n\"I said 'Dad, you know, this is our story. And it's a story of love. It's a story of hope. It's a story that so many people are going through right now. Just talk to them and know that your honesty and my honesty about where we are is what I think will resonate with the American people.'\n\"It wasn't a political calculation, it was from the heart.\"\nLooking towards his future, Mr Biden said addiction \"never leaves\" but that many addicts had \"gone on to do incredibly brilliant, great, amazing things\".\n\"It's about time we started looking at addiction as a mental health issue, rather than an ethical or moral issue,\" he said.\nAsked about the possibility of his father running for re-election at the age of 82, he said: \"My dad is younger than me in his physical and mental capacity... I don't know anyone that has more energy.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nCriticism is growing over plans for Covid passports in England. Government documents say certificates proving whether someone has had a vaccine, has tested negative or has immunity are likely to become \"a feature of our lives\" and their use will be trialled at events such as the FA Cup final. The UK government says it's working with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to seek a \"consistent approach\". But some MPs argue they could lead to a \"two-tier Britain.\"\nStatutory Sick Pay increases by 50p a week to \u00a396.35 on Tuesday, but unions are calling the rise \"miserly\", with Trades Union Congress general secretary Frances O'Grady saying: \"No-one should be plunged into hardship if they need to self-isolate.\" The government says there's a \"comprehensive package\" in place to support those who need to do so.\nLeading travel industry figures have reacted with dismay to Boris Johnson's latest comments on the lockdown roadmap, saying they need more clarity. The prime minister said he was \"hopeful\" that foreign travel could begin again on 17 May but urged people to wait for advisers to report back next Monday. Business Travel Association chief executive Clive Wratten says a move to open borders has \"once again been kicked down the road\".\nThere was a net loss of nearly 10,000 shops to the UK High Street last year, as the pandemic exacerbated difficulties for bricks-and-mortar retail. BBC Radio 5 live has been hearing from workers affected by those closures, like Heather Rowlinson, 54, from Newcastle. After 34 years at TopShop, she is still unemployed and has been left frustrated by recruitment agencies who promise jobs but don't deliver. \"They never answer your calls,\" she says.\nThe family of Captain Sir Tom Moore is encouraging people to take on their own \"100\" challenge on what would have been his 101st birthday weekend, between 30 April and 3 May. The Army veteran raised almost \u00a333m for NHS charities, as the pandemic swept the country, by walking 100 laps of his Bedfordshire garden before he turned 100. He died on 2 February after contracting coronavirus. Now his relatives want people to create their own challenge around the number 100 to raise money for the foundation set up in his name, or other charities.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWant to know if your boss can make you head to the office?

      "tags": "Bradford,Leeds Bradford International Airport,Leeds,Yeadon",
      "text": "A \u00a3150m proposal to redevelop Leeds Bradford Airport has been delayed to allow Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick more time to consider it.\nPlans to demolish existing buildings and build a new terminal were approved by Leeds City Council in February.\nBut that decision was referred to the government after objectors said it would contribute to climate change.\nThe government said it needed time to allow for \"proper consideration\" of requests for the plan to be called in.\nA date for a final decision has not been set, but the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has put in place an order which prevents Leeds City Council from granting planning permission without special authorisation.\nLeeds Bradford Airport said the new terminal was not an expansion as it could already expand passenger numbers with its existing facilities.\nIt added that the replacement building would be a more efficient and sustainable development helping it to achieve its carbon net-zero goals by 2023.\nA spokesman for Leeds Bradford Airport said: \"We acknowledge the deadline extension and hope the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government will uphold Leeds City Council's approval for our replacement terminal, which will deliver thousands of new jobs and support the region's economy.\"\nThe airport estimates the project will support 12,650 permanent jobs across the Leeds City Region, as well as creating 850 construction-related jobs.\nThe site handles about four million passengers annually and has already been granted permission to increase that to seven million over a 10-year-period.\nIn July 2020, a group of climate scientists warned the expanded airport's greenhouse gas emissions would be higher than those allowed for the whole of Leeds in 10 years' time.\nEnvironmental campaigners Greenpeace said the delay over a final decision on the redevelopment plans was a sign the government was \"starting to clock the catastrophic impacts of this proposed expansion\".\nRebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK's head of politics, said: \"But we're just months away from hosting critical global climate talks, and this climate-wrecking mega project is clearly incompatible with our plans to cut emissions, so why only delay the decision and not just call it in now?\"\nMeanwhile, in a tweet, the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport, said: \"No airport anywhere should expand. Delaying this decision is good news.\"\nMr Jenrick's decision to - in effect - kick this local issue into the long grass has national significance because seven other airports as well as Leeds Bradford also want to expand their operations. They'll all be less optimistic now.\nTo be clear, the Leeds plan isn't dead. But it doesn't bode well for the airport that Mr Jenrick says he needs more time to decide whether to kill it or not.\nHis note to the airport didn't spell out his reasoning, but it's reasonable to assume Mr Jenrick wanted to avoid another bruising like the one he suffered recently after tacitly approving a plan for a coal mine in Cumbria. \nHe was forced into a U-turn on that issue.\nSo when will we get a final ruling? The government won't say, but my guess is we'll have to wait for the government's transport decarbonisation strategy due in the coming months that will show how all emissions from transport can be reduced.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "tags": "Minneapolis,George Floyd death,United States",
      "text": "The police chief of Minneapolis has testified that ex-officer Derek Chauvin violated the agency's policy on force during the arrest of George Floyd.\nChief Medaria Arradondo said the way Mr Chauvin restrained Mr Floyd was not in line with training and \"certainly not part of our ethics and our values\".\nThe chief fired Mr Chauvin and the three other officers involved days after Mr Floyd's death last May.\nMr Chauvin, who is on trial for murder, has denied the charges against him.\nFootage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on African-American Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes last year sparked global protests against racism.\nMonday marks the sixth day in Mr Chauvin's trial, which is expected to last for at least one month. \nAs police officers are rarely convicted or charged at all for deaths that occur in custody, the verdict in this trial is being seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future.\nProsecutors, who are seeking to prove that Mr Chauvin's actions violated his training, focused their questions on departmental guidelines and strategies taught to help officers de-escalate situations.\nMr Arradondo told the court Mr Floyd should not have been restrained in the manner used by the officers after he stopped resisting, \"and certainly [not] once he was in distress\".\nHe said the type of restraint Mr Chauvin, 45, was using came \"once there was no longer any resistance and clearly after Mr Floyd was no longer responsive - and even motionless\".\n\"That is, in no way, shape or form, by policy, is not part of our training, and is certainly not part of our ethics and our values.\"\nMr Arradondo also noted it would be rare for officers to take into custody a suspect accused of passing a counterfeit bill, as Mr Floyd was.\nThe police chief said \"talking your way out of a situation\" was always better than using force, adding that officers may seek the \"community's help\" when available.  \nDefence lawyer Eric Nelson questioned Mr Arradondo about officers brandishing a weapon to defuse a situation, as Mr Chauvin did by holding up pepper spray to onlookers. \n\"Sometimes an officer has to take out his gun, and say, 'hey, if you don't listen to me, I'm going use force,'\" Mr Nelson said.\nThe chief agreed it was in line with policy to sometimes gesture in such a way to get a suspect to back down.\nWhen Mr Nelson showed different angles of footage of the arrest, Mr Arradondo also noted that right before the paramedics arrived, it appeared that Mr Chauvin had shifted his knee onto Mr Floyd's shoulder blade.\nMr Arradondo joined the force in 1989. He became the city's first African-American police chief in 2017.\nLast June, Mr Arradondo said that Mr Floyd's \"tragic death was not due to a lack of training - the training was there\".  He called Mr Floyd's death \"murder\", and said Mr Chauvin \"knew that Floyd was nonresponsive\" during the last few minutes of his life. \nThis is not the first time that Mr Arradondo has testified against a former officer. As assistant chief, he testified against patrolman Mohamed Noor for the killing of Australian woman Justine Damond in 2017. \nEarlier in his career, he successfully sued the Minneapolis police department along with four other officers, accusing the force of tolerating discriminatory practices.\nAnalysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Minneapolis\nPolice officers are allowed to use force; it is part of their job. When a suspect ends up dead, officers are rarely convicted. \nBetween 2005 and 2014, out of thousands of police shootings, only about 40 officers were convicted of murder or manslaughter, according to Bowling Green State University's Philip Stinson.\nOn Monday, prosecutors tried to beat the odds. The appearance of a key witness, Chief Arradondo, was itself a rarity: he is one of the few police chiefs to speak out against a former officer. \nEven with Mr Arradondo's testimony, though, the odds are against the prosecutors. \nJurors understand that police use force routinely, and it is hard to convince them that an officer has crossed a line.\nOn Monday, the court also heard from Dr Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld, who pronounced Mr Floyd dead 30 minutes after he arrived at the Hennepin County Medical Center.\nDr Lagenfeld said he believed that Mr Floyd's death was caused from a lack of oxygen, called asphyxia. \nProsecutors have suggested that asphyxiation was the cause of Mr Floyd's death - contrasting with the ruling of the medical examiner who said Mr Floyd died of \"cardiopulmonary arrest\", which means a person's heart and lungs have stopped. \nMr Chauvin's defence team has contended that alleged drug use and an underlying heart condition contributed to Mr Floyd's death. \nThe physician's appearance in court follows testimony from two paramedics who said that Mr Floyd had no pulse and did not appear to be breathing when they arrived at the scene.

      "text": "The collapsed fashion chain Peacocks has been bought out of administration, a move that includes transferring 2,000 jobs and 200 shops. \nThe number means the other half of the 400 trading at the time of the chain's collapse last November will not reopen as Peacocks.\nIt was previously owned by Edinburgh Woollen Mills (EWM).\nThe buyers are an international consortium, led by Peacocks' former chief operating officer, Steve Simpson.\nHe hopes to reopen the stores once non-essential retailers are allowed out of lockdown.\nEWM Group is a private investment group controlled by the Day family, which is owed money by Peacocks and is supporting the consortium. \nA statement from the administrators, FRP, said the collapse of the chain was due to \"the devastating effects of the Covid-19 lockdown\" on the business. \nThe Peacocks' management team hope that, with the support of their partners, suppliers and landlords, they will be able to reopen up to 200 stores. \nThe statement added the company hoped all 1,850 store staff, who are currently on furlough, will be able to return to work once stores reopen, along with more than 150 in head office and support. \nA similar deal was set in place with EWM and Bonmarche brands, while another of EWM's brands, Jaeger, was sold to Marks & Spencer, which intends to run it as an online-only business.\nPeacocks had 400 stores going into the pandemic a year ago and announced a series of job losses and store closures as it struggled to manage under the various restrictions.\nAnalyst Susannah Streeter at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Peacocks will be a much leaner beast emerging from the crisis, with its footprint of around 400 stores halved under the deal. \n\"Shedding the excess weight of underperforming outlets will help it be more nimble but getting the online offering into better shape will be even more crucial, given its rivals are seen as racing ahead.\"\nShe added that there were parallels with Sir Philip Green's Arcadia chain, whose star outlet was Top Shop: \"Like Arcadia Group, Peacocks former owner, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, struggled with the accelerated shift to digital brought on by the pandemic. It was another sprawling retail empire which collapsed, with former rivals picking over the spoils.\""

      "text": "Claims all over-50s and at-risk adults with underlying health conditions have been offered a Covid vaccine in Wales have been disputed.\nSome people in those groups have said they are still waiting to be contacted to have their jab.\nIt comes after the Welsh government said on Monday it had already met the mid-April milestone target set for all UK governments.\nOn Tuesday, it said \"plans are in place to make sure no-one is left behind\".\nPublic Health Wales (PHW) has said people should contact their health board.\nGarry Edwards, 51, from Anglesey, is registered as asthmatic and said he was still waiting for his invitation.\nHe said he was previously told by his surgery only second jabs were being given, so he called Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board which confirmed he was on the list and would be called.\n\"I know a lot of people who have had, and a lot of people younger than me who have had it - I know people in their 40s who have had it,\" Mr Edwards said on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers.\n\"It's going to be done when it's done but when you are told you are going to be invited to have it... and it hasn't happened, then the statistics are wrong somewhere.\"\nOther listeners to the programme messaged to say they were also still waiting for a first vaccine. \nBeverley Williams, 57, from Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she was still waiting to hear about her vaccine through Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board.\n\"I've had Covid before so I'm a bit stressed,\" she said.\n\"I rang them this morning and they are going to send me another letter and if I don't hear anything by next week, I've got to ring them again.\n\"My husband's [vaccine] was late and he only found out he missed his because they rang him to find out why he hadn't turned up.\"\nShe added he was then booked in for the jab the same day as the call.\nGraham Thomas said it was \"really annoying\" his 84-year-old mother Marion Price was still waiting for her vaccine in Caerphilly.\n\"She has asthma and [lung disease] COPD. She's disabled and can't get out of the house.\"\nHe said she had received an offer to come to the surgery, but it was known she was housebound: \"She has to have a home visit. She's got a letter saying she is on the priority list but she hasn't had a vaccine.\"\nSonja Milano's mother Manuela Levi moved to Bangor, Gwynedd, last summer from Italy.\nThe 50-year-old is registered with a GP but has been told to wait two more weeks for news of a vaccine appointment.\nMs Milano said: \"I phoned her GP surgery today and was told if nothing has happened by then, to call again.\n\"Everybody else around us over 50 has been offered one. I just want to make sure she will get a call.\"\nDr Giri Shankar, incident director for the Covid-19 response at PHW, said vaccinations were delivered by health boards.\n\"I can't think of any systematic issue that would have led to several people having not received their vaccinations,\" he said.\n\"There may be isolated cases where that has happened, which obviously needs to be looked into, and the health boards are best placed to do that.\n\"Without looking into the specific details of each of those cases, it's difficult to say what might have happened, but I think the main thing to say is it's never too late. \n\"If you feel you haven't been given an appointment, you should immediately make contact with the health board.\"\nIn a statement, the Welsh government said: \"Any person aged 50 or over will have had at least their first vaccination or been sent an appointment, and plans are in in place to make sure no-one is left behind. \n\"If health boards have been unable to contact someone on the list, or if an appointment has been missed, systems are in place to go back and check and re-arrange a new appointment for anyone who wants to be vaccinated.\"\nInformation is available on the Welsh government website for people who think they should have had an appointment but have not received one.\nDr Mair Hopkin, joint chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners Wales, said she did not think there was \"potentially a problem\" with delivering the vaccine. \nShe said she had heard cases of people not being offered the vaccine were \"few and far between\".\n\"There may be very many reasons why people have been left off a list,\" Dr Hopkin said, citing people moving house and records not being updated.\nDr Hopkin expressed concern younger people could be harder to reach for vaccination since they could be in education or at work and not \"sitting there waiting for that phone call\".\nShe said it was important the young were vaccinated even if they thought they were not at risk. \n\"You have to remember that you are putting everyone one else at risk,\" she said. \nOn Monday, PHW said 1,493,192 people had received a first dose of the vaccine and 469,251 people were fully vaccinated, having had both jabs.\nThe Welsh government also said on Monday it had achieved its \"second milestone\" of offering a vaccine to everyone over the age of 50 and those with underlying health issues.\nBut Hywel Dda University Health Board, which covers Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, said it was on track to meet the UK's mid-April target by 18 April.\nChief executive Steve Moore encouraged people to get in touch to secure their first vaccine dose if they have not yet had an appointment.\nHe added: \"We have seen an overwhelming response from our wonderful communities across the three counties who have turned up in storms, snow, rain and sunshine to receive their vaccine.\"\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board's primary and community care boss, Dr Chris Stockport, said the \"vast majority\" of appointments for unvaccinated people in groups five to nine were now booked. \nInvitation letters, he said, were \"sent in the post last week\". \n\"Most of these letters have been delivered, but a small number may arrive in the coming days, because of bank holiday postal arrangements,\" Dr Stockport said.\nA \"significant number\" of invitations had also been sent to people in their 40s, he said. \n\"We are determined to not leave anybody behind,\" he said.\nThe uptake of first doses of those in their early 50s across Wales on average was up to 67.2%, while for those in their late 50s, the figure stands at more than 84%.\nThe top four priority groups in Wales, which is made up of all over-70s, including care home residents, were offered a jab by mid-February."

      "tags": "North Korea,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "North Korea has announced it will not take part in the Tokyo Olympics this year, saying the decision is to protect its athletes from Covid-19. \nThe decision puts an end to South Korea's hopes of using the Games to engage with the North amid stalled cross-border talks.\nIn 2018, both sides entered a joint team at the Winter Olympics which led to a series of historic summits.\nPyongyang says it has no cases of the virus but experts say this is unlikely.\nThe country's health system is thought to be completely inadequate for dealing with the Covid pandemic, the BBC's Tokyo Correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports.\nThe announcement makes North Korea the first major country to skip the delayed 2020 Games because of the pandemic. The event is due to begin on 23 July. \nThis will be the first time North Korea has missed a Summer Olympics since 1988, when it boycotted the Seoul Games during the Cold War. \nPyongyang's decision was made at an Olympic committee meeting on 25 March, according to a report by the state-run site Sports in the DPRK.\nHowever, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it had not \"received an official application\" from North Korea to step back from the Games. \nIt added that despite repeated requests, the country's National Olympic Committee had failed to \"hold a telephone conference during which the Covid-19 situation in North Korea should also have been discussed\". \nNorth Korea has taken stringent measures against the virus since it broke out last year. \nIt shut its borders in late January and later quarantined hundreds of foreigners in its capital. \nSince early last year, trains and wagons have been forbidden to enter or leave North Korea, with most international passenger flights stopped as well.\nThere were hopes from South Korea's President Moon Jae-in that the Games could be a catalyst for progress between both Koreas. \nThat had been the case in 2018, when North Korea sent 22 athletes to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, along with government officials, journalists and a 230-member cheering group. \nAmong the contingent was North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's sister, Kim Yo-jong - a move which helped it initiate diplomacy with South Korea and the US. \nThe talks that followed led to a series of historic, high-profile meetings between the North Korean leader and former US President Donald Trump.\nThere were hopes for improved relations after the meetings, but nothing materialised and the atmosphere has since deteriorated.\nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war because no peace treaty was signed when the Korean War ended in 1953. \nJapan and North Korea also have their own enduring tensions, rooted in Japan's 35-year colonisation of Korea, Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear and missile programmes, and the North's past abduction of Japanese citizens.  \nMeanwhile, in Japan, an Olympic preparatory event was cancelled after Covid infections broke out at a training camp for the Japanese water polo team - with seven people testing positive for the virus.\nIt follows the announcement that the Osaka leg of the Olympic torch relay will be cancelled after infections in the city hit record highs. \nThere have been growing concerns in Japan that more infectious strains of the virus could be driving a potential fourth Covid wave in the country. \nWatch how a group of Russian diplomats and their families made an unusual exit out of North Korea on a hand-pushed rail trolley, due to strict Covid measures.

      "tags": "Arkansas,Transgender people,United States",
      "text": "Arkansas has become the first US state to outlaw gender confirming treatments and surgery for transgender people under the age of 18. \nThe bill also in effect bans doctors from providing puberty blockers, or from referring them to other providers for the treatment.\nThe Republican state governor had vetoed the bill, calling it a \"vast government overreach\".\nBut the state's Republican-controlled House and Senate overruled him.\nThe bill has faced much opposition from groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics, which said the law would block trans youth from important medical care and increase their already high risk of suicide.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said it was preparing litigation, stating that the bill \"will drive families, doctors and businesses out of the state and send a terrible and heart-breaking message to the transgender young people who are watching in fear\".\n\"This is a sad day for Arkansas, but this fight is not over - and we're in it for the long haul,\" Holly Dickson, executive director of ACLU in Arkansas, said in a statement.\nBy Shrai Popat, BBC News, Washington DC\nOver the past few weeks Arkansas has played a game of legislative ping-pong, with gender-affirming care hanging in the balance. Now, the state has become the first to prohibit physicians from providing gender-affirming healthcare to trans youth. Medical experts have said this will likely have disastrous consequences for trans youth, particularly when it comes to mental health.\nDr Jack Turban, a fellow in child and adolescent psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine, told the BBC that access to gender-affirming care for trans youth is \"consistently linked to better mental health outcomes\".\nHe added that much of the political discourse around this care has been shrouded in unscientific misinformation that implies  \"transgender youth are 'confused' or invalid.\"\nThe issue goes beyond Arkansas' borders. Trans children in states like Alabama and Tennessee await their lawmakers' decisions on similar legislation. According to Dr Morissa Ladinsky, an associate professor of paediatrics at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, \"the anticipation, uncertainty and fear\" of losing gender-affirming care is \"chipping away\" at trans youth's resilience.\nGovernor Asa Hutchinson had called the bill \"a product of the cultural war in America\". He argued it created \"new standards of legislative interference with physicians and parents as they deal with some of the most complex and sensitive matters involving young people\".\nThe override of Governor Hutchinson's veto needed only a simple majority, but passed easily in both chambers, with the House voting 72-25 in favour and the Senate 25-8.\nAt least 16 other states are considering similar legislation.\nSupporters of the bill, who are almost all Republican, say they want to protect children from life-changing procedures they will later regret. They also point to side-effects of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and cite occasional cases where transgender people reverse their decision to transition.\nBut experts say each step is undertaken with the consultation of doctors, therapists and social workers, often over extended periods of time."

      "text": "Great Britain's electricity system was the greenest it had ever been at lunchtime on Easter Bank Holiday Monday, its operator has said.\nSunny and windy weather, coupled with low demand for power, led to a surge in renewable sources of energy, National Grid Electricity System Operator said.\nIt meant low-carbon energy sources made up almost 80% of Britain's power.\nThere was no coal generation on the grid and just 10% of power was from gas plants, the operator added.\nThe National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) said levels of carbon pollution for each unit of electricity consumed dropped to just 39 grams of carbon dioxide - the lowest ever recorded for the grid - at 13:00 BST on Monday.\nIt said wind power made up 39% of the energy mix, with solar at 21% and nuclear accounting for 16%.\nThe burning of biomass accounted for around 4%. There is debate over the environmental costs of burning biomass, like wood, and the National Grid ESO categorises it separately from low-carbon sources and fossil fuels.\nBy comparison, on Tuesday, 24.8% of Britain's energy came from fossil fuels, most of which was gas (combined cycle), while 45.2% was renewable energy sources. \nThose fossil fuel figures have been dropping all year. In January, gas accounted for more than 43% of the energy mix, with coal at almost 5%, and then last month just 37% of Britain's electricity was generated from gas. \nThe previous record for Great Britain's greenest day was set during lockdown last year, on 24 May.\nWhen Britain went into lockdown, electricity demand plummeted and the National Grid responded by taking power plants off the network and the four remaining coal-fired plants were among the first to be shut down.\nThe new record may be a cause for celebration as the UK strives for a near zero-carbon society - but it's far from a surprise.\nTake the ingredients of a sunny, windy day on a bank holiday when factories are not working - coupled with a lockdown, and you're sure to cook up an impressive percentage of wind power. \nBut remember, as investment in renewables increases, these records will be happening regularly.\nThe real test for renewables comes when we face a cold, still, overcast February day when demand for heat and light soars and wind power is non-existent.\nThat will need much more energy storage than is currently available.\nThe government aims to have almost all electricity produced from low carbon sources by 2030 - and despite this week's impressive results, there's still a very long way to go. \nLast year as a whole saw many records broken for Britain's electricity mix, with an almost 68-day coal-free run between 10 April and 16 June, and solar providing more than a third of electricity supplies on several occasions during May. \nChristmas 2020 was also the first ever coal-free Christmas Day. \nMeanwhile, the highest ever amount of electricity generated by wind was on 13 February this year.\nFintan Slye, director at National Grid ESO, said: \"This latest record is another example of how the grid continues to transform at an astonishing rate as we move away from fossil fuel generation and harness the growth of renewable power sources.\n\"It's an exciting time, and the progress we're seeing with these records underlines the significant strides we're taking towards our ambition of being able to operate the system carbon free by 2025.\"\nThe record comes ahead of COP26, a UN international climate change summit, due to be held in Glasgow this November.\nKate Blagojevic, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, praised the progress on taking fossil fuels out of the energy mix, but added that it was \"no time for the UK government to rest on its laurels\".\n\"Carbon emissions from our homes, farms and roads remain stubbornly high, and only a major government intervention can unblock the impasse,\" she said.\n\"As the Glasgow climate summit looms closer, ministers really need to up their game on tackling UK carbon emissions right across the board.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "Unusual blood clots in the brain have been detected in a handful of people after they were injected with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThese \"cerebral venous sinus thromboses\" or CVSTs have led some countries - including Germany, France and Canada - to restrict who can be given the jab. The World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks.\nScientists and medicines safety regulators around the world are trying to figure out if the vaccine is genuinely causing these strokes, how big any risk might be and what that might mean for vaccination programmes. \nAt the moment, we do not know. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA), which has been reviewing the safety data, says it is \"not proven, but is possible\".\nThe organisation has to figure out whether the reported clots are a side-effect or a coincidence that would have happened naturally. This is incredibly hard when dealing with rare events. If, on the other hand, one in every 10,000 people was having serious blood clots then the answer would be obvious.\nI have spoken to respected scientists some of whom are sceptical, others increasingly convinced. \nSome point to the highly unusual nature of the clots as a sign something could be going on. They are often appearing at the same time as low levels of blood platelets, which are one of the main components of a clot, and antibodies linked to other clotting disorders appearing in the blood. \nOthers say there is not enough proof and the reported cases could plausibly be down to Covid, which itself is linked to abnormal clotting. \nIt remains entirely possible the risk is zero as vaccines are not proven to cause the brain clots. \nGermany's Paul Ehrlich Institute has reported 31 cerebral venous sinus thromboses and nine deaths out of 2.7 million people vaccinated there. \nThe most recent UK data reported 30 clots linked with low platelet counts and seven deaths out of 18 million people vaccinated. \nThe European Medicines Agency, which has assessed data from around the world, estimates there is around a one in 100,000 risk of a CVST in people under the age of 60 who have been given the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nThe organisation's head of safety monitoring, Dr Peter Arlett, said that was \"more than we would expect to see\". \nHowever, it is uncertain what the background rate of these blood clots in the brain truly is. Estimates vary from around two cases per million people every year to nearly 16 in every million in normal times and coronavirus itself may be causing them too. \nYou might expect to see the same numbers of CVSTs in different countries if they were genuinely being caused by the vaccine. Yet the UK has reported roughly the same number of cases despite giving the vaccine to nearly seven times as many people as Germany.\nOne argument is the type of people being vaccinated is different. \nThe UK has, largely, been working from the oldest age groups down, while Germany was one of the countries that initially refused to use the vaccine in the over 65s because of a lack of trial data. Instead nearly 90% of Germans given AstraZeneca are thought to be under 60.\nSide-effects in general tend to be more severe in younger people as they have a stronger immune response, which has been one speculated reason why the UK has had fewer cases. \nHowever, CVSTs are inherently more common in younger women and taking the pill increases the risk. So the natural risk levels - whether people are vaccinated or not - could have a role too. \nTeasing all this apart is challenging, but the EMA said it had found no specific risk factors such as age, gender or medical history. \nNothing in medicine in completely safe and even therapies that are highly toxic are used in the right circumstance. \nChemotherapy drugs can have brutal side effects, but are hugely valuable; and even over-the-counter painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen have severe side-effects, they are just incredibly rare. \nThe real decision is always whether the benefits outweigh the risks. \nThis is particularly challenging in a pandemic. Normally medicine would rely on the \"precautionary principle\" to prove adequate safety before giving a new medicine to large numbers of people. But in a pandemic, any delays in vaccinating people will also cost lives. \nBased on the Germany data alone, if you vaccinate a million people then you would expect 12 to have a blood clot and four of them to die. \nBut if a million 60-year-olds catch coronavirus then around 20,000 would die of Covid-19. If a million 40-year-olds catch coronavirus then around 1,000 die. It would be a few hundred people in their 30s.\nThe benefits of vaccination clearly increase with age and countries like Germany and Canada have allowed the AstraZeneca vaccine to be used in older age-groups. These decisions will also be driven by which alternative vaccines they have available and who still needs to be immunised. \nThe world is scrutinising the data intensely, but clarity will still take time. \nFollow James on Twitter"

It would record whether people had been vaccinated, recently tested negative, or had already had and recovered from Covid-19.\nThe European Union is also working on plans to introduce certificates, while in Israel a \"Green Pass\" is already available to anyone who has been fully vaccinated or has recovered from Covid-19, which they have to show to access facilities such as hotels, gyms or theatres.\nThe World Health Organization on Tuesday said it did not currently support requiring vaccination passports for travel, because of uncertainty over whether inoculation prevents transmission, and discrimination concerns. \nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that he had brought forward to 19 April the date by which all American adults will be eligible for a Covid vaccine. \n\"We have to ramp up a whole-of-government approach that rallies the whole country and puts us on a war footing to truly beat this virus,\" he said."

      "text": "It would be \"remiss\" of the government not to consider Covid certification as a way of fully reopening the economy, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi says.\nAmid criticism of the plans, Mr Zahawi said: \"It's only right that we look at all these options that are available to us to take our lives back.\"\nThe government said certificates showing vaccination, test or immunity status could \"provide reassurance\".\nBoris Johnson said they could help signal a person is not contagious.\nSpeaking on a visit to an AstraZeneca factory in Macclesfield, Cheshire, Mr Johnson said Covid certificates - also referred to as passports - would not be rolled out until well after indoor hospitality reopens from 17 May.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was open-minded about using certificates to allow certain activities to resume, and called for an open debate. \nBut many MPs have criticised the plans, with senior Tory backbencher Mark Harper warning it could lead to a \"two-tier\" Britain, demanding a vote on the issue.\nMr Zahawi was keen to point out that the concept of using Covid certificates to allow international travel was distinct from a review of using them within the UK.\n\"But I think it would be remiss and irresponsible for us to not look at all these things,\" he told BBC Breakfast, adding that any certificate would show test results because testing is available to all, unlike vaccines.\nBut he stressed they would not be needed for the reopening of outdoor hospitality or non-essential retail on 12 April or indoor hospitality from 17 May.\nMr Zahawi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the use of certificates domestically \"does raise a number of ethical issues\".\nGovernment scientific advisers have warned indoor mixing later in the year would be \"highly likely\" to lead to a resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths.\nMr Zahawi said the prediction - by SPI-M, a group that feeds into the government's scientific advisory group, Sage - was why England's roadmap out of lockdown had five-week intervals.\nThe UK government said it was working with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to seek a \"consistent approach\".\nMr Johnson has the power to set public health regulations for England, but it is a devolved power in the other UK nations.\nA government review is currently being carried out to see how certificates that show testing status could work in England - and they are going to be trialled at upcoming events including the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium.\nA series of trials - including comedy nights and a large nightclub event - are also planned in Liverpool to see whether requiring participants to have a negative test can allow big indoor gatherings to be held more safely.\nNo decision has yet been made on whether Covid status certificates will be introduced, but the government has now published an update on its review.\nIt said they could play a role in allowing people to return to theatres, nightclubs and mass events like festivals, and could allow social distancing to be relaxed in hospitality venues.\n\"Even without government intervention, Covid status certification is likely to become a feature of our lives until the threat from the pandemic recedes,\" it added.\nOn the face of it, the UK seems to be in a very strong position. The vaccine rollout is going very well and infection levels, hospitalisations and deaths are all low.\nAnd yet modelling done for the government suggests once all restrictions are lifted the country could be heading for a devastating resurgence in the virus similar to that seen in January.\nHow can this be? First of all, the models are not a prediction. They are an example of what could happen under certain assumptions, including how many do not take up the offer of the vaccines, how much vaccines stop infections and serious illness and how much people mix.\nThe idea of returning to January levels of deaths is at the pessimistic end of those models - and comes with huge caveats. A more optimistic scenario is that deaths are no higher than a bad flu season.\nThe problem the decision makers face is that there are so many unknowns and it is very easy to find yourself playing catching up. Working out what is a proportionate response is the key.\nA recent opinion poll of more than 8,000 UK adults suggested there was strong public support for the use of \"vaccine passports\" in certain situations. \nMore than three-quarters (78%) of those surveyed by Ipsos Mori supported their use for international travel and care home visits, while 74% supported them for visiting relatives in hospital, and 68% to attend the theatre.\nBut opposition to Covid passports being used within the UK has mounted - with a group of more than 70 cross-party MPs criticising the plan last week.\nThey said demanding medical proof in order to take part in local community life, for example going to venues like pubs, is discriminatory and divisive.\nMark Harper, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs, which is against lockdown restrictions, said it was not acceptable for the end of social distancing to depend on certificates.\nHe said it was \"crucial\" that MPs are allowed to vote on the issue. \n\"Trying to introduce these domestic vaccine passports by the back door by linking them to removing social distancing rules just won't be acceptable either,\" he said.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth did not rule out voting for the policy in Parliament, but said he would not support certificates for activities like clothes shopping.\nThe government has said certificates to permit access to essential public services, public transport and essential shops should \"never be required, in order to ensure access for all\".\nMr Zahawi said MPs would \"absolutely\" be offered a vote on Covid certification.\nBehavioural scientist Prof Stephen Reicher, who advises the government as part of SPI-B, which feeds into Sage, criticised ministers for \"very mixed\" messaging that could affect the take-up of jabs.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: \"I think even to talk about vaccine passports, even to talk about the possibility that participating in everyday social life, you will have to get vaccinated is counterproductive at this stage where we'd need to convert and convince those who have doubts.\"\nThe government's certificate review is not expected to be finalised until the summer. \nIt comes as several countries implement their own passport schemes, including Israel.\nMeanwhile, Mr Zahawi confirmed a third vaccine, made by Moderna, would be deployed in the UK \"around the third week of April\". \nMore than 5.4 million people in the UK have been fully vaccinated, with a total of more than 31.6 million first doses given.\nAnother 2,379 cases were reported on Tuesday alongside a further 20 deaths within 28 days of testing positive.\nEngland's next step of lockdown easing is to go ahead as planned on 12 April."

It has recently opened up part of its premises as a vaccination centre.\nThe church's senior pastor, Agu Irukwu, has previously been criticised after speaking out against same-sex marriage and equality laws.\nFollowing Sir Keir's visit, the LGBT+ Labour group called it \"unacceptable\" and said they had contacted Sir Keir to ask for an apology. It said the church was known for its \"broadly anti-LGBT+ views\".\nHowever the group said it believed the explanation that it was a \"genuine mistake\" where \"research had mistakenly not been carried out in advance of the visit\".\nAfter Sir Keir apologised, the group tweeted their thanks and added: \"We are pleased that you have recognised and apologised for this mistake. We look forward to working with you to end conversion therapy and achieve equality for LGBT+ people.\"\nSir Keir is not the only public figure to have visited the church. Boris Johnson and the Prince of Wales have both been to the pop-up vaccination centre there in recent weeks without attracting widespread comment - although Mr Johnson did face criticism when he visited as mayor in 2009.\nIn 2017, Theresa May was criticised for visiting the church and meeting with the pastor.

      "text": "Secondary schools in Scotland will reopen full time as planned after the Easter holidays, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.\nPupils will no longer have to follow strict two metre physical distancing rules when they return, and must wear face coverings throughout the school.\nMs Sturgeon said \"virtually all\" secondary pupils would be back in the classroom after the holidays.\nThe only exception is for those pupils in the shielding category.\n\"We are continuing to recommend that they stay at home until 26 April, and that's in line with the advice already received from the chief medical officer,\" said Ms Sturgeon.\nPrimary schools had already resumed full-time teaching before the holidays, but a part-time blended learning system had been used in secondary schools.\nThe first minister said the return to in-person, full-time learning would be \"a huge relief\" to many children and parents.\nShe acknowledged that there would be some \"concern and anxiety\" about the move, but said safety would be \"paramount\"\n\"The return to school will involve the removal, where necessary, of strict two metre distancing between pupils, but we are asking schools to consider how they strengthen their mitigations,\" she said.\nSecondary pupils will have to wear face coverings at all times, and all age groups will be able to access twice-weekly lateral flow testing.\nDuring the coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon was asked about the assessment system for senior pupils following concerns that some would be sitting \"exams by another name\" in coming weeks.\nShe said: \"There is no requirement to replicate a full exam or prelim this year. Teacher judgement is at the centre of this.\"\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats' Alex Cole-Hamilton said he had \"some real concerns\" that the assessments were exams by another name.\nHe said this would put \"tremendous pressure\" on teachers and pupils, adding: \"We have to make sure young people have every support they need.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the full-time return of pupils would bring \"a sense of relief\" for parents.\nBut he added: \"Now we have a ramping up of the vaccine supply, we should be looking at rolling out those vaccines for teachers to give them a sense of confidence, and to pupils and parents as well.\"\nLarry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teachers' union, said there needed to be \"great caution\" over the return of pupils to school.\n\"It will undoubtedly lead to an increase in school Covid outbreaks, which will require to be dealt with quickly, particularly for senior pupils who will be in the final stages of their qualification work,\" he said.\n\"If we had made more progress on the EIS demands of ventilation, vaccination and facemasks, we would be in a stronger position. Improving such mitigations is still possible.\"\nThe first minister also told the briefing that the first batch of the newly-approved Moderna vaccine had arrived in Scotland.\nScotland is due to receive more than one million of the 17 million doses ordered by the UK.\n\"The fact that we now have three vaccines in use is clearly very welcome and it does give us greater security of supply which is welcome,\" she said.\nResponding to questions about the prospect of introducing vaccine passports for those who have had their jab, Ms Sturgeon said it was important \"not to close our minds\" to the idea.\nShe said that if the public are to have confidence in any future certification process, time must be taken to \"air all of the challenges\".\n\"We all want to get back to normal, so anything that can play a part in getting us back to normal is something we should think about very carefully,\" she said.\n\"But nor should we gloss over the practical and ethical issues.\"\nThe UK government has said the introduction of certificates which could show vaccination, test or immunity status is one option currently being considered.\nAlison Johnstone, from the Scottish Green Party, said she had not been convinced that widespread use of vaccination passports would be a good thing.\n\"There may be some cases where this is appropriate, but I would be extremely concerned about the introduction of a vaccine passport at a domestic level,\" she said.\nA total of 2,577,816 people in Scotland have now received their first dose and 463,780 have received their second dose.\nThere were 259 positive cases of Covid reported in the last 24 hours, a positivity rate of 2%. No further deaths were recorded.\nMs Sturgeon said routine testing will be expanded to enable everyone to take a lateral flow test twice a week. A similar move was announced in England on Monday.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the figures indicated that things were moving in the right direction.\nHe said this meant there were \"a number of reopenings that can be safely and cautiously brought forward\" - such as allowing alcohol to be served with a meal indoors in pubs and restaurants."

There will be some people who chose not to have a vaccine when they were first offered it, who may have changed their minds.\"\nMr Drakeford said the NHS was \"checking and rechecking\" whether anyone had been left out and final appointments were being arranged for the weekend.\n\"Anybody who knows of somebody who may have missed out, it is not too late at all,\" he said.\n\"We will make sure that those people have an appointment as fast as possible.\"\nHealth minister Vaughan Gething said \"a leave no-one behind approach\" was being taken. \n\"The next group, those people 65 and over, all health boards are already sending out invites for those people to come forward as well,\" he said. \n\"We're not looking to miss a step, we're carrying on with the vaccine we have available.\"\nThe top four priority groups include:\nFigures show 88.4% of those aged 80 or older have had a first dose, compared to 86.3% for 75 to 79 year olds and 79.8% of 70 to 74 year olds.\nPublic Health Wales said a total of 80.3% of care home residents have had a first dose, and 83.5% of care home workers.\nBritish Medical Association chairman Dr David Bailey said Wales was \"hopefully on the home straight\".\nHe told BBC Radio Wales: \"People are really making an effort to make the thing go smoothly as possible, and it is a credit to the Welsh public, as well as everyone who has actually been delivering the vaccine, because it has gone smoothly and everyone has been trying to do their part.\"\nMr Drakeford said: \"To have achieved this first milestone and offered vaccination to everyone in the first four priority groups - those who are most vulnerable to coronavirus - is a truly phenomenal effort. \n\"Of course, the hard work has only just begun - there are many, many more people to vaccinate yet and a lot of second doses still to give.\"\nWelsh Conservative's Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called the milestone a \"true British and Welsh success story\".\nHe said it showed the UK Government had \"ensured Wales has had the vaccines available to protect the most vulnerable in our society and meet this target\" and hoped Wales could soon reopen its economy.\nHowever he added there was a still a \"long way to go\" with 80% of the population yet to be offered the vaccine.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesperson Rhun ap Iorwerth, said it was thanks to NHS staff and volunteers \"that Wales has been able to accelerate the vaccination effort to its current levels\".\nMr ap Iorwerth added his party would continue to call for \"those in all care settings, not just the elderly, to be vaccinated as a matter of priority, and for key workers in schools, the emergency services and public transport to be brought in to the priority system sooner.\""

      "tags": "Comedy,Television,Acting,Film",
      "text": "Actor Paul Ritter, who played dad Martin Goodman in the popular Channel 4 comedy Friday Night Dinner, has died after a brain tumour at the age of 54.\nHe also starred in Sky drama Chernobyl, played Eldred Worple in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and was in James Bond film Quantum of Solace.\nHis other TV credits included Vera, Belgravia, Cold Feet and No Offence.\nFriday Night Dinner creator Robert Popper said he was \"a deeply clever, funny, intelligent, kind man\".\n\"But he also had that rare thing, he had the common touch, so people could just relate to him,\" Popper told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nRecalling watching Ritter on set, Popper said: \"He was so quiet and focused before he went on, and then as soon as he went on, all that energy just popped out of him. It was amazing.\n\"I don't think he ever did anything wrong\u2026 he was very professional and he was a lovely guy.\"\nThe sitcom also starred Tamsin Grieg, Simon Bird, Tom Rosenthal and Mark Heap. Ritter played Martin, who was loosely based on Popper's father, who apparently often walked around the house with his shirt off.\nRosenthal tweeted that it was \"incredibly sad\" news.\nStephen Mangan, who had known Ritter since they were students, co-starred with him in Alan Ayckbourn's The Norman Conquests in the West End and on Broadway. Mangan said he had \"so much talent and it shone from him even as a teenager\".\nRitter's agent said he was \"an exceptionally talented actor playing an enormous variety of roles on stage and screen with extraordinary skill\", describing him as \"fiercely intelligent, kind and very funny\".\nIn a statement, Big Talk, the producers of Friday Night Dinner, said: \"He was a brilliant, kind and talented man much loved by everyone who was lucky enough to know and work with him, and Paul will forever be part of both the Big Talk and Friday Night Dinner families.\n\"Our thoughts are with his own family at this time and following their wishes we will be making a donation to the Old Vic Impact Fund.\"\nOther actors paying tribute included Derry Girls' Nicola Coughlan, who tweeted that Ritter \"was absolutely magic\", while Eddie Marsan said he was \"one of our greatest actors\".\nCatastrophe's Rob Delaney said Ritter had an \"unreal talent\" that spanned comedy and drama, and fellow actor Sanjeev Kohli described him as \"one of the most versatile & brilliant actors that has ever drawn breath\".\nRadio Times executive editor Morgan Jeffrey remembered him as \"a fantastic, magnetic actor\" and said Martin was \"one of the most brilliant and memorable comedy characters of the past several decades\".\nYears and Years and Being Human star Russell Tovey said he still remembered learning a lesson on stage from Ritter.\nFriday Night Dinner started in 2011 and was nominated for the best sitcom award at the Baftas the following year.\nThe show focused on the British Jewish Goodman family, whose sons returned home each Friday night for a meal, which usually involved eating \"crimble crumble\" for dessert, and ended in some kind of disarray after the appearance of their unusual neighbour Jim, played by Heap. \nMartin would regularly joke about the meal's main course being \"a lovely bit of squirrel\".\nRitter, from Kent, told the New Zealand Herald in 2014 he based some aspects of Martin on his own father, saying: \"Lots of the mannerisms come from my own dear old departed dad. He was a very funny guy as well.\"\nThe series became such a hit that Ritter said he was stopped in the street by teenagers and parents alike, who all wanted to talk to him about Martin. There have been three attempts at a US remake, including one with Tony Shalhoub as the father figure.\nIn the 2019 drama Chernobyl, which was produced by HBO and Sky UK, Ritter played Anatoly Dyatlov, the deputy chief engineer at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. \nThe show, which also starred Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Emily Watson, won awards including two Golden Globes and 10 Emmy Awards. \nRitter was a familiar face elsewhere on stage and screen. He was nominated for an Olivier Award in the West End in 2006, and was up for a Tony Award on Broadway for The Norman Conquests.\nIn 2013, he played John Major in The Audience, which was The Crown creator Peter Morgan's play about the meetings between prime ministers and the Queen, played by Dame Helen Mirren.\nHis agent said on Tuesday: \"It is with great sadness we can confirm that Paul Ritter passed away last night.\"\nThey said he died peacefully at home with his wife Polly and sons Frank and Noah by his side. \"We will miss him greatly,\" they added."

      "tags": "France,Rubbish collection,Paris",
      "text": "Paris officials have blamed a \"political smear campaign\" after angry comments and pictures of filthy streets spread on social media criticising a \"trashed Paris\".\nThe hashtag \"saccage Paris\" went viral over Easter, with many of the messages accusing the city's Socialist leadership of ruining the capital.\nThey complained of uncollected rubbish, damaged pavements and graffiti.\nThe Paris deputy mayor said keeping the city clean had always been a problem.\nHowever, the social media campaign was a \"travesty of reality\", Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire insisted. Paris was densely populated and cleaners were doing all they could, he told RTL Radio, but he said the French capital was no different from London, whose mayor Sadiq Khan faced exactly the same issues.\nAmong the thousands of tweets, Cyrille Capuano said that for years Paris had not lived up to its reputation as the city of light, and he accused Mayor Anne Hidalgo of turning it into a public dump.\n\"If you take a picture every day of the worst moment of your daily life that isn't reality. You have to draw a distinction between occasional issues of cleanliness and the slant of political protest,\" Mr Gr\u00e9goire said.\nIs Paris as dirty as all that? Permit a resident of 25 years to cast doubt upon this new piece of received wisdom.  \nBack in the 1990s the commonest complaint in the city was the ubiquity of d\u00e9jections canines - dog faeces to you and me. Today, the owner who fails to clear up after his or her pet is rare and furtive. And the streets are cleaner. \nEvery day I see not one but several visits to my street by cleaning vehicles and bin lorries. The individuals - mostly of immigrant origin - jumping on and off the back of the trucks are unsung heroes. \nHow many of the people complaining about the dirtiness of Paris are also the ones who complain about being stuck in traffic behind rubbish collections, or about the anti-car (and thus clean-air) policies of the mayor?\nOf course the public sphere is being degraded. But so is it everywhere. Graffiti is so commonplace as to be like ambient sound. Uncivic behaviour is growing. Some areas of Paris are worse than others. And fairly regularly, it is true (this is France), the bin collectors strike.\nBut it is worth remembering that in Paris 2.18 million people live in a circle just 10km (about six miles) across. Evacuating their daily ordure is a feat.  \nWhile some of the pictures focused on mounds of rubbish, others highlighted an increase in graffiti, street furniture and overall ugliness.\nThere were pictures of broken, antiquated benches and before-and-now comparisons suggesting general negligence.\nOn the political right, the mayor's opponents weighed into the debate, with far-right leader Marine Le Pen saying the many thousands of pictures broke the heart of anyone who loved Paris. The capital's \"decay\" should not leave anyone in France unmoved, she tweeted.\nRachida Dati, who is mayor of the seventh arrondissement (district) of Paris, which takes in the Eiffel Tower, called for an emergency council meeting to tackle the problems of \"cleanliness and sanitation\".\nBut on the left another mayor, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Coumet from the 13th district further to the south, said he did not see evidence of a ruined city, just an orchestrated campaign.\nOthers noted that the Covid pandemic had led to depleted council teams, and closed restaurants meant Parisians had to eat more often in the street.\nA month ago, the Paris mayor launched a consultation on how to give Paris a \"new aesthetic\". Unlike the social media campaign that attracted tens of thousands of comments, the website offering a rethink and a new urban landscape for the city has prompted a mere 1,650 contributions.\nAnother questionnaire launched on Twitter by Parisian Quentin Divernois has fared better, attracting 4,000 suggestions on how to look after the historic elements of Paris dating back to Baron Haussmann, whose urban renewal in the 19th Century gave Paris the boulevards and parks it is known for today."

A way back to normality.\"\nJohn Sanders, from Carmarthenshire, was the fifth person to receive the jab. \nHe said: \"It's massively important. I'm a carer for my disabled son who's now 22. He's had brain cancer and various chemotherapies and he's got immune problems as well, so it's obviously important for us.\"\nThe UK is committed to buying 17 million doses of Moderna, the third of seven vaccines developed in the UK or around the world that it has put in orders for.\nIt has not been confirmed when the rest of the UK will start using the jab, but Scotland received its first batch on Monday. \nLike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs which are already in use, the Moderna jab is given in two doses, several weeks apart.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said he was delighted its UK rollout was starting. \n\"The UK government has secured vaccines on behalf of the entire nation and the vaccination programme has shown our country working together at its best,\" he said.\nWales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said a third vaccine for use in Wales \"significantly adds\" to the nation's defences against Covid-19.\nAcross the whole of the UK, more than 31.6 million people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine - while 5.4 million have been fully vaccinated.\nIn Wales, more than 1.49 million people have had a first dose, while more than 469,000 people have had both doses.\nBut the UK's Covid vaccine supplies are set to be delayed by \"up to four weeks\" in April and Wales expects to have 250,000 fewer Oxford-AstraZeneca doses.\nMr Scully told Sky News the vaccination programme remained on track to cover all adults in England by the end of July. \nOn Tuesday, the trial of the Oxford vaccine on children stopped giving out jabs as a precaution.\nThe Moderna vaccine is a two-dose jab given at an interval of between four and 12 weeks.\nLike Pfizer's, it is an RNA vaccine and works by injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body, where it enters cells and tells them to create antigens.\nThese antigens are recognised by the immune system and prepare it to fight coronavirus.\nNo actual virus is needed to create an mRNA vaccine, meaning the rate at which it can be produced is accelerated.\nIt also only requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer.\nTrial results suggested efficacy against the disease was 94.1%, and vaccine efficacy against severe Covid-19 was 100%.\nMore than 30,000 people in the US took part in the trial, from a wide range of age groups and ethnic backgrounds.\nThe government has bought 17 million doses - enough to vaccinate about 8.5 million people.\nScotland is due to receive more than one million of the UK's order, and the doses will arrive over a period of months.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon cautioned that the supply does not mean the vaccine programme will be accelerated.\nModerna said the vaccine was generally well-tolerated, with no serious safety concerns identified.\nEvents after the first dose included injection-site pain, and after the second dose fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, other pain and redness at the injection site.\nBut these were generally short-lived.\nRos Jervis, director of public health for Hywel Dda University Health Board, said the Moderna vaccine would be used alongside the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in the rollout to communities in Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire.\n\"We are incredibly lucky to have a third vaccine in Wales, with a long shelf life and the ability to be easily transported, to help deliver the vaccination programme to small clinics across our rural communities,\" she said.\nDarren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health boards, told BBC Radio Wales the Moderna rollout would help the country make up for a reduction in Oxford-AstraZeneca supplies in April. \nMr Gething said every vaccine given in Wales was \"a small victory\" against the virus and people should go for their jab when invited.\nA Welsh Conservatives spokesman said the UK government's vaccination strategy had been \"fully vindicated\". \nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"We need to know what this milestone now means for further easing of restrictions.\"\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats said the third vaccine came as \"welcome news\", adding the priority should be to vaccinate everyone \"as quickly and safely as possible\".

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "tags": "Harvey Weinstein",
      "text": "Lawyers for disgraced US film producer Harvey Weinstein have launched an appeal against his conviction for rape and sexual assault.\nWeinstein, 69, was convicted in New York City in February 2020 and later sentenced to 23 years in prison.\nIt was seen as a landmark moment in the #MeToo movement against the sexual abuse and harassment of women. \nWeinstein, formerly one of Hollywood's most powerful figures, has consistently denied any wrongdoing.\nHe has vowed to clear his name. Filed in New York State Supreme Court, the long-anticipated appeal signals the start of what is expected to be a lengthy attempt to have his conviction quashed.\nHis lawyers argue that the judge made several errors that denied Weinstein's right to a fair trial.\n\"With a year behind us and emotions subsided, the transcript of the case confirms what we always believed: that Mr Weinstein did not receive a fair trial,\" one of Weinstein's lawyers, Arthur Aidala, said in a statement sent to the BBC on Monday.\nDozens of women have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct, including rape, against Weinstein, an Oscar-winning producer.\nThe allegations began to emerge in October 2017, when the New York Times newspaper first reported incidents dating back decades.\nWeinstein faces further criminal charges, for rape and sexual assault, in Los Angeles, California, where he is due to stand trial.\nHe is currently being held in a maximum-security prison in New York state. He had heart surgery after his February 2020 conviction and tested positive for coronavirus a month later while in jail.\nWeinstein faced five charges in the New York City trial but was only found guilty of two. \nThe first was a first-degree criminal sexual act against production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The second was a third-degree rape of aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013.\nNew York jurors acquitted him of the most serious charges, of predatory sexual assault, which could have seen him given an even longer jail term.\nWeinstein he did not testify to defend himself in court. But moments before he was sentenced, he read out a statement in which he expressed \"deep remorse\" but described himself as \"totally confused\" by the #MeToo movement.\nOutside court, Ms Haley said the assault had \"scarred me deeply, mentally and emotionally\".\n\"What he did not only stripped me of my dignity as a human being and a woman, but it crushed my confidence,\" she said.\nIn a 166-page brief, Weinstein's lawyers raise seven examples of \"errors\" that, in their view, compromised the fairness of the trial.\nIn one argument, the lawyers say the trial was \"tainted by a single juror who demonstrated a strong and disqualifying bias in favour of the prosecution\". That juror, they say, was writing an autobiographical book about the sexual harassment of younger women by older men.\nAnother argument says the testimony of women whose sexual allegations were not the subject of the criminal charges unfairly influenced the jury. Jurors heard testimony from the actress Annabella Sciorra, who accused Weinstein of raping her in 1993.\nWeinstein was not charged with raping Sciorra, but prosecutors used her testimony to support their argument that he was a sexual predator.\nA third argument says defence experts were improperly barred from rebutting the testimony of the prosecution's witnesses.\n\"We will argue that the trial judge disregarded well accepted and fundamental principles of New York law and violated Mr Weinstein's constitutional rights,\" Weinstein's lawyer, Mr Aidala, said. \"We have the utmost confidence that the Appellate Division will correct these mistakes and send this case back before a different judge.\"\nNow the appeal has been submitted, prosecutors will have a chance to respond before a judge assesses the arguments and makes a decision."

Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "International Monetary Fund (IMF),Global economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The International Monetary Fund is now forecasting a stronger economic recovery this year and next.\nThe IMF has upgraded both its UK and global forecasts compared with what it projected in January.\nBut the British economy is still predicted to return to its pre-pandemic level of activity only in late 2022. \nThe agency also warns that recoveries are diverging dangerously within and between countries. \nThe new UK forecast is for growth of 5.3% this year and 5.1% in 2022. Both figures are upgrades, though the latter is only marginally higher than the January forecast.\nThe recovery follows last year's pandemic driven contraction of 9.9% which was the deepest of any of the G7 major developed economies.\nBringing in the two predicted recovery years, the UK's performance over 2020 to 2022 would be ahead of one of the G7 countries, Italy. \nThe new global forecasts are growth of 6% and 4.4% this year and next. Both are upgrades, a fairly modest one for 2022.\nThat mainly reflects up-rating to the forecast for developed economies, especially the United States.   \nIn a blog on the forecasts, the IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath says a way out of the health and economic crisis is increasingly visible. Vaccinations, she writes, are likely to power recoveries in many countries in 2021.\nBut she is also concerned about how those recoveries are diverging. \nCountries with slower vaccine rollouts, more limited support from economic policy, and those more reliant on tourism are likely to do less well. \nThe first two of these are particular issues for developing countries. Many have less access to vaccines, and they also tend to find it more difficult to finance economic and health policy actions.\nAmong emerging and developing economies, China has already returned to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity. But many others in the group are not expected to do so until well into 2023.\nThe report says the cumulative losses in income per person over the period 2020 to 2022 are likely to be 20% for those countries, compared with a less severe but still large figure of 11% for the developed world. \nThe report also says that gains in poverty reduction have been reversed. It says people counted as extremely poor are likely to have increased by 95 million last year, with a rise of 80 million in the number who are undernourished.  \nThe IMF says the divergences are occurring not just between but also within countries. Income inequality is likely to increase as young people and those with relatively low levels of skills have been harder hit in both developed and developing countries.  \nWomen have already been affected as they account for a large share of employment in some sectors, such as tourism, where there is a lot of personal contact. \nThe pandemic has also had an impact on workers whose jobs are vulnerable to automation. That is a process that has been accelerated as a result of the health crisis. "

Airline crews must have only worked on low-risk routes.\nThose with cold or flu symptoms will not be allowed to travel, and all passengers must wear masks and give details to New Zealand authorities of where they will be staying.\nMs Ardern warned that travel arrangements could change \"if there is an outbreak\" - similar to how Australia has on two occasions briefly halted travel from New Zealand.\nBut she said New Zealand would view cases in Australia \"as a region of our own when making decisions on restrictions\".\nIf multiple cases of an unknown origin emerged \"we would likely suspend flights for a set period of time\", she added.\nOther conditions may be brought in too, including pre-departure testing for people from affected areas.\n\"These precautions are all part of our preparation to keep Covid out,\" she said.\n\"Both countries have had border incursions and I know neither one of us wishes to export Covid to the other country.\" \nAbout 1.5 million Australians used to visit New Zealand annually prior to the pandemic - about 40% of that nation's international visitors.\nMs Ardern said she expected most travellers taking early trips would be going to see family and friends - but added the upcoming ski season would also be an attraction.\nAustralia's national carrier Qantas said it would resume 122 return flights to New Zealand per week once the bubble came into operation.\nThis travel bubble is believed to be the second in the world, after one opened up between the islands of Taiwan and Palau last week.\nAustralia and New Zealand have also previously raised the idea of separate travel bubbles with low-risk places like Singapore, Taiwan and several Pacific island nations."

      "text": "Credit Suisse took drastic action on Tuesday, replacing two key executives and cutting bonuses amid the fallout from two major business relationships.\nIts chief risk officer, Lara Warner and its investment banking chief, Brian Chin will both leave the bank in April.\nTwo businesses linked to the Swiss banking giant, Greensill Capital and hedge fund Archegos imploded in recent weeks with major losses.\nGreensill was the key financial backer of Liberty Steel owner, GFG Alliance.\nGreensill Capital, filed for insolvency earlier this month. There are concerns about the future of Liberty Steel which directly employs 3,000 people in the UK. An additional 2,000 people work for GFG Alliance in the UK.\nCredit Suisse said it expects to make a $960m (\u00a3690m) loss for the first quarter. It had planned to ask shareholders to vote on both short and long-term bonus awards for executives, but it has now cancelled these proposals and it is cutting its proposed dividend payout to shareholders.\nIt also warned of a $4.7bn loss from Archegos' implosion alone.\nIt said it had yet to calculate the cost of its involvement with Greensill Capital.\nArchegos is run by controversial former hedge fund manager, Bill Hwang.The Swiss bank was one of several lenders that acted as prime broker to Mr Hwang.\nArchegos collapsed after bets it made on stocks unravelled. Shares in one of its holdings, US entertainment giant Viacom, starting falling, forcing it to sell them off in double-quick time.\nCredit Suisse was one of the last to try to unload its shares in the company, selling then at just over $40 per share, compared with the $100 it was priced at earlier in March.\nCredit Suisse's chief executive, Thomas Gottstein, said in a statement: \"The significant loss in our prime services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable.\n\"In combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognise that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders.\"\u00a0\nCredit Suisse said it had launched investigations into both of these matters. It said these would not only focus on the direct issues arising from each of them, but also on the broader consequences.\nMr Gottstein said: \"Serious lessons will be learned.\"\nThe bank's results will be published on April 22, 2021."
