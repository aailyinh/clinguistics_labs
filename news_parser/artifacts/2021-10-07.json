      "text": "France will send its ambassador back to Australia to \"redefine\" relations, after Canberra reneged on a deal to buy French submarines and sparked a row.\nLast month, Australia formed the Aukus security pact with the US and the UK - aimed at maintaining Western influence in the Asia-Pacific.\nThat saw Australia end a $65bn (\u00a348bn) deal with France to instead access US nuclear-powered submarine technology.\nParis called the deal a \"stab in the back\".\nSoon after the shock announcement, France recalled its ambassadors from Canberra and Washington DC in protest.\nBut while it has sought to mend the rift with the US, France has continued to freeze out Australia. \nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said French President Emmanuel Macron has refused to take his calls. Australia's trade minister has also been shunned by his French counterpart.\nLast week, negotiations over an Australia-EU trade deal were also pushed back, in what was widely interpreted as a result of the row. \nFrench officials have said they were blindsided by Canberra, which had maintained talks about the French submarines while working to secure an alternative deal.\nFrance's contract to build a fleet of conventionally powered submarines for Australia, dating to 2016, was to be a key part of France's regional engagement.\nForeign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday that while his country would \"start afresh\" with Australian relations, it would \"not have an impact in our determination to remain engaged in the Pacific\".\nThe returning ambassador to Australia would also \"defend our interests\" over the scrapped submarine contract.\nCanberra has already spent over $900m on the French programme and is expected to pay a minimum $288m exit fee for breaking the contract. \nAustralia has said it understands France's \"deep disappointment\".\n\"Australia values its relationship with France, which is an important partner and a vital contributor to stability, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. This will not change,\" Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said last month.\nAukus is widely seen as a response to the growing power of China."

      "tags": "Personal finance,Universal Credit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government should find \u00a310bn a year to boost universal credit, former Tory minister Steve Baker has said. \nThe \u00a320-a-week increase to the benefit officially ended on Wednesday despite warnings about a squeeze on living standards and rising prices.\nMr Baker said it should be an \"absolute priority\" to find extra funds as part of the upcoming spending review. \nThe government says the benefit boost was always meant to be temporary and it is helping the most needy.\nClaims the government is out of touch with the plight of low-income families were fuelled by an interview with the New Statesman on Wednesday by Tory grandee, Sir Peter Bottomley.\nHe said MPs need a pay rise as some were struggling financially to cope on an annual salary of just over \u00a380,000.\n\"I don't know how they manage. It's really grim,\" he said, arguing that a salary of around \u00a3110-\u00a3115,000 a year was needed to bring them in to line with GPs. \nSpeaking to LBC radio, Mr Bottomley explained he was not arguing for pay rises.\nHe said he was trying to make the point that increasing MPs' salaries would make it easier to widen the pool of people interested in switching their careers to become parliamentarians.\nHigher wages would make it possible for headteachers and senior executives in nursing to come to sit in Parliament rather than it being the preserve of the independently wealthy, he said. \nHis comments come as a social media film emerged of Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey singing (I've Had) The Time of My Life at this week's Conservative conference in Manchester. \nLabour called the timing of her karaoke performance, as benefits are cut for millions of people, \"an insult and a disgrace\".\nBut Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it was \"unfair\" to link the two.\nHe told ITV's Good Morning Britain that \"parties and dance-offs and singing is a feature of all party conferences\", and Ms Coffey had also announced the hardship fund at Manchester.\nMinisters have admitted that many UK households could face \"a very difficult winter\".\nEnergy prices are surging at the same time as the universal credit top-up being withdrawn and taxes are rising to fund the NHS and social care.\nBut asked during the Conservative Party conference about the pressure on family incomes, the prime minister told the BBC he was \"not worried\"  because supply chain issues will sort themselves out \"rapidly\".\nAnd he said the economy was facing the \"stresses and strains\" of a post-Covid recovery as it moves to a \"new approach\" with higher wages and lower immigration.\nHe said government schemes, such as a \u00a3500m hardship fund, would help those on the lowest incomes. \nSpeaking to ITV's Peston, Mr Baker - an influential figure on the right of the Conservative Party - said the government should find \u00a310bn a year to improve universal credit. \nHe said the \u00a320-a-week top-up, which was introduced to help people on low incomes through the pandemic, should be retained.\nHe also said he had urged the government to improve the taper rate, which reduces the amount individuals can claim for every extra pound they earn, as an \"absolute priority\".\nBut he added that he will vote for whatever the government decides in its Spending Review at the end of this month.\nCurrently for every \u00a31 claimants earn over their work allowance their benefit is reduced by 63p.\nSpeaking on the BBC News Channel, Shadow Business Secretary, Ed Miliband said Labour was \"not giving up\" on attempts to reverse the cut to universal credit. \n\"It beggars belief\" he said ,that in the context of escalating energy prices and tax rises, \"the government is ploughing ahead\" with the cut to the benefit.  \nPeople are facing a \"double whammy\" and the situation is going to be \"unbearable for so many families\" he added and targeting support through the social security system is the best way to help them.

      "tags": "Insects,Environment",
      "text": "A stink bug that can spoil crops and infest homes has been trapped in Surrey as part of a monitoring study. \nThe brown marmorated stink bug is native to Asia, but has spread to parts of Europe and the US, where it can destroy fruit crops.\nA lone stink bug was caught at RHS Garden Wisley this summer within weeks of the setting up of a pheromone trap.\nThe adult may be a stowaway brought in on imported goods or part of an undiscovered local population.\nDr Glen Powell, head of plant health at RHS Garden Wisley, said the stink bug may become commonplace in gardens and in homes within a decade.\n\"This isn't a sudden invasion but potentially a gradual population build-up and spread, exacerbated by our warming world,\" he said. \nIt's not yet clear if stink bugs are living undetected in parts of England or are rare visitors that hitch-hike in on imported goods or passenger luggage and survive for only a short time. So far, no eggs or immature bugs have been found that would suggest the bug is breeding and has set up home.\nThe bug has been caught only twice before in pheromone traps set up to lure it in by means of a natural chemical - in all cases as lone instances. The previous finds were at Rainham Marshes in Essex and in the wildlife garden of London's Natural History Museum.\nAccording to the department for the environment, Defra, the bug has been intercepted in the UK on several occasions - in passenger luggage flown in from the US, clothing and wood imports from the US, and stone imported from China.\nThe trap at Wisley is part of a national monitoring project led by a plant science research company, NIAB EMR, in Kent, and funded by Defra.\nDr Michelle Fountain, head of pest and pathogen ecology at NIAB EMR, said: \"[The] brown marmorated stink bug represents a significant threat to food production systems in the UK so it is crucial that we continue to monitor any establishment and spread of the pest.\"\nThere are more than 40 species of stink bugs, also known as shield bugs, already present in the UK. Most pose no threat to plant health and are not considered pests.\nBrown marmorated stink bugs, which have a distinctive rectangular-shaped head, get their name from the odour they emit when threatened.  \nIn the US, they can invade houses, clustering in their hundreds, and can be devastating for farmers, destroying fruit such as nectarines and peaches and feeding on a wide range of ornamental trees, vegetables and other plants.\nInvasive species cost the UK economy over \u00a31.8bn a year and can threaten the survival of other plants and animals. A Defra spokesperson said: \"The brown marmorated stink bug is not a significant threat to our crops - but as with all pests and diseases we will continue to monitor any threats closely.\"\nAnyone finding what they believe to be a brown marmorated stink bug is asked to take a picture and report the sighting at BMSB@niab.com or via email to Entomology@rhs.org.uk.\nThe insect can be confused with other species - more information can be found here.\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

      "tags": "Companies,Intel,Semiconductors",
      "text": "The boss of Intel says the US chipmaker is no longer considering building a factory in the UK because of Brexit. \nPat Gelsinger told the BBC that before the UK left the EU, the country \"would have been a site that we would have considered\".\nBut he added: \"Post-Brexit... we're looking at EU countries and getting support from the EU\".\nIntel wants to boost its output amid a global chip shortage that has hit the supply of cars and other goods.\nThe firm - which is one of the world's largest makers of semiconductors - says the crisis has shown that the US and Europe are too reliant on Asia for its chip-making needs. \nIntel is investing up to $95bn (\u00a370bn) on opening and upgrading semiconductor plants in Europe over the next 10 years, as well as boosting its US output.\nBut while Mr Gelsinger said the firm \"absolutely would have been seeking sites for consideration\" in the UK, he said Brexit had changed this.\n\"I have no idea whether we would have had a superior site from the UK,\" he said. \"But we now have about 70 proposals for sites across Europe from maybe 10 different countries. \n\"We're hopeful that we'll get to agreement on a site, as well as support from the EU... before the end of this year.\"\nMicrochips are vital components in millions of products from cars to washing machines, but they have been in short supply this year due to surging demand and supply chain issues. \nIt has led to shortages of popular goods like cars and computers and driven up prices - issues Mr Gelsinger said were set to continue into Christmas.\n\"There is some possibility that there may be a few IOUs under the Christmas trees around the world this year,\" he said. \n\"Just everything is short right now. And even as I and my peers in the industry are working like crazy to catch up, it's going to be a while.\"\nHe said things would \"incrementally\" improve next year but were unlikely to stabilise until 2023.\nIntel's expansion comes as the overall market for semi-conductors is set more than double in the next seven years to around $800bn. \nThe firm also hopes to secure subsidies from US and European politicians, who feel their reliance on Asia for chips could threaten national security. \nToday the US only produces around 12% of the world's semiconductors, while Korea's Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) account for 70% of global supply. \n\"It is clearly part of the motivation of a globally balanced supply chain that nobody should be too dependent on somebody else,\" Mr Gelsinger told the BBC.  \nIntel will continue outsourcing some of its chip-making but eventually hopes to make most of its products in-house. Competing won't be easy, though. \nChip-making is still far cheaper in Asia and Intel's rivals continue to expand. TSMC, the world's largest contract maker of semi-conductors, will spend $100bn on increasing capacity over the next three years while Samsung invests $205bn.\nMr Gelsinger said he is confident Intel can still regain its leading edge. \"This is an industry that we created in the US, Intel's the company that puts silicon into Silicon Valley,\" he said. \n\"But we realise these are good companies, they're well capitalised, they're investing, they're innovating together. So we have to re-earn that right of unquestioned leadership.\" "

      "tags": "NI economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The legal requirement for social distancing in bars and restaurants is to be removed.\nNightclubs are also to be allowed to reopen, meaning legal restrictions on dancing in venues will be scrapped.\nRestrictions will be lifted from 31 October.\nA number of mitigations have been agreed and it is thought businesses will be asked to check for vaccine certificates, but this will not be a legal requirement. \nMinisters have also agreed to retain the mandatory wearing of face coverings in certain settings.\nIt is understood ministers were advised that moving legal regulations on face coverings into guidance would lead to a 30% decline in their use. \nThe industry had argued that social distancing requirements were damaging trade.\nThe new rules mean people will be able to move around pubs and restaurants and to eat and drink while standing up.\nChanges were also announced to the UK travel red list, which has been cut from 54 countries to seven.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan welcomed the easing of restrictions, particularly for the the hospitality sector, which he said had been hit hard during the pandemic.\n\"I'm pleased that at the end of this month they will be able to operate in a much more sustainable and viable way,\" he said.\nMr Givan said the sector benefitted from \"a high level of adherence\" to coronavirus restrictions, adding that he believed this would continue.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she was pleased progress had been made at Thursday's executive meeting, but that people should remain cautious. \n\"We're in for an uncertain period ahead and we have to work our way through that as best we can,\" she said. \nMs O'Neill said continuing increasing vaccination rates would also be a \"crucially important\" part of the executive's winter planning.\nUnder existing rules, social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) remains a legal requirement in pubs, bars and restaurants in Northern Ireland.\nFrom Thursday 14 October the restrictions on the number of people allowed to meet inside a home is to be increased from 15 from four households to 30 from an unlimited number of households.\nFrom that date, people attending performances at indoor venues will not have to be seated during the performance.\nThe executive is now moving to unlock the final stage of pandemic recovery. \nNightclubs will finally get to reopen on Halloween and social distancing - something we've lived with as the norm for the past 18 months - will be scrapped. \nIt's perhaps no surprise given how that's already the case in Great Britain and the rules south of the Irish border will end this month too. \nBut not everything is changing - face coverings will remain - a sign that for some, caution is still needed with Covid. \nThe executive has also warned that if things begin to go in the wrong direction again, vaccine passports could then be deployed. \nThe Department of Health will now progress work on the system after agreement with Executive Office officials - but the onus on hospitality businesses will be to prove that a mandatory scheme isn't needed.\nJohn Leighton, owner of Bennigan's Bar, Londonderry, said easing restrictions for hospitality was fantastic news, which the sector \"had been waiting on for some time\".\nHe said it had been a challenging and stressful time for the sector and that the timing to ease restrictions on 31 October was particularly good for Derry's annual Halloween festival.\n\"It means we can get back to enjoying ourselves and not having so many things to think about,\" he said. \n\"We can get back to a bit more normality.\"\nJanice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the restrictions which are being removed had presented \"significant challenges\" for businesses which were trying to become fully operational again.\nShe said: \"The industry has traded well to date and our primary focus remains the health and well-being of our staff and customers. \n\"Winter trade, in a viable manner within a sustainable framework and without further lockdown, is our aim.\"\nIn September, the executive agreed to end social distancing restrictions for shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings. \nThey asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test.\nBut this is advice and is not legally enforceable.\nLast week, Health Minister Robin Swann warned that a delay by the executive in agreeing a vaccine passport policy had limited options for easing more restrictions. \nThe Department of Health will now progress work to develop the digital scheme, but ministers will have to decide whether to deploy it.\nMs O'Neill said she did not want things to reach that point and hoped businesses would voluntarily comply with executive advice and demonstrate they could work safely. \nMinisters also discussed a bid from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey for \u00a355m in funding to mitigate the end of a \u00a320 weekly uplift for people claiming universal credit. \nStormont received an extra \u00a3180m from the Treasury in September and that money has yet to be distributed.\nThe expectation was that most if not all of that money would go on health spending.\nMr Givan and Ms O'Neill made clear that Stormont would face major difficulties - both financially and logistically - of stepping in to top up payments \nMr Givan said the Executive had to be \"honest\" with the public about the financial position.\n\"Now is not the time to be removing this uplift,\" he said.\n\"That is happening though this week and the ability, even if the executive had the funding, to do this [top up the payments] isn't there because we don't have the systems, this is administered directly through the Department for Work and Pensions in London.\n\"So we don't have the system. And the ability to finance it - we have to be honest with the public.\""

Any proposals must be subject to genuine negotiation and the commission mustn't take a 'take it or leave it' approach.\n \"If solutions cannot be agreed soon, we will need to act using the Article 16 safeguard mechanism to address the disruption that the protocol is causing on the ground\".\nTriggering Article 16 would suspend part of the protocol.\nSpeaking to the BBC in Brussels, United States national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned the British government that suspending the protocol would be a \"serious risk to stability\". \nHe said any possibility of a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was \"of serious concern to the United States\".\nMr Sullivan said both the UK and the EU should work together \"in a constructive way to find a deal and a way forward\".\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - had warned that it may quit Stormont if its demands over the protocol were not met.\nSpeaking on Thursday, the DUP leader said he was \"pleased\" that the EU was to table new proposals, adding that he believed pressure from unionists had \"opened up the protocol\". \n\"We were told weeks ago that the EU were not in a position where they were ever going to reopen negotiations, so I think we've breached the first wall,\" Sir Jeffrey said. \n\"And I think that is the result of unionists standing together and saying: 'Look, we cannot support this protocol; we cannot support an Irish Sea border'.\"\nThe DUP leader added: \"I think the pressure we have brought to bear and the steps that have been taken in the last few weeks have focused minds both in London and Brussels and I'm pleased that we've made this level of progress, but we still have a long way to go.\"\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the EU was going to \"enormous lengths\". \n\"I believe the package of practical solutions that we are putting on the table would be attractive for Northern Ireland and would be, I hope, supported by a majority of stakeholders in Northern Ireland,\" he told the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) in Dublin. \nHe said the commitment of the EU to the Good Friday Agreement was \"absolute\" and that the avoidance of a hard border on the island was a \"prerequisite\".\nEarlier this week UK Brexit Minister Lord Frost said he was expecting a short, intense negotiation with the EU.\nHe told the Conservative party conference that the protocol was \"not working and needs to change\".\nIn July, Lord Frost put forward radical proposals for changes to the protocol.\nTriggering Article 16, may end up as \"the only way\" forward, he warned.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said threats to trigger Article 16 were not helpful.\nHe said his proposals were not presented on a \"take it or leave it\" basis and that both the UK and EU would need to get out of their comfort zones.

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

The gas is to stun animals for slaughter and in packaging to prolong shelf life.\n\"We have already seen the impact of the truly astronomical increases in energy costs on production in the fertiliser and steel sectors,\" said Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group.\n\"Nobody wants to see a repeat in other industries this winter, given that UK EIIs [energy intensive industries] produce so many essential domestic and industrial products and are intrinsically linked with many supply chains.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"We are determined to secure a competitive future for our energy intensive industries and in recent years have provided them with extensive support, including more than \u00a32bn to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs. \n\"Our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to build a strong, home-grown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\"\nBesides industry struggles, a total of nine energy suppliers have collapsed in recent weeks, which has affected nearly 1.73 million customers in September alone.\nThe companies that have gone bust have been mostly smaller firms, which have been unable to deliver price promises to customers because of the surge in gas prices.\nFirms going bust has also had a knock on effect to auto-switching services, with Look After My Bills, famous for its popularity on BBC Two's Dragon's Den, \"pausing\" its operations, and fellow auto-switching company Flipper closing down completely.\nFlipper said in a statement that it had withdrawn from the market and was closing because it could \"no longer sustain the great savings\" its customers had \"come to expect\".\nMeanwhile, Look After My Bills said it was \"temporarily pausing\" its switching service, but would be \"back as soon as we can\" access energy deals \"right\" for customers.\nAffected customers have been told they will be switched to a new tariff by energy regulator Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier.\nIt has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm.\nJonathan Brearley, the boss of Ofgem, has warned that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills.\nA higher energy price cap came into force on Friday, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by \u00a3139 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nCustomers are protected from sudden hikes in gas prices through the energy price cap, which sets maximum prices and charges for those on a standard or default tariff.\nHowever, the next revision of the cap, which will affect bills from the start of April, is likely to rise significantly to reflect the greater costs faced by suppliers.\nAnalysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted the next cap will mean the typical household will have an annual bill of \u00a31,600 and the impact of the crisis could be felt into 2023. \n\"The explosion of choice and innovation seen in the sector in the last decade by challenger suppliers has been fundamentally altered in a matter of months, and while all eyes will inevitably be on this winter, the need for an enduring solution to ensure that the gains experienced by almost three decades of competition are not lost,\" said its senior consultant, Craig Lowrey."

      "text": "Firms and business groups have criticised the government for what they see as a lack of action to help fix supply chain shortages. \nDuring his speech at the Conservative Party, Boris Johnson said a high-wage, high-skilled economy was being created in the wake of Brexit and the pandemic.\nBut one business group said firms had been \"left wanting\" on details of a clear plan.\nRetailer Iceland said it was \"not helpful\" to make firms the bogeymen.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, said ambitions on wages \"need to be backed up by action\" to help firms with wider cost increases. \n\"It's inevitable that we will see price rises... our margins are very tight and we're not just an endless sponge.\n\"Pointing the finger and choosing us as the bogeymen for issues such as HGV driver shortages... is simply not helpful.\"\nResponding to Mr Johnson's conference speech, Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chair Mike Cherry said that the prime minister's vision did not \"match the current lived realities of small businesses and sole traders\". \nMr Cherry said that \"ambitious\" policies to drive growth and reduce tax at the autumn Budget were needed. \nSmall firms who face supply chain disruptions, staff shortages and business taxes, Mr Cherry said, had been hoping to hear a \"practical, clear action plan\" from the government, but \"been left wanting\". \n\"You have to start with reducing upfront business taxes and costs to unlock investment in training, recruitment and innovation. If you think that process works in reverse, you're putting the cart before the horse\", Mr Cherry added. \nShevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, agreed that what businesses \"urgently\" needed were answers to the problems they are facing \"in the here and now\". \n\"The economic recovery is on shaky ground and if it stalls then the private sector investment and tax revenues that the prime minister wants to fuel his vision will be in short supply.\" \nAddressing the issue of staff shortages, Ms Haviland said firms \"need much more flexibility\" for people to access training and qualifications. \nTony Danker, the head of the CBI business lobby group, said that while the prime minister set out a \"compelling vision\" for the country's economic future, \"ambition\" on wages \"without action on investment and productivity is ultimately just a pathway for higher prices\". \nHe added that at a \"fragile moment\" for the economy, companies need \"action on skills, on investment and on productivity\". \n\"It's time to get around the table, roll up our sleeves and get things done.\"\nBoris Johnson's alleged four-lettered response to those businesses which had concerns about his plans for Brexit is pretty infamous. \nHis Conservative Party conference speech was much longer (and expletive-free) but it seems that for some business leaders, it amounted to the same message.\nStrikingly, bosses who backed Brexit are now among those most loudly criticising the PM's approach.\nMr Johnson is a politician who really doesn't mind ruffling feathers and clearly believes he has the voters on his side.\nIt is a risky strategy though for a party which sees itself as the natural home for enterprise and for a government which is likely need private business on side to deliver much of the change it is promising."

      "text": "Commemorations have been held to mark the 20th anniversary of the start of UK military operations in Afghanistan.\nWreaths were laid in the UK at exactly 11:00 in Afghan time in remembrance of 457 British personnel killed there.\nUK troops left Afghanistan at the end of August, bringing an end to the 20-year war.\n\"The hurt never goes away,\" said Claire Hill, whose only son James was killed in 2009. \"We have to believe he did make a difference.\" \nThe war in Afghanistan began on 7 October 2001, with American-led coalition airstrikes against airports and terrorist training camps in response to the 11 September terror attacks in the US.\nTwo small wreath-laying ceremonies took place place in the UK at 07:30 BST - which was 11:00 in Afghanistan, the traditional time for military remembrance.\nThe Ministry of Defence said the ceremonies were planned to honour \"the courage and commitment of its people\" during the two decades of conflict.\nWreaths dedicated to those who lost their lives in combat in Afghanistan were laid at the Bastion Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.\nAt the same time, another wreath was laid at the Iraq and Afghanistan Memorial near the Ministry of Defence in central London.\nPipe Major Colour Sgt Peter Grant, who led the procession in Staffordshire, said the service was an important moment to reflect on what had happened in Afghanistan.\nSpeaking before the service, he told the BBC that having served in Afghanistan, it was \"quite emotional\" to see the names of people he knew on the wall of the Bastion memorial.\nC Sgt Grant, who also served as the lone piper at the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral, said: \"It gives me the opportunity to reflect on my time out there, think about the people who have lost their lives, the soldiers who are living with life-changing injuries and also the families who are living through the pain and hardship of losing people out there.\"\nThe commemoration comes as veterans and their families try to reckon with the legacy of the war, having watched the Taliban swiftly regain control of Afghanistan as UK and US forces withdrew.\nNearly 12 years to the day since L/Cpl James Hill died, his parents Claire and Brian are proud of his service and sacrifice, but also acknowledge the pain of seeing the Taliban return.\n\"If we were to say that James' life is wasted then that would hurt us all over again, because we have to believe he did make a difference,\" said Mrs Hill. \"They all gave so much. Not just the ones who died but the ones who carry on with injuries.\"\nJames was 23 and about to get married when he was killed by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan's Helmand province.\n\"It never leaves us, we don't have a son anymore. We don't have any other children. There's an emptiness, there's a hole here that nothing can fill,\" Mrs Hill said. \"The hurt never goes away.\"\n\"Remembrance Day for most people is 11 November, but for the likes of us Remembrance Day is every day,\" said Mr Hill.\nStuart Tootal - a former colonel who commanded 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment - saw the first serious casualties of the war when he led British troops into Helmand in 2006, and a simple peace support operation became a bloody counter-insurgency conflict.\nHis view of the war now is very clear: \"The intent of what we were trying to do was always right. The concept was flawed: too little, too late. And we quit far too soon. \n\"And that is the great tragedy of Afghanistan.\"\nWhile Afghanistan had 20 years to see how life could be different, Mr Tootal adds that the opportunity was never fully realised because the Taliban regained power.\n\"I don't think we can be very proud of the outcome. We can be proud of what we tried to do as soldiers,\" he said.\n\"But in terms of those responsible for the strategic decisions, I don't think there's a great deal to crow about... There is no victory here. You know, we did not win that conflict.\"\nAdditional reporting by Joseph Lee."

      "tags": "China,The Moon,Space exploration",
      "text": "The rock samples brought back from the Moon in December by China's Chang'e-5 mission were really young.\nIt's all relative, of course, but the analysis shows the basalt material - the solidified remnants of a lava flow - to be just two billion years old. \nCompare this with the samples returned by the Apollo astronaut missions. They were all over three billion years of age.\nThe findings are reported in the journal Science.\nChina's robotic Chang'e-5 mission was sent to a site on the lunar nearside called Oceanus Procellarum. \nIt was carefully chosen to add to the sum of knowledge gained from previous sample returns - the last of which was conducted by a Soviet probe in 1976.\nXiaochao Che and colleagues at the Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe (SHRIMP) Center in Beijing led the Chang'e-5 dating analysis, but worked with a broad international consortium.\nThe age data they've produced is fascinating because it proves volcanism continued on the Moon long after one might have expected such a small body to have cooled down and given up the activity.\nTheorists will now be thinking through new ideas for what kind of heat source might have sustained the late-stage behaviour.\nIt doesn't appear to have been driven by concentrated radioactive decay because the Chang'e-5 samples don't contain a lot of the kind of chemical elements associated with this effect.\n\"One of the other options we discuss in the paper is maybe the Moon was able to stay active longer because of its orbital interactions with Earth,\" speculated Dr Katherine Joy, a co-author from the University of Manchester, UK.\n\"Maybe the Moon wobbled back and forth on its orbit, resulting in what we call tidal heating. So, a bit like the Moon generates ocean tides on Earth, maybe the gravitational effect of the Earth could stretch and flex the Moon to generate frictional melting,\" she told BBC News.\nOne really important outcome from the study is the way it helps calibrate the crater-counting technique that is used for dating planetary surfaces.\nScientists assume that the more craters they see on a surface, the older that terrain must be; and also, obviously, in the reverse: the presence of very few craters is suggestive of a surface that has only recently been laid or remodelled.\nBut this technique has to be anchored in some absolute dates that are derived from measured samples, and for the Moon the chronology was not well constrained between one and three billion years ago. \nThe Chang'e-5 material now provides a precise waypoint in the middle of this time period.\nProf Brad Jolliff, from Washington University in St Louis, US, is another co-author in the consortium. He's now hoping China will send its next sample return mission to a region on the Moon's farside called South Pole Aitken Basin.\nThis vast depression, some 2,500km wide and up to 8km deep, was created by a spectacular impactor very early in lunar history.\n\"If Chang'e-6 goes to South Pole Aitken it will give us the age of the oldest big impact basin on the Moon, and that provides a very different part of the calibration, in the range of four to four-and-a-half billion years ago. We don't know what the flux of big impactors was back then, and a sample from the South Pole Aitken Basin region has the potential to answer the question.\"   \nChang'e-5 marked the start of an astonishing few months for China's national space programme. \nWithin six months of the lunar probe returning home with its rock samples on 16 December, another spacecraft had successfully entered orbit around Mars to place a rover on its surface; and Chinese astronauts had begun the occupation of a new space station at Earth."

If you think that process works in reverse, you're putting the cart before the horse\", Mr Cherry added. \nShevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, agreed that what businesses \"urgently\" needed were answers to the problems they are facing \"in the here and now\". \n\"The economic recovery is on shaky ground and if it stalls then the private sector investment and tax revenues that the prime minister wants to fuel his vision will be in short supply.\" \nAddressing the issue of staff shortages, Ms Haviland said firms \"need much more flexibility\" for people to access training and qualifications. \nTony Danker, the head of the CBI business lobby group, said that while the prime minister set out a \"compelling vision\" for the country's economic future, \"ambition\" on wages \"without action on investment and productivity is ultimately just a pathway for higher prices\". \nHe added that at a \"fragile moment\" for the economy, companies need \"action on skills, on investment and on productivity\". \n\"It's time to get around the table, roll up our sleeves and get things done.\"\nBoris Johnson's alleged four-lettered response to those businesses which had concerns about his plans for Brexit is pretty infamous. \nHis Conservative Party conference speech was much longer (and expletive-free) but it seems that for some business leaders, it amounted to the same message.\nStrikingly, bosses who backed Brexit are now among those most loudly criticising the PM's approach.\nMr Johnson is a politician who really doesn't mind ruffling feathers and clearly believes he has the voters on his side.\nIt is a risky strategy though for a party which sees itself as the natural home for enterprise and for a government which is likely need private business on side to deliver much of the change it is promising."

      "tags": "Islamic State group,Syria",
      "text": "A British woman who joined the Islamic State group with her young children has said UK politicians should \"open your minds\" to allowing them to return.\nNicole Jack and her three daughters are currently being held in a detention camp in Syria alongside thousands of wives and children of IS fighters.\nShe said they are \"out of sight, out of mind\" and the UK government must not sweep them \"under the carpet\".\nThe Home Office said its priority is to ensure the UK's safety and security.\nMs Jack and her daughters - aged 12, 9 and 7 - are currently in Syria's Roj camp, where Shamima Begum is also being held.\nSpeaking publicly for the first time, the 34-year-old told the BBC that despite living under IS rule for three years, she was not a security risk to the UK.\nThe UK government has been unwilling to let those who joined IS - a group that committed genocide and murder around the world - back to the UK, viewing them as potential national security threats.\nMs Jack left London with her husband and her then four young children to join IS in October 2015. She had told relatives her family was leaving for Somalia to start a new life.  \nIS had already become notorious for its brutality, including public beheadings, before she joined the group. And unlike some recruits from the UK, who joined as teenagers, she was an adult when she left.\nShe told the BBC few people will understand her decision to take her children to a dangerous warzone and live under IS rule. \nWhen pressed for an answer, she said her husband, Hussein Ali, threatened to split the family up if she refused to travel with him. \"It was about my family being together\", she claimed. \nBut the following year her husband died fighting for the militant group. \nShe then remarried, to another foreign IS recruit - Trinidadian fighter, Adil de Montrichard - who went on to die in an airstrike, which also killed her 10-year-old son, Isaaq. \nShe says she coped with the death of her son by \"knowing that he's in a better place\". \"Anything else can put us on the verge of a breakdown and this is what I can't risk,\" she added. \nWhen asked about the group's brutality, she says she was not witness to its worst crimes. She told the BBC: \"I haven't seen a beheading in my life.\" \nThe BBC also spoke to her 12-year-old daughter, who we are not naming. She said she \"misses her grannies and aunties\" and hopes to return to the UK so she can \"go to school and make friends\". \nThe children, who were born in London, attend a makeshift school in the camp, run by Save the Children. \n\"I like learning different things, like different languages,\" the 12-year-old said. \"When you learn more things, your brain becomes better and all these kind of things. I want to be smart when I grow up.\"  \nThere are estimated to be at least 16 British women and between 35 and 60 British children detained in Syrian camps, according to international advocacy groups.\nMany of the women in the camp - including Shamima Begum, who left the UK aged 15 with two other east London schoolgirls - have been stripped of their British citizenship. \nHowever, international charities are pushing governments to take back more of the children. Ms Jack, who has British and Trinidadian nationality, says she does not know if her citizenship has been removed. \nBut she insists she is not prepared to allow her children to return to Britain without her. \"I know for sure if my kids are separated from me they will not be in a stable situation, because we are a unit.\"\nThousands of miles away in London, the children's grandmother, hospital nurse Charleen Jack Henry, says the children should be allowed to return. \n\"It is not fair and it is not right for these children to be languishing in this place,\" she said, adding that Ms Jack should also be allowed back to \"face the consequences\" in the UK.\nBritain has said it is willing to repatriate orphans and unaccompanied children. \nKurdish authorities responsible for managing prisons and camps in north-east Syria have repeatedly urged Western governments for support in dealing with foreign IS fighters, as well as their wives and children.  They want countries to repatriate their own citizens.\nSome countries, like Sweden, Finland, Belgium and Germany, have brought back children and their mothers. \nMeanwhile, Save the Children says violence and illness are a daily risk for children living in Syrian camps.\n\"These children are experiencing traumatic events that no child should have to go through - and this is after years of living in conflict zones,\" Sonia Khush, director of the charity's Syria response team said. \"It is incomprehensible that they are condemned to this life.\"\nThe UK government wouldn't comment specifically on Nicole Jack's case, but said: \"Our priority is to ensure the safety and security of the UK.\"\u202f \nIt said those who remain in Syria \"include dangerous individuals\" adding: \"It's important that we do not make judgements about the national security risk someone poses based on their gender and age.\""

      "text": "Parents whose children attend a village school have pledged to take a council to court if it decides to shut it. \nLlanbedr school in Powys, founded in 1728, is one of several rural primaries under threat of closure due to council plans to overhaul local education.\nKate Stradling, whose two daughters attend with 50 other pupils, said she \"felt sick\" about the proposals.\nPowys council said \"difficult decisions\" had to be made and its plans would \"allow learners to thrive\".\nIt has decided to press ahead with the closure of the 200-year-old Castle Caereinion school, near Welshpool, which has 25 pupils, and a 37-pupil school at Llanfihangel Rhydithon, near Knighton, which dates back 170 years. \nThe future of Llanbedr Primary School, just north of Crickhowell, and seven other schools - whose pupil populations range from 23 to 109 - are also in doubt.\nBut a lawyer representing parents at several of the schools has told BBC Wales Live he believed the plans were a breach of a Welsh government policy designed to protect rural schools.\nIn 2018, the-then Education Minister Kirsty Williams changed the School Organisation Code to bring in a \"presumption against closure\" of listed rural schools.\nMichael Imperato said if Powys went ahead with the closures, the matter would be \"played out in the High Court\" in what would be the first legal test of the revised code. \nIt states that the case for closing a rural school must be \"strong\" and all viable alternatives must be \"conscientiously considered\". \nPowys council said it had sought independent legal advice to ensure its proposals were robust and said its consultations were held \"in accordance\" with the code.\nIt said its smallest schools generally have higher per-pupil budgets than the average, and estimated closing Llanbedr primary would save about \u00a3100,000 by 2024.\nIn April, Powys council chief executive Caroline Turner said that if the school closed, children would attend schools \"better equipped to meet the requirements of the new national curriculum and that could provide a wider range of educational and extra-curricular opportunities\".\nBut Mr Imperato said people felt communities would become unsustainable without these schools.\n\"Ways of life in Wales could change forever if good rural schools are allowed to disappear,\" he said.\nFi Loftus, who has three children at Llanbedr school, said: \"It would mean the world for them to stay open.\n\"Also, being a military family, they already have enough disruption in their life, why disrupt a perfect, thriving rural school?\"\nParent Kate Stradling, who has two daughters at the school and a son who went there previously, said: \"When I first heard the school was going to close I felt sick.\n\"I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach and I just had this sense of fear.\n\"And then my second thought was, if that's how I feel as an adult, how's my eight-year-old daughter going to feel?  \n\"She was distraught, really confused, scared, worried. It really affected her and it even still has affected her to this day - nine months on.\"\nMatt Beecham, who has a daughter in Year 2, said: \"I can't comprehend or put into words how devastated our daughter would be if the school was to close.  \n\"She loves coming to school and the thought the school might close and she might have to go to another school, quite possibly the school she left previously, is a massive concern to us.\" \nPowys council is run by a coalition of independent and Conservative councillors.\nPhyl Davies, cabinet member for education, said the council's education strategy would \"help transform the learner experience\" and address the \"significant challenges facing our education in Powys\".\n\"These challenges include a high proportion of small schools in the county, decreasing pupil numbers, high number of surplus places, inequality in access to Welsh-medium education, limited post-14 and post-16 offer and inequality in access to special education needs, additional learning needs provision,\" he said.\n\"We want the best for all our learners and I believe that this strategy will see us deliver a legacy that will allow learners to thrive and reach their potential and compete with the rest of the world.\"\nRussell George, Conservative Member of the Senedd for Montgomeryshire, said the Welsh government must ensure \"appropriate funding\" went to councils.\n\"If there's going to be a difficulty in delivering the curriculum and the Welsh government aren't appropriately funding schools and local authorities to deliver that curriculum, then the council's got very little choice but to look at altering the way they configure education and having to close smaller schools.\"\nA Welsh government spokesman said it had taken \"a number of actions\" to help give children in rural and remote areas \"the best start to their educational journey\".\nHe added: \"In recognition of the challenges small and rural schools can face, we also introduced a Small and Rural Schools grant - worth \u00a32.5m per year - which provides funding to encourage innovation, support greater school-to-school working and raise standards.\""

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson,Conservative Party Conference",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has promised to \"get on with the job\" of uniting and levelling up the UK, in a speech to the Conservative Party conference.\nIn an upbeat address peppered with jokes, but light on new policy, the prime minister claimed a high-wage, high-skilled economy was being created in the wake of Brexit and the pandemic.\nHe also defended tax rises to pay for the NHS and vowed to fix social care.\nThe 45-minute speech was his first to a conference since the pandemic began.\nIn it, the prime minister said the overwhelming Conservative general election victory in 2019 placed an onus on his government to deliver change demanded by voters.\nThe main theme of his speech was \"levelling up\", with the PM saying that reducing gaps between regions would ease pressure on south-eastern England, while boosting places that felt left behind.\nHe also repeated pledges set out at during his party's conference this week in Manchester to crack down on crime, improve transport links and broadband, and reform the housing market.\nAnd he sought to reassure Tories anxious about plans to increase National Insurance to pay for the NHS and social care by claiming it was what predecessor Margaret Thatcher would have done, if the economy had been hit by a \"meteorite\" like the pandemic.\n\"She would have wagged her finger and said that more borrowing now is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes later,\" he said. \nBoris Johnson is an optimist. \nThe prime minister wants a new economic model with better pay and conditions. He wants to persuade voters his is the party to distribute wealth and opportunity more evenly across the UK. He wants people to feel good about the future.\nLevelling up has been the slogan repeated by ministers at this conference. We only got a sliver of meat on the bones today. This was a speech thin on policy, big on jokes and rhetorical flourishes. \nConservatives love Mr Johnson because he makes them feel good - it's a strategy that is key to understanding his success as a politician. \nBut will it be enough? There are some difficult months ahead for many people. \nRising prices, supply chain issues, the end of the universal credit top-up and furlough. \nMany Conservatives acknowledge the cost of living squeeze - and are worried about the impact. \nCritics will accuse the prime minister of ignoring those big issues in favour of what they see as vague promises for the future. \nBut the hope in Manchester was that Boris Johnson's unflinchingly upbeat vision of a post-Brexit, post-pandemic Britain is as popular with voters as it is with Tory activists.\nThe Conservative conference has taken place amid concerns over rising inflation, supply chain problems, and petrol and worker shortages.\nBut Mr Johnson insisted that the present problems were the result of an economic rebound in the wake of Covid shutdowns.\nHe added that controls on immigration represented the \"change that people voted for\" in the 2016 Brexit referendum, while also promising to end declining home ownership among young people by building more housing. \nHe announced a \u00a33,000-a-year bonus for teachers, as an incentive for struggling areas of England to recruit maths and science specialists. The policy replaces a similar nationwide scheme that has recently been phased out. \nDowning Street said the new \"levelling up premium\" would cost \u00a360m, but no details have yet been given over which areas will qualify. \n\"There is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"You will find talent, genius, flair, imagination, enthusiasm - all of them evenly distributed around this country. But opportunity is not.\"\nMr Johnson referred to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who was recently photographed dancing in an Aberdeen nightclub, as \"Jon Bon Govi\" - an allusion to the rock star Jon Bon Jovi.\nHe also mocked Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he has frequently dubbed \"Captain Hindsight\".\n\"If Columbus had listened to Captain Hindsight, he'd be famous for discovering Tenerife,\" he joked.\nBut Sir Keir accused Mr Johnson of \"playing this game where he's pretending that he's just sort of just landed from the Moon and he's looking around and saying, 'Things look pretty awful around here, we need a bit of levelling up, things are so awful'\".\nHe told ITV's Peston programme: \"He and the Tories have been in government for 11 years, so we're in this state because of the way that they have governed the country.\"\nThe CBI business lobby group said Mr Johnson said set out a \"compelling vision\" but had so far \"only stated his ambition\" on raising wages. \nShevaun Haviland, who heads the British Chambers of Commerce, said firms supported the aim of a higher-wage, higher-skill economy but warned: \"This will not happen overnight.\""

      "text": "Campaigners who lost loved ones in the pandemic say they have had an \"incredibly positive\" meeting with the first minister over their call for a Wales-specific public inquiry.\nMembers of Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru were invited to the meeting by Mark Drakeford.\nThey also discussed topics such as care home deaths and hospital infections.\nThe Welsh government said the families agreed to meet Mr Drakeford again and it was the start of \"ongoing dialogue\".\nGroup founder Anna-Louise Marsh-Rees believes Wales' handling of the coronavirus pandemic should not be a \"footnote\" in a UK-wide inquiry. But Mr Drakeford has previously said he was \"not in favour of rival inquiries\".\nAfter the meeting, Ms Marsh-Rees said it had gone \"really, really well\", and was \"very productive\".\n\"He spent an hour and a half with us. It was incredibly positive. The key thing for him now is to get a response to the letter he wrote to [UK cabinet minister] Michael Gove about the shape of the inquiry.\n\"The next milestone in his decision-making will be regarding when the chair [of the UK inquiry] is appointed and how involved Wales will be in that decision-making. He listened and was quite emotional.\"\nGroup members said they had given Mr Drakeford \"a tough time\" and \"we didn't let him off the hook\". They said this was \"the beginning of the dialogue\", and he had given them \"confidence\".\nMs Marsh-Rees said: \"It was a very productive meeting and we were properly listened to.\" \nA second meeting with Mr Drakeford will be held before Christmas.\nMs Marsh-Rees lost her father Ian to Covid last October after he was admitted to Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, for a gall bladder infection.\nShe previously said it was \"awful\" to watch her father, who had been shielding at home for months to protect himself, \"die gasping for breath\". \nShe believes he caught the virus while in hospital and began campaigning for an inquiry after not being satisfied with answers from the health board.\nNearly a quarter of people who have died with Covid-19 in Wales were infected in hospital.\nThe Welsh government has previously stated a UK-wide inquiry was the best option for understanding the experiences of people in Wales.\nBut Ms Marsh-Rees said, because the pandemic had raised questions about health and social care, Wales should have its own inquiry because that is where those types of decision were made.\n\"We basically want what Scotland is doing - a judge-led inquiry and a human rights-based inquiry,\" she added.\nThe Scottish government has confirmed it will hold its own inquiry into the pandemic, despite First Minister Nicola Sturgeon previously stating her preference was for it to be UK-wide.\nMs Sturgeon said that inquiry would look at \"all matters related to the handling of the pandemic that are within our devolved competence\".\nThe Welsh government spokesperson said Mr Drakeford had thanked the families for being \"open and honest\" in the meeting.\n\"The first minister welcomed the opportunity to meet the families and to listen to their concerns and experiences,\" they said.\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the Welsh government had \"no excuse\" not to follow suit.\n\"We need to look at what happened in detail, and in public, to learns lessons for the future,\" he said. \nHowever, Prof Hugh Pennington, who chaired Wales' E. coli inquiry in 2005, has warned that a Wales-specific probe would lead to \"an enormous degree of overlap\".\nProf Pennington said focusing solely on decision-making in Wales could result in \"ignoring important information\". \nHe also argued that a Welsh inquiry would have more limited powers to make people give evidence."

      "tags": "Abortion,Women,Texas,US abortion debate,United States",
      "text": "A US judge has temporarily blocked a new law in Texas that effectively bans women from having an abortion.\nDistrict Judge Robert Pitman granted a request by the Biden administration to prevent any enforcement of the law while its legality is being challenged.\nThe law, which prohibits women in Texas from obtaining an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, was drafted and approved by Republican politicians.\nThe White House praised the latest ruling as an important step.\n\"The fight has only just begun, both in Texas and in many states across this country where women's rights are currently under attack,\" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.\nTexan officials immediately appealed against the ruling, setting the stage for further court battles.\nJudge Pitman, of Austin, wrote in an 113-page opinion that, from the moment the law came into effect on 1 September, \"women have been unlawfully prevented from exercising control over their lives in ways that are protected by the Constitution\". \n\"This court will not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right,\" he said on Wednesday.\nWhole Woman's Health, which runs a number of clinics in Texas, said it was making plans to resume abortions \"as soon as possible\".\nBut the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, accused judges of \"catering to the abortion industry\" and called for a \"fair hearing\" at the next stage.\nThis is the first legal setback for Texas since the law was implemented.\nPresident Joe Biden's administration took legal action after the conservative-majority Supreme Court declined to prevent Texas from enacting the law. The justice department filed an emergency motion to block enforcement of the law while it pursues legal action.\nMr Biden, a Democrat, has described the law as an \"unprecedented assault\" on women's rights, but Texas Governor Greg Abbott has defended it, saying: \"The most precious freedom is life itself.\"\nThe \"Heartbeat Act\" bans terminations after the detection of what anti-abortion campaigners call a foetal heartbeat, something medical authorities say is misleading. This effectively bans abortions from as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, at a time when most women will not be aware they are pregnant. \nIt is enforced by giving any individual - from Texas or elsewhere - the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week point. However, it does not allow the women who get the procedure to be sued.\nOne doctor who admitted breaking the state's new abortion legislation has already been sued.\nWriting for the Washington Post, Dr Alan Braid said he \"acted because I had a duty of care to this patient, as I do for all patients, and because she has a fundamental right to receive this care\".\nDespite the injunction, some clinics remain hesitant to resume procedures as there is some uncertainty over whether they could be sued retroactively during the ban.\nThe law itself includes a provision that stipulates clinics and doctors may still be liable for abortions carried out while an emergency injunction is in place, legal experts say. \nBut whether that provision will be enforceable is unclear, and Judge Pitman said in his ruling that it was \"of questionable legality\".\n\"The threat of being sued retroactively will not be completely gone until [the law] is struck down for good,\" Nancy Northup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement."

South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham called the move \"a complete capitulation\". \nUS lawmakers will still have to address this issue near the new December deadline to avert a default.\nIf the US defaults on debts, experts say it will severely hurt the country's credit rating, plunge the global financial system into turmoil, and possibly lead to a self-inflicted recession.\nThe US government spends more money than it collects in taxes, so it borrows to make up for the shortfall.\nBorrowing is done via the US Treasury, through the issuing of bonds. US government bonds are seen as among the world's safest and most reliable investments.\nIn 1939, Congress established an aggregate limit or \"ceiling\" on how much debt the government could accumulate.\nThe ceiling has been lifted on more than 100 occasions to allow the government to borrow more. Congress often acts on it in a bipartisan manner and it is rarely the subject of a political standoff.\nBut some Republicans have voiced frustration about new Democrat spending proposals.\nDemocrats have pointed out that raising the debt ceiling is about paying off existing obligations rather than paying for new ones, and that President Biden's policies have only contributed to 3% of existing debts."

      "text": "Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the last decade, a study has shown.\nThat reduction though is not happening quickly enough to meet a key national target, according to scientists. \nThe aim is to reduce the environmental impact of our diets.\nThis goal, set by the National Food Strategy, is based on a review of the whole UK food system - from farming and production to hunger and sustainability. \nIt recommends meat consumption in the UK fall by 30% over the next 10 years.\n\"We now know we need a more substantial reduction,\" said lead researcher Cristina Stewart from the University of Oxford. \nThe new study, published in the journal the Lancet Planetary Health, revealed that while most people are eating less red and processed meat compared to a decade ago, they are eating more white meat. \nHigh consumption of red and processed meat can increase the risk of health problems including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even certain cancers. \nMeat production also has a higher environmental impact - producing more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions - than other types of agriculture and food production. \nThis Oxford-based research team used data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey - a detailed survey of the dietary habits of more than 15,000 people across the country.  \nThis showed that daily meat consumption had reduced by about 17g per person per day. \nWhat it did not reveal was the reason people were changing their diets. But market research in 2019 suggested that almost 40% of meat-eaters were actively trying to reduce their consumption, with many citing either health or environmental reasons. \nDr Stewart stresses that, for those who want to reduce the environmental impact of what they eat, \"any reduction in meat will have an impact\". \n\"You don't have to be vegetarian,\" she said. \"Although, in general, meat-free dishes will have a lower impact. \n\"But if you're someone that eats meat every day, reducing your meat consumption by 30% just looks like having two meat-free days per week.\" \nThere is huge variation in the environmental impact of meat; it depends on what livestock are fed and where and how the meat is produced. \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\n\"Locally produced meat has a much lower impact than meat that has been imported,\" Dr Stewart pointed out.  \nShe and her colleagues have also been studying the effect of \"environmental impact labelling\" on consumer choices. They have designed experimental labels that score a product based on its greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, water-use and water pollution. \n\"When you don't have the information about environmental impact of food, it's really hard to shop with that in mind,\" she pointed out. \nHaving the support of those we eat our meals with, the Oxford researchers say, makes it easier for us to change our diets. And the availability and prominence of meat-free food options has an effect on people's food choices, too. \n\"So, for example, if you're at a restaurant, you often see a vegetarian options 'box of shame' at the bottom of the menu rather than at the top with chef's specials,\" Dr Stewart explained.\nThe team's ongoing study of what drives people to reduce their meat consumption has revealed some simple strategies that participants have found helpful, including: \n\"Hopefully this paper will help us understand the patterns and trends so we can tailor public health policies and behavioural nudges to help people choose more sustainable options,\" said Dr Stewart. \nHear Idris and Sabrina Elba discuss the impact on the planet of what we eat on the What Planet Are We On podcast on BBC Sounds\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "text": "The number of countries on the UK Covid travel red list will be cut from 54 to seven, the government says.\nSouth Africa, Brazil and Mexico come off the red list, which requires travellers to quarantine in an approved hotel at their cost for 10 full days.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the changes begin on Monday and \"mark the next step\" in opening travel.\nThis latest move will be seen as a boost to the airline industry and families separated during the pandemic.\nPanama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Haiti and the Dominican Republic remain on the red list.\nPandemic travel rules in the UK have recently been simplified, with the amber list cut, and advice against holidays changed for 32 countries.\nBut consumer group Which? warned the changes only reflect requirements for arriving back in the UK. \n\"Travellers should be aware that they may still face restrictions on entry to many destinations, especially those under 18 who are not yet vaccinated,\" it said.\nArrivals from 37 more destinations will have their vaccination status certificates recognised, meaning they can avoid more expensive post-arrival testing requirements.\nVaccinated travellers from Brazil, Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Turkey will be treated the same as returning fully-vaccinated UK residents so long as they have not visited a red-list country in the 10 days before arriving in England.\nAll arrivals will still complete a passenger locator form.\nThe Scottish government said the changes were \"agreed on a four-nation basis\".\nThe Welsh government said that they increased opportunities for new infections and variants, but it was adopting them because it was not practical to have its own border policy.\nFor British expats Matt and Hannah Pirnie, who have lived in South Africa for a decade, the country's removal from the red list will mean it is easier to see family again.\n\"It's been a long pandemic for us. Not seeing family, not being allowed to go back, but more importantly grandparents not being able to come here and see their grandkids. It's been a long two years,\" Matt says.\n\"First of all when all the aeroplanes stopped initially - that was quite anxiety provoking - and then to be put on the red list for so long has just been quite hard to wrap your head around why,\" Hannah adds.\n\"Taking three children into a prison-like mentality was just a no-go, plus the cost. It's been quite hard really.\"\nAnnouncing the latest changes, Mr Shapps said the government was \"making it easier for families and loved ones to reunite\".\nHe said that with fewer restrictions \"and more people travelling, we can all continue to move safely forward together along our pathway to recovery\".\nIn addition to the shorter red list, the government said passengers would soon be able to use a photograph of a lateral flow test as a minimum requirement to verify a negative result.\nThis change - affecting tests taken by eligible fully-vaccinated people from non-red list countries two days after arrival in England - would come into effect in \"late October\", the Department for Transport (DfT) said.\nA UK government source said the government still aimed to replace the so-called day two \"PCR test on arrival\" with a cheaper lateral flow test by the half-term break, for many schools in England after 22 October.\nBut they said the government was still working on a date for when the new testing rule would be introduced. \nUnder current rules, travellers must use more expensive PCR tests for their post-arrival day two screening. People who are not fully vaccinated must provide a further PCR test on day eight.\nThe DfT said NHS lateral flow devices cannot be used for the purpose of international travel. \"Both pre-departure tests and on arrival tests must be bought from private providers,\" it said.\nAirlines and the travel industry praised a \"much-improved system\" but called on ministers to implement changes to testing as soon as possible and consider scrapping tests for passengers arriving from low-risk countries.\nA spokesperson for London's Heathrow Airport said the announced changes would \"kick start a global Britain\". \n\"However, the missing piece to this is clarity on when cheaper lateral flow tests will be accepted, which is now critical in order to save the half-term getaway for many,\" they said.\nA further 40,701 new coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Thursday, alongside another 122 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nThe following destinations will be removed from the red list from 04:00 BST on Monday:\nAfghanistan, Angola, Argentina, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Burundi, Cape Verde, Chile, Congo (Democratic Republic), Costa Rica, Cuba. Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, French Guiana, Georgia, Guyana, Indonesia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mayotte, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Paraguay, Philippines, R\u00e9union, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\nSource: Department for Transport"

      "tags": "Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Bulb",
      "text": "Together Energy is the latest UK supplier to collapse due to rising gas prices. \nTwenty-eight energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August, including Bulb, which is being managed separately because of its size. \nMore than three million customers have seen their energy firm collapse since the summer, though most suppliers are tiny compared to Bulb. \nOfgem said a new supplier will be found for Together Energy's 176,000 domestic customers, whose supply will continue without interruption. \nThe other companies which have already gone out of business are: \nAmpoweruk Ltd, Avro, Bluegreen, CNG Energy Limited, Colorado Energy, Daligas, Enstroga, Entice, Goto, Green, Hub, Igloo Energy, MA Energy Limited, Money Plus, Neon Reef, Omni Energy Limited, Orbit Energy, People's Energy, PFP, Pure Planet, Social Energy Supply, Symbio Energy, Utility Point, Zebra Power Limited and Zog Energy.  \nFirms have struggled because they offered customers cheap fixed deals. That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices.\nIf your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. \nBecause of its size, Bulb has been put into an arrangement called \"special administration\". \nThe company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it means Bulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything. \nThe accounts held by the other failed firms are automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.\nYou can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff.\nOfgem has sent customers to the following suppliers: \nOfgem and Citizens Advice both recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch.\nThere's no need to cancel direct debits.\nIf you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks.\nIf you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business.   \nIt's unlikely. \nUsually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. \nBut at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nThose coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs.\nA tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust says simple changes to our homes and energy habits could help offset the current price rises.\nThe price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months.\nIt's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases.\nAbout 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland saw a 12% rise in their energy bills on 1 October, when a higher price cap took effect.\nOfgem has now said it will review how the price cap is calculated to make sure it accurately reflects the risks faced by companies. \nIt will publish its conclusions in February, and a new price cap will be announced before it is implemented in April 2022.\nIn Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, a number of suppliers have also announced price increases in recent months.\nA worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies has meant gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia have risen dramatically. \nSupplies of renewable energy in Great Britain were also reduced by the least windy summer since 1961. \nA fire at a National Grid site in Kent closed a power cable supplying electricity from France. \nRising gas prices also led to a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is widely used in the food and drink industry."

It was for him, and for me, his mother and sister.\n\"He was screaming, crying, punching the walls, and locking himself in his room for days on end.\"\nA statement from Mr Beynon's girlfriend Victoria Key, who has since died, was also read out.\nIn it, she said he began acting strangely a couple of days before he died, saying he saw the devil in people, as well as their dog.\nThe inquest continues."

      "text": "Council tax in England could rise by as much as \u00a3220 per year within three years, researchers have said.\nThis is to keep local services running and help pay for social care reforms, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank said.\nIt comes amid warnings that councils continue to face severe funding pressures due to the pandemic and must find new sources of income.\nThe government said it had given them \u00a312bn since the start of the crisis.\nUnder current government spending plans, council tax bills will need to rise by at least 3.6% a year just to keep services running at pre-pandemic levels, the IFS said.\nThat would mean bills would have to rise by \u00a3160 by 2024-25, it said.\nBut extra cost pressures that eat into central government grants could easily push up council tax by 5% a year, or \u00a3220 by 2024-25, it said.\nIn addition, the government's plans for social care, which include capping costs, won't be completely paid for by a planned rise in National Insurance contributions, the IFS said.\nThe plans are likely to cost \u00a35bn per year eventually, it said, nearly three times the funding currently allocated.\nThe government has made much of the idea that after decades of governments neglecting the increasingly pressing issue of underfunded social care, this was a nettle it was determined to grasp.\nWhat's concerning in the IFS report is who might get stung. \nA large part of the goal of the social care reforms was to address unfairness in the means-testing system.\nBut the IFS report highlights the risk that, without further funding, it could create new unfairness elsewhere.\nTo extend publicly-funded care to those who've spent \u00a386,000 of their own money on fees will cost extra, and local authorities may only be able to recoup that by tightening eligibility criteria - so many poorer people lose access.  \nSecond, the way the funds are allocated to local authorities dates back to 2013.\nBecause some areas like Blackpool have seen their populations fall, but others, like Tower Hamlets have seen them jump since then, the risk is that the money won't go where it needs to.\nIFS research economist Kate Ogden said: \"The government has stepped up with billions in additional funding for councils to support them through the last 18 months.\n\"It is likely to have to find billions more for councils over the next couple of years if they are to avoid cutting back on services, even if they increase council tax by 4% a year or more.\"\nShe said that the coming financial year is \"likely to be especially tough\", with ongoing Covid-19-related pressures and squeezes on budgets\nShe added that the local government funding system was \"hopelessly out of date\", being based on 2013 population levels, leading to \"unfairness\" in the distribution of resources between councils.\nCouncil tax goes towards funding local services such as policing, the fire service and street cleaning. The funding is topped up with grants from central government and business taxes.\nHowever, these central government grants were slashed between 2009-10 and 2019-20, especially in areas such as public transport, housing and planning.\nThe Local Government Association said councils \"continue to face severe funding and demand pressures that will stretch the local services our communities rely on to the limit\".\n\"The significant financial pressures facing local services cannot be met by council tax income alone,\" said LGA chairman James Jamieson. \"Councils are particularly alarmed that the government's solution for tackling social care's core existing pressures appears to be solely through the use of council tax, and the social care precept.\"\nMr Jamieson called for local services to be \"the top priority\" in the upcoming Spending Review.\nA government spokesperson said: \"The government has allocated more than \u00a312bn directly to councils since the start of the pandemic - with more than \u00a36bn available to spend as they see fit - recognising that councils are best placed to deal with local issues.  \n\"We have also taken historic action to fix the social care crisis - the Health and Social Care Levy will raise \u00a312bn a year to fund the NHS and social care. \n\"The Spending Review will continue to focus on supporting jobs and delivering the public's key priorities.\""

It said that rather than implementing the committee's recommendations from its first report a year ago - the government \"refused to act on nearly all of them\".\nCommittee chair Catherine McKinnell said: \"We have continued to receive petitions highlighting the difficulties new parents, and the services they rely on during the vital early months of their child's life, have continued to face over the last year. \n\"It is clear that the impact of the pandemic is still being felt.\n\"The government must now reconsider its response and urgently take action to put in place support.\"\nShe said it was particularly concerning that no extra funds had been made available to help new parents with mental health issues.\nShe added: \"It has been incredibly valuable to hear from petitioners and experts on this subject, and the committee will continue to challenge the government to bring forward the changes we have concluded need to be made.\" \nThe committee report calls for:\nThe committee also sought the views of 8,700 new parents and childcare providers.\nThe vast majority of respondents, 93%, said they had not been able to access crucial baby and toddler groups over the past year.\nAnd three-quarters said they had not been able to find childcare they could afford.  \nStacey, a mum from Kent, struggled when health visitor appointments for her newborn baby were mainly held online during lockdown.\nShe had one appointment on the phone but says: \"That level of support I think is severely diminished because you can't physically be there. What if it then leads to problems?\"\nSpeaking to BBC Newsbeat, she said: \"All of that on top of new mum stress and figuring out this baby who you thought you knew and at every step changes. That was really difficult.\" \nStacey thinks there should have been more support for young mums including seminars online to watch if there is a problem, but says they're still not widely available.\n\"It's like they haven't learnt from those past 18 months, how difficult it is.\"\nRos Bragg, director of charity Maternity Action, commented: \"The situation for new and expectant mothers is really quite desperate in the aftermath of Covid. \n\"It's clear from the Petitions Committee report that this group has been disproportionately affected by the fallout from the pandemic - but the government has consistently failed to act.\n\"Our helplines are struggling to cope with the volume of calls from pregnant women and new mothers facing unfair redundancies, as maternity discrimination continues to increase sharply.\"\nNeil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance which represents childcare providers, says the committee is right to call for a review into early years funding. \n\"Substantial further investment into the early years is needed to ensure that providers can deliver affordable, accessible - and crucially, sustainable - early care and education,\" he said.\n\"If the government is truly committed to helping families recover from the impact of Covid-19, it must ensure that this includes helping parents of babies and young children to access the services and support they need.\"\nA government spokesperson said: \"We recognise the challenges faced by new parents during the pandemic, which is why we have increased support for them.  \n\"This includes expanding specialist mental-health services, making an unprecedented investment in childcare, and introducing parental bereavement leave.  \n\"We will respond to the committee's recommendations in full in due course.\""

      "tags": "Travel,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "New simplified travel rules have come into force in the UK, with the traffic light system replaced by a single red list. \nMost fully vaccinated travellers arriving from non-red list countries will no longer have to take a test before setting off for the UK.\nAirlines UK said it would make travelling abroad easier and cheaper.\nBut those coming from red list destinations must still pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. \nUnder the changes, which came into force at 04:00 BST, the green and amber lists have been scrapped. \nTesting rules are also being eased for people travelling from non-red list destinations who have been vaccinated in the UK, the EU, the US, or any of 18 other recognised countries. \nAnyone under 18 who is resident in those countries can also travel to the UK without testing.\nThese groups were already able to avoid self-isolating on their arrival back in the UK. \nAll travellers - except children under five years old - will still have to pay for a PCR test two days after arrival. \nPeople who are not fully vaccinated will need a pre-departure test and a PCR test on days two and eight after they return, and must self-isolate for 10 days at home. \nAnd those arriving from red list countries, including Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines and South Africa, must quarantine for 10 days in a government-approved hotel, at a cost of \u00a32,285 for one adult. Only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, are allowed to enter the UK if they have been in a red country in the previous 10 days. \nThe red list is due to be updated later this week. \nThe government may also announce additions to the list of countries whose vaccination certificates are recognised by the UK. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"We are accelerating towards a future where travel continues to reopen safely and remains open for good, and today's rule changes are good news for families, businesses and the travel sector.\n\"Our priority remains to protect public health but, with more than eight in 10 people now fully vaccinated, we are able to take these steps to lower the cost of testing and help the sector to continue in its recovery.\"\nThere was a surge in holiday bookings after the government announced the changes last month and the travel sector has welcomed the move.\nThe industry previously criticised the government for being too slow to ease and simplify rules on testing and quarantine. \nFrom later in October, the government has said fully vaccinated people coming to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival and can take a cheaper lateral flow test instead. \nNo date has been set for this change but ministers are aiming to have it in place for the half-term school break. \nSo far, no other UK nation has followed suit. \nScotland has said it will \"align with the UK post-arrival testing regime\" but has not announced further details. The Welsh government said it had \"concerns\" about easing its testing regime. \nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents UK carriers, said: \"Things are moving in the right direction and the removal of these restrictions will make it easier and cheaper for people to travel.\"\nHowever, he said the UK remained \"an outlier on arrivals testing for vaccinated passengers\".\nAirlines UK hopes to see more countries removed from the red list at the next update and further mutual recognition of vaccine status for those jabbed in other countries, he added. \nWillie Walsh, head of industry body the International Air Transport Association, welcomed the change as a \"positive step\", saying the government's testing and quarantine restrictions had been both unscientific and costly. \n\"People have been led to believe that the risk is people flying into the country. The risk was inside the country,\" he said. \nAlan French, chief executive at Thomas Cook, said more options would now be available for travellers. \n\"They will be more confident if they book the holiday, they can travel safely there and be able to return in a transparent way, which is something they've not been able to do,\" he said. \nMr French said since the government announced the changes, three weeks ago, his company had seen bookings more than double.  \nThe UK recorded 30,439 cases on Sunday, with the total number of cases in the past seven days up one per cent on the previous week. \nHowever, the number of Covid deaths and hospital admissions are falling, with 43 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported on Sunday.\nHow will the new system affect you?

      "text": "Daniel Craig has capped the launch week of his final James Bond movie by becoming the 2,704th celebrity to be honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in California.\nIt was unveiled outside 7007 Hollywood Boulevard, in honour of the fictional British spy's code number.\nJust yards away is the star of his predecessor as Bond, Sir Roger Moore.\nCraig, who has played 007 since 2006, said it was an \"absolute honour to be walked all over in Hollywood\".\nThe 53-year-old was introduced by Bond producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, along with his co-star in the latest 007 outing No Time To Die, Rami Malek.\nBefore his star was unveiled, Craig said: \"To Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, I thank you from the depth of my heart, without you I would not be here today - thank you for those lovely words. Thank you to Rami for those beautiful, beautiful words.\n\"I never thought I would hear myself say this, but it's an absolute honour to be walked all over in Hollywood.\"\nNo Time To Die won critical praise and earned the highest opening weekend takings of any Bond movie in the UK - after repeated delays to its release date because of the coronavirus pandemic. The film opens in the US on Friday.\nCraig said: \"If happiness was measured by the company we keep, then me being on this pavement surrounded by all of these legends makes me a very, very, very happy man. So thank you very much.\"\nMalek, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Queen singer Freddy Mercury in the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, plays supervillain Safin in the latest instalment of Bond's adventures.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, he praised Craig as an actor and a colleague.\n\"We all know he's a superb actor, he's dedicated, he can handle all his own stunts with one hand tied behind his back and the other holding a Negroni,\" Malek said.\n\"But he's as fastidious about his craft as he is about his empathy for everyone around him.\n\"He has this ability to hold these two potentially opposing things at the same time - an incredible amount of talent and responsibility and an incredible warmth and acute awareness of what those around him need.\"\nCraig also joins fellow Bond actors Pierce Brosnan, David Niven and Barry Nelson on the Walk of Fame, although the late Sir Sean Connery does not have a star. \nNiven played Bond in a 1967 version of Casino Royale, a send-up of the spy films, which sees his peacefully retired 007 dragged back into action. Barry Nelson was the first actor to play James Bond on screen in a one-hour TV adaptation of Casino Royale in 1954.\nAnti-vaccine demonstrators also attended the ceremony, to protest against Los Angeles passing one of the strictest vaccine mandates in the US.\nStars on the Walk of Fame are awarded each year by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, chosen from hundreds of applications.\nRecipients also pay a sponsorship fee of $50,000, which pays for the creation and installation of their star, along with the maintenance of the entire attraction."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

Any proposals must be subject to genuine negotiation and the commission mustn't take a 'take it or leave it' approach.\n \"If solutions cannot be agreed soon, we will need to act using the Article 16 safeguard mechanism to address the disruption that the protocol is causing on the ground\".\nTriggering Article 16 would suspend part of the protocol.\nSpeaking to the BBC in Brussels, United States national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned the British government that suspending the protocol would be a \"serious risk to stability\". \nHe said any possibility of a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was \"of serious concern to the United States\".\nMr Sullivan said both the UK and the EU should work together \"in a constructive way to find a deal and a way forward\".\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - had warned that it may quit Stormont if its demands over the protocol were not met.\nSpeaking on Thursday, the DUP leader said he was \"pleased\" that the EU was to table new proposals, adding that he believed pressure from unionists had \"opened up the protocol\". \n\"We were told weeks ago that the EU were not in a position where they were ever going to reopen negotiations, so I think we've breached the first wall,\" Sir Jeffrey said. \n\"And I think that is the result of unionists standing together and saying: 'Look, we cannot support this protocol; we cannot support an Irish Sea border'.\"\nThe DUP leader added: \"I think the pressure we have brought to bear and the steps that have been taken in the last few weeks have focused minds both in London and Brussels and I'm pleased that we've made this level of progress, but we still have a long way to go.\"\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the EU was going to \"enormous lengths\". \n\"I believe the package of practical solutions that we are putting on the table would be attractive for Northern Ireland and would be, I hope, supported by a majority of stakeholders in Northern Ireland,\" he told the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) in Dublin. \nHe said the commitment of the EU to the Good Friday Agreement was \"absolute\" and that the avoidance of a hard border on the island was a \"prerequisite\".\nEarlier this week UK Brexit Minister Lord Frost said he was expecting a short, intense negotiation with the EU.\nHe told the Conservative party conference that the protocol was \"not working and needs to change\".\nIn July, Lord Frost put forward radical proposals for changes to the protocol.\nTriggering Article 16, may end up as \"the only way\" forward, he warned.\nMr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said threats to trigger Article 16 were not helpful.\nHe said his proposals were not presented on a \"take it or leave it\" basis and that both the UK and EU would need to get out of their comfort zones.

      "tags": "Germany,World War Two",
      "text": "Seventy-six years after the end of World War Two, a former concentration camp guard has gone on trial for assisting in the murder of 3,518 prisoners at Sachsenhausen near Berlin.\nJosef S is accused of complicity in the shooting of Soviet prisoners of war and the murder of others with Zyklon B gas.\nTime is running out for Nazi-era criminals to face justice and he is the oldest defendant so far to stand trial.\nIt was only in recent years that lower-ranking Nazis were brought to trial.\nTen years ago, the conviction of former SS guard John Demjanjuk set a precedent enabling prosecutors to charge people for aiding and abetting Nazi crimes in World War Two. Until then, direct participation in murder had to be proven.\nIdentified as Josef S, because of German privacy laws, the defendant was led into a specially adapted sports hall at a prison in Brandenburg an der Havel, where the trial began amid strict security. \nHe arrived outside the court in a wheelchair, clutching a briefcase, and entered with the aid of a walking frame. He shielded his face with a blue file to stop photographers getting a view.\nJosef S has lived in the Brandenburg area for years, reportedly as a locksmith, and has not spoken publicly about the trial.\nHis lawyer, Stefan Waterkamp, told the court that the defendant would make no comment at the trial on the allegations against him. He would, however, speak about his personal circumstances at Friday's hearing.\nJosef S was 21 when he first became a guard at Sachsenhausen in 1942. Now almost 101, he is considered able to appear in court for up to two and half hours a day. The trial is due to continue until January.\nPublic prosecutor Cyrill Klement told the court of the systematic killings at Sachsenhausen between 1941 and 1945. \"The defendant supported this knowingly and willingly - at least by conscientiously carrying out guard duty, which was perfectly integrated into the killing regime.\" \nTens of thousands of people died at the camp in Oranienburg, north of Berlin, including resistance fighters, Jews, political opponents, homosexuals and prisoners of war. \nA gas chamber was installed at Sachsenhausen in 1943 and 3,000 people were massacred at the camp as the war drew to a close because they were \"unfit to march\". The prosecutor gave details of mass shootings and murders by gas, as well as through disease and exhaustion.\nThursday's trial was especially important for 17 co-plaintiffs, who include survivors of Sachsenhausen.\nChristoffel Heijer was six years old when he last saw his father: Johan Hendrik Heijer was one of 71 Dutch resistance fighters shot dead at the camp.\n\"Murder isn't destiny; it's not a crime that can be legally erased by time,\" he told Berliner Zeitung.\nLeon Schwarzenbaum, who is a 100-year-old survivor of Sachsenhausen, said this was the \"last trial for my friends and acquaintances and my loved ones who were murdered\" and he hoped it would end in a final conviction.\nThere was widespread frustration at Josef S's refusal to give evidence.\n\"For the survivors this is yet another rejection, just like it was in the camp. You were vermin,\" said Christoph Heubner of the International Auschwitz Committee. \nThomas Walther, the lawyer acting for the co-plaintiffs, said he was not surprised but hoped he would change his mind.\nMost Nazi camp guards will not face trial. \nThere were 3,000 guards at Stutthof concentration camp alone, and only 50 were convicted. Bruno Dey was convicted of complicity in mass murder there last year and given a suspended sentence,\nOnly last week, a Nazi secretary at the Stutthof camp, Irmgard Furchner, was due to go on trial north of Hamburg but escaped from a nursing home hours beforehand.\nShe was eventually caught in Hamburg and her trial was rescheduled for 19 October. She was released from custody earlier this week."

      "tags": "Companies,Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "High energy costs are forcing manufacturers to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers.\nIceland boss Richard Walker said higher energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now \"inevitable\".\nThe warning came as analysts predicted that household energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds next year.\nThey said the energy price cap, which protects domestic consumers, could soar by \u00a3400 in the spring.\nCornwall Insight forecasts that the energy price cap will rise to about \u00a31,660 by next summer.\nThat is about 30% higher than the record \u00a31,277 level for the cap set for winter 2021-22, which began at the start of October.\n\"With wholesale gas and electricity prices continuing to reach new records, successive supplier exits during September 2021 and a new level for the default tariff cap, the Great British energy market remains on edge for fresh volatility and further consolidation,\" said Craig Lowrey, senior consultant at Cornwall Insight.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem said the price cap \"will ensure that consumers don't pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter\".\nBut if gas prices stay high, the price cap will rise, Ofgem said.\nThe regulator said its \"number one priority is to protect customers\", but acknowledged \"this is a worrying time for many people\". \nBut while the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices.\nMr Walker warned that Iceland's energy bill would go up by \u00a320m next year. Alongside higher salaries to address lorry driver shortages and other new costs, he said grocery prices would have to increase.\n\"It's inevitable that we will see price rises,\" he told the BBC. \"The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world. \n\"Our margins are very very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases.\"\nAndrew Large, director general of the Confederation of Paper Industries, said: \"This is a highly inflationary situation for the British economy and members will clearly be in a position where they do try to pass those costs on to consumers where they can.\"\nOne paper manufacturer, the Northwood Group, said the industry had been \"left to fend for itself\" in the face of \"horrendous\" knock-on effects from the gas price rise.\n\"The spike [in gas prices] that we have seen since January is equivalent to a 550% price increase, which of course destroys any industrial planning,\" said chairman Paul Fecher.\nLaura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, said many of her member firms could even be forced to stop production \"due to uneconomic higher energy costs\".\nThis could cause \"severe damage\" to production facilities such as brick kilns, which could not easily be turned off at short notice, she said.\nMeanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said that by decarbonising the UK's power supply, the country will protect customers from volatile fossil fuel prices.\n\"The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,\" he told a conference organised by trade body Energy UK.\nHe said that the government's recent pledge to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 - 15 years ahead of the previous target - would help.\n\"Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nThe Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills.\nIt said that the next increase in the price cap, due to come in from 1 April 2022, could be \u00a3500 or even higher.\nFounder Joe Malinowski warned: \"If things don't settle down soon, increases of \u00a3600, \u00a3700 or even \u00a3800 cannot be ruled out.\"\nNine energy suppliers have already collapsed in recent weeks and more could be facing the same fate.\nThey were unable to keep their price promises as the wholesale price of gas soared. \nTheir customers have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds when they moved to a new provider and away from whichever low-rate fixed deal their supplier had offered.\nSome of the heat was drawn from the crisis on Wednesday when Russia said it would increase gas supplies to Europe.\nUK wholesale gas prices hit a record high during the day before falling after the Russian intervention.\nBut price volatility could continue as investors remain nervous about low stockpiles of gas across Europe.\nIf you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company.\nNormally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now.\nUntil recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available.\nThe cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase.\nSo for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter.\nThe energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThat includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas.\nThe cap was increased on 1 October, with about 15 million households facing a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of \u00a3139 - from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a \u00a3153 increase.\nThat's a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by \u00a384, to \u00a31,042.\nWill you be affected by rising energy prices?

      "tags": "Edinburgh,Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland is facing a \"student housing emergency\" driven by a shortage of available accommodation and soaring rents.\nNUS Scotland has warned unprecedented demand has left some homeless and others considering dropping out.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests some landlords are asking for six months' rent upfront while others are holding off to make a profit from COP26.\nThe Scottish government said it was concerned by the reports.\nA spokesman also confirmed it was carrying out a review of purpose-built student accommodation. \nStudents returned to campuses across the country last month after a year in which many subjects were taught entirely online due to the pandemic.\nKyle MacKinnon has been struggling to find a new property with his old flatmate since he returned to Edinburgh from Harris last month.\nThe final year student at Edinburgh Napier University told BBC Scotland: \"So far it has been an absolute nightmare.\n\"There has been very few people getting back to us and even fewer viewings.\"\nMr MacKinnon said when he does get a reply it is to inform him viewings are fully booked or the property is no longer available.\nAsked about his current situation, he said: \"Right now I am on my friend's sofa in the west end of Edinburgh.\n\"It is a nice area but not very comfortable and not very good for the long term for studying.\"\nMr MacKinnon said a lot of his friends and fellow undergraduates have struggled as well.\nHe said: \"I have seen jokes on Facebook groups that finding a flat has been harder than their degrees so far.\" \nMany find themselves priced out of the market which currently offers, for example, a two-bedroom flat in the Dalry area for \u00a31,300 a month.\nMr MacKinnon said students are either targeting private halls as a solution or turning to more affordable areas, such as Leith, despite the longer commute involved. \nLast year was a write-off for most when it came to the full \"university experience\".\nOnline learning was the norm and there was limited socialising. \nNow things are getting slightly closer to normal, this situation with housing is causing concern. \nStudents unions say they have never had this many requests for support to help people find places to live. \nWe are hearing stories of students sofa-surfing and of those who have nowhere to go at all. \nThe long-term plan is to build more accommodation but the short-term solution is less clear. \nNUS Scotland president Matt Crilly said he was \"deeply concerned\" about reports students are struggling to find accommodation for the current academic, year.\nHe has written to the Scottish government to highlight his concerns.\n\"For many students, particularly those studying in the central belt of Scotland, there is currently a lack of safe and affordable accommodation,\" Mr Crilly said.\n\"With purpose-built student accommodation full, shortages in the private rented sector, and landlords holding off to make a profit from COP26, I am concerned we have a student housing emergency.\"\nMr Crilly said he was aware of some landlords increasing rent for new tenants by hundreds of pounds extra per month.\nAnecdotal evidence also suggests some students are being expected to pay six months of rent upfront.\nThe NUS president added: \"It is completely unacceptable that any student would be experiencing homelessness and left without accommodation when classes have already started. \n\"However, this issue is not unique to the current academic year. Scotland has been dragging its heels on providing adequate and affordable accommodation for students for years, which is why we see large areas with substandard housing dominated by intimidating landlords.\"\nMr Crilly urged ministers to \"urgently intervene\" to address the situation and introduce a student housing strategy to ensure no student is left without a roof over their head.\nHe also called for rents to be brought under control and for a points-based rent controls system, which is tied to the property rather than the lease, in a bid to stop landlords being able to hike rents between tenancies.\nThe Scottish Green's education spokesman Ross Greer described the current situation as \"really grim\".\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: \"I am aware of one case of a mature student who, with her child at the moment, is in a homeless shelter because she has been unable to find accommodation.\"\nMr Greer said it was the result of a \"perfect storm\" of factors including house in multiple occupation (HMO) licence delays in Scotland, the popularity of short-term Airbnb-style lets and rent increases that have far outstripped the growth in wages.\nEarlier this week the programme heard from the parents of students who are struggling to find accommodation.\nOne said his son spoke to an estate agent who revealed one flat attracted 600 inquiries.\nAnd a mother said her son was currently commuting from Edinburgh to Glasgow for lectures as flat viewings in the city are typically full \"within five minutes.\"\nJohn Blackwood, chief executive of the Scottish Association of Landlords (SAL), said: \"We are seeing a chronic shortage of private rented accommodation across Scotland, partly as a result of landlords leaving the sector over the past couple of years which has reduced supply. \n\"In addition, landlords warned  in 2017 that an unintended consequence of the Private Residential Tenancy (PRT) could be a reduction in accommodation available to students as landlords were no longer able to offer fixed-term leases which matched with term times.  \n\"As a result, properties which landlords would hold back and market specifically for students are now rented by people as their primary home on a longer-term basis.  One of the key aims of the PRT has been achieved but it is students who are suffering.\"\nJamie Hepburn, the minister for higher and further education, said the government was concerned about the issues raised by NUS Scotland. \n\"While the Scottish Government has no direct role in the provision of student residential accommodation, we would strongly encourage students with those concerns to speak with their college or university,\" he added.  \n\"We are determined to improve accessibility, affordability and standards across the rented sector and are carrying out a review of purpose built student accommodation. \n\"We are also working to deliver a new deal for tenants giving them more secure, stable, affordable tenancies with improved standards of accommodation, new controls on rent and more flexibility to personalise homes.\""

      "text": "NatWest bank has pleaded guilty to failing to prevent alleged money laundering of nearly \u00a3400m by one customer.\nNatWest said \"we deeply regret\" failing to \"adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers between 2012 and 2016\".\nThe state-backed bank, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, is the first British lender to admit such an offence.\nLawyers told a court hearing that NatWest faces a large fine.\nThe case was brought by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which alleged the bank failed to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about \u00a3365m in its accounts over five years, of which \u00a3264m was in cash.\nThe criminal action, first announced by the FCA in March, was the first against a bank under a 2007 money laundering law.\nThe FCA said NatWest failed to adhere to the requirements of anti-money laundering legislation in relation to Fowler Oldfield Ltd's account between 7 November 2013 and 23 June 2016. \nFowler Oldfield was a century-old jeweller based in Bradford, and was shut down following a police raid in 2016.\nFCA prosecutor Clare Montgomery QC told Westminster magistrates that when Fowler Oldfield was taken on as a client by NatWest, its predicted turnover was said to be \u00a315m per annum.\nHowever, it deposited \u00a3365m over the space of almost five years. \nShe said: \"It was agreed that the bank would not handle cash deposits. However, it deposited \u00a3365m, with around \u00a3264m in cash.\"\nShe said that at its height, Fowler Oldfield deposited up to \u00a31.8m a day.\nThe court was told the \"likely sentence is a very large fine\".\nNatWest remains 55% taxpayer-owned after receiving a \u00a345bn bailout at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.\nChief executive Alison Rose said: \"NatWest has a vital part to play in detecting and preventing financial crime and we take extremely seriously our responsibility to prevent money laundering by third parties.\n\"In the years since this case, we have invested significant resources and continue to enhance our efforts to effectively combat financial crime.\"\nJonathan Fisher, a senior lawyer at Bright Line Law specialising in money laundering cases, said the FCA had claimed \"a big scalp\".\n\"The message sent to financial institutions is clear. If there are failings in your money laundering systems, criminal prosecution may follow. NatWest was sensible to take the hit, and it must now move on.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "High energy costs are forcing manufacturers to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers.\nIceland boss Richard Walker said higher energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now \"inevitable\".\nThe warning came as analysts predicted that household energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds next year.\nThey said the energy price cap, which protects domestic consumers, could soar by \u00a3400 in the spring.\nCornwall Insight forecasts that the energy price cap will rise to about \u00a31,660 by next summer.\nThat is about 30% higher than the record \u00a31,277 level for the cap set for winter 2021-22, which began at the start of October.\n\"With wholesale gas and electricity prices continuing to reach new records, successive supplier exits during September 2021 and a new level for the default tariff cap, the Great British energy market remains on edge for fresh volatility and further consolidation,\" said Craig Lowrey, senior consultant at Cornwall Insight.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem said the price cap \"will ensure that consumers don't pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter\".\nBut if gas prices stay high, the price cap will rise, Ofgem said.\nThe regulator said its \"number one priority is to protect customers\", but acknowledged \"this is a worrying time for many people\". \nBut while the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices.\nMr Walker warned that Iceland's energy bill would go up by \u00a320m next year. Alongside higher salaries to address lorry driver shortages and other new costs, he said grocery prices would have to increase.\n\"It's inevitable that we will see price rises,\" he told the BBC. \"The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world. \n\"Our margins are very very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases.\"\nAndrew Large, director general of the Confederation of Paper Industries, said: \"This is a highly inflationary situation for the British economy and members will clearly be in a position where they do try to pass those costs on to consumers where they can.\"\nOne paper manufacturer, the Northwood Group, said the industry had been \"left to fend for itself\" in the face of \"horrendous\" knock-on effects from the gas price rise.\n\"The spike [in gas prices] that we have seen since January is equivalent to a 550% price increase, which of course destroys any industrial planning,\" said chairman Paul Fecher.\nLaura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, said many of her member firms could even be forced to stop production \"due to uneconomic higher energy costs\".\nThis could cause \"severe damage\" to production facilities such as brick kilns, which could not easily be turned off at short notice, she said.\nMeanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said that by decarbonising the UK's power supply, the country will protect customers from volatile fossil fuel prices.\n\"The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,\" he told a conference organised by trade body Energy UK.\nHe said that the government's recent pledge to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 - 15 years ahead of the previous target - would help.\n\"Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nThe Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills.\nIt said that the next increase in the price cap, due to come in from 1 April 2022, could be \u00a3500 or even higher.\nFounder Joe Malinowski warned: \"If things don't settle down soon, increases of \u00a3600, \u00a3700 or even \u00a3800 cannot be ruled out.\"\nNine energy suppliers have already collapsed in recent weeks and more could be facing the same fate.\nThey were unable to keep their price promises as the wholesale price of gas soared. \nTheir customers have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds when they moved to a new provider and away from whichever low-rate fixed deal their supplier had offered.\nSome of the heat was drawn from the crisis on Wednesday when Russia said it would increase gas supplies to Europe.\nUK wholesale gas prices hit a record high during the day before falling after the Russian intervention.\nBut price volatility could continue as investors remain nervous about low stockpiles of gas across Europe.\nIf you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company.\nNormally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now.\nUntil recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available.\nThe cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase.\nSo for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter.\nThe energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThat includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas.\nThe cap was increased on 1 October, with about 15 million households facing a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of \u00a3139 - from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a \u00a3153 increase.\nThat's a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by \u00a384, to \u00a31,042.\nWill you be affected by rising energy prices?

      "text": "Tory MP Peter Bottomley has stood by comments he made about MPs struggling to get by and needing more pay.\nThe MP faced an angry backlash over the claims, with Labour accusing him of being out of touch.\nBut Sir Peter said the comments were part of a broader interview in which he also expressed concern about universal credit cuts.\nThe \u00a320-a-week top up to the benefit officially ended on Wednesday, despite warnings about rising living costs.\nLabour's shadow child poverty secretary Wes Streeting said he was \"genuinely infuriated\" by Sir Peter's comments.\n\"We are perfectly well paid, and unfortunately too many MPs on the Conservative side, at the same time as whingeing about very high - relatively high - levels of pay that MPs get in this country, at the same time they are clobbering people who are losing over \u00a31,000 a year, which is 10% of their income in some cases,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nHe added: \"This is my problem with the Tories - it's not that they're evil, bad people who go into work every day thinking 'How can we plunge more kids into poverty?' \n\"But, as Peter Bottomley's comments show, they just don't know what life is like for a hell of a lot of people in this country and they make policies that are actively hurting people who are going out, working hard, trying to make the best for their family and are really struggling.\"\nBut Sir Peter told the BBC he was not arguing for MP pay rises until after the next general election \"which is probably in three years' time\". \nHe said he was trying to make the point that increasing MPs' salaries from the current average of just over \u00a380,000 a year would make it easier to widen the pool of people interested in changing careers to become parliamentarians, without having to take a pay cut. \n\"If people can't switch across to being an MP, you're going to exclude a whole lot of people\" he said, such as headteachers and public sector executives. \nThe 77-year-old Worthing West MP - the longest serving MP in the Commons - said he also shared concerns expressed by other Tory MPs about the government's benefit cuts although he is not arguing for the universal credit uplift to be made permanent. \nHe \"would have agreed to increase universal credit temporarily\" as Chancellor Rishi Sunak did, he said, because it was a way to \"support those hurt most by the pandemic\".\nBut he expressed concern at the speed with which it has been removed and said it would have been better to taper the extra money down to \"avoid cutting it off at a cliff-edge\". \nConservative peer, Philippa Stroud, a former adviser to Iain Duncan Smith when he was work and pensions secretary, has threatened to force a vote on the universal credit cut in the House of Lords. \nAnd speaking on the BBC News Channel, Shadow Business Secretary, Ed Miliband said Labour was \"not giving up\" on attempts to reverse the reduction. \n\"It beggars belief\" he said ,that in the context of escalating energy prices and tax rises, \"the government is ploughing ahead\" with the cut to the benefit.  \nPeople are facing a \"double whammy\" and the situation is going to be \"unbearable for so many families\" he added and targeting support through the social security system is the best way to help them.

Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter.\nNational Energy Action (NEA) said this month's price rises had already pushed half a million more households into fuel poverty.\n\"It's building into a brutal and bleak winter for millions. If the price cap goes up by \u00a3400 to \u00a3600 a year it could plunge 1.2 to 1.5 million households into fuel poverty, leaving almost 5.5 million households struggling to keep their homes warm and safe,\" said NEA chief executive Adam Scorer.\nNEA is calling for more support to be put in place for low income households.\nOfgem, the energy regulator, said it expected prices would rise further in April. \nIts chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the energy cap was \"designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time\".\nNatural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. \nAs a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it.\nEven with the raising of the cap this month Mr Brearley said more energy firms could run into difficulties.\n\"Given the continued volatility in the market, it is likely more suppliers will exit the market,\" he told an energy conference on Thursday.\nNine firms have already gone out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers.\nThose households have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds, since new providers aren't able to match lower-rate fixed deals that were on offer when gas prices were lower.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who was also attending the conference, said the right response to rising gas prices was to renew the UK's commitment to renewable energy.\nThe government recently pledged to shift electricity generation away from fossil fuels entirely by 2035.\n\"The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,\" he said.\nDecarbonising heating and power would mean lower prices he said. \n\"Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nHowever, customers will question whether the cost of the making the transition to lower carbon energy could push bills higher in the short term.\nThe next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February but will come into force in April.\nAnalysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by \u00a3400 meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay around \u00a31,660 a year.\nHowever the Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills.\nIt said that the next increase in the price cap could be \u00a3500 or even higher.\nFounder Joe Malinowski warned: \"If things don't settle down soon, increases of \u00a3600, \u00a3700 or even \u00a3800 cannot be ruled out.\"\nBusinesses are also feeling the impact of rising energy costs.

Today they employ about 30 people making bespoke bathroom and bedroom furniture. \nThe past 18 months have been so good that they've moved premises to expand - and invested about \u00a3500,000 in new technology and machinery to keep up with demand.\n\"It's a gas guzzler - unfortunately for us it's a big gas guzzler,\" he says of their new painting machine, which is piped into the mains and is able to produce colourful furniture much faster. \n\"Any business, it's about cost and quite a big component for us is energy, so it's quite a scary thought.

      "text": "The legal requirement for social distancing in bars and restaurants is to be removed.\nNightclubs are also to be allowed to reopen, meaning legal restrictions on dancing in venues will be scrapped.\nRestrictions will be lifted from 31 October.\nA number of mitigations have been agreed and it is thought businesses will be asked to check for vaccine certificates, but this will not be a legal requirement. \nMinisters have also agreed to retain the mandatory wearing of face coverings in certain settings.\nIt is understood ministers were advised that moving legal regulations on face coverings into guidance would lead to a 30% decline in their use. \nThe industry had argued that social distancing requirements were damaging trade.\nThe new rules mean people will be able to move around pubs and restaurants and to eat and drink while standing up.\nChanges were also announced to the UK travel red list, which has been cut from 54 countries to seven.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan welcomed the easing of restrictions, particularly for the the hospitality sector, which he said had been hit hard during the pandemic.\n\"I'm pleased that at the end of this month they will be able to operate in a much more sustainable and viable way,\" he said.\nMr Givan said the sector benefitted from \"a high level of adherence\" to coronavirus restrictions, adding that he believed this would continue.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she was pleased progress had been made at Thursday's executive meeting, but that people should remain cautious. \n\"We're in for an uncertain period ahead and we have to work our way through that as best we can,\" she said. \nMs O'Neill said continuing increasing vaccination rates would also be a \"crucially important\" part of the executive's winter planning.\nUnder existing rules, social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) remains a legal requirement in pubs, bars and restaurants in Northern Ireland.\nFrom Thursday 14 October the restrictions on the number of people allowed to meet inside a home is to be increased from 15 from four households to 30 from an unlimited number of households.\nFrom that date, people attending performances at indoor venues will not have to be seated during the performance.\nThe executive is now moving to unlock the final stage of pandemic recovery. \nNightclubs will finally get to reopen on Halloween and social distancing - something we've lived with as the norm for the past 18 months - will be scrapped. \nIt's perhaps no surprise given how that's already the case in Great Britain and the rules south of the Irish border will end this month too. \nBut not everything is changing - face coverings will remain - a sign that for some, caution is still needed with Covid. \nThe executive has also warned that if things begin to go in the wrong direction again, vaccine passports could then be deployed. \nThe Department of Health will now progress work on the system after agreement with Executive Office officials - but the onus on hospitality businesses will be to prove that a mandatory scheme isn't needed.\nJohn Leighton, owner of Bennigan's Bar, Londonderry, said easing restrictions for hospitality was fantastic news, which the sector \"had been waiting on for some time\".\nHe said it had been a challenging and stressful time for the sector and that the timing to ease restrictions on 31 October was particularly good for Derry's annual Halloween festival.\n\"It means we can get back to enjoying ourselves and not having so many things to think about,\" he said. \n\"We can get back to a bit more normality.\"\nJanice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the restrictions which are being removed had presented \"significant challenges\" for businesses which were trying to become fully operational again.\nShe said: \"The industry has traded well to date and our primary focus remains the health and well-being of our staff and customers. \n\"Winter trade, in a viable manner within a sustainable framework and without further lockdown, is our aim.\"\nIn September, the executive agreed to end social distancing restrictions for shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings. \nThey asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test.\nBut this is advice and is not legally enforceable.\nLast week, Health Minister Robin Swann warned that a delay by the executive in agreeing a vaccine passport policy had limited options for easing more restrictions. \nThe Department of Health will now progress work to develop the digital scheme, but ministers will have to decide whether to deploy it.\nMs O'Neill said she did not want things to reach that point and hoped businesses would voluntarily comply with executive advice and demonstrate they could work safely. \nMinisters also discussed a bid from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey for \u00a355m in funding to mitigate the end of a \u00a320 weekly uplift for people claiming universal credit. \nStormont received an extra \u00a3180m from the Treasury in September and that money has yet to be distributed.\nThe expectation was that most if not all of that money would go on health spending.\nMr Givan and Ms O'Neill made clear that Stormont would face major difficulties - both financially and logistically - of stepping in to top up payments \nMr Givan said the Executive had to be \"honest\" with the public about the financial position.\n\"Now is not the time to be removing this uplift,\" he said.\n\"That is happening though this week and the ability, even if the executive had the funding, to do this [top up the payments] isn't there because we don't have the systems, this is administered directly through the Department for Work and Pensions in London.\n\"So we don't have the system. And the ability to finance it - we have to be honest with the public.\""

      "text": "Ryanair and British Airways customers who say they are owed refunds because of Covid restrictions on travel could miss out because the competition regulator says the law is unclear.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has closed an investigation into the two airlines, saying there is a \"lack of [legal] clarity\".\nInstead of offering refunds, the carriers offered vouchers or rebooking.\nThis, the CMA believed, probably broke the law, and a probe was launched.\nAlthough some flights went ahead, many customers were prevented from taking them because of restrictions. The CMA said the law needed clarifying. \n\"After a thorough examination of relevant law, and the evidence it had gathered during its investigation, the CMA has concluded that the law does not provide passengers with a sufficiently clear right to a refund in these unusual circumstances to justify continuing with the case,\" the regulator said.\n\"Consumer protection law sets out that passengers are entitled to refunds when an airline cancels a flight, because the firm cannot provide its contracted services. However, it does not clearly cover whether people should be refunded when their flight goes ahead but they are legally prohibited from taking it.\"\nGlobal lockdown restrictions on air travel left many customers claiming ticket refunds and looking to the law for the protection.\nBut the CMA said prolonging the case through the courts \"could not be justified given the length of time it would take\".\nCMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli has now called for a change in the law, adding he strongly believes people prevented from taking flights due to lockdown should get a full refund.\n\"Given the importance of this to many passengers who have unfairly lost out, we hope that the law in this area will be clarified,\" he said.\nThe CMA's statement highlighted it had already secured commitments to refund hundreds of millions of pounds for people whose holidays were cancelled due to the pandemic, including from LoveHolidays, Lastminute.com, Virgin Holidays, TUI UK, Sykes Cottages, and Vacation Rentals. \nBoth Ryanair and BA welcomed the CMA's move and defended their actions.\nRyanair said: \"We operated a limited schedule during UK lockdowns for customers who travelled for essential reasons. Passengers had the option to change their bookings without paying the flight change fee and many availed of this option.\"\nAnd BA said: \"During this unprecedented crisis we have acted lawfully at all times, issuing nearly 4 million refunds and offering highly flexible booking policies enabling millions of our customers to change their travel dates or destinations.\"\nWere you hoping for a refund from BA or Ryanair?

      "text": "Householders in the UK will find out in the next few weeks how much their gas bills are likely to increase in the coming year.\nThe energy regulator is due to announce the new energy price cap - the maximum amount that suppliers can charge in Great Britain.\nIt's expected to rise steeply, because global wholesale prices have gone up so much.\nEvery six months, Ofgem, the energy regulator, reviews the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThis is called the energy price cap. \nAbout 15 million households saw their energy bills increase by 12% when it was last updated in October. \nThe next review is due at the beginning of February, and the new cap will come into effect in April. Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."

      "text": "Long delays outside hospitals are costing ambulance crews thousands of hours when they are unable to respond to other calls, a new report has found. \nIt found frequent delays were having a \"detrimental\" impact on the NHS's ability to care for patients.\nA Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) report looked at patient delays between April 2020 and March 2021.\nDuring this period, crews had to wait more than an hour to transfer patients on no fewer than 32,699 occasions.\n\"It's an entire system issue. I'm not under any illusion that's an easy fix for anyone, but we do need the system to work closely together,\" said Alun Jones, interim chief executive of HIW.  \nThey key findings of the report include:\nThe review was based on assessment, interviews and surveys with more than 400 NHS staff and more than 100 patients.\nHIW makes clear that handover delays are not directly an ambulance service problem, but symptomatic of problems across the entire health and social care system.\nA&Es become overcrowded when hospital wards are full and hospital wards become full when there are delays in discharging patients.\nThe report makes 20 recommendations and says the ambulance service, health boards and Welsh government need to work together to make improvements.\nClaire Roche of the Welsh Ambulance Service said: \"Our emergency ambulance service exists to deliver life-saving immediate care and to take patients promptly to hospital for the necessary treatment.\n\"For the Welsh Ambulance Service, this is about getting to the root cause of the issue in order to resolve it, rather than adapting to a situation so that it becomes the new normal.\n\"We welcome the fact that Health Inspectorate Wales is shining a light on this issue, and we will continue to work with colleagues in health boards and Welsh government to make improvements.\"\nDarren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation said the review \"demonstrates the impact that the enormous pressures on the NHS are having\".\n\"The NHS in Wales is working relentlessly to cope with current levels of demand and to ensure everyone waiting for care is seen as soon as possible,\" he added.\n\"Staff are doing all they can to continue delivering care for those who need it. We thank them and the public for doing all they can to support the NHS.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"Health boards are responsible for improving ambulance patient handover times and we expect to see them deliver improvement in this area.\n\"A broad range of actions are already in place, including recruitment of additional ambulance clinicians, creation of urgent primary care centres and a new national programme to support people to return home from hospital when ready.\"\n\"We will continue to work with the chief ambulance services commissioner, WAST and Wales' wider health and care system to improve quality of care, patient experience and staff wellbeing.\"\nChris Williams-Ellis was left with 45% burns after a car he was working beneath caught fire.\nHe waited an hour and 18 minutes for an ambulance despite eight 999 calls being made from his home in Brynsaithmarchog, Denbighshire, on 8 September last year. \nThe first was made at 14:51 by Mr Williams-Ellis's partner Catherine, followed by seven more from the fire service, the final one being at 16:04.\nAn air ambulance arrived at 16:17.\nHis mother, Philomene Williams-Ellis, said on Thursday: \"The ambulance was called and it didn't come.\n\"The time it took between when the call was made and when the helicopter landed at Liverpool was just a minute off three hours.\" \nAs he waited he was looked after by fire crews who were attending. \n\"The flesh was coming off his body, he was in absolute agony,\" Ms Williams-Ellis said. \n\"All the time Christopher waited he was fully aware of what was happening to him and what was happening around him.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service has met Ms Williams-Ellis to discuss what went wrong. \n\"There were 36 ambulances supposed to be on call that day,\" she said. \nFour were off \"for various reasons\", she said. \n\"Thirty-two were in car parks at various hospitals and they were there for hours and hours.\" \nThe reason, she said, was because patients were waiting in the vehicles until there was space for them to be seen in the hospitals. \n\"For almost an hour there was not one emergency vehicle available.\"\nShe said the NHS in Wales was \"not for purpose.\" \n\"The person who needs to answer is the minister for health in Wales and the trusts who are running the hospitals.\"\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service NHS trust offered a \"sincere apology\" last year for \"errors\" that contributed to an \"unacceptable\" delay.\nMs Williams-Ellis said her son was \"doing really well\". \n\"He has life-changing injuries but he is a very positive person with a good attitude.\n\"He gets on with it.

      "text": "Christmas this year is likely to be more normal than in 2020, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said.\nHe said if nothing unexpected happens Wales can look forward to a holiday season \"much more like the ones we are used to\".\nThe Welsh government said that all businesses are likely to be able to stay open this winter.\nBut it has drawn up a \"Covid Urgent\" plan if a new variant risks overwhelming the NHS. \nIn a statement setting out Wales' autumn and winter plan, the government said such a scenario could be the emergence of a new, fast-spreading variant or if vaccine immunity levels fall, causing a rise in pandemic pressures.\nBut it is more likely the country will slowly move out of the pandemic, where coronavirus becomes a seasonal illness, and that businesses can stay open.\nMr Drakeford said Wales remains at alert level zero, with no changes likely in the next three weeks beyond those already announced.\nAt a briefing on Friday he also said it would now be easier to visit a loved one in a care home.\nIt comes as Wales' case rates dip below 500 per 100,000 for the first time since mid-September.\nMr Drakeford said in the most probable scenario \"we ought to be able to get through the autumn and the winter with restrictions at the sort of level we have at the moment.\n\"That would be very different to last Christmas, far more like the sort of Christmasses we were used to.\"\n\"If nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to.\"\nWales went into lockdown days before Christmas last year, curtailing plans to allow more mixing over the period.\nBusinesses said the news they would probably not be facing another winter lockdown was \"reassuring\".\nNeil Collier, owner of Colliers Photo Imaging in Uplands, Swansea, said he faced \"quite a hit\" last Christmas with \"panicked customers wondering if they were going to get their orders\". \n\"I think it's more security for business trade going into the winter months which is potentially our busiest period,\" he added.\nLast winter, Nicki Collier, who manages Bluebell Coffee and Kitchen in Tycoch, also Swansea, faced having to cancel bookings and process refunds.\n\"It's really reassuring to hear some good news finally. Shutting overnight last year was a really big shock,\" she said.\n\"Fingers crossed now this is good news for this Christmas.\"\nDr Richard Stanton, a virologist at Cardiff University, said the Welsh government should stick with current restrictions to \"keep a lid on transmission rates\" ahead of the winter.\nHe said Covid-19 was now not the only concern, with other respiratory viruses such as flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - a common winter bug that can cause lung problems - likely to spread too.\n\"All those things will put pressure on the NHS and could result in further hospitalisations,\" he added.p\nMr Drakeford confirmed there would be no changes to the current regulations for the next three weeks, beyond those already announced.\nRules around care home visits will be reduced, however. Mr Drakeford said providers can now allow visitors to take lateral flow tests at home and will no longer have to socially distance in a resident's room or in a designated visiting room.\nRestrictions around gifts, including food and drink, will also be eased.\nThe first minister set out two planning scenarios for the pandemic over the winter.\nIn the first, called Covid Stable, Wales remains at alert level zero through the autumn and winter, with all businesses able to open.\nThe second, Covid Urgent, is designed to deal with any sudden changes to the situation.\nIf that happens previously drawn up \"alert levels\" - including lockdown at level four - could be used as an option of last resort.\n\"While we do not think measures under a Covid Urgent scenario will be necessary this autumn or winter, we cannot completely rule them out,\" the plan added.\nMr Drakeford told journalists that, should demand for PCR tests outstrip the ability to provide them during the winter, then some less-vulnerable groups would be offered lateral flow strips in the first instance.\nHe told journalists there was no plan to charge for PCR tests, but said after the winter Wales will begin to move into an era where \"mass testing will play a less important part in the way we manage the virus\".\n\"We will be reserving the tests for the purposes for which they are most important\", he added.\nPrior to the press conference the first minister said Wales was \"facing a challenging winter ahead - coronavirus hasn't gone away and flu is forecast to return this winter.\"\n\"Vaccination is the best defence we have against coronavirus - the more people who are fully vaccinated, the better our chances of controlling the spread of this awful virus.\"\nHe encouraged everyone who was eligible \"to have their flu jab this year\".\nHe said he believed Wales was now past the peak of the third wave, following a decline in cases over the last few days.\nIn other measures to keep Wales safe, Covid passes in nightclubs and large events will be introduced from Monday, following a narrow victory for the Welsh government in a knife-edge Senedd vote this week.\nThe public will be expected to show evidence of being fully vaccinated or having a recent negative Covid test.\nMr Drakeford told the BBC's Dros Frecwast programme event organisers were responsible for checking people were carrying the correct Covid passes through a spot check system, as fines were being introduced for fake ones from Monday.\n\"When there are lots and lots of people trying to go in, for example, there will be no need to check each one,\" he said.\nAt the briefing, he said he expected the introduction of Covid passes would be \"relatively smooth,\" but admitted it would not be without \"teething trouble\".\n\"I think that the system is easy to use,\" he added.\nProfessor of epidemiology and biostatistics Mike Gravenor, of Swansea University Medical School, has been part of the team looking at the modelling of Covid-19 in Wales.\nHe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"We're still under a situation of uncertainty. A new variant is one factor and our understanding of how long immunity lasts for, in natural immunity and in vaccinated individuals.\"\nAll the indicators are pointing to an improving position with regards to Covid - case rates have been falling for the last nine days.\nThe spike we saw in recent weeks was driven by high numbers of under-19s, especially secondary school-age children, testing positive, ahead of vaccinations being available for this age group.\nThe character of this third wave spike was also influenced by record numbers of lateral flow tests coming back positive, so young people were being found to have Covid, even if not displaying symptoms.\nBecause so many infections have involved young people, while many older and vulnerable people have been double-vaccinated, we have not seen anything like the Covid cases in hospital beds. \nAdmissions have been higher in recent weeks than some early modelling predicted as likely, but numbers of patients with Covid are coming down. \nOn Wednesday, there were 14% fewer Covid patients in hospital beds on average than two weeks ago. \nWe have been seeing similar numbers in critical care for more than a month and those in ICU with non-Covid conditions outnumber Covid patients by more than two to one. \nBut hospital managers will still be concerned that there are more than 420 Covid patients in beds across Wales and bed occupancy is at 90% in acute hospitals, with the winter to come.\nSadly, there are still people dying of Covid and figures from the ONS this week showed 88 deaths in Wales in the latest week. But numbers are down considerably on earlier waves - and after a spike in September, they are back within the range expected by scientists."

      "text": "The Public Health Agency (PHA) has warned post primary schools in Northern Ireland about hoax Covid vaccine consent letters.\nSome schools have received emails claiming to come from the NHS, which contain a \"consent checklist\" for vaccination.\nThe email asks them to share the checklist with parents and pupils.\nBut the PHA said \"the false email and 'consent form' content contains a number of important inaccuracies\".\nIt should \"not be forwarded to parents,\" the PHA said.\nBBC News NI has been contacted by some principals in Northern Ireland whose schools have received the hoax consent forms.\nThey are presented as a form with information to be sent to parents ahead of pupils being given Covid vaccinations.\nBelow an \"NHS Vaccines\" logo, the consent form includes claims such as the vaccine being a risk for \"strokes, blindness, deafness, clotting, miscarriages, anaphylaxis and cardiovascular disorders\".\nAs a result, the PHA has written to schools in Northern Ireland warning them that the material is false.\n\"Materials include a branded 'consent form' has the look and feel of authoritative NHS communications using a made up NHS vaccines logo,\" the PHA letter said.\nThe agency said that some schools elsewhere in the UK had mistakenly circulated the hoax checklist to parents.\n\"Please only forward to parents materials that have come from the PHA or your own Trust school nursing teams,\" the PHA told principals.\nThe agency has published guidance on the imminent rollout of the vaccine to 12 to 15 year olds in Northern Ireland.\nAbout 100,000 children and young people in Northern Ireland will be offered a jab by the start of December.\nThe PHA said that information packs for children and parents would \"be delivered to schools in the second to third week of October to make sure that individuals, or those giving consent on their behalf, have enough information to enable them to make a decision before they give consent\".\n\"In Northern Ireland, Covid-19 vaccine for school children is being offered at school by the usual Trust school health nursing arrangements,\" the PHA letter to principals said.\n\"Schools will be receiving an information pack with more details from the PHA via the Education Authority school systems very shortly.\""

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Boris Johnson,Conservative Party Conference",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has promised to \"get on with the job\" of uniting and levelling up the UK, in a speech to the Conservative Party conference.\nIn an upbeat address peppered with jokes, but light on new policy, the prime minister claimed a high-wage, high-skilled economy was being created in the wake of Brexit and the pandemic.\nHe also defended tax rises to pay for the NHS and vowed to fix social care.\nThe 45-minute speech was his first to a conference since the pandemic began.\nIn it, the prime minister said the overwhelming Conservative general election victory in 2019 placed an onus on his government to deliver change demanded by voters.\nThe main theme of his speech was \"levelling up\", with the PM saying that reducing gaps between regions would ease pressure on south-eastern England, while boosting places that felt left behind.\nHe also repeated pledges set out at during his party's conference this week in Manchester to crack down on crime, improve transport links and broadband, and reform the housing market.\nAnd he sought to reassure Tories anxious about plans to increase National Insurance to pay for the NHS and social care by claiming it was what predecessor Margaret Thatcher would have done, if the economy had been hit by a \"meteorite\" like the pandemic.\n\"She would have wagged her finger and said that more borrowing now is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes later,\" he said. \nBoris Johnson is an optimist. \nThe prime minister wants a new economic model with better pay and conditions. He wants to persuade voters his is the party to distribute wealth and opportunity more evenly across the UK. He wants people to feel good about the future.\nLevelling up has been the slogan repeated by ministers at this conference. We only got a sliver of meat on the bones today. This was a speech thin on policy, big on jokes and rhetorical flourishes. \nConservatives love Mr Johnson because he makes them feel good - it's a strategy that is key to understanding his success as a politician. \nBut will it be enough? There are some difficult months ahead for many people. \nRising prices, supply chain issues, the end of the universal credit top-up and furlough. \nMany Conservatives acknowledge the cost of living squeeze - and are worried about the impact. \nCritics will accuse the prime minister of ignoring those big issues in favour of what they see as vague promises for the future. \nBut the hope in Manchester was that Boris Johnson's unflinchingly upbeat vision of a post-Brexit, post-pandemic Britain is as popular with voters as it is with Tory activists.\nThe Conservative conference has taken place amid concerns over rising inflation, supply chain problems, and petrol and worker shortages.\nBut Mr Johnson insisted that the present problems were the result of an economic rebound in the wake of Covid shutdowns.\nHe added that controls on immigration represented the \"change that people voted for\" in the 2016 Brexit referendum, while also promising to end declining home ownership among young people by building more housing. \nHe announced a \u00a33,000-a-year bonus for teachers, as an incentive for struggling areas of England to recruit maths and science specialists. The policy replaces a similar nationwide scheme that has recently been phased out. \nDowning Street said the new \"levelling up premium\" would cost \u00a360m, but no details have yet been given over which areas will qualify. \n\"There is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"You will find talent, genius, flair, imagination, enthusiasm - all of them evenly distributed around this country. But opportunity is not.\"\nMr Johnson referred to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who was recently photographed dancing in an Aberdeen nightclub, as \"Jon Bon Govi\" - an allusion to the rock star Jon Bon Jovi.\nHe also mocked Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he has frequently dubbed \"Captain Hindsight\".\n\"If Columbus had listened to Captain Hindsight, he'd be famous for discovering Tenerife,\" he joked.\nBut Sir Keir accused Mr Johnson of \"playing this game where he's pretending that he's just sort of just landed from the Moon and he's looking around and saying, 'Things look pretty awful around here, we need a bit of levelling up, things are so awful'\".\nHe told ITV's Peston programme: \"He and the Tories have been in government for 11 years, so we're in this state because of the way that they have governed the country.\"\nThe CBI business lobby group said Mr Johnson said set out a \"compelling vision\" but had so far \"only stated his ambition\" on raising wages. \nShevaun Haviland, who heads the British Chambers of Commerce, said firms supported the aim of a higher-wage, higher-skill economy but warned: \"This will not happen overnight.\""

      "text": "The gap between private-school fees and state-school per-pupil spending in England has more than doubled over the past decade, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.\nAverage fees, of \u00a313,600, were more than 90% higher than the \u00a37,100 spent on state-school pupils in 2020-21, compared with a gap of 39% in 2009-10. \nFor sixth-formers, fees are about three times higher than per-student funding.\nThe government says schools are having the biggest funding uplift in a decade. \nWhile private-school fees have grown by more than 20% above inflation since 2009-10, state-school per-pupil spending has fallen by 9% in real terms. \nAnd the gap in resource levels is probably even larger, the IFS researchers say, as the figures do not include other forms of income for private schools, such as account investment and endowments or gifts. \n\"Longstanding concerns about inequalities between private- and state-school pupils, which have come into sharp focus during the pandemic, will not begin to be easily addressed while the sectors enjoy such different levels of resourcing,\" Luke Sibieta said.\nLabour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said: \"School budgets have been hammered over the last decade, which is holding children back. \n\"As state-school class sizes have soared and enriching activities - art, sport, music, drama - have been cut back, the gap with private schools has grown ever wider.\"\nAssociation of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said: \"It is pretty outrageous that the government has cut funding in real terms to schools and colleges over the past decade, while independent school fees have increased over the same period. \n\"The funding gap between the two sectors has always been there of course but the fact it has widened to such a huge extent does stick in the throat. \n\"Surely the government should want the same opportunities for all children and young people. \n\"It may be naive to think that state education funding could match the independent sector but it surely shouldn't actually go into reverse.\"\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"This government is providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade - \u00a314bn in total over the three years to 2022-23. \n\"This includes a \u00a37.1bn increase in funding for schools by 2022-23, compared to 2019-20 funding levels.\n\"Next year, funding through the schools national funding formula (NFF) is increasing by 2.8% per pupil compared to 2021-22. \n\"The NFF continues to distribute this fairly, based on the needs of schools and their pupil cohorts.\""

      "tags": "Cyber-crime,Computer hacking,Princess Latifa,United Arab Emirates,Princess Haya case,Cyber-attacks,Mohammed Al Maktoum,Dubai,Cyber-security",
      "text": "The High Court has found that the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum, interfered with British justice by ordering the hacking of the phone of his ex-wife, Princess Haya of Jordan.\nThe phones of her solicitors, Baroness Fiona Shackleton and Nick Manners, were also targeted during their divorce custody case, according to the court. \nPrincess Haya said the discovery had made her feel \"hunted and haunted\". \nSheikh Mohammed denied any knowledge of the hacking. \nHe said the court's findings were based on evidence that was not disclosed to him, and that they were \"made in a manner which was unfair\".\nThe judgments are a blow to the sheikh and a further revelation as to his treatment of female members of his family.\nThe High Court judgments, which were published on Wednesday afternoon, referred to the hacking as \"serial breaches of (UK) domestic criminal law\", \"in violation of fundamental common law and ECHR rights\", \"interference with the process of this court and the mother's access to justice\" and \"abuse of power\" by a head of government.\nThe president of the Family Division of the High Court found that \"the mobile phones of the mother (Princess Haya), two of her solicitors, her personal assistant and two members of her security staff had been the subject of either successful or attempted infiltration by surveillance software. The software used is called Pegasus software and was that of an Israeli company, the NSO Group.\"\nThe court concluded that the surveillance was carried out \"by servants or agents of the father (Sheikh Mohammed), the Emirate of Dubai or the [United Arab Emirates] and that the surveillance occurred with the express or implied authority of the father\". \nThe extent of the hack is shocking in what data it gave the hackers access to.\nNSO's Pegasus software, often referred to as \"spyware\", is able to track the location of the individual using the phone, read their SMS messages, emails and messages in other apps, as well as eavesdrop on their phone calls and access their contact list, passwords, calendar dates and photographs. In other words, it gives the hacker complete access to all the data they want to see in their target's phone. \nIt also allows the hacker to activate the target's phone without their knowledge, recording their activity and even taking photographs and screenshots. \nSimilar spyware is alleged to have been deployed by Saudi government agents, working on the orders of the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, against dissidents living abroad, including associates of the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nIt is extremely difficult for a victim of such spyware to even detect that their phone has been infected with Pegasus. \nIn the ongoing custody case between Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya at the Family Division of the High Court, her legal team said the hacking took place with his \"express or implied authority\".\nThe president of the court concluded that \"in relation to the mother (Princess Haya), it is clear that the [hacking] attempt succeeded with a very substantial amount of data (265MB) being covertly extracted from her phone\". \nSheikh Mohammed denied any knowledge of the hacking and said he did not instruct anyone to use NSO \"or any software in this way\". His legal team said he was not prepared to enter into any debate in relation to what security systems the UAE might have. \nThe allegations against Dubai's ruler were supported by testimony given by an expert technology witness, Dr William Marczak, who is based in California and is a senior research fellow at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which researches digital surveillance.\nHe told the court he had no doubt the phones were hacked using NSO's Pegasus software. He also concluded \"with high confidence\" that the phones were hacked by a single operator in a nation state. He concluded with medium confidence that it was most unlikely to be any state other than the UAE.\nPrincess Haya's legal team first became aware that they had been hacked after an urgent phone call made by Cherie Blair QC, the wife of former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, to Baroness Shackleton. Mrs Blair acts as an adviser to NSO Group on business and human rights related issues.\nA senior member of NSO's management team called Mrs Blair from Israel on 5 August 2020 to inform her that \"it had come to their attention that their software may have been misused to monitor the mobile phones of Baroness Shackleton and HRH Princess Haya\".\nThe NSO staff member then told Mrs Blair that those phones could no longer be accessed using NSO software and they asked for her help in contacting Baroness Shackleton.\nNSO, which has previously been accused by human rights groups of enabling autocratic states to carry out intrusive surveillance of dissidents and journalists, has insisted in public statements that it only supplied its spyware to enable governments to counter criminals and terrorists.\nNSO is believed to have terminated its contract with the UAE.\nThe hack took place during a critical phase in Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya's divorce custody case at the High Court in the summer of last year. \nThe guardian appointed for her children said it \"impacts crucially on the mother and her wellbeing. It is a very pernicious experience if the mother has been subjected to surveillance of the type that she understands that she has been\".\nPrincess Haya's legal team told the court that \"the mother has been living in fear of her life frankly, and in fear of the children's security since April of [2019]\".\nThe court also heard how Sheikh Mohammed had attempted to buy a property in Surrey, Parkwood Estate, so close to his ex-wife's home at Castlewood, that \"if anyone chose to use it, it is in prime position for direct or electronic surveillance\".\nHer legal team said \"there is a powerful objective case as to why the mother should be genuinely in fear if the father has access to a property overbearing her own\".\nReferring to the proposed property purchase, Princess Haya told the court: \"It feels as if I am being stalked, that there is literally nowhere for me to go to be safe from (the father), or those acting in his interests. It is hugely oppressive.\" \nSheikh Mohammed, a close ally of Britain's and a billionaire racehorse owner, was found by the High Court in March 2020 to have threatened and intimidated Princess Haya.\nThe court also found proven allegations that he kidnapped and forcibly returned to Dubai two of his own daughters, Sheikha Latifa and Sheikha Shamsa. \nThis February, BBC Panorama obtained secretly filmed footage of Sheikha Latifa saying she was imprisoned by her father in a villa converted into a jail.\nShe recounted how she had attempted to escape her family by boat in 2018 but was recaptured by armed men off the coast of India, tranquilised and forcibly returned to Dubai. \nThe UN later demanded to see proof she was alive and well. \nPhotographs have since been posted on social media showing her accompanied by female friends in a Dubai mall, and holidaying in Madrid and Iceland. \nHuman rights campaigners remain suspicious that she is still not at liberty or able to speak freely.\nA law firm saying it is acting on her behalf has asked the media to leave her alone.\nDuring the recent hearings in the High Court, Princess Haya's legal team said that previous abductions were made possible by hacking, which \"enabled the identification of the whereabouts of Princess Latifa and she was then rendered back to Dubai\". \nPrincess Haya, a daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan and half-sister of King Abdullah II, fled Dubai in 2019 for Britain along with her two children after learning that her husband had ordered the abduction of Sheikha Latifa and Sheikha Shamsa. \nShe has since said she is living in fear of her life after receiving threatening messages from agents of her former husband. \nNow her legal team is accusing agents of the Emirate of Dubai of acting on his behalf in hacking the phones of Princess Haya, her solicitors, Baroness Shackleton and Nick Manners, as well as her personal assistant and two members of her security staff. \nThe hacking took place in July and August 2020 \"at a time of significant events\" in the court proceedings when hearings were taking place over the welfare of the children.\nThe judgment concluded that \"the allegations of hacking came before the court at a time when it had already made very serious findings against the father\".\nDuring the long-running custody case at the High Court, Sheikh Mohammed has tried on several occasions through appeals to keep details of the allegations against him out of the public eye. But both in March 2020 and now, in October 2021, they have been made public, although he did not seek to appeal the most recent order permitting publication of these judgments. \nWednesday's ruling that, despite his denials, a sovereign ruler has interfered in the course of British justice by ordering the hacking of UK phones, including of a member of the House of Lords is both shocking, embarrassing and damaging to Sheikh Mohammed's international reputation.\nSumming up the hacking allegations made by Princess Haya, her barrister Nicholas Cusworth QC told the court: \"It is now clear, essentially, that the mother is engaged in a terrible game, a terrible life or death game of grandmother's footsteps in the dark. While she seeks answers about property purchases, hackers apparently get to work interfering with her privileged communications.\"\nAfter the publication of the judgments Sheikh Mohammed said in a statement: \"I have always denied the allegations made against me and I continue to do so. These matters concern supposed operations of state security. \n\"As a head of government involved in private family proceedings, it was not appropriate for me to provide evidence on such sensitive matters either personally or via my advisers in a foreign court.\"\nHe added: \"Neither the Emirate of Dubai nor the UAE are party to these proceedings and they did not participate in the hearing. The findings are therefore inevitably based on an incomplete picture.\n\"In addition, the findings were based on evidence that was not disclosed to me or my advisers. I therefore maintain that they were made in a manner which was unfair.\"\nEmbarrassing as this is for Sheikh Mohammed, there is little or no prospect of his ever having to face any police questioning. \nAs Dubai's sovereign ruler, he remains a huge figure in the equestrian world, he owns extensive properties in the UK and has been photographed with the Queen at race meetings such as Ascot. The emirate of Dubai is home to around 100,000 British expatriates and both he and the wider UAE government are considered close allies of the UK. \nThe story is unlikely to get much coverage in the government-monitored media in the UAE, and here in London the UAE Embassy has declined to comment on the case, saying it is a private family matter. \nThe sheikh himself has sovereign immunity from any future potential prosecution."

      "text": "The wave of job cuts many expected at the end of the furlough scheme has not happened, early data suggests.\nThe number of redundancies proposed by employers in September was close to record lows.\nMany businesses with large numbers of furloughed workers say they have taken everyone back, and unions had not heard of major redundancy processes.\nAround one million workers were thought to be on furlough when the scheme ended.\nThe furlough scheme, where government paid a proportion of workers' wages when their employers couldn't, ended in September after 18 months.\nThere were concerns that many employers would not be able to pay their workers' wages when the scheme ended, and would have to cut jobs. \nHowever, the number of firms planning redundancies was still close to record lows in September. \nJust over 200 firms in Great Britain informed the government of plans to make redundancies in September, with a total of 13,836 jobs at risk.\nThis was a slight increase on August, but far below the levels seen last summer, and among the lowest numbers seen in data which stretches back to 2006.\nThese figures don't include smaller firms, because employers are only obliged to notify government when making 20 or more jobs redundant.\nNonetheless the fact that they file at the start of the process gives an early indication of how the labour market is developing.\nOther evidence also suggests that the number of job losses as a direct result of the end of furlough was lower than had been feared. \nThe Community, CWU, GMB, Prospect, Unite and Usdaw trade unions had not received news of any major redundancies among their members when contacted by the BBC this week.\nGoogle searches for 'redundancy' - another early indicator of possible job losses - showed a small increase at the end of September, but it was still less than a quarter of the levels seen at the worst of the pandemic last summer.\n\"With estimates of actual redundancies and of real-time online searches related to redundancy both lower than before the pandemic, it looks like the worst is well and truly behind us now on job losses,\" said Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies.  \nAround a million people were thought to be on furlough by the time the scheme ended, of whom around half were working part-time and partly furloughed, according to estimates from the Resolution Foundation think-tank. \nThe BBC contacted the 31 employers which claimed \u00a31m or more in June, the most recent month for which official figures have been published.\nNone told the BBC they were making significant numbers of redundancies, though some declined to comment or failed to reply. \nMany of the big users for the furlough scheme were airlines and air travel businesses, as international travel is still far below pre-pandemic levels.\nBritish Airways was the biggest user of the scheme, claiming over \u00a310m in June. It had brought all its furloughed workers back by the end of September. \nOther major scheme users Easyjet, Jet2, Ryanair, Tui, Virgin Atlantic, Hays Travel, Airbus, delivery firm DHL, air traffic controller NATS, baggage handler Swissport, plus Gatwick, Heathrow, Manchester and Stansted airports all told the BBC they are not making redundancies because of the end of the furlough scheme.\nVirgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss wrote on LinkedIn that \"the furlough scheme has been crucial to Virgin Atlantic and many other companies throughout the pandemic, helping us to protect as many jobs as possible.\"\nTravel firms have already shed thousands of jobs in the early months of the pandemic.\nWith a number of travel restrictions lifted in recent weeks, and more to expected soon, many in the industry are optimistic that further job cuts will not be necessary.  \nOutside the travel industry, J D Wetherspoon and Travelodge said they had already brought all their furloughed workers back in the summer. \nHowever, some the workers returning from furlough may have to work part-time for a while, if firms don't have enough work to keep them busy full-time.\nAnd workers at smaller employers may not be so fortunate as those at larger companies.  \n\"Six in ten furloughed workers were at firms with less than 20 employees,\" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"I do worry about the capacity of those firms to bring back staff on a full-time basis.\""

      "text": "The US is \"deeply concerned\" about actions that undermine peace across the Taiwan Strait, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan has told the BBC. \nHis comments come after China sent a \"record number\" of military jets into Taiwan's air defence zone for four days in a row, in a public show of force.\nTaiwan considers itself a sovereign state - but China views the island as a breakaway province. \nBeijing has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification.\n\"We are going to stand up and speak out, both privately and publicly when we see the kinds of activities that are fundamentally destabilising,\" Mr Sullivan told the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale in Brussels on Thursday, a day after meeting China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi.\nAsked whether the US was prepared to take military action to defend Taiwan, Mr Sullivan said: \"Let me just say this, we are going to take action now to try to prevent that day from ever coming to pass.\"\nPressed on whether the US was reluctant to use force in the wake of its recent withdrawal from Afghanistan, Mr Sullivan said it was \"an enormous mistake to try to draw lessons\" from that conflict.\n\"Trying to say that coming out of Afghanistan somehow tells any country anything about the depth and level of commitment the US has elsewhere is a grave mistake.\"\nMr Sullivan said China was \"going to steadfastly defend its perspective on the world\".\nAnd he added: \"It's incumbent upon us as the United States, working with allies and partners to make clear where we stand, to stand up for our friends, to stand up for our interests... And that's what we intend to do.\"\nTaiwan broke away from the mainland as communists seized power in 1949. \nAnalysts have warned that Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned that Taiwan's government is moving the island towards a formal declaration of independence and wants to deter its President Tsai Ing-wen from taking any steps in that direction.\nHowever, US President Joe Biden said his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had agreed to abide by the \"Taiwan agreement\".\nMr Biden appeared to be referring to Washington's longstanding \"one China\" policy under which it recognises China rather than Taiwan.\nIn the BBC interview, Mr Sullivan also urged Russia not to exploit the growing energy crisis.\nHe said Moscow had in the past used energy as \"a tool of coercion and a political weapon\" - but any attempt to use the situation to its advantage would backfire on Russia.\nMr Sullivan also warned the British government that suspending the Northern Ireland Protocol to the Brexit deal would be a \"serious risk to stability\". \nHe said any possibility of a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was \"of serious concern to the US\".\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol ensures there is no need for checks along the land border between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).\nDuring Brexit negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority.\nAnd asked how long the US would wait while Iran delayed the resumption of talks on reviving a 2015 nuclear deal, Mr Sullivan said: \"We've just heard... that Iran is prepared to come back in a matter of a few short weeks, if that turns out not to be the case, then we will have to consult with allies and partners on a different way forward. \n\"If it does turn out to be the case, then we will see quite quickly whether the Iranians are serious at the table or whether they're simply coming to stall and delay for time. That's not a game that we're going to play.\"\nMr Sullivan stressed that the US was \"determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And we will use all the tools at our disposal to make sure that they do not\".\nIn 2015, Iran reached a deal with six powers - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - that saw Tehran limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief.\nBut the US abandoned the agreement in 2018, raising fears that the deal would collapse completely."

      "tags": "Abortion,Texas,US abortion debate,United States",
      "text": "Some Texas abortion clinics have reopened amid fears that a legal ruling which halted the state's near-total abortion ban may be short-lived. \nOther clinics have reported that concerns over lawsuits have prevented them from reopening. \nOn Wednesday, a US judge temporarily blocked the new law, which effectively bans women from having an abortion. \nTexas officials appealed against the ruling, setting the stage for further court battles in the coming months. \nAbortion care provider Whole Woman's Health, which runs four clinics across Texas, said it had already resumed offering abortion care on Thursday. \nSpeaking to reporters, Amy Hagstrom Miller, the firm's founder, said there had been an immediate spike in inquiries from patients seeking abortions in the wake of the judge's decision. \n\"Phone call volume has increased. There's actually hope from patients and staff,\" she said. \"There's a little desperation in that hope. Folks know this opportunity could be short-lived.\" \nDistrict Judge Robert Pittman's 113-page ruling earlier this week granted a request from the Biden administration to prevent enforcement of the law while its legality was being challenged. \nThis is the first legal setback for Texas since the law - which was drafted and approved by Republican politicians - was implemented.\nThe law effectively bans abortions from as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, at a time when most women will not be aware they are pregnant.\nDespite the injunction, some clinics remain hesitant to resume procedures as there is uncertainty over whether they could be sued retroactively if the law is re-instated. \nThe controversial law can be enforced by any individual from Texas or elsewhere, giving people the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week point. Women who get the procedure, however, cannot be sued. \nThe law includes a provision that stipulates clinics and doctors may still be liable for abortions carried out while an emergency injunction is in place, legal experts say. \nIt remains unclear whether such a provision can be enforced, with Judge Pittman saying in his ruling that it is \"of questionable legality\". \nMs Miller said that both patients and staff at Whole Woman's Health were worried about the possibility of retroactive lawsuits. \nOther abortion clinics said they were taking a cautious approach to resuming abortion care services. \nSources within Planned Parenthood's affiliate South Texas - which operates seven clinics in San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley - said that it remained unclear when they would resume providing abortion care. \nAmong the factors preventing an immediate restart of services, sources said, are concerns about retroactive lawsuits along with the possibility of trauma for patients who may get an appointment while the emergency injunction is in place but are forced to cancel later. \nAn abortion doctor working at an independent facility in Texas - who asked to remain anonymous - told the BBC he and other reproductive specialists were \"not optimistic\" about the possibility of the appeal from Texas officials. \n\"We're going right back to where the law was on 1 September. This will be the most conservative appeals court in the US,\" he said, referring to the conservative-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, where Texas intends to appeal the ruling. \n\"They're going to overrule the federal judge, and it's going to go back to where it was, and we're going to be in the same boat.\" \nSupporters of the law have harshly criticised the judge's decision. \nThe anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, for example, accused judges of \"catering to the abortion industry\" and called for a \"fair hearing\" at the next stage."

      "text": "A domestic abuse charity has called for an amendment to a new policing bill to recognise the seriousness of violence against women and girls.\nRefuge wants sexual violence, domestic homicide and domestic abuse specifically named as crimes that police and other public bodies must develop strategies to prevent.\nIt wants the bill's \"serious violence duty\" to include those crimes.\nThe Home Office said protecting women and girls was its top priority.\nA spokesman said it would consider any amendments to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill  - which is currently going through Parliament - as they are raised.\nRefuge launched its campaign for the amendment with an event at New Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police.\nIt brought 16 silhouettes to represent the 16 women said by the Femicide Census to have been killed by former and serving police officers since 2009.\nIt comes days after Home Secretary Priti Patel said there would be an inquiry into the \"systematic failures\" that allowed Wayne Couzens to continue to be a police officer, despite concerns over his behaviour.\nCouzens was sentenced to a whole-life prison term earlier this week after he kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while he was a serving officer, using his police warrant card.\nThe case has reignited debate over women's safety and further scrutiny of policing of crimes against them.\nSpeaking at the event, the charity's chief executive Ruth Davison said there was an \"enormous opportunity\" for the home secretary to bring about real change for women and girls by amending the policing bill.\nMaking sexual violence, domestic homicide and domestic abuse part of the serious violence duty would give police and other bodies \"the ability to act differently\" to address these crimes, she added.\nThe duty requires police, councils, criminal justice and health agencies to work together to prevent and tackle serious violence.\nShe told the BBC: \"As Refuge, we've been working on the frontlines of violence against women and girls for years, so we have known it's an epidemic, but it's been hidden behind closed doors.\n\"We're saying today enough is enough. These are the words of our own home secretary who said she's going to do everything in her power to end this epidemic.\n\"We say these words are really encouraging but they're not enough, what we need now is action.\"\nBaroness Kennedy, a patron of Refuge, said she intended to table an amendment to the bill in the House of Lords, adding such a change was needed to put violence against women and girls \"at the top level of the commitments and priorities of policing in Britain\".\nComedian Jo Brand, who is an ambassador for the charity, called on police to take more seriously the \"hidden epidemic of domestic violence\".\nCampaigners say misogyny - prejudice against women - is one of the \"root causes\" of violence against women and have called for it to be made a hate crime in England and Wales.\nBut earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he did not support calls to make misogyny a hate crime, insisting there was \"abundant\" existing legislation to tackle violence against women.\nIn July, the government unveiled its strategy for tackling violence against women and girls - with measures such as a 24-hour rape and sexual assault helpline, \u00a35m of funding to tackle violence in public places at night, and an online tool on which women and girls can log areas where they have felt unsafe.\nIt also saw Deputy Chief Constable Maggie Blyth appointed to the role of a new national policing lead for tackling violence against women and girls.\nA Home Office spokesman added: \"Protecting women and girls from violence and abuse is a top priority for this government. \n\"That is why the violence against women and girls strategy...sets out the government's ambition to increase support for survivors, bring perpetrators to justice, and, ultimately, reduce the prevalence of violence against women and girls.\""

      "tags": "Children,Vaccination,Malaria",
      "text": "Children across much of Africa are to be vaccinated against malaria in a historic moment in the fight against the deadly disease.\nMalaria has been one of the biggest scourges on humanity for millennia and mostly kills babies and infants. \nHaving a vaccine - after more than a century of trying - is among medicine's greatest achievements.\nThe vaccine - called RTS,S - was proven effective six years ago.\nNow, after the success of pilot immunisation programmes in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, the World Health Organization says the vaccine should be rolled out across sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high malaria transmission. \nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said it was \"a historic moment\". \n\"The long-awaited malaria vaccine for children is a breakthrough for science, child health and malaria control,\" he said. \"[It] could save tens of thousands of young lives each year.\"\nMalaria is a parasite that invades and destroys our blood cells in order to reproduce, and it's spread by the bite of blood-sucking mosquitoes.\nDrugs to kill the parasite, bed-nets to prevent bites and insecticides to kill the mosquito have all helped reduce malaria.\nBut the greatest burden of the disease is felt in Africa, where more than 260,000 children died from the disease in 2019. \nIt takes years of being repeatedly infected to build up immunity and even this only reduces the chances of becoming severely ill.\nDr Kwame Amponsa-Achiano piloted the vaccine in Ghana to assess whether mass vaccination was feasible and effective.\n\"It is quite an exciting moment for us, with large scale vaccination I believe the malaria toll will be reduced to the barest minimum,\" he said.\nConstantly catching malaria as a child inspired Dr Amponsa-Achiano to become a doctor in Ghana.\n\"It was distressing, almost every week you were out of school, malaria has taken a toll on us for a long time,\" he told me.\nThere are more than 100 types of malaria parasite. The RTS,S vaccine targets the one that is most deadly and most common in Africa: Plasmodium falciparum.\nTrials, reported in 2015, showed the vaccine could prevent around four in 10 cases of malaria, three in 10 severe cases and lead to the number of children needing blood transfusions falling by a third. \nHowever, there were doubts the vaccine would work in the real world as it requires four doses to be effective. The first three are given a month apart at five, six and seven months old, and a final booster is needed at around 18 months.\nThe findings of the pilots were discussed by two expert advisory groups at the WHO on Wednesday.\nThe results, from more than 2.3 million doses, showed:\n\"From a scientific perspective, this is a massive breakthrough, from a public health perspective this is a historical feat,\" said Dr Pedro Alonso, the director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme.\n\"We've been looking for a malaria vaccine for over 100 years now, it will save lives and prevent disease in African children.\"\nHaving just seen the world develop Covid vaccines in record time, you might be wondering why it has taken so long with malaria?\nMalaria is caused by a parasite which is far more insidious and sophisticated than the virus that causes Covid. Comparing them is like comparing a person and a cabbage.\nThe malaria parasite has evolved to evade our immune system. That's why you have to catch malaria time and time again before starting to get even limited protection. \nIt has a complicated life cycle across two species (humans and mosquitoes), and even inside our body it morphs between different forms as it infects liver cells and red blood cells.\nDeveloping a malaria vaccine is like nailing jelly to a wall and RTS,S is only able to target the sporozoite form of the parasite (this is the stage between being bitten by a mosquito and the parasite getting to the liver).\nIt is why the vaccine is 'only' 40% effective. However, this is still a remarkable success and paves the way for the development of yet more potent vaccines.\nThe vaccine, developed by the pharmaceutical giant GSK, is not going to replace all the other measures for controlling malaria such as insecticide-treated bed nets. It will be used alongside them to get closer to the goal of zero deaths from malaria.\nAnd it won't be used outside of Africa where different forms of malaria, which the vaccine can't protect against, are more prevalent.\nDr Ashley Birkett, from the Path malaria vaccine initiative, said rolling out the vaccine was a \"historic event\" that would \"take away fear\" from families.\nHe told me: \"Imagine your young child could be healthy one day and full of potential and then after the bite of an infected mosquito, while playing with friends or sleeping in a bed, they could be dead in a couple of weeks.\n\"Malaria is a huge problem, it's frightening and scary.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.\nThe wave of job cuts many feared at the end of the furlough scheme has not happened, early data suggests. The number of redundancies proposed by employers in September was close to record lows. Many businesses with large numbers of furloughed workers say they have taken everyone back - and unions had not heard of major redundancies. Around one million workers in the UK were thought to be on furlough when the scheme ended in September.\nAlmost a year after it was rolled out, the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine has finally reached the Antarctic. It was flown in this week to immunise the 23 staff members who've been keeping the British Rothera research station running through the polar winter. This is the most southerly dispatch yet for the jabs developed at Oxford University. Apart from some cases at a Chilean base, Antarctica has been Covid-free. The international science agencies want to keep it that way.\nMinisters in Northern Ireland are due to meet later to decide whether to lift some of the remaining Covid-19 restrictions on the hospitality sector. Social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) remains a legal requirement in pubs, bars and restaurants in Northern Ireland - but the industry has argued the rules are damaging trade. Any changes would be likely to begin on 14 October. In September, the NI executive agreed to end social distancing rules for shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings.\nIndia has begun delivering Covid-19 vaccines by commercial drones, a government scientist has told the BBC. Dr Samiran Panda said drones were delivering doses in mountainous states in the north-east of the country. India aims to vaccinate all eligible citizens by the end of 2021 - but experts say the drive needs to pick up pace to meet the target. About 70% of the country's eligible population have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to official data.\nFor some years ivermectin has been a vital anti-parasitic medicine used to treat humans and animals. But recently it has been labelled by some a Covid \"miracle\" drug - championed by vaccine opponents, and recommended by health authorities in some countries. However, the BBC can reveal there are serious errors in a number of key studies that the drug's promoters rely on.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

Greenpeace plans to appeal.\nThe UK government welcomed the outcome.\nIt follows a two-day hearing into the case last month.\nProduction from the development started in November after BP was granted approval by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) in 2018.\nGreenpeace said it was the first time an offshore oil permit had ever been challenged in court and that if it had won, the case would have had huge ramifications for other sites, such as the planned Cambo field off Shetland.\nRuth Crawford QC for Greenpeace said UK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng had been \"deprived\" of information about the environmental impact of the development.\nMs Crawford said Greenpeace wanted proper public participation in important developments such as the Vorlich oilfield.\nRoddy Dunlop QC, representing the UK government, said the challenges advanced by Greenpeace were \"largely procedural and opportunistic\".\nJim Cormack, representing oil firms BP and Ithaca, had previously told hearing that the challenge was \"highly significant\" and if the original decision was overturned, production from the field would have to stop until new consent could be obtained.\nHe said the works for which consent was granted had been implemented by BP and Ithaca at a cost of about \u00a3230m and the project was fully operational and in the production phase.\nThree judges at the Court of Session - Lord President Lord Carloway, Lord Menzies and Lord Pentland - rejected Greenpeace's case.\nThe UK government said in a statement: \"We welcome today's judgment which upholds the environmental decisions made by the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning.\n\"While we are working hard to drive down demand for fossil fuels, there will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming years as we transition to lower carbon, more secure forms of energy generated in this country.\"\nJohn Sauven, Greenpeace UK executive director, said: \"We will not give up the fight for the climate. Our intention is to appeal this ruling before the Supreme Court.\"\nIthaca said in a statement that it welcomed the decision handed down by the Court of Session to dismiss the appeal raised by Greenpeace."

Scotland has been dragging its heels on providing adequate and affordable accommodation for students for years, which is why we see large areas with substandard housing dominated by intimidating landlords.\"\nMr Crilly urged ministers to \"urgently intervene\" to address the situation and introduce a student housing strategy to ensure no student is left without a roof over their head.\nHe also called for rents to be brought under control and for a points-based rent controls system, which is tied to the property rather than the lease, in a bid to stop landlords being able to hike rents between tenancies.\nThe Scottish Green's education spokesman Ross Greer described the current situation as \"really grim\".\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: \"I am aware of one case of a mature student who, with her child at the moment, is in a homeless shelter because she has been unable to find accommodation.\"\nMr Greer said it was the result of a \"perfect storm\" of factors including house in multiple occupation (HMO) licence delays in Scotland, the popularity of short-term Airbnb-style lets and rent increases that have far outstripped the growth in wages.\nEarlier this week the programme heard from the parents of students who are struggling to find accommodation.\nOne said his son spoke to an estate agent who revealed one flat attracted 600 inquiries.\nAnd a mother said her son was currently commuting from Edinburgh to Glasgow for lectures as flat viewings in the city are typically full \"within five minutes.\"\nJohn Blackwood, chief executive of the Scottish Association of Landlords (SAL), said: \"We are seeing a chronic shortage of private rented accommodation across Scotland, partly as a result of landlords leaving the sector over the past couple of years which has reduced supply. \n\"In addition, landlords warned  in 2017 that an unintended consequence of the Private Residential Tenancy (PRT) could be a reduction in accommodation available to students as landlords were no longer able to offer fixed-term leases which matched with term times.  \n\"As a result, properties which landlords would hold back and market specifically for students are now rented by people as their primary home on a longer-term basis.  One of the key aims of the PRT has been achieved but it is students who are suffering.\"\nJamie Hepburn, the minister for higher and further education, said the government was concerned about the issues raised by NUS Scotland. \n\"While the Scottish Government has no direct role in the provision of student residential accommodation, we would strongly encourage students with those concerns to speak with their college or university,\" he added.  \n\"We are determined to improve accessibility, affordability and standards across the rented sector and are carrying out a review of purpose built student accommodation. \n\"We are also working to deliver a new deal for tenants giving them more secure, stable, affordable tenancies with improved standards of accommodation, new controls on rent and more flexibility to personalise homes.\""

      "text": "The public are being reminded to come forward for their flu jab to maximise their protection ahead of winter.\nHealth officials are worried because this will be the first winter Covid and flu circulate fully at the same time.\nResearch shows those infected with both viruses are more than twice as likely to die as someone with Covid alone.\nMore than 40 million people across the UK - 35 million in England - are being offered a jab this year in the biggest flu vaccination campaign so far.\nAnd this includes, for the first time, all secondary-school children up to the age of 16.\nAlongside the extended flu campaign, the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions are also being offered a Covid booster jab this autumn and winter.\nDr Jenny Harries, head of the newly formed UK Health Security Agency, warned the level of immunity to flu was likely to be lower this winter because very little of the virus had been circulating last year, because of social distancing and lockdown.\n\"It is really important people get vaccinated,\" she said.\n\"This is the first winter where we will have seasonal flu and Covid co-circulating.\"  \nProf Wendy Barclay, professor of virology at Imperial College London, told the BBC's Today Programme that it had been trickier to gauge which flu strains to cover with this year's vaccine because cases had been so low last year. \n\"The vaccine this year is updated to match what we predict will be the circulating strains,\" she said.\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said \"we need to take this seriously and defend ourselves\" by taking the vaccines when offered.\n\"Both these viruses are serious: they can both spread easily, cause hospitalisation and they can both be fatal,\" he said.\nFlu kills about 11,000 people on average every winter in England and during the last bad flu winter of 2017-18 the toll was more than double that - with more than 300 deaths a day during the peak.\nFlu and the other winter viruses also lead to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day in winter months - more, currently, than is being seen for Covid.\nAnd this winter, respiratory illness could hit very high levels, causing severe strain on the NHS and up to 60,000 deaths, according to a report from the Academy of Medical Sciences.\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of hospital admission in the under-fives, is already circulating at much higher levels than normal. \nThe winter warning comes as the government launches an advertising campaign, featuring TV medics Dr Amir Khan, Dr Dawn Harper and Dr Karan Ranj, to encourage those eligible to come forward for both the flu and Covid boosters.\nThe following groups are among those eligible for winter vaccines:\nGP surgeries will contact patients eligible for the free NHS flu vaccine or eligible patients can book an appointment at a pharmacy.\nPeople who qualify for the coronavirus booster are being told to wait until they are contacted.\nAnyone who is not eligible for a free flu jab can pay for it privately at many pharmacies, at a cost of about \u00a315.\nWhat questions do you have about the flu vaccine?"

      "text": "Ryanair and British Airways customers who say they are owed refunds because of Covid restrictions on travel could miss out because the competition regulator says the law is unclear.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has closed an investigation into the two airlines, saying there is a \"lack of [legal] clarity\".\nInstead of offering refunds, the carriers offered vouchers or rebooking.\nThis, the CMA believed, probably broke the law, and a probe was launched.\nAlthough some flights went ahead, many customers were prevented from taking them because of restrictions. The CMA said the law needed clarifying. \n\"After a thorough examination of relevant law, and the evidence it had gathered during its investigation, the CMA has concluded that the law does not provide passengers with a sufficiently clear right to a refund in these unusual circumstances to justify continuing with the case,\" the regulator said.\n\"Consumer protection law sets out that passengers are entitled to refunds when an airline cancels a flight, because the firm cannot provide its contracted services. However, it does not clearly cover whether people should be refunded when their flight goes ahead but they are legally prohibited from taking it.\"\nGlobal lockdown restrictions on air travel left many customers claiming ticket refunds and looking to the law for the protection.\nBut the CMA said prolonging the case through the courts \"could not be justified given the length of time it would take\".\nCMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli has now called for a change in the law, adding he strongly believes people prevented from taking flights due to lockdown should get a full refund.\n\"Given the importance of this to many passengers who have unfairly lost out, we hope that the law in this area will be clarified,\" he said.\nThe CMA's statement highlighted it had already secured commitments to refund hundreds of millions of pounds for people whose holidays were cancelled due to the pandemic, including from LoveHolidays, Lastminute.com, Virgin Holidays, TUI UK, Sykes Cottages, and Vacation Rentals. \nBoth Ryanair and BA welcomed the CMA's move and defended their actions.\nRyanair said: \"We operated a limited schedule during UK lockdowns for customers who travelled for essential reasons. Passengers had the option to change their bookings without paying the flight change fee and many availed of this option.\"\nAnd BA said: \"During this unprecedented crisis we have acted lawfully at all times, issuing nearly 4 million refunds and offering highly flexible booking policies enabling millions of our customers to change their travel dates or destinations.\"\nWere you hoping for a refund from BA or Ryanair?

People are dying, people are being hurt around the world - we must deal with these issues in the most kind way,\" he said.\n\"I came to England when these words, such as asylum-seeker, were not quite the same - more people are struggling and running from terror states.\n\"The world is much more violent than it was in the 1960s, so there is now greater pressure on the countries that are safe, they inevitably draw more people.\"\nIn an interview in 2016, when asked if he would call himself an \"author of postcolonial and/or world literature\", Gurnah replied: \"I would not use any of those words. I wouldn't call myself a something writer of any kind.\n\"In fact, I am not sure that I would call myself anything apart from my name. I guess, if somebody challenges me, that would be another way of saying, 'Are you a... one of these...?' I would probably say 'no'. Precisely, I don't want that part of me having a reductive name.\"\nThe Nobel Prizes, which have been awarded since 1901, recognise achievement in literature, science, peace and latterly economics.\nPast winners have included novelists such as Ernest Hemingway, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Toni Morrison, poets such as Pablo Neruda, Joseph Brodsky and Rabindranath Tagore, and playwrights including Harold Pinter and Eugene O'Neill.\nLast year's award was won by American poet Louise Gluck. \nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Local Government Association,Local government,Institute for Fiscal Studies",
      "text": "Council tax in England could rise by as much as \u00a3220 per year within three years, researchers have said.\nThis is to keep local services running and help pay for social care reforms, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank said.\nIt comes amid warnings that councils continue to face severe funding pressures due to the pandemic and must find new sources of income.\nThe government said it had given them \u00a312bn since the start of the crisis.\nUnder current government spending plans, council tax bills will need to rise by at least 3.6% a year just to keep services running at pre-pandemic levels, the IFS said.\nThat would mean bills would have to rise by \u00a3160 by 2024-25, it said.\nBut extra cost pressures that eat into central government grants could easily push up council tax by 5% a year, or \u00a3220 by 2024-25, it said.\nIn addition, the government's plans for social care, which include capping costs, won't be completely paid for by a planned rise in National Insurance contributions, the IFS said.\nThe plans are likely to cost \u00a35bn per year eventually, it said, nearly three times the funding currently allocated.\nThe government has made much of the idea that after decades of governments neglecting the increasingly pressing issue of underfunded social care, this was a nettle it was determined to grasp.\nWhat's concerning in the IFS report is who might get stung. \nA large part of the goal of the social care reforms was to address unfairness in the means-testing system.\nBut the IFS report highlights the risk that, without further funding, it could create new unfairness elsewhere.\nTo extend publicly-funded care to those who've spent \u00a386,000 of their own money on fees will cost extra, and local authorities may only be able to recoup that by tightening eligibility criteria - so many poorer people lose access.  \nSecond, the way the funds are allocated to local authorities dates back to 2013.\nBecause some areas like Blackpool have seen their populations fall, but others, like Tower Hamlets have seen them jump since then, the risk is that the money won't go where it needs to.\nIFS research economist Kate Ogden said: \"The government has stepped up with billions in additional funding for councils to support them through the last 18 months.\n\"It is likely to have to find billions more for councils over the next couple of years if they are to avoid cutting back on services, even if they increase council tax by 4% a year or more.\"\nShe said that the coming financial year is \"likely to be especially tough\", with ongoing Covid-19-related pressures and squeezes on budgets\nShe added that the local government funding system was \"hopelessly out of date\", being based on 2013 population levels, leading to \"unfairness\" in the distribution of resources between councils.\nCouncil tax goes towards funding local services such as policing, the fire service and street cleaning. The funding is topped up with grants from central government and business taxes.\nHowever, these central government grants were slashed between 2009-10 and 2019-20, especially in areas such as public transport, housing and planning.\nThe Local Government Association said councils \"continue to face severe funding and demand pressures that will stretch the local services our communities rely on to the limit\".\n\"The significant financial pressures facing local services cannot be met by council tax income alone,\" said LGA chairman James Jamieson. \"Councils are particularly alarmed that the government's solution for tackling social care's core existing pressures appears to be solely through the use of council tax, and the social care precept.\"\nMr Jamieson called for local services to be \"the top priority\" in the upcoming Spending Review.\nA government spokesperson said: \"The government has allocated more than \u00a312bn directly to councils since the start of the pandemic - with more than \u00a36bn available to spend as they see fit - recognising that councils are best placed to deal with local issues.  \n\"We have also taken historic action to fix the social care crisis - the Health and Social Care Levy will raise \u00a312bn a year to fund the NHS and social care. \n\"The Spending Review will continue to focus on supporting jobs and delivering the public's key priorities.\""

      "text": "Long delays outside hospitals are costing ambulance crews thousands of hours when they are unable to respond to other calls, a new report has found. \nIt found frequent delays were having a \"detrimental\" impact on the NHS's ability to care for patients.\nA Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) report looked at patient delays between April 2020 and March 2021.\nDuring this period, crews had to wait more than an hour to transfer patients on no fewer than 32,699 occasions.\n\"It's an entire system issue. I'm not under any illusion that's an easy fix for anyone, but we do need the system to work closely together,\" said Alun Jones, interim chief executive of HIW.  \nThey key findings of the report include:\nThe review was based on assessment, interviews and surveys with more than 400 NHS staff and more than 100 patients.\nHIW makes clear that handover delays are not directly an ambulance service problem, but symptomatic of problems across the entire health and social care system.\nA&Es become overcrowded when hospital wards are full and hospital wards become full when there are delays in discharging patients.\nThe report makes 20 recommendations and says the ambulance service, health boards and Welsh government need to work together to make improvements.\nClaire Roche of the Welsh Ambulance Service said: \"Our emergency ambulance service exists to deliver life-saving immediate care and to take patients promptly to hospital for the necessary treatment.\n\"For the Welsh Ambulance Service, this is about getting to the root cause of the issue in order to resolve it, rather than adapting to a situation so that it becomes the new normal.\n\"We welcome the fact that Health Inspectorate Wales is shining a light on this issue, and we will continue to work with colleagues in health boards and Welsh government to make improvements.\"\nDarren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation said the review \"demonstrates the impact that the enormous pressures on the NHS are having\".\n\"The NHS in Wales is working relentlessly to cope with current levels of demand and to ensure everyone waiting for care is seen as soon as possible,\" he added.\n\"Staff are doing all they can to continue delivering care for those who need it. We thank them and the public for doing all they can to support the NHS.\"\nThe Welsh government said: \"Health boards are responsible for improving ambulance patient handover times and we expect to see them deliver improvement in this area.\n\"A broad range of actions are already in place, including recruitment of additional ambulance clinicians, creation of urgent primary care centres and a new national programme to support people to return home from hospital when ready.\"\n\"We will continue to work with the chief ambulance services commissioner, WAST and Wales' wider health and care system to improve quality of care, patient experience and staff wellbeing.\"\nChris Williams-Ellis was left with 45% burns after a car he was working beneath caught fire.\nHe waited an hour and 18 minutes for an ambulance despite eight 999 calls being made from his home in Brynsaithmarchog, Denbighshire, on 8 September last year. \nThe first was made at 14:51 by Mr Williams-Ellis's partner Catherine, followed by seven more from the fire service, the final one being at 16:04.\nAn air ambulance arrived at 16:17.\nHis mother, Philomene Williams-Ellis, said on Thursday: \"The ambulance was called and it didn't come.\n\"The time it took between when the call was made and when the helicopter landed at Liverpool was just a minute off three hours.\" \nAs he waited he was looked after by fire crews who were attending. \n\"The flesh was coming off his body, he was in absolute agony,\" Ms Williams-Ellis said. \n\"All the time Christopher waited he was fully aware of what was happening to him and what was happening around him.\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service has met Ms Williams-Ellis to discuss what went wrong. \n\"There were 36 ambulances supposed to be on call that day,\" she said. \nFour were off \"for various reasons\", she said. \n\"Thirty-two were in car parks at various hospitals and they were there for hours and hours.\" \nThe reason, she said, was because patients were waiting in the vehicles until there was space for them to be seen in the hospitals. \n\"For almost an hour there was not one emergency vehicle available.\"\nShe said the NHS in Wales was \"not for purpose.\" \n\"The person who needs to answer is the minister for health in Wales and the trusts who are running the hospitals.\"\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service NHS trust offered a \"sincere apology\" last year for \"errors\" that contributed to an \"unacceptable\" delay.\nMs Williams-Ellis said her son was \"doing really well\". \n\"He has life-changing injuries but he is a very positive person with a good attitude.\n\"He gets on with it. But there is a lot of anger.\" "

      "tags": "Companies,Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Oil & Gas industry",
      "text": "More than a million extra British households won't be able to afford to heat and power their homes next spring, according to a charity.\nEnergy bills are expected to rise again in April to reflect the rising wholesale price of gas.\nNational Energy Action says 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households will be plunged into fuel poverty.\nHouseholds that spend a high proportion of their income on energy bills are considered to be in fuel poverty.\nAt the start of October the energy price cap, which limits the impact of rising energy prices on households in England, Scotland and Wales, was raised to take the sharply rising wholesale gas price into account.\nBut Ofgem, the energy regulator, said the price cap would have to rise again next year if wholesale gas prices continue to go up.\nAnalysts said this could mean a typical customer paying between \u00a3400 and \u00a3600 more per year. \nHouseholds in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they aren't protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain.\nIf you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company.\nNormally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now.\nUntil recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available.\nThe cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase.\nSo for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter.\nNational Energy Action (NEA) said this month's price rises had already pushed half a million more households into fuel poverty.\n\"It's building into a brutal and bleak winter for millions. If the price cap goes up by \u00a3400 to \u00a3600 a year it could plunge 1.2 to 1.5 million households into fuel poverty, leaving almost 5.5 million households struggling to keep their homes warm and safe,\" said NEA chief executive Adam Scorer.\nNEA is calling for more support to be put in place for low income households.\nOfgem, the energy regulator, said it expected prices would rise further in April. \nIts chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the energy cap was \"designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time\".\nNatural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. \nAs a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it.\nEven with the raising of the cap this month Mr Brearley said more energy firms could run into difficulties.\n\"Given the continued volatility in the market, it is likely more suppliers will exit the market,\" he told an energy conference on Thursday.\nNine firms have already gone out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers.\nThose households have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds, since new providers aren't able to match lower-rate fixed deals that were on offer when gas prices were lower.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who was also attending the conference, said the right response to rising gas prices was to renew the UK's commitment to renewable energy.\nThe government recently pledged to shift electricity generation away from fossil fuels entirely by 2035.\n\"The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,\" he said.\nDecarbonising heating and power would mean lower prices he said. \n\"Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nHowever, customers will question whether the cost of the making the transition to lower carbon energy could push bills higher in the short term.\nThe next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February but will come into force in April.\nAnalysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by \u00a3400 meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay around \u00a31,660 a year.\nHowever the Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills.\nIt said that the next increase in the price cap could be \u00a3500 or even higher.\nFounder Joe Malinowski warned: \"If things don't settle down soon, increases of \u00a3600, \u00a3700 or even \u00a3800 cannot be ruled out.\"\nBusinesses are also feeling the impact of rising energy costs. Firms are warning that could lead to higher prices for their goods as increases are passed on to consumers.\nRichard Walker, managing director of supermarket chain Iceland, said steep rises in energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now \"inevitable\".\n\"The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Our margins are very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases.\"\nMark Nicholson and his business partner set up their firm Harvey George Furniture four years ago in Hull. Today they employ about 30 people making bespoke bathroom and bedroom furniture. \nThe past 18 months have been so good that they've moved premises to expand - and invested about \u00a3500,000 in new technology and machinery to keep up with demand.\n\"It's a gas guzzler - unfortunately for us it's a big gas guzzler,\" he says of their new painting machine, which is piped into the mains and is able to produce colourful furniture much faster. \n\"Any business, it's about cost and quite a big component for us is energy, so it's quite a scary thought. Our last bill was \u00a38,000 - it was a shock.\n\"We'll keep going. But we could just do with some stability on our costs. It feels like everything - rates, recruitment, materials, shipping - now energy... feels very up and down.\" \nThe energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThat includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas.\nWhen the cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019.\nThose on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of \u00a3139 - from \u00a31,138 to \u00a31,277 a year.\nPrepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a \u00a3153 increase.\nThat is a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by \u00a384, to \u00a31,042.\nWill you be affected by rising energy prices?

      "text": "The head of the navy has been selected as the next chief of Britain's armed forces - the first in 20 years.\nBoris Johnson has chosen Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, 55, to take over the position from General Sir Nick Carter.\nThe prime minister said the new Chief of Defence Staff had proved himself as an \"outstanding military leader\".\nHe is credited with \"overseeing a period of transformation\" in the navy, that has seen \"more ships deployed, for longer, all over the world\".\nSir Tony will be responsible for leading and setting strategy for defence, as well as conducting operations and maintaining relationships with other military leaders.\nThis year, he oversaw the deployment of the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier and a string of supporting vessels into the Pacific as part of a more aggressive posture towards China.\nMr Johnson said: \"Admiral Tony will lead the armed forces at a time of incredible change while upholding the values and standards that they are respected for around the world. \n\"I know he will bring drive and dedication to the job and I look forward to working with him.\"\nThe PM thanked Sir Nick, whose term had come to an end, for his \"decades of steadfast duty spent keeping the UK, its citizens and our allies safe\".\nHe added: \"I have valued his wisdom and support through moments of national crisis, including the Covid pandemic.\n\"He leaves his post at the end of November with the armed forces in excellent health, ready to face whatever challenges tomorrow brings.\"\nJonathan Beale, defence correspondent\nThe appointment of Admiral Sir Tony Radakin marks a shift. \nWhen Boris Johnson announced extra investment in defence last November, he promised to restore Britain's position as the \"foremost naval power in Europe\". \nThe Integrated Defence Review also signalled a \"tilt\" to the Indo Pacific region in recognition of the rising power of China. Maritime power is seen as key to that. \nHence the current deployment of the Aircraft Carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth to the region. \nSir Tony was also involved in the early discussions that led to the Aukus agreement - the commitment by the US and UK to help Australia build a new fleet of nuclear powered submarines.\nUK defence is also investing heavily in its two new aircraft carriers; four new nuclear armed submarines and a fleet of new frigates. \nThe fact that Sir Tony is politically and media savvy has helped. \nSome question his lack of operational experience - he's spent more time behind a desk than driving ships.  \nBut he has delivered for the navy, cutting the number of admirals and increasing the navy's days at sea. \nThe prime minister believes he's the man who can help transform the armed forces, and just as important to Boris Johnson, help boost British defence exports. \nSir Tony was appointed First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in June 2019.\nCommissioned in 1990, his operational service has included responding to tanker disputes in Gulf, security duties in the Falklands, countering smuggling in Hong Kong and the Caribbean, and three command tours in Iraq.\nSir Tony said he was \"humbled\" to be selected as the new head of the armed forces.\n\"It will be an immense privilege to lead our outstanding people who defend and protect the United Kingdom,\" he added."

      "title": "Find more money for universal credit, says senior Tory Steve Baker",

      "text": "The government should find \u00a310bn a year to boost universal credit, former Tory minister Steve Baker has said. \nThe \u00a320-a-week increase to the benefit officially ended on Wednesday despite warnings about a squeeze on living standards and rising prices.\nMr Baker said it should be an \"absolute priority\" to find extra funds as part of the upcoming spending review. \nThe government says the benefit boost was always meant to be temporary and it is helping the most needy.\nClaims the government is out of touch with the plight of low-income families were fuelled by an interview with the New Statesman on Wednesday by Tory grandee, Sir Peter Bottomley.\nHe said MPs need a pay rise as some were struggling financially to cope on an annual salary of just over \u00a380,000.\n\"I don't know how they manage. It's really grim,\" he said, arguing that a salary of around \u00a3110-\u00a3115,000 a year was needed to bring them in to line with GPs. \nSpeaking to LBC radio, Mr Bottomley explained he was not arguing for pay rises.\nHe said he was trying to make the point that increasing MPs' salaries would make it easier to widen the pool of people interested in switching their careers to become parliamentarians.\nHigher wages would make it possible for headteachers and senior executives in nursing to come to sit in Parliament rather than it being the preserve of the independently wealthy, he said. \nHis comments come as a social media film emerged of Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey singing (I've Had) The Time of My Life at this week's Conservative conference in Manchester. \nLabour called the timing of her karaoke performance, as benefits are cut for millions of people, \"an insult and a disgrace\".\nBut Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it was \"unfair\" to link the two.\nHe told ITV's Good Morning Britain that \"parties and dance-offs and singing is a feature of all party conferences\", and Ms Coffey had also announced the hardship fund at Manchester.\nMinisters have admitted that many UK households could face \"a very difficult winter\".\nEnergy prices are surging at the same time as the universal credit top-up being withdrawn and taxes are rising to fund the NHS and social care.\nBut asked during the Conservative Party conference about the pressure on family incomes, the prime minister told the BBC he was \"not worried\"  because supply chain issues will sort themselves out \"rapidly\".\nAnd he said the economy was facing the \"stresses and strains\" of a post-Covid recovery as it moves to a \"new approach\" with higher wages and lower immigration.\nHe said government schemes, such as a \u00a3500m hardship fund, would help those on the lowest incomes. \nSpeaking to ITV's Peston, Mr Baker - an influential figure on the right of the Conservative Party - said the government should find \u00a310bn a year to improve universal credit. \nHe said the \u00a320-a-week top-up, which was introduced to help people on low incomes through the pandemic, should be retained.\nHe also said he had urged the government to improve the taper rate, which reduces the amount individuals can claim for every extra pound they earn, as an \"absolute priority\".\nBut he added that he will vote for whatever the government decides in its Spending Review at the end of this month.\nCurrently for every \u00a31 claimants earn over their work allowance their benefit is reduced by 63p.\nSpeaking on the BBC News Channel, Shadow Business Secretary, Ed Miliband said Labour was \"not giving up\" on attempts to reverse the cut to universal credit. \n\"It beggars belief\" he said ,that in the context of escalating energy prices and tax rises, \"the government is ploughing ahead\" with the cut to the benefit.  \nPeople are facing a \"double whammy\" and the situation is going to be \"unbearable for so many families\" he added and targeting support through the social security system is the best way to help them.
