      "text": "The Mail on Sunday has been ordered to publish a front-page statement about the Duchess of Sussex winning her copyright claim against the newspaper.\nMeghan sued the paper for a copyright breach over the publication of a letter to her father and won most of her claim.\nA High Court judge ruled the MoS must print on its front page and page three that it infringed her copyright.\nThe MailOnline must also publish the statement \"for a period of one week\".\nA spokesman for the Mail On Sunday said: \"We will be applying to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal, including in relation to aspects of the judgment today.\"\nMeghan, 39, brought the legal action against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) - the publisher of both the MoS and MailOnline.\nIt was over a handwritten letter to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018, parts of which were later published in news articles. \nLast month, she won her privacy claim and most of her copyright claim. The judge ruled the letter was \"personal and private\" and Meghan had a \"reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private\".\nThe publisher's lawyers applied for permission to appeal earlier this week but Lord Justice Warby refused.\nIn Friday's ruling the judge Lord Justice Warby said the MoS must print a single statement on the front page, referring readers to a further statement on page three.\n\"The defendant devoted a very considerable amount of space to the infringing articles, which it continued to publish for over two years,\" he said.\n\"It has devoted a very considerable number of further column inches, and many hundreds if not thousands of words, to coverage of earlier stages of this litigation and commentary upon them.\n\"The wording sought is modest by comparison and factual in nature.\"\nThe MailOnline must publish the statement for a week with a link to his full judgment.\nThe judge also granted Meghan a declaration that ANL \"misused her private information and infringed her copyright\".\nAlthough the judge found the publication of the letter infringed the duchess's copyright, there will still be a trial to decide whether Meghan is the exclusive owner of copyright in all parts of the letter, or whether any other person owns a share.\nThere will also be further hearings to determine whether the duchess is entitled to any profits or financial remedies relating to her claim."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A mystery person in the UK infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil has now been traced.\nLast week, it was announced that six cases of the P.1 variant had been found in the UK - but the identity of one of the cases was unknown.\nThe person, who lives in Croydon, has been traced, as have their contacts.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the person \"stayed at home\" and there was no sign of any onward transmission - but local testing is being rolled out.\nScientists say the variant appears to be more contagious and there are concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it.\nBut Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said it hoped vaccines would have a strong impact on reducing hospitalisations and deaths in cases of the new variant.\nNews that the Brazil variant had been found in the UK was released last Sunday. Three cases were found in England, and separately three in Scotland.\nThe three cases in Scotland were all oil workers who were returning to their families from Brazil, via Paris and London. Health officials have been trying to trace all the passengers who were on their flight from Heathrow to Aberdeen.\nIn England, two of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire who tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February.\nThe third case in England - now confirmed to be in Croydon - was unknown for several days after he or she failed to register their test properly.\nDr Hopkins said the person was finally identified when they called the NHS 111 number, after officials had spent days contacting potential households. \nThe person lived in a household that had recently returned from Brazil and all of them had quarantined at home, she added.\nMr Hancock said contact-tracers had worked \"flat out\" to narrow the search.\n\"The best evidence is this person in question stayed at home and there's no sign that there's been any onward transmission but as a precaution we're putting more testing in in Croydon, where they live, to minimise risk of spread,\" he said.\nEarlier this week, Mr Hancock said work was under way to tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of the new strains.\nDr Hopkins said there was not yet data to show whether the vaccine was effective against this variant - but there was some data for the variant from South Africa \"and we expect that it should at least perform in a similar way\".\n\"And therefore we think that it's likely there may be some reduction in risk of transmission, or reducing the risk of transmission, but we at least hope at the moment that it will have a strong impact in reducing hospitalisations and deaths.\n\"We do need to wait for studies to come out from South America and in particular Brazil, and those will come but it will take weeks rather than days I'm afraid.\"\nThe variant has been designated \"of concern\" because it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa.\nOne of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade some of the immunity people may have already built against Covid.\nPreliminary data from Manaus - the Brazilian city hit hard by this P.1 variant - suggested the variant could be up to twice as transmissible as earlier Covid.\nBut experts said this should not be used to predict what might happen in the UK.\nOne of the lead researchers said it was unlikely P.1 would quickly take off in Britain when only six cases had been identified and these were being closely monitored.\nMeanwhile, two-fifths of all adults in the UK have now had their first dose of the vaccine, Mr Hancock also said at Friday's press conference.\nHe said the fall in the number of deaths was accelerating - down 41% compared with last week - which suggested the vaccination programme was working. \n\"What this all shows is that the link from cases to hospitalisations and then to deaths that had been unbreakable before the vaccine - that link is now breaking,\" he said.\nLatest government figures show the total number of people who have had their first dose of vaccine has now reached 21,358,815, while the number who have had their second dose has topped one million.\nThere have been another 5,947 cases announced and a further 236 people recorded as having died within 28 days of testing positive."

      "text": "A new investigation has been launched into the disastrous Metropolitan Police VIP abuse inquiry, Operation Midland.\nMerseyside Police will examine why Scotland Yard did not refer two false accusers for criminal investigation despite an official recommendation.\nA third accuser, Carl Beech, is in jail for falsely accusing public figures of murder and child sexual abuse.\nBeech was only investigated when the Met followed a recommendation that he be looked at by an independent force. \nThe recommendations for Beech and the two other accusers came in a damming 2016 report by retired High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques, who found more than 40 failings in Operation Midland.\nBeech, referred to as \"Nick\" during Operation Midland, made false claims of sexual abuse and child murder about a group of MPs, generals and senior figures in the intelligence services in the 1970s and 1980s.\nMet officers searched the homes of former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, D-Day veteran and former chief of the defence staff Lord Bramall, and former home secretary Lord Brittan's widow, Lady Diana Brittan.\nThe issue of why the other two false accusers, known as A and B, were not investigated was first highlighted by the BBC. \nSir Richard Henriques found that both men \"deliberately lied\" and that their allegations had extended the 18-month inquiry.\nHe recommended that \"offences of attempting to pervert the course of justice be considered in the cases of A and B\" and said it would be appropriate for another police force to carry out such investigations.\nScotland Yard did not refer the men to another force, but this only emerged three years later when a largely unredacted version of the report was published.\nCarl Beech was referred to Northumbria Police. \nHe is now serving 18 years in jail for perverting the course of justice, as well as paedophile offences uncovered by Northumbria detectives.\nA and B, who both have criminal records for dishonesty, were first interviewed by Operation Midland officers in September 2015, nearly a year after the operation started.\nFollowing Sir Richard's recommendation, Scotland Yard decided against referring the pair for investigation despite a senior officer privately saying they were liars.\nThe Henriques report quoted from a presentation given to Sir Richard in August 2016 by then Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw Operation Midland, in which he said: \"I am satisfied that both A and B have told deliberate lies.\"\nDespite this admission, months earlier Scotland Yard had publicly stated that Operation Midland detectives \"have not found evidence to prove that they were knowingly misled by a complainant\".\nIn October 2019, Harvey Proctor submitted a formal complaint that A and B had not been investigated, which resulted in the Met asking the police watchdog to examine an apparent failure to record the decision not to start an inquiry to a sufficient standard. \nLast summer, Merseyside Police were asked by the Met to conduct a probe into the issue, but it has taken months to agree the terms of reference.\nMerseyside will now examine Mr Proctor's complaint about why A and B were not investigated for perverting the course of justice and wasting police time, despite Mr Rodhouse allegedly stating that he knew they were deliberate liars.\nMr Proctor told the BBC: \"I am very pleased that Merseyside Police are investigating these matters.\"\nA Met spokesman said the force would co-operate fully with the Merseyside inquiry."

      "tags": "Public sector,Nursing,NHS,Pay",
      "text": "A nurses' union has set up a \u00a335m fund to prepare for possible strike action over a proposed 1% pay rise for NHS workers in England.\nThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) called this \"pitiful\", arguing that its members should get 12.5% instead.\nIt would have to hold a ballot before strikes could go ahead. \nLabour said NHS \"heroes\" deserved more money, but the government insisted 1% was \"what's affordable\" at a difficult time for the public finances. \nAt least 1.3 million other public sector staff - including teachers, the armed forces, firefighters and police officers - are about to have their pay frozen for a year.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care recommended the 1% pay rise to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries. \nIt would cover nearly all hospital staff, but not GPs and dentists. The panel is due to make its own pay recommendations in early May, when ministers will make their final decision.  \nA government spokesperson said 1% was a \"real-terms increase\", as the latest official inflation figure was 0.9%.\nBut RCN general secretary Dame Donna Kinnair warned it would mean just \u00a33.50 more per week in take-home pay for an experienced nurse.\n\"This is pitiful and bitterly disappointing,\" she said. \"The government is dangerously out of touch with nursing staff, NHS workers and the public.\"\nThe RCN's governing council voted on Friday to set up a \u00a335m \"industrial action fund\" to support members who would lose income during a strike.\nAnd the public sector Unison union has called for a \"mass slow handclap\" at 20:00 next Thursday, over what general secretary Christine McAnea described as a \"miserly\" offer.\nEmily Huntingford, an intensive care nurse at a London hospital, said she had been \"completely shocked\" when she heard about the 1% pay rise.\n\"The first thing that came into my mind was that this is insulting,\" she added. \"It shows a complete disregard for the work NHS workers have done this year.\n\"This whole year has taken a lot of personal sacrifice for all of us. We've put ourselves at risk.\"\nBut Emma, a nurse who works in Nottingham, said that \"even though 1% isn't much, it's still a pay rise\".\nShe told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat that all public sector workers and key workers - not just NHS staff - should get the same.\nHealth minister, and former nurse, Nadine Dorries said she was \"pleasantly surprised\" that any rise had been proposed, with the government set to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds this year to support people and businesses through the pandemic.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that nurses \"do their job because they love their job\", adding that \"we totally appreciate their efforts over the past year\".\nLabour said the government's promise to reward NHS workers for their efforts during the pandemic \"now lie in tatters\".\n\"Boris Johnson is cutting nurses' pay,\" said shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, who - in contrast to ministers - called the 1% rise a \"real-terms pay cut\".\nSome staff, whose pay bands are being changed due to restructuring, will get more than a 1% increase as the result of a previously agreed three-year pay deal. \nThe NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations.\nThe Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will be delayed until the summer because of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an \"interim\" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement.\nNHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised a one-off \u00a3500 \"special recognition\" payment in January, following a similar announcement in Scotland.\nThe Welsh government has said it will not set a \"ceiling\" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22."

Residents were told they could return home but were warned to stay off beaches.\nThe South Pacific archipelagos of New Caledonia and Vanuatu have been warned to prepare for dangerous waves.\nTheir coasts could see wave surges as high as 3m (10ft), while parts of South America - including Peru, Ecuador and Chile - were warned they could see 1m waves reaching their coasts.\nThe Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said \"tsunami waves have been observed\", but as yet no damage had been reported.\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern posted on Instagram: \"Hope everyone is ok out there.\"\nThe three earthquakes, all above 7.0 magnitude, came during the early hours of Friday.\nThe last, at 8.1, struck at around 08:30 near the uninhabited Kermadec Islands, 1,000 km (621 miles) north-east of New Zealand.\nWhile earlier tsunami warnings had been called off, the third quake prompted the National Emergency Management Agency to send out a new alert and tsunami sirens sounded in some areas.\nThe agency told people near the coast in several areas to move immediately to high ground or get inland as far as possible.\nIt said \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges\" with tsunami activity continuing for several hours.\nLocal media reported gridlock in towns such as Whangarei and Whakatane as people tried to flee their homes, schools and workplaces.\nIn nearby Ohope town, resident Leslie Peake was quoted by the New Zealand Herald as saying the traffic was \"bumper to bumper\" with \"huge queues of people evacuating\".\nNew Zealand's civil defence department advised people to walk or cycle to avoid getting caught in traffic\nMeanwhile local media posted footage of waves rolling into Tokomaru Bay.\nJust last week, New Zealand marked the 10th anniversary of the 6.3 magnitude earthquake that destroyed parts of Christchurch in the south Island, killing 185 people.\nTsunami warnings were also issued for Hawaii and American Samoa, but later stood down.\nPatrick Ti'a Reid, 37, was among those in American Samoa, situated some 3,300 km (2,000 miles) north-east of New Zealand, who had been told to evacuate to higher ground in an emergency bulletin.\n\"Alarms went off in our executive office building and we immediately took for higher ground,\" Mr Ti'a Reid, who works for the government in the US territory, told the BBC.\nHe said the tsunami of 2009, which was triggered by an 8.1-magnitude earthquake, was \"very much vivid in many Samoans' minds\".\nAre you in the region?

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has said Buckingham Palace could not expect her and Prince Harry to be silent if it was \"perpetuating falsehoods about us\". \nIn a clip of Oprah Winfrey's interview with the couple, Meghan had been asked how she felt about the palace hearing her \"speak your truth today\".\nMeghan also said: \"If that comes with risk of losing things, I mean... there is a lot that has been lost already.\"\nBuckingham Palace is investigating claims the duchess bullied royal staff.\nThe allegations of bullying levelled at Meghan were published after the interview with Oprah was recorded.\nThe interview with Oprah, which will air in the US on Sunday and in the UK on Monday, is expected to detail Harry and Meghan's short period as working royals together before they stepped down for a life in the US.\nIn the 30-second teaser clip released by CBS, Oprah asks the duchess: \"How do you feel about the palace hearing you speak your truth today?\"\nMeghan replies: \"I don't know how they could expect that, after all of this time, we would still just be silent if there is an active role that The Firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us.\"\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. \nA report in the Times newspaper on Wednesday claimed the duchess faced a complaint made in October 2018, while the duke and duchess were living at Kensington Palace after their marriage in May of that year.\nA leaked email sent from a staff member, which was published by the newspaper, alleges that Meghan drove two personal assistants out of the household. The report claims she undermined the confidence of a third member of staff.\nIn a statement later, Buckingham Palace - which is responsible for the hiring of royal staff - said it was \"clearly very concerned about allegations in the Times\" and its HR team would look into the circumstances outlined in the article. \n\"The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace.\"\nIf anyone thought Prince Harry and Meghan were going to restrict their criticism to the British media, a sector they have made clear they loathe, they should think again. \"The Firm\" - aka the Royal Family and its staff - is clearly in their sights.\nThis isn't directly about the allegations of bullying levelled at Meghan, and also to a lesser degree Harry. They were published after the interview was recorded. But the couple see the allegations as an example of how some people in the palace brief against them.\nWe'll have to wait for the interview to find out exactly what \"falsehoods\" the couple believe have been put out by the palace. The bullying allegations - which are vigorously denied by the couple - are being investigated.  \nBut it's clear that the gloves have come off, and that the ties of family have not restrained the couple as they seek to put their side of the story.\nPast and present royal employees are to be invited to speak in confidence about their experiences of working for Meghan as part of the investigation.\nThe bullying allegations are denied by Meghan and Prince Harry.\nA statement issued by Meghan's spokesman in response to the newspaper's story said: \"The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma.\n\"She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good.\"\nAuthor Anna Pasternak - who wrote a book on Princess Diana - said she thought \"the whole issue stems to when Meghan first entered the Royal Family\".\n\"I think she was na\u00efve, she didn't really understand the monarchy or 'The Firm' as she rightly puts it, and the constricts of royal power. She was naive to think that she could modernise the monarchy, that she could have her voice and could do things her way,\" she told Radio 5 Live.\nBut Rachel C. Boyle, head of interdisciplinary studies at Leeds Beckett University, said the Oprah interview was \"absolutely the right thing to do at this point\".\n\"I feel like Meghan has not been given the opportunity to defend herself or to respond to any of the claims that have previously been made about her in the media, in a space that allows her to express herself.\"\nMeghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah will be aired on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March.\nIn the UK, the interview will be screened on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March.\nCBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about \"stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood\" and \"how she is handling life under intense public pressure\".\nShe will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans.\nIn an earlier clip released by CBS, the Duke of Sussex drew parallels between the treatment of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Meghan.\nJust hours before the interview is aired in the US, a special programme to celebrate Commonwealth Day will be broadcast on BBC One at 17:00 on Sunday 7 March.\nIt comes as Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of Edinburgh has undergone a successful procedure for a pre-existing heart condition and will be remaining in hospital for a number of days."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Mental health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Money to support children and young people's mental health after the \"disruption\" of the pandemic has been cautiously welcomed. \nIt is part of a \u00a3500m pot for mental health services across the board, announced in November.\nThe government confirmed \u00a379m would be allocated to support children in school and in the community.\nCharities and campaigners said the pandemic had significantly impacted young people's mental health.\nOne in six young people are now estimated to have a mental health problem, according to Emma Thomas, head of charity Young Mind.\n\"Before Covid, we were looking at one in nine young people with a mental health diagnosable need,\" she said.\nMs Thomas warned against \"medicalising\" what are natural feelings of distress, saying school might be the appropriate place for many children, who don't need formal mental health treatment, to seek support. \nShe said it was \"absolutely right\" to boost mental health support in schools and the community. \nBut others, like the Children's Society, have condemned it as a \"sticking plaster\".\n\"Only about a third of children will receive support this way by April 2023,\" a spokesperson said. \n\"That still leaves millions of children without help which they need right now. Young people have been through so much in this last year and the government must explain what it is providing for the millions of children left behind.\"  \nAnd mental health services were struggling to meet demand even before Covid-19 hit,\" according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\nSaadia, an 18-year-old from Swansea and volunteer for the charity Mind, said the pandemic had been a \"rollercoaster\" for her. \n\"There's a lot of time when I feel very tired. I miss my friends. I miss being in that learning environment. There have been a lot of highs and lows\".\nNow in her first year of university, Saadia was able to get support for her mental health - though she's mindful not all schools and colleges have such good support teams. \n\"I relied on [school support services] - more than on my friends and family - because when I was younger I didn't feel able to open up.\n\"I was very fortunate to be in that place where the right services were around, but I'm aware not every school has that.\"\nShe says the funding announcement is \"a big step forward\", but hopes young people will keep being involved and consulted at all stages of the process. \nMind originally asked government for a \u00a31bn investment in mental health - twice was what pledged. \nThe \u00a379m should pay for more mental health support teams in schools and therapy in the community, including for eating disorders. \nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the money would be aimed at:\nCommunity mental health care includes talking therapies, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aimed at teaching people to change the way they think about and act on their problems. \nBen, who is 18 and from Cumbria, says he was also \"very lucky\" at his school.\nWhile they didn't have a team of mental health support staff, teachers took on the role outside of their usual jobs to support students. \nHe says extra support and funding for both teachers and students is needed with demand for such services \"growing all the time.\"\nNHS mental health director Claire Murdoch said the pandemic had \"turned our lives upside down and hit children and young people particularly hard\".\nShe said NHS mental health services had been working \"around the clock, proactively reaching out to and caring for children and young people despite challenging circumstances\".\nAnd as young people go back to school from Monday, Emma Thomas from the charity Young Minds called for their wellbeing to be prioritised as much as their need to catch up academically.\n\"It's a really unsettling time\u2026they're going back into a school environment they haven't been in, to their social networks they haven't had, and many of them are uncertain about whether they'll have the support. \n\"Day one is just that first step,\" she said. \"Let's take each step as it comes\"."

      "text": "Top-level discussions have taken place within Downing Street about the cost of renovating Boris Johnson's official flat, the BBC understands.\nSources said setting up a charity to allow members of the public to donate towards the revamp has been considered to cover the cost. \nWork on the flat, where the PM lives with his fiancee Carrie Symonds, is understood to be largely complete.\nThe PM's spokesman declined to comment on press reports about the cost.\nWhen asked whether a charity had been set up, as first reported by the Daily Mail, he said they \"wouldn't comment on speculation\".\nA source has told the BBC the interior designer Lulu Lytle has been involved in the upgrade.\nLike several of his recent predecessors, Mr Johnson is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, the chancellor's official residence.\nMr Johnson and Ms Symonds moved into No 11 in July 2019. Their son Wilfred was born in April 2020.\nThe four-bedroom flat, which is much larger than the one above No 10, was extensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameron in 2011.\nThe Camerons spent \u00a330,000 on their revamp - the maximum annual public grant available to prime ministers for the upkeep of their accommodation.\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson and his fiancee are considering options for how any expenditure over this annual limit could be covered.\nSources have suggested the matter has been of some considerable concern in Downing Street, with high-level meetings taking place. \nInterior designer Ms Lytle is a co-founder of Soane Britain, an upmarket London-based interior design firm which specialises in traditional craft methods. \nAccording to the company's website, its furniture can be found in \"fine hotels and restaurants,\" private members' clubs, yachts and private houses.\nLondon's Connaught and Claridges hotels, the Somerset Georgian manor Babington House and Shoreditch House private members' club are listed as clients.\nDowning Street has said details of any work carried out on the Downing Street property would be published in the normal way later this year.\nOn Friday, the PM's spokesman said the Downing Street complex was a \"working building\" where refurbishments were made periodically. \nOpposition parties have questioned the cost of the refurbishment, and whether conflicts of interest could arise if Conservative donors are approached to contribute.\nLabour MP Sarah Owen has written to the PM asking him for details of taxpayers' contribution.\nShe has said the British public \"rightly expect probity, integrity and transparency when it comes to spending public money\". \nThe SNP has said the move would be \"grossly inappropriate\", suggesting the PM - who is paid \u00a3150,000 a year - should fund the works out of his own pocket."

      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "Chancellors like to claim their Budgets include something for everyone, and Rishi Sunak's tax and spend statement on Wednesday certainly cast the net wide. There were short-term policies to tackle the impact of Covid-19 and long-term plans for righting the nation's finances.\nBut some people still feel there were gaps, areas where he could have done more: for those struggling to make ends meet, for example, and on action to fast-track the switch to a low carbon economy. \nHere are four areas where critics and commentators were surprised by what was left out of the chancellor's economic recovery Budget.\nThe BBC has put their points to the Treasury for a response.\nRishi Sunak wasn't silent on the environment in the Budget.\nHe handed the Bank of England a duty to support the move to zero emissions. He set up a new infrastructure bank, to invest mainly in green projects, and a new green savings scheme.\nBut does that amount to the revolution many people hoped would be kick-started in the Budget? Hardly, say critics.\nMr Sunak held off a fuel duty rise for the 11th year in a row. And he is accused of clawing back money from a key home insulation scheme that supporters say was an easy win for the environment.\nThe \u00a31.5bn Green Homes Grant (GHG), launched last year, offered money for people to insulate their homes and install low carbon heating such as heat pumps.\nThe deadline to apply is the end of this month and people must have their improvements completed by March 2022.\nBut many householders couldn't contact installers, and some installers didn't get paid because the system was so creaky. Only 6% of the cash has been spent, so environmentalists want the money to be rolled over. \nBut Sunak didn't mention it in the Budget so that won't happen and the scheme will be withdrawn as planned at the end of March.\nFatima Ibrahim, from the group Green New Deal UK, said: \"Our response to the climate crisis should have been front and centre of the Budget, not a footnote.\"\nMoney has been showered on government departments to deal with pandemic costs: \u00a3150bn this year and the same again next.\nBut there was no planning for Covid costs beyond April 2022, said Richard Hughes, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides independent financial forecasts to the Treasury. He called it a \"source of risk\" for the public finances.\nThe government's own roadmap out of lockdown has talked of the possible need for an annual vaccination programme and continuing test and trace capacity.\nAdd to this the backlog of hospital appointments, additional help needed for school children, and reduced revenues for public transport, and many economists calculate that Covid costs will continue well beyond the next two years.\nMr Hughes said: \"We don't know what the government's plans are for dealing with these legacy costs beyond this year.\nIn fact the government has announced a reduction in spending after two years, he points out.\n\"Faced with these looming pressures, the chancellor's response so far has been to cut around \u00a315bn a year from total departmental spending in the years beyond 2021-22, including a further \u00a34bn cut in this Budget.\"\nAnother respected economist, Paul Johnson, director at the Institute of Fiscal Studies, agreed that the Budget left a big question mark over Covid costs. He tweeted: \"Spending plans from 2022 include precisely nothing for dealing with additional pressures arising from the pandemic, of which there are plenty. In fact they involve spending cuts relative to pre-pandemic plans. Is that really credible?\"\nThere was no support for struggling renters in the Budget, pointed out social research group the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.\n\"The chancellor was silent on support for the 700,000 households already in rent arrears,\" it said. \nThe Local Housing Allowance which is used to work out housing benefit will be frozen from April too, piling further pressure onto renters, the Foundation added.\nOn the other hand, for those buying a home, the chancellor extended the stamp duty holiday for another three months and launched a new 95% mortgage guarantee scheme. \n\"These policies will compound the UK's housing crisis, driving up house prices and making it harder to address the issues faced by people in poverty,\" the JRF said.\nHigher house prices can have a knock-on effect, pushing up rents, and squeezing the finances of renters who are often struggling already.\nJon Sparkes, chief executive of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"It is very disappointing to see the housing support announced is limited to home buyers. Hundreds of thousands of renters in arrears are facing eviction in a matter of weeks and must not be forgotten.\"\nExtending the \u00a320 boost to universal credit and the furlough scheme until September will help tenants plan ahead, \"but much more is required to avoid a mounting crisis in the private rented sector,\" said Timothy Douglas, policy & campaigns manager for letting agents' organisation Propertymark.\n\"As the impact of Covid continues to bite and unemployment rates rise, we are increasingly concerned about how tenants will avoid future rent arrears,\" he added.\nAfter the pandemic took the lives of more than 40,000 mostly elderly care residents there were widespread calls for reform of the social care sector.\nBut the chancellor failed to offer even a whisper of fresh support for care homes or their staff.\n\"The sector was already on its knees before the pandemic hit, and now it is at crisis point,\" said Helen Wildbore, director of the Relatives & Residents Association.\n\"Following a year of unremitting challenges, with care services stretched to breaking point and staff burnt out, support from the chancellor was desperately and urgently needed.\"\nShe said the Association's helpline hears daily from people who are relying on these services who already feel neglected and left behind by the government. \n\"The Budget is an insult to older people needing care, and their families,\" she added.\nThe day after the Budget, parliament's Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee launched an enquiry into the impact of COVID-19 on adult social care, conceding that the problems in the sector aren't simply a consequence of the pandemic.\n\"We have seen year-on-year the demand on services increasing, while local authority budgets have been stretched more and more,\" said committee chair Clive Betts MP.\n\"Unless the funding of social care is resolved there will continue to be more cuts to other council services.\"\nBut many wish reforms to social care and how it is funded had been tackled much earlier.\n\"The silence on social care funding proposals in the Budget was deeply disappointing,\" said Steven Cameron, director at pension firm Aegon.\n\"The devastating impact the pandemic has had on our most elderly has shown just how valuable but stretched our care system is, making it even more urgent that the government delivers on previously promised reforms to social care funding.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,European Union,AstraZeneca,Australia",
      "text": "The Italian government has blocked the export of an Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shipment to Australia.\nThe decision affects 250,000 doses of the vaccine produced at an AstraZeneca facility in Italy.\nItaly is the first EU country to use the bloc's new regulations allowing exports to be stopped if the company providing the vaccines has failed to meet its obligations to the EU.\nAustralia said losing \"one shipment\" would not badly affect its rollout.\nBut it has asked the European Commission, which reportedly backs Italy's move, to review the decision.\nAstraZeneca is on track to provide only 40% of the agreed supply to member states in the first three months of the year. It has cited production problems for the shortfall.\nIn January, then Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described delays in vaccine supplies by both AstraZeneca and Pfizer as \"unacceptable\" and accused the companies of violating their contracts.\nThe EU has been widely criticised for the slow pace of its vaccination programme. \nUnder the EU vaccine scheme, which was established in June last year, the bloc has negotiated the purchase of vaccines on behalf of member states.\nThere has been no official comment on the Italian move by the EU or AstraZeneca.\nAustralia began its vaccination programme last week using the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It was due to start inoculations with the AstraZeneca jab on Friday.\nThe Italian government approached the European Commission last week to say that it was its intention to block the shipment.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the foreign ministry explained the move, saying it had received the request for authorisation on 24 February.\nIt said that previous requests had been given the green light as they included limited numbers of samples for scientific research, but the latest one - being much larger, for more than 250,000 doses - was rejected.\nIt explained the move by saying that Australia was not on a list of \"vulnerable\" countries, that there was a permanent shortage of vaccines in the EU and Italy, and that the number of doses was high compared with the amount given to Italy and to the EU as a whole.        \n\"Australia has raised the issue with the European Commission through multiple channels, and in particular we have asked the European Commission to review this decision,\" Health Minister Greg Hunt said.\nAustralia said it had already received a shipment of 300,000 doses and planned to begin local production next month.\n\"Domestic production starts with 1 million [doses] per week of deliveries from late March and is on track,\" Mr Hunt said.\n\"This [Italy] shipment was not factored into our distribution plan for coming weeks.\"\nIn the acrimonious vaccine war, this is a muscular move by one of the European Union's heavyweights. \nIt is the first such ban under a new EU scheme in which manufacturers must request authorisation for export from the country in which the vaccine is produced. \nItaly's new Prime Minister Mario Draghi, an influential figure in Europe as the former president of the European Central Bank, argued in a videoconference with EU leaders that the rules should be applied rigorously, furious at reductions by AstraZeneca of up to 70% in the doses it was contracted to provide. \nMr Draghi has prioritised ramping up the vaccination programme. He is clearly determined to show that his country - and the EU - will use all means necessary to do so.\nThe EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but earlier this year the UK-Swedish company reported production delays at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium.\nInstead of receiving 100 million doses by the end of March, the EU is now expected to get just 40 million.\nThe EU accused the company of reneging on its deal, with EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides saying that UK factories making the vaccine should make up the shortfall.\nMs Kyriakides also rejected AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot's characterisation of the contract as one of \"best effort\" rather than an obligation to meet a deadline for delivery of vaccines.\nAs a result of the row, the EU announced export controls which began on 30 January, known as the \"transparency and authorisation mechanism\"."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Rules around outdoor socialising are likely to ease next week, the first minister has said.\nNicola Sturgeon said more opportunities to see loved ones would be the \"first steps\" taken out of lockdown.\nOnly two people from two households are currently allowed to meet outdoors, with people being urged to stay at home apart from for essential reasons.\nMs Sturgeon said she hoped to announce \"relatively minor but important\" changes on Tuesday.\nShe said these would relate to restrictions on meeting outdoors and how young people are able to interact with friends.\nThe government's recent plan for easing lockdown said that allowing four people from two households to meet outdoors was unlikely to happen before 15 March. \nMs Sturgeon said the progress with the vaccine programme and the decline in hospital admissions and case number should give encouragement that \"greater normality is firmly on the horizon\".\nBut she added: \"It's really important we don't get carried away yet.\n\"The overall stay at home message needs to stay for a bit longer so that we don't send our progress into reverse.\n\"But I'm very keen if we can we should all get a bit more opportunities to see loved ones as the first steps we take out of this lockdown.\"\nThe Scottish government has been considering accelerating its exit plan out of lockdown, which currently says that the country will return to a levels system towards the end of April.\nHowever, new rules are set to make it harder for areas to drop down to lower tiers of these restrictions.\nIf an area is to see restrictions lifted, the number of positive cases will need to be far lower than when the system operated last year.\nIt is also expected that non-essential retail, hospitality and services such as gyms and hairdressers will reopen as part of the levels system.\nBut business leaders have said a return to this framework would be \"devastating\" and have called for more clarity on how the system would work.\nThe first minister and Chief Medical Officer haven't quite started playing Ian Dury's Reasons To Be Cheerful Part 3 during the daily briefing, but the change of tone in recent days has been dramatic.\nFrankly, the figures are improving far faster than anyone dared hope.\nThe rolling death toll is falling and is at its lowest since early October. The number of patients in hospital with Covid - while still high - is falling rapidly, as are new Covid admissions.\nThere is growing confidence this is down to the vaccination programme as well as lockdown.\nVirtually everyone over 65 has now had their first jab as have nearly 40% of those between 60 and 64 and a third of those aged 55 to 59. \nPositive tests are falling and the proportion of positive tests is consistently below the crucial 5pc benchmark.\nBecause those most at risk are being vaccinated first, jabs should mean far fewer hospital admissions or deaths. The portion of positive tests where the patient is asymptomatic or only mildly unwell may rise. Vaccinations also appear to cut transmission rates. \nWhile some scientists argue for a strategy based around the complete elimination of Covid, the argument made to the public has always been about saving lives and protecting the NHS. \nThere is a question over whether the public would support harsh measures if the risk of death and hospitalisation had been greatly reduced.\nThe challenge for those responsible for regulations is to strike the right balance between persuading people that difficult measures are still needed, ensuring people follow the rules and offering the tantalising prospect that the dark clouds may now be lifting and the sun will soon shine again.\nAs part of the lockdown easing plans, it was announced on Tuesday that all secondary school pupils in Scotland will return to classrooms part-time from 15 March - a month earlier than originally planned. \nThe latest statistics showed that further 498 people have tested positive for Covid-19 - the lowest daily figure since 27 September - representing 3.1% of the tests carried out.\nThe FM said 11 new deaths had been reported of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within 28 days, bringing the total under that measure to 7,409.\nA further 29,064 people received the first dose of the vaccine while 8,139 received the second dose.\nAnd the number of people in hospital with the virus has fallen by 52 to 666, with 64 patients in intensive care - three fewer than yesterday's figures.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar welcomed the improving statistics, but said the number of vaccinations and tests being carried out was \"nowhere near\" the level it should be.\nHe added: \"The vaccine is the way that we try to defeat the virus - or defeat it as best we can. \n\"The target was 400,000 vaccinations a week and we are nowhere near that.\n\"But the vaccine is only one part of this. People need to see that testing and tracing is still a huge, huge part of getting back some level of normality.\""

      "text": "Scientists have identified 16 cases of another new variant of coronavirus in the UK. \nPublic Health England has designated it as a 'variant under investigation' (VUI), meaning it is on their watch list, but not one they are immediately concerned about. \nIt has a mutation in common with the South Africa and Brazil variants. \nThat change, E484K, may help the virus evade some immunity from vaccination or prior infection, experts believe.\nThe cases were first identified on 15 February by the UK's variant surveillance system. \nExperts suspect it originated in the UK.\nAll 16 individuals who tested positive, and their contacts, have been traced and advised to isolate.\nPHE said the cases were geographically spread across the UK. And it confirmed that surge or mass testing would not be necessary - this is only done for variants of concern (VOC), such as the Brazil one. \nThe UK now has 8 variants on its watch list - 4 VUIs and 4 VOCs.\nMost recently, officials had been trying to track down a person in England known to have been infected with the Brazil VOC. \nThe search was narrowed to 379 households in the south of England, and the case was traced to Croydon. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has said incidents like this are rare and only occur in around 0.1% of tests. \nIt's not unexpected that variants are appearing or that the virus will continue to change. All viruses mutate as they make new copies of themselves to spread and thrive.\nBut some changes may affect how well current vaccines work. \nScientists are looking at tweaking coronavirus vaccines to keep pace with the new, emerging variants to ensure that they continue to offer high protection against the disease as the virus mutates.  \nThe UK's drug regulator the MHRA has said new vaccines can be fast-tracked through the approval system without \"lengthy\" clinical studies.

      "tags": "Tourism,Cyprus,Travel",
      "text": "Cyprus and Portugal say they hope to welcome vaccinated British tourists from May - the month when travel restrictions may be lifted in the UK.\nThe Cypriot government said those who had two Covid jabs could travel, while Portugal said those who tested negative or were \"immune\" could also visit.\nIt is not known how vaccine status would be proved. \nThe earliest date those in England could go abroad for holidays is 17 May, following a review on travel rules.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has said it is still \"too early\" to book a foreign trip.\nUnder current rules, foreign travel from the UK is banned apart from for exceptional reasons.\nFrom Monday, passengers travelling internationally from England will have to carry a form stating their trip is permitted, the Department for Transport has announced. It will be an offence to fail to produce a completed form. Those who do not have one could be fined \u00a3200. \nBut once travel is allowed again, the success of the UK's vaccination programme makes Britons especially attractive to countries wanting to attract holidaymakers, especially those European countries which are traditionally popular with British tourists.\nPortugal is currently on the UK's red list, meaning travellers coming from there have to quarantine in the UK when they arrive. \nRita Marques, Portugal's secretary of state for tourism, told the BBC: \"I do believe that Portugal will soon allow restriction-free travel, not only for vaccinated people, but those who are immune or who test negative. We hope to welcome British tourists from 17 May.\"\nShe added that the situation in Portugal was \"stable\" and said, \"Everything will be ready by mid May.\"\nThe UK government says the red list remains under review, with public health the UK's top priority.\nInternational travel from England will not start until 17 May at the earliest, with a global travel taskforce reporting in April. The UK government has not yet approved any kind of vaccination certificate but Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is looking into possible measures.\nThe decision to lift restrictions on travel abroad still depends on vaccine rollout in the UK and abroad, the effectiveness of the vaccine, the prevalence of the virus and its variants. \nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have not set a date for the start of international travel.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes a certification scheme could allow vaccinated holidaymakers to journey abroad - but warned Scotland was still \"some way away\" from such a programme. She said she could not advise people to \"fly off to the sun\" before there was a degree of certainty it could be done without risk. \nGoing on holiday is currently still illegal, but the prime minister's roadmap last week has left many optimistic that that will change soon.\nAlthough international travel is not guaranteed to start on 17 May, countries and companies are already gearing up to have British tourists back and making a bid for them to book.\nWhen travel does restart, it's likely to be in tiers, with some countries more open than others. \nBe warned, just because a country may say it is happy to have us, doesn't mean that they will be on that list; those discussions are still ongoing and will ultimately rest on how the vaccine, virus and variants look in the next few months.\nCyprus's deputy tourism minister, Savvas Perdios, said the country would allow Britons who had been given vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to enter without the need for a negative test or to quarantine.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna jabs have been approved for use by the EMA.\nTourists would be required to have had their second dose at least seven days before travelling, the minister added.\nBritish tourists make up the largest group of visitors to the island and made more than a million trips to Cyprus in 2019, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nOther countries are optimistic they could be seeing British tourists back soon. \n\"We believe that summer has to be the beginning of the end of this bad experience,\" says Fernando Valdes, Spain's secretary of state for tourism. \"I can't give a specific date, that will depend on how the pandemic evolves.\"\nHe said it depended how the vaccination programme was going in both countries - but noted \"the UK is increasingly moving towards their goals\".  \nGreece has also said it hopes to open this summer, saying its government is taking all the necessary actions for this to happen.\nSimon Calder, travel editor at the Independent, said, with the UK's vaccine programme ahead of the rest of Europe, the British holidaymaker was going to become \"quite appealing to countries who are working out how to rebuild their tourist industries while at the same time minimising risk\".\nAlthough family members might have different vaccination statuses, potentially meaning only some were able to travel unrestricted, he told BBC Breakfast he thought there would be \"a way found\".\nMr Calder said it was possible Cyprus would reflect its travel rules from last summer when visitors were able to get a test three days before their flight and noted that under-12s are excluded from the current travel restrictions.\nHolidays in the UK could begin more than a month earlier, with people in England potentially permitted to stay in self-contained accommodation such as holiday lets from 12 April under Mr Johnson's road map for easing lockdown restrictions.\nThis has led to many people opting to plan a holiday at home, resulting in them becoming more expensive, according to researchers at Which."

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has said being a royal was \"different than I think what people imagine it to be\".\nIn a clip from the couple's interview with Oprah Winfrey, due to air in the US on Sunday, Meghan was asked why she has decided to give an interview now.\n\"We have the ability to make our own choices in a way that I couldn't have said yes to then,\" she said. \"That wasn't my choice to make.\"\nShe said it was \"really liberating\" to now feel \"able to speak for yourself\".\nIt comes as Buckingham Palace is investigating claims the duchess bullied royal staff.\nThe report about the allegations of bullying levelled at Meghan were first published in the Times after the interview with Oprah was recorded. Meghan has called it the \"latest attack on her character\".\nThe interview with Oprah, which will air in the US on CBS on Sunday and in the UK on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday, is expected to hear details about Meghan and Prince Harry's short period as working royals together before they stepped down for a life in the US.\nIn the latest clip, shown on CBS's This Morning show, Oprah said to Meghan: \"So I just want to say, I called you either February or March 2018 before the wedding asking, would you please give me an interview. And you said 'I'm sorry, it's not the right time'. Finally we get to sit down and have this conversation.\"\nMeghan replied: \"I remember that conversation very well. I wasn't even allowed to have that conversation with you personally, right? There had to be people [from the communications team] sitting there.\"\nAsked why now was the right time, Meghan said: \"Well, so many things. That we're on the other side of a lot of life experience that's happened and also that we have the ability to make our own choices in a way that I couldn't have said yes to then. That wasn't my choice to make. \n\"So, as an adult who lived a really independent life to then go into this construct that is different than I think what people imagine it to be, it's really liberating to be able to have the right and the privilege in some ways to be able to say, yes, I'm ready to talk, to say it to yourself. \n\"To be able to just make a choice on your own and to be able to speak for yourself.\"\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California.\nPrince Harry recently said he had to step back from royal duties to protect himself and his family from the \"toxic\" situation created by the UK press, as it was \"destroying my mental health\".\nDeals have been struck in more than 17 countries across the world for the rights to screen Oprah's interview.\nThe chat show host has promised it will be \"shocking\" with \"nothing off limits\".\nMeghan will be interviewed about marriage, motherhood, life as a royal and \"how she is handling life under intense public pressure\", CBS has said. The couple will also discuss their move to the US and their future plans.\nSeveral clips have already been released by CBS and have racked up millions of views.\nAfter the first two clips were released, the Times published its report saying Meghan faced a complaint of bullying from her staff while she was a working royal at Kensington Palace.\nThe palace said it was \"concerned\" about the accusations and an HR team would look at the circumstances outlined in the article.\nOn the reported allegations of bullying, the duchess has said in a statement through her spokesman she was \"saddened\" by the \"attack on her character\"."

      "tags": "GCHQ,Bletchley Park,US national security,National Security Agency",
      "text": "New documents have been released about the birth of a secret intelligence pact between the US and UK 75 years ago.  \nThe documents, including diary entries, detail the war time meetings that began at Bletchley Park and led to the UKUSA deal being signed in March 1946.\nThe alliance involved working together to intercept communications and break codes, sharing almost everything.\nIt grew into what is today called the \"Five Eyes\" pact of the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.\n\"Together, we are greater than the sum of our parts,\" said Jeremy Fleming, director of GCHQ, and director of the US National Security Agency, Gen Paul Nakasone, in a joint statement to mark the anniversary, amid talk of expanding the group even further.\nA short entry from February 1941 in the diary of Alastair Denniston, released for the first time today by GCHQ, marked the beginning of what was once the most secret of relationships. \n\"The Ys are coming!\" it read - meaning the Yanks. \nDenniston was head of Bletchley Park and he was welcoming a group of American code breakers at a time when the US had not yet entered the Second World War. \n\"There are going to be four Americans who are coming to see me at 12 o'clock tonight. I require you to come in with the sherry. You are not to tell anybody who they are or what they will be doing,\" he told his assistant. \nThe Americans had undertaken a perilous crossing with their boat shot at by Nazi planes but they arrived at the home of British code breakers on a mission of huge importance. \nWith the permission of then-Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the two groups of spies would share their most sensitive secrets - that the UK had broken the German Enigma code and the US the Japanese code called Purple. \nFurther diary entries reveal how key figures would travel back and forth over the Atlantic, including Denniston to meet with his opposite number as well as code breaker Alan Turing.\nThe relationship forged in that visit would outlast World War Two and, after a series of meetings, be formalised at the start of the Cold War with a document signed in Washington on 5 March 1946.\nThe agreement was something of a \"marriage contract\" - each agreed honesty, openness and commitment to the other including a \"no spy agreement\" in which they would not target the other side. \nThey would share nearly all the intelligence they produced through breaking codes and intercepting communications (known as signals intelligence or SIGINT) although the agreement did allow some wiggle room if one side felt they had to act independently.  \nInitially known as UKUSA, over the next 10 years it would be expanded as Australia, Canada and New Zealand joined, making up what is known today as the Five Eyes alliance. Details of the original deal were secret until 2010.\nThe power of the alliance in WW2 has made it the heart of what is sometimes called the \"special relationship\" between the two countries. The term seems increasingly outdated but the one place where it has always been real is when it comes to code breaking.\n\"This alliance defines how we share communication, translation, analysis, and code breaking information, and has helped protect our countries and allies for decades,\" said Mr Fleming of GCHQ and Gen Nakasone in their joint statement.  \n\"The modern digital world is constantly evolving. Threats don't respect international borders. Global partnerships are key to our security and economic prosperity - and none more so than the one between our two countries.\"\nThe relationship meant that the allies divided up the world between them when it came to intercepting communications. In the case of the Cuban Missile Crisis, this meant a GCHQ outstation in Scarborough would end up playing a critical role in delivering intelligence to the desk of President Kennedy in Washington. \nThe NSA and GCHQ continue to divide up tasks - GCHQ for instance monitors the hackers of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency and passed intelligence to the US when they saw them hacking into the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US Presidential election.\nThe relationship remains close with staff from each side travelling over the Atlantic to work in the other side's agency and is far more intimate than that of MI6 and CIA, which deal with human, as opposed to signals intelligence.\nBut the relationship has not always been smooth. Intimacy creates risks. In the early Cold War, there were fears that the other side might be \"leaky\". \nIn Britain this came after revelations about the Cambridge Five showed individuals within British intelligence had betrayed secrets to the Soviet Union. The UK also has worried about showing it was contributing enough, especially given US resources dwarf its own (although expertise in code breaking has often made up for this).\nMore recently, there was tension after a GCHQ whistleblower, Katharine Gun revealed an NSA memo that showed plans to spy on the UN in the run up to the Iraq War in 2003. \nAnd former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed to the world the extent to which the two allies had built a vast capability to intercept global communications with almost no public awareness and little oversight.\nOther countries have sometimes suggested they wanted in on the deal. Germany made noises about a \"no spy deal\" in the wake of the Snowden revelations which showed the US spying on it. But Five Eyes is not simply an intelligence sharing alliance but an intelligence production alliance where members are expected to contribute and this appeared to be an obstacle. \nRecently, Western intelligence agencies have focused more on China, making Australia's role increasingly important. \nThe sensitives were also on display when the US warned about limiting intelligence sharing if the UK continued to use Chinese telecoms Huawei in its new 5G network (the UK changed its position in 2020 to exclude the company). \nThe changing focus has also led to talk about Japan and perhaps others in Asia joining Five Eyes. \nOfficials say this is unlikely even though they do expect closer co-operation. The reality is that the alliance still remains one rooted in the trust and personal connections first forged during the WW2."

      "tags": "Nasa Perseverance Mars rover,Space exploration,Mars rovers,United States",
      "text": "The US space agency's Perseverance rover has wiggled its wheels and undertaken its first Martian drive.\nIt didn't move far - just 6.5m (21ft) in total.\nBut Nasa's deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan said it was a significant moment.\n\"While the rover is still doing a lot of engineering checkouts, the minute the rover begins to move we can consider ourselves explorers on the surface of Mars,\" she told BBC News.\nIt's two weeks now since the one-tonne robot made its dramatic descent to the Red Planet.\nEngineers have spent the time commissioning the vehicle and its many complex systems, including its instruments and robotic arm.\nEveryone, however, has been waiting for Perseverance to start rolling. It happened on Thursday. The robot went forward a short way, spun on the spot 150 degrees, and then backed up a bit.\n\"You can see the wheel tracks that we left on Mars; I don't think I've ever been happier to see wheel tracks,\" said Perseverance mobility engineer Anais Zarifian.\n\"This is just a huge milestone for the mission and the mobility team. We've driven on Earth but driving on Mars - that's the ultimate goal, and just so many people have worked towards this very moment for years.\"\nPerseverance was put down in a near-equatorial crater called Jezero, to search for evidence of past life.\nThis will involve roving some 15km over the coming Martian year (roughly two Earth years).\nScientists want to reach a number of enticing rock formations in the crater that might retain a record of ancient biological activity.\nAmong these is what looks in satellite imagery to be a delta - a structure built up from the silt and sand dumped by a river as it enters a wider body of water. In Jezero's case, this wider body was very likely a crater-wide lake that existed billions of years ago.\nThe mission team is considering two possible routes to the delta, one of which would give scientists a preview by taking the robot past an isolated remnant.\n\"This (mound) is about a mile-and-a-half away from the rover. You can actually resolve layering within the rocks,\" said Dr Stack Morgan. \n\"In this outcrop, these resistant layered rocks were likely deposited by rivers flowing into the ancient Lake Jezero, and scientists on the team are hard at work trying to understand the significance and origin of rocks like this.\"\nAn immediate goal for Perseverance is its helicopter experiment. The rover brought a small chopper with it from Earth. \nThe vehicle will spend the next few weeks driving from its present location to a suitable stretch of terrain where the 2kg device called Ingenuity can be put safely on the ground. At present, the aircraft is slung beneath Perseverance's belly. \n\"We're still figuring out the possible flight zones,\" said Robert Hogg, Perseverance's deputy mission manager. \"We're taking navigation camera images, stereo images, to be able to analyse the terrain. And also the team's been looking at orbital images looking at possible flight zones. Long story short, we're still aiming for getting that done in the spring,\" he told reporters.\nPerseverance is the fastest rover Nasa has ever put on Mars. This is not so much because of the rate at which the wheels can turn (about 5cm/s), but rather because of advances in autonomous navigation.\nThe robot takes pictures to assess the road ahead. Previous vehicles had to stop while these images were processed onboard. Perseverance can do this on the fly.\n\"Perseverance can walk and chew gum at the same time,\" said Anais Zarifian.\nNasa announced on Friday that it had named Perseverance's landing site in Jezero Crater after the celebrated American science fiction writer Octavia E. Butler. The same honour was given to scifi author Ray Bradbury in 2012. His name will forever be associated with the touchdown location of the US space agency's previous rover, Curiosity."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nScientists have identified 16 cases of another new variant of coronavirus in the UK. Public Health England said this strain was on their watch list, but not one they were immediately concerned about. It has a mutation in common with the South Africa and Brazil variants which experts believe may help the virus evade some immunity from vaccination or prior infection. All viruses mutate and tweaked vaccines to fight new variants can be fast-tracked through the approval system. Here's what we know about the new strain so far.\nIt's the day after the Budget and many families and businesses are counting the costs of the coronavirus pandemic to their pocket. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has rejected claims his plans to claw back the cost of coronavirus support will hit the poorest hardest. He insisted no-one's take-home pay would be lowered by the plan he set out. But one campaign group said \"Santa Sunak\" was now looking more like \"Scrooge Sunak\". Here are a few ways the Budget could affect you.\nCoronavirus case rates in England are continuing to fall among all age groups, Public Health England says. The highest rate is among 30 to 39-year-olds, at 121.1 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 28 February. That's down from 178.3 cases last week. We've got data for the other age groups here. You can use our look-up tool to find out how many cases there are in your area. Meanwhile the World Health Organization said it was concerned about a \"resurgence\" of cases in Europe. It's comes as Germany did a U-turn over giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to people aged over 65.\nEx-Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown has pulled out of headlining a festival because he's refusing to play events that \"accept vaccination proof as condition of entry\". Neighbourhood Weekender confirmed on Wednesday its event had been moved from May to September because of the pandemic. Festival organisers said they would \"comply with conditions\" set out by the government through the local authority. Brown has been vocal in his criticism of Covid vaccines during the pandemic. It comes as The Isle of Wight festival has been pushed back another three months, while Download and Glastonbury were cancelled for 2021.\nHere to sing us out is Lloyd Balatongan, an NHS medic who recorded a song encouraging people to have their Covid-19 jab. The Royal Derby Hospital theatre practitioner composed the song with his family band The Soulm8s. The catchy track, which features his wife Jackielou on vocals and his son Liam on drums, includes the lyric: \"Working together to protect the nation, everybody's waiting for their vaccination.\" They're not the only ones singing about vaccines, check out Dolly Parton's reworking of her hit song Jolene.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nAnd if you're feeling concerned about the new variant you can read aboutwhat scientists are doing to tackle it.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "text": "The health secretary has defended a proposed 1% pay increase for NHS workers in England this year, amid a backlash from unions. \nMatt Hancock said the proposal was \"what we think is affordable\" given financial pressures caused by the Covid pandemic. \nHe added staff had been exempted from the wider freeze on public sector pay to reward their \"incredible\" work.\nA nurses' union has set up a fund to prepare for possible strike action.\nAnd Unite - the third largest union in the NHS - said it is considering a strike ballot.\nThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has called the recommended 1% pay rise \"pitiful\", arguing that its members should get 12.5% instead.\nIt would have to hold a ballot before strikes could go ahead.\nSpeaking at Friday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said the pay award reflected the \"difficult financial circumstances the country is in\".\n\"One of the challenges we've faced as a country is in terms of the financial consequences of the pandemic,\" he told reporters. \n\"We've proposed what we think is affordable to make sure in the NHS people do get a pay rise,\" he said. \nThe health department recommended the 1% pay award to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries. It would cover nearly all hospital staff, but not GPs and dentists. \nIn addition, some staff whose pay band is being changed will get more than a 1% increase as a result of a previously agreed three-year pay deal. \nThe government says newly-qualified nurses got a 12% pay rise over the course of that three-year agreement. \nIn its submission to the panel, officials at the department argued the 1% rise would strike the \"right balance between pay and staff numbers\".\nThe panel is due make its own pay recommendations in early May, when ministers will make their final decision.\nSome 1.3 million public sector workers will see a pay freeze next year, with those earning less than \u00a324,000 guaranteed a pay rise of at least \u00a3250.\nA government spokesperson said 1% was a \"real-terms increase\", as the latest official inflation figure was 0.9%.\nBut Unite's national officer for health Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe said it would turn into a \"pay cut in real terms\" if inflation rises over this year. \nRCN Chief Executive Dame Donna Kinnair has said the award shows ministers are \"dangerously out of touch with nursing staff, NHS workers and the public\".\nLabour's shadow health minister Rosena Allin-Khan said the recommended 1% pay increase was \"nothing short of an insult\".\nThe NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations.\nThe Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will be delayed until the summer because of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an \"interim\" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement.\nNHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised a one-off \u00a3500 \"special recognition\" payment in January, following a similar announcement in Scotland.\nThe Welsh government has said it will not set a \"ceiling\" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22.\nIf you are an NHS worker, what are your views about your pay?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It is \"impossible\" to give a date for the end of lockdown restrictions, one of Wales' top doctors says.\nDr Chris Jones, deputy chief medical officer, said there was a \"real risk\" of a third wave of Covid-19 cases if restrictions eased too quickly.\nHe was speaking after Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a plan to end lockdown in England, by 21 June.\nThe Conservatives have called for the Welsh Government to produce a roadmap for the end of the Covid lockdown.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Jones said there were \"probably greater risks\" now than at previous points in the pandemic because of the more transmissible variants.\nHe told Claire Summers that opening schools \"has a definite effect on the R-rate\", and how the new variants will affect infections is \"uncertain\".\n\"It is absolutely impossible in my view to say that on any one date in several months, that this will be the situation,\" he said in response to a question about Mr Johnson's announcement.\n\"I think we have to take things step by step.\"\nHe said all the UK's chief medical officers \"share the same view about the risks associated with relaxing restrictions,\" but added politicians had \"very difficult decisions\" to make.\nBut he said \"messaging to the public\" was \"very important\".\n\"To send the message that everything is going to be back to normal in a few months time, I think, is almost too open,\" he said.\n\"We are not out of the woods yet. There is a real risk of a third wave if restrictions are eased too quickly.\n\"We hope, from our cautious approach and step-by-step approach, will minimise the risk of that.\"\nIn England, the prime minister has set out a four-stage plan beginning on 8 March, with \"at least\" five weeks between each of the stages to allow time to assess the impact of relaxing some restrictions to be felt, and prepare for the next stage if possible.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has published a \"cautious\" framework to ending restrictions there, with the reopening of shops, bars, restaurants, gyms and hairdressers expected to start from 26 April.\nShe said it was hoped that Scotland's stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April.\nHowever, Northern Ireland has renewed lockdown measures until 1 April.\nChildren in England are due to return to the classroom on 8 March.\nIn Wales, Foundation phase children, aged three to seven, are returning to school this week.\nIf conditions regarding the virus continue to improve, all primary years will be back in school on 15 March, along with pupils in exam years 11 and 13, and some pupils in years 10 and 12 who are due to sit exams.\nHowever, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said not all of those secondary-age pupils would be back in full time, which she hopes will happen from 12 April.\nIn Scotland all primary pupils and S4 to S6 secondary students could return to school from 15 March, but pupils in the first three years of secondary school are unlikely to return until after Easter.\nFrom 8 March in England, one nominated person will be able to visit a care home resident, but there is no date for this in Wales, where care home visits remain banned. \nCare Forum Wales is working with the Welsh Government to \"formulate a safe policy for visiting\".\nSomeone who is very keen to see visits start is Jen Sutton.\nHer mother Liz Jones is 82 and lives in a care home in Aberystwyth. Ms Sutton, who lives in Cardiff, is an only child and used to visit her mother regularly until the pandemic struck.\n\"I haven't seen her indoors since March and the only other visit I've had is 20 minutes in a garden pod end of July, beginning of August. Then they closed down again for various reasons. I've seen her on Skype but it's not the same,\" she said.\n\"I'd just like to see her through a window. If it meant me isolating for 10 days beforehand I would do that. I don't particularly want to go in. I'm quite happy to wave through a window.\n\"It's a human right isn't it, to see your family. It's not too much to ask.\"\nThis is one of the areas where Wales could be moving more quickly than England.\nOn Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said some non-essential shops and hairdressers could reopen on 15 March.\nBut this has raised questions over prioritising this when large numbers of secondary pupils will remain unable to return to the classroom.\nEngland is due to reopen all shops on 12 April, while in Scotland the provisional date is 26 April.\nFor most of us the rules for who we can meet indoors remain limited to the people we live with.\nUntil 27 February, only those who lived alone - or are single and live in a house share - and single parents had been able to form a so-called \"support bubble\".\nHowever, now families with babies are now allowed to meet up with one other household to form a bubble.\nIt means anyone with a child under the age of one can form an exclusive support bubble with another household, allowing them to meet indoors, and stay overnight in each others homes.\nThe rule change also allows teenagers - aged 16 to 17 - who do not live with an adult to form a support bubble with another household.\nSince Saturday 20 February , people in Wales have been able to exercise in groups of four, but only from a maximum of two households, and it must be exercise rather than \"socialising\", Mr Drakeford said.\nIn England, from 8 March people can exercise with one other person not from their household, but they will also be allowed to meet outdoors on a park bench for a chat, for example, expressly for the purpose of socialising.\nIn Scotland a provisional date of 15 March has been given for four people from two households to be allowed to meet outdoors.\nThen from 29 March, people in England will be able to meet in groups of up to six people from different households, or two groups from two households. They will be able to do this in private gardens as well as public spaces.\nDiscussions have been ongoing in Wales with the tourism sector about a potential reopening at Easter.\nThe country is again likely to be ahead of England on this, although no firm date has been mentioned yet, and Mr Drakeford said it would not be opened \"in one go\".\nMr Johnson's roadmap has holidays in self-contained accommodation used by one household being allowed from 12 April at the earliest, which misses the school holidays completely.\nMr Drakeford has talked of easing the stay at home requirement at the lockdown review on 12 March, if cases continue to decreased.\nHowever he has said there could be a \"stay local\" requirement in place, as there was in the arrangements during the autumn for people to remain in their local authority area.\nMr Johnson has said the stay at home rule in England will end on 29 March but people should stay as local as possible, while in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes stay at home restrictions could be lifted on 5 April.\nAt present, only certain elite athletes in Wales are allowed to train together.\nNo dates have been mooted so far to allow people to get together for sport, including more individual distanced pursuits like golf or singles' tennis.\nThere are also no plans to reopen gyms.\nIn England, outdoor sports venues and formally organised outdoor sports can resume from 29 March. Gyms will be able to open from 12 April at the earliest.\nWhile in Scotland the possible date for reopening gyms and swimming pools has been mooted as 26 April.\nCurrently in Wales, only register offices and places of worship are open to perform marriages and guests are limited to the number who can be accommodated in the venue under the 2m social distancing regulations for different households.\nFrom 1 March, licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen for ceremonies.\nIn England, six people can currently attend but ceremonies are limited to those in exceptional circumstances, such as those who are terminally ill.\nFrom 8 March, all weddings with six people will be allowed. This will expand to 15 people on 12 April and 30 people on 17 May.\nNot any time soon in Wales, in a nutshell. There has been no date mooted, and Mr Drakeford said closures were unlikely to be revoked in the next six weeks.\nIn England, it is hoped people will be able to visit outdoor seating in restaurants and pubs from 12 April, and move indoors from 17 May.\nMeanwhile in Scotland pubs could reopen on 26 April."

He said he was sure it was \"a welcome breathing space for local businesses\".\n\"However, I will continue to press both the UK and EU for permanent solutions that ensure GB's agri-food business can trade unfettered with NI,\" he added.\nShadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said that the action did not take Northern Ireland \"a single step closer to any lasting solutions that ease the red tape the prime minister's deal created\".\n\"Ministers have a responsibility to secure lasting solutions that benefit Northern Ireland, and ensure stability,\" she added.\n\"Without trust that will be impossible, and that trust is being undermined.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in MP Chris Hazzard said the UK government had \"gone off on a further solo run\".\n\"This is another reckless and unnecessary move by the British government and, instead of providing the certainty required, only adds to the confusion,\" he said.

Sir Alex resigned in response.\nIn his report, Sir Alex found Ms Patel's \"approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals.\"\n\"To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the ministerial code, even if unintentionally,\" he concluded. \nThe FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, has launched legal action to try to get Mr Johnson's decision overturned at the High Court.\nMs Patel apologised for her alleged behaviour, saying \"any upset I have caused was completely unintentional\". \nMr Johnson said he did not think Ms Patel was a bully, and had \"full confidence\" in her.\nIn a statement issued via the FDA civil servants' union on Thursday, Sir Philip said he was \"pleased\" the government had settled his unfair dismissal claim.\n\"I now look forward to the next stages of my career,\" he added. \nOn its official website, the government said it \"regrets the circumstances surrounding Sir Philip's resignation\".\n\"The government and Sir Philip are now pleased that a settlement has been reached to these proceedings,\" a spokesperson added. \nMr Thomas-Symonds said Ms Patel still had \"very serious questions to answer about her conduct\", and Mr Johnson had \"shown terrible judgement\". \n\"It can't be right that his adviser on ministerial standards resigned when he found that the home secretary bullied colleagues, while the home secretary herself remained in post,\" he added."

      "tags": "Film,Gender,Cate Blanchett",
      "text": "The Berlin Film Festival has awarded its first ever gender-neutral acting prize to Maren Eggert.\nThe new award, which was announced by the festival last August, means both male and female actors now compete in the same category.\nGerman actress Eggert won for her performance as a museum researcher in the sci-fi comedy, I'm Your Man.\nBerlin's decision to merge the categories could have a knock-on effect on other film award ceremonies.\nThe idea has previously been welcomed by screen stars such as Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton, but it has also sparked heated debate.\nMariette Risenbeek, director of the Berlin Film Festival said genderless award was intended to spark further discussions around gender justice.\nAnalysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter\nIt may only be a matter of time before major awards ceremonies merge their acting categories - but this is a more complicated debate than it looks.\nFor starters, it's unlikely that a group of Hollywood stars - probably the most self-involved and self-congratulatory group of people in the world - would be enthusiastic about halving the number of awards they give themselves every year.\nMore importantly, it could actually be a disadvantage for actors who would currently be recognised.\nLet's take an example. Suppose last year's two Oscar winners for best actress and actor, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Joaquin Phoenix, had competed in one big overarching category. Now suppose Phoenix won. That means a woman, who would otherwise have rightfully taken home a trophy, would be left empty-handed.\nIn the current climate, it's not hard to imagine the scandal if, in the long-term, a decision like this led to a repeated loss of recognition for worthy winners, particularly women.\nSo while some will argue gender-neutral categories are socially progressive, they will also have unintended consequences. It could, interestingly, lead to a battle between two different factions of equality campaigners.\nAt the same time, the changing societal landscape needs to be considered. Trans people aren't discriminated against by the current model (Laverne Cox would currently qualify for best actress, for example), but gender-neutral people are. The existing situation leaves gender-neutral actors without a category to apply for, and awards bodies will be eager to rectify that in the future as more people identify as such.\nAll things considered, it's a complicated debate with no easy answers. It will be fascinating to see whether the Baftas, Oscars, Globes or Emmys follow Berlin's lead.\nMost arts and entertainment events, including the Oscars, the Baftas, the Grammys and the Brits, all still have separate award categories for males and females.\nIn 2019, the Brit Awards said they will review the way they distribute prizes, with one option being the abolition of separate male and female categories.\nIn September, speaking at the Venice Film Festival, Tilda Swinton said she was \"really happy\" to hear of Berlin's decision, as the idea of gendered prizes was outdated; adding that it was \"pretty much inevitable that everybody will follow\".\n\"In every sense, you know, dividing people up and and prescribing a path for them, whether we're talking about gender, or whether we're talking about race or about class,\" she said. \"It's just such a waste of life.\"\nCate Blanchett, at the same event, noted how she had \"always referred to myself as an actor\", as opposed to an actress.\n\"I am of the generation where the word actress was used almost always in a pejorative sense,\" she said. \"So I claim the other space.\"\nBack in 2017, Emma Watson won the MTV Movie and TV award for best big-screen actor - the first gender-neutral prize the ceremony had given out.\nIn her acceptance speech, the actress said winning the prize for her role in Beauty and the Beast was \"very meaningful\".\n\"To me, it indicates that acting is about the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, and that doesn't need to be separated into two different categories.\"\nElsewhere in Berlin on Friday, the festival's top prize - aka the Golden Bear for best film - went to Radu Jude for the sexually explicit Romanian comedy Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn.\nIsraeli director Nadav Lapid announced the winner, saying the film - which satirises pandemic-era social hypocrisy with the story of a teacher whose sex tape winds up on the internet - succeeded in \"provoking the spirit of our time... by slapping it, by challenging it to a duel\".\nThe winning director told reporters that while he was pleased, he was \"more happy that nobody got sick\" during filming.\n\"We proved that we could do it respecting the people and putting their health above art,\" he said.\nEggert said she was \"overwhelmed\" to have collected the festival's Silver Bear prize for best leading performance.\nI'm Your Man, directed by Maria Schrader, sees her play an antiquities researcher who signs up to test a humanoid robot [played by Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens] as a romantic partner.\nSpeaking about why she won the prize, Bosnian director and jury member Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107, said Eggert created a \"memorable character\" which encouraged viewers to think about \"what we really want from ourselves\".\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It makes me feel as if nurses have been undervalued.\"\nShe added that in some cases nurses could not reserve shifts on the dedicated vaccination app as they were being booked out by independent practitioners.\nMs Allen said: \"It is all about equality. Everyone should be getting the same pay.\n\"It is very disheartening when you are on a 12-hour shift and you are getting up to five times less than some of your colleagues.\"\nDuring her daily media briefing, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was asked about the concerns of nursing staff who felt \"undervalued\".\nShe said nursing staff were \"hugely valued\" for their work during the pandemic and the way vaccinators are paid reflects the job they do. \nThe first minister added that nurses' rates had already changed to reflect the band they were currently in.\nA Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"We have become aware that, due to a misunderstanding of national guidelines, some individual pharmacists participating in the programme have been paid the incorrect rate. \n\"We are actively looking into this matter, and updated guidance will be issued shortly, reaffirming the existing position.\n\"All staff employed to work on the programme are paid in accordance with nationally-set terms and conditions and are working to agreed job roles, which come with specified rates of pay, and we value the contribution of everyone who has offered their services.\""

      "tags": "Spending reviews,Public sector,Employment,Pay",
      "text": "Some 1.3 million public sector workers will see a pay freeze next year, but low-paid and NHS staff will get raises \nChancellor Rishi Sunak said he could not justify across the board rises when many people in the private sector had seen cuts in pay and hours. \nHowever, he said 2.1 million public sector workers earning below the median wage of \u00a324,000 were \"guaranteed a pay rise of at least \u00a3250\".\nMore than a million NHS workers will also get a raise, he said. \nMeanwhile, the minimum wage - which has been rebranded as the National Living Wage - will increase by 2.2% - or 19p - to \u00a38.91 an hour, with the rate extended to those aged 23 and over. \nThe pay freeze, which was trailed in unconfirmed news reports last week, has sparked anger from unions which say it will affect key workers who have played a vital role during the pandemic. \nDelivering his Spending Review, the chancellor said the \"majority\" of the UK's public sector workers will see their pay increase in 2021.\nBut he added that pay rises for the rest - about 1.3 million out of a total of 5.5 million public sector workers - will be paused \"to protect jobs\". \nHowever, that figure only covers 1.3 million people working for the central government. The total rise could be much higher if local government and devolved pay agreements are frozen.\nHe highlighted a disparity between public sector and private sector wages, adding he \"cannot justify a significant, across-the-board\" pay increase for all public sector workers in the circumstances.\n\"Instead, we are targeting our resources at those who need it most,\" he said. \nJohn Apter, chairman of the Police Federation union, called the pay freeze a \"kick in the teeth\" for police officers.\n\"Rewarding those who have played a vital role in the fight against the virus with a pay freeze is nothing short of a disgrace,\" he said.\n\"A handful of officers will get the additional \u00a3250 for the lowest paid workers, but only those who are already on an appallingly low starting salary for the dangerous job they do.\"\nDame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said nursing staff would oppose plans to freeze the pay of equally skilled professionals. \n\"Those working in social care and the community deserve a pay boost as much as their NHS colleagues.\"\nDr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the chancellor had delivered a \"body blow\" to staff in schools and colleges.\n\"Education workers are key workers who have kept the country going during the pandemic but pay cuts are their only reward from this government.\"\nTeacher Esme says she is not surprised the government is freezing pay for many workers.\n\"Clearly money will need to be clawed back from the damage to the economy, however the concern is how long for?\" \nShe says it will have \"quite an impact\" on her as someone fairly new to the profession, after what has been an \"incredibly challenging year in education\". \n\"After getting barely any support, the proposal to freeze pay is another confirmation that the government has very little appreciation or respect for the profession, or those working within it.\"\nAt the end of last year, the Low Pay Commission - which advises the government on the National Living Wage wage - had said the rate would rise by 6% in April 2021. \nBut the commission has revised this down amid fears it would cost struggling businesses too much and damage jobs. \nMr Sunak said the plans would mean the average full-time worker on the rate will see their annual income rise by around \u00a3345 next year. \n\"Compared to 2016 when the policy was first introduced, that's a pay rise of over \u00a34,000,\" he added.  \nHe added that around two million people would benefit from the widened eligibility for the National Living Wage. \nBryan Sanderson, chair of the low pay commission, said: \"Recommending minimum wage rates in the midst of an economic crisis coupled with a pandemic is a formidable task.\n\"We have opted for a prudent increase which consolidates the considerable progress of recent years and provides a base from which we can move towards the government's target over the next few years.\""

She was told to expect a call for a vaccine along with her age group in around June.\n\"I was really shocked and so upset I put the phone down and sobbed,\" she said. \"I'm due to go back to work in schools next week and I'm absolutely scared witless.\n\"I'd just like some clear clarification on where the 'within the last 12 months' criteria has come from.\"\nPeter Smith, a 37-year-old from Bristol, said his GP dismissed the NHS guidance as \"irrelevant\".\nHe had four hospital stays because of his asthma when he was younger - twice after an emergency ambulance was called - and says respiratory illnesses like flu are a trigger for him now. \nHe says his GP \"alluded to the fact that my admissions weren't recent\".\n\"GPs are working hard and providing a great service, and I don't want to queue jump,\" he said. \"I just wish it was all clearer.\"\nOthers spoke of feeling \"anxious\" and \"frustrated\", with their mental health suffering after a year of trying to be careful with their condition, which they were told at the start of the pandemic put them in the clinically vulnerable group. \nNow some younger asthma sufferers in their 20s face a much longer wait to get the jab.\nCharity Asthma UK says a lot of people have been in touch with them to report a similar issue, and they've had thousands of calls to their helpline asking for advice on coronavirus and the vaccine rollout over the past year.\nSarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: \"We know that there are different interpretations of the official guidance from GP surgery staff and we're not sure why exactly this is happening.\n\"We know that GPs are very busy and trying to vaccinate so many people quickly, and keep on top of very complex daily new information about Covid-19 and the vaccination programme. \n\"But it's essential that GPs follow official guidance, so that people with asthma who need to be prioritised are protected now.''\nThe most severe asthma sufferers who have received a letter advising them to shield are part of the fourth vaccine priority group.\nThose with asthma requiring hospitalisation join those who have had three oral (tablet or liquid) steroid prescriptions over a three-month period as being in group six. \nThe millions of people with asthma who do not fit these criteria must wait until their age range is called.\nProf Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"The focus for GPs and our teams is currently to offer vaccinations to patients from group six... this is a large group of approximately seven million patients, and it is likely some patients in this group will not yet have been invited for their first jab. \n\"Prioritisation within this group will consider a number of factors, including age and ethnicity as well as some degree of clinical judgement.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Our priority is to save lives and protect the most vulnerable, and based on clinical risk the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has recommended that adults with severe asthma should be vaccinated in priority group six.\n\"This includes anyone who has ever had an emergency asthma admission to hospital and those who require regular steroids. \n\"Mild asthma, including that which can be treated by an inhaler alone, has not been found to carry a higher risk of serious outcomes from Covid-19.\""

      "text": "Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has said it could be forced to close stores due to the cap on business rates relief announced in the Budget.\nIt said the \u00a32m cap rendered the package \"near worthless\" for large retailers.\nThe group, which includes Sports Direct, House of Fraser and Evans Cycles, said retailers needed a total overhaul of the business rates model.\nThe rates holiday for non-essential retailers in England will end in June.\nFrom the start of July, business rates - which are taxes on properties used for commercial purposes - will then be discounted by two-thirds for nine months, up to a maximum of \u00a32m if businesses are closed.\nFrasers Group said in a statement that the business rates relief package would \"mean we need to review our entire portfolio to ascertain stores that are unviable due to unrealistic business rates\".\nIt warned last month that it expected a \u00a3100m hit due to continuing restrictions on trading. \nFrasers Group, which is owned by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, had already announced a number of store closures in 2020.\nThe group suggested that many retailers would have expected further rates relief \"until structural reform is implemented\", adding that firms \"should pay the fair amount of rates in line with realistic rateable values, but instead we continue to have an unwieldy, overly complex, and out of date business rates regime\".\nRetail property expert Jonathan De Mello agreed. He told the BBC that the rates relief cap would \"place a significant rates burden on retailers with more than just a handful of stores\".\nHe suggested that retailers with stores in large shopping centres and city centre locations would be hit hard: \"Some retailers pay more than \u00a32m rates from just one store alone!\n\"The government missed an opportunity here to reform rates root and branch,\" he added.\nIn response to the chancellor's Budget, the British Retail Consortium also said it hoped to see the ongoing business rates review by government reduce the \"burden\" on retailers.\nIt added: \"Without further funding, it is likely that many 'non-essential' retailers will struggle under sluggish consumer demand and high Covid costs.\"\nIn Scotland, retail, hospitality, leisure and aviation businesses will not pay non-domestic rates throughout the next financial year. The Welsh government has said hospitality, retail, leisure and tourism will get full rates relief for another 12 months.\nFrasers Group also said on Friday that the business rates relief cap in England would \"make it nearly impossible to take on ex-Debenhams sites with the inherent jobs created\".\nThe Debenhams brand and website were bought by fast fashion firm Boohoo in January, leaving many of the chain's 118 remaining shops vacant.\nIt has been reported that Frasers Group is currently in talks over taking on a number of former Debenhams stores.\nBillionaire Mike Ashley had made an offer for Debenhams when it was initially put up for sale last April, which was rejected.\nThe businessman had previously built up a 29% stake in the chain, but saw his \u00a3150m holding wiped out in 2019, when the company fell into administration and then ended up in the hands of its lenders - a consortium led by hedge fund Silverpoint.\nThe rise of online shopping, expensive rents and coronavirus shutdowns have put department stores chains under increased pressure. \nLast year, 139-year-old Beales closed all of its shops after falling into administration, while the BBC understands John Lewis is considering closing up to eight further department stores, on top of those already announced in 2020."

      "tags": "Endometriosis,Women's health,Edinburgh,Glasgow,Pregnancy",
      "text": "Women in their early 20s are still being told to \"get pregnant\" as a way of treating the debilitating gynaecological condition endometriosis.\nExperts have criticised GPs for lack of understanding of the disease which affects one in 10 women.\nThey are calling for more research and awareness for the condition that has few treatments and no cure.\nThe shocking advice was given to 22-year-old Glasgow journalist Sophie Buchan last year.\nShe told the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme she was shocked.\n\"Last year I had a really bad flare-up,\" she said. \"I was just in pain, I couldn't move. So I went to my GP and he told me to get pregnant. I was 21.\n\"He just said that a lot of women tend to find that their symptoms are better after they get pregnant. I was just really angry, to be honest.\"\nProf Andrew Horne, a leading expert on endometriosis at the University of Edinburgh, disagrees with the suggestion.\n\"That is awful,\" he said. \"I think it's a thing we had hoped as gynaecologists was out of date and was not happening. We shouldn't be telling people to get pregnant for any reason that improves their health and for the other reason that it is simply not true.\n\"We know patients' symptoms get better during pregnancy but it is definitely not a cure or a treatment.\"\nThe condition means cells such as the ones in the lining of the womb (uterus) are found elsewhere in the body.\nEach month these cells react in the same way to those inside the womb - building up, then breaking down and bleeding, but with no way to escape. \nPainful periods are just one of the potential symptoms, which can also include pain during sex, heavy, prolonged or irregular periods, pain when passing urine, symptoms of irritable bowel, back and leg pain, fatigue, infertility and depression. Surgery can also cause adhesions - which are bands of scar tissue that can bind two organs together.\nBecause some symptoms are shared by other illnesses, diagnosis is very difficult. On average, it takes almost eight years between a woman first seeing a doctor about their symptoms and receiving a firm diagnosis.\nThe cause is unknown and there is no definitive cure.\nFaye Farthing is the campaigns manager for Endometriosis UK.\nShe said \"Comments such as 'just get on with it', 'the pain is all in your head', or even myths such as 'just get pregnant and your endometriosis will be cured', must become a thing of the past if we are to ensure those with endometriosis are accessing the support they need to manage this condition, and to reduce diagnosis time which currently averages at a shocking 8.5 years in Scotland. There is no cure for endometriosis, and it's time to call an end to such myths.\"\nDuring endometriosis awareness month, there is also a call for more research and awareness among women with endometriosis from Scotland's black, Asian and ethnic minority communities.\nScottish broadcaster Afua Adom has had really bad symptoms since she was 15 and was finally diagnosed at the age of 25. \nShe said: \"I have been on painkillers every single day since I started getting symptoms, whether that is paracetamol, mefenamic acid naproxen, ibuprofen or co-codamol. \n\"You name it - I've thrown it at the situation. And I have not had less than two paracetamol every single day of my life since then.\"\nIt took 10 years for Afua to get a diagnosis, and that is not uncommon. \nShe is now worried about the number of painkillers she is taking just to keep going.\n\"It's absolutely shocking. I mean, what are your options?,\" she said. \"You take painkillers every day, like I do. You have invasive laser surgery, which I had and perforated my bowel. And then it comes back so you have another surgery, you have another incision, and it comes back.\n\"There is no effective treatment, there is no effective cure. Essentially we are being told this is a horrible thing that happens inside of your body - go away and deal with it.\"\nAbout 1.5m UK women are dealing with it, including radio presenter Katy Johnston, 25, from Glasgow.\nShe was put into a chemical menopause in an attempt to ease her pain.\nShe said: \"A 22-year-old should not know what it feels like to be kept up all night with hot flushes. But for me it was a case of menopause or crippling pain, can't get out of bed, can't function. At this point I was so poorly I hadn't left the house in months, I had to drop out of my postgrad in journalism. My quality of life was just zero.\"\nAnother issue flagged up by campaigners is a lack of research among BAME communities.\nAfua Adom said: \"We need to know how it affects black and Asian women differently and how long it takes them to get a diagnosis, how it ties in with fibroids and is it more prevalent and how the two sit together in the body.\nProf Horne agrees this is an area that needs inspection.\n\"I run a number of research studies and we would like hear from the BAME community and make sure everybody gets involved, not just a subset of the population,\" he said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There is huge variation in the percentage of frontline NHS healthcare staff who have been vaccinated against Covid in England.\nMore than 98% in the North East and South West have had a first dose - but only 79% in London, leaving around 35,000 staff unvaccinated there.\nMinisters are considering whether to make the jab mandatory for NHS staff.\nHealth and social care workers across the UK were one of the first groups to be offered a vaccine. \nIn England, NHS data suggests 93% of eligible frontline staff have been vaccinated - equivalent to one million doses.   \nBut, nearly three months after the vaccination programme began, up to 80,000 frontline staff have still not taken up the offer. \nDr Lara Alloway, chief medical officer of Hampshire Hospitals, told the BBC that the trust was contacting staff individually if they haven't been vaccinated and \"making sure they understand why having a vaccine is so important\".\nWeekly online Q&A sessions are being held for staff, a dedicated helpline has been set up and clear information on the vaccine is provided to try to combat misinformation. \nMore than 90% of staff at the trust have had a first dose.\nDr Alloway said some had chosen to delay getting the jab because they were pregnant or breastfeeding or had already had Covid. Some were also concerned about their allergies.\n\"We need to make sure we are providing as much information to people to allow them to make the right decisions,\" Dr Alloway said. \nThe idea of making the vaccine compulsory for NHS staff will be looked at as part of a government review in England into whether vaccine passports or certificates are a good way of proving someone's Covid status.\nNurses, doctors, ambulance staff and other NHS staff were prioritised early in the vaccine rollout if they:\nBut an estimated one in 10 frontline health care workers in England and Wales has not yet had their first dose, according to NHS England figures.\nScotland and Northern Ireland were not able to provide comparable figures, although the Scottish government said it had exceeded its target to vaccinate frontline staff. Almost 123,000 health and social care staff have been vaccinated in Northern Ireland.\nLeon Ghulam, the Hampshire trust's black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) workforce lead, said language barriers were one reason why some staff, including Eastern Europeans, were hesitant to have the vaccine. \nA video in several languages has been shared with staff to reassure them. \n\"Family and friends can put pressure on staff - but we recommend all workforce to take the vaccine,\" he said.\n\"There is still progress to be made, but we are heading in the right direction.\" \nA nurse, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC she was prepared to accept the risk of choosing not to being vaccinated.\nShe said being forced to have the jab \"would be against my human right - I should be able to make my own decision\".\nIn London, where just over three-quarters of frontline staff have been vaccinated, senior doctor Anton Emmanuel said he had met several staff members who decided to reject the vaccine for personal reasons. \n\"One of the most common reasons is about trust. When it comes to staff belonging to black, Asian and other minority communities, for example, some feel they haven't been at the front of the queue for anything in terms of health before, and question why they are suddenly at the front of the queue now,\" he said.\n\"Aside from the historical inequalities in healthcare, these staff have seen patients from these same communities dying of Covid in disproportionate numbers. And they feel too little was done to prevent it.\"\nDr Emmanuel has taken part in several events and discussions with healthcare workers about the vaccine and said having humble, honest discussions was crucial. \n\"I start by saying, 'I understand we don't deserve your trust but please do ask all your questions'.\" \nHe tells them he's had the vaccine and gives them the facts they ask for, saying it can protect them.\n\"You see people's eyes suddenly widen as their minds change.\"\nSir David Sloman, regional director of the NHS in London said they were \"continuing to reach out to eligible groups, working with local authorities, care homes, faith and community groups and others to encourage uptake of the safe, effective vaccines which will help save lives\".\nHowever, in Yorkshire, GP registrar Henna Anwar said she hadn't come across a single healthcare worker who had decided not to take the vaccine when offered it. She says vaccine uptake is high in this group and, in her experience, frontline staff are excited to have it. \n\"Although I don't feel vaccines should be mandatory, I felt it was almost a professional obligation,\" she said.\n\"It was not only about me - I could potentially have been carrying the virus without knowing it. \n\"For me it was about my patients and my family.\""

      "text": "On 3 March 2016, Natalie Queiroz shared a picture on social media of her rapidly growing baby bump. She was eight months pregnant and looking forward to the birth of her daughter and life with partner Babur \"Bobby\" Raja. Twenty-four hours later she was being flown by air ambulance to hospital. She had been stabbed more than 20 times, and paramedics feared for the lives of both her and her unborn child.\nAhead of the fifth anniversary of the attack, I met Natalie at the scene - Trinity Hill in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. \nHer hands were shaking and she described being back as \"really, really tough\", adding: \"To think this could have been the final place I would have been [alive].\" Revisiting the scene has become part of how she has dealt with the trauma. \nNatalie, 45, remembers most of what happened vividly.  It was raining, she had her coat pulled up and was holding an umbrella as she walked towards the town centre. Her mind was on shopping.\n\"I just remember these footsteps running behind me,\" she said. She feared she was about to be mugged, but felt she was safe because she was such a short distance from the shops, and, as it was 15:00, there were plenty of people about. That's when her attacker jumped her from behind and began stabbing her.\nShe desperately held on to her bump to try to protect her baby, but described the attack as \"incessant\". Two men intervened and tried to drag the attacker off her, incurring injuries themselves.\nNatalie didn't know who the knifeman was. Raja, her partner, had disguised his appearance and had a hood covering his face. She told me that she caught a glimpse and thought it was him, but then disregarded the idea. \nAs the others fought with Raja, Natalie tried to escape. Despite bleeding heavily she managed to get to her feet and stagger away. \"I was looking at the town centre\u2026 and I remember thinking 'I've just got to get there, because if I can get there, I can get help'.\"\nHer wounds were too severe and she collapsed next to a wall and passed out. \"The two guys who'd been holding the attacker said they thought that I'd gone - they thought that that was it, that I had died.\"  \nRaja managed to fight off the other men and came at Natalie again just as she regained consciousness. \"I put my head down and he pulled up in front of me, and he crouched down and he began the attack again.\"\nNatalie doesn't remember much of what happened next. A third rescuer, Callum Gibson, had run up Trinity Hill and joined the other men, John Mitchell and Anthony Smith, in finally stopping Raja's attack. West Midlands Police officers arrived to help, and closed nearby roads to allow an air ambulance to land.\nNatalie had suffered eleven chest wounds, her right lung had collapsed and she had also been stabbed in the liver and uterus.  \nParamedics stabilised her as she was taken to hospital. Natalie had regained consciousness again, but there seemed to be little hope for her child. \"To be honest, we all thought she'd passed away,\" she said.\nNatalie underwent lifesaving surgery and was put into an induced coma. It was only when she came round that she was given the news her daughter had survived and had been safely delivered by Caesarean section. \"To get that news, that she was alive, was almost incomprehensible.\"\nIn June 2016, Raja pleaded guilty at Birmingham Crown Court to attempted murder and was jailed for 18 years. During the hearing, at which Natalie was present, the court heard he attacked her after being forced to choose between his conservative Muslim mother's faith and the \"love of his life\". This, it was said, had \"tipped him over the edge\". \nA court order remains in place meaning that Natalie's daughter cannot be named. On Thursday, the family has been celebrating her fifth birthday. It will be impossible to keep the full details of the story from the little girl forever. As she grows up, Natalie is gradually explaining to her what happened, but she doesn't know everything yet.\n\"She's a funny little girl with a big heart... she knows that mummy got hurt the day she was born, she knows it was very serious, and that mummy went in a helicopter... she knows that because of what happened she had to be born that day.\" \nNatalie is amazingly upbeat despite what happened. She still suffers physically because of some of her wounds, but jokes that her breast implants saved her life. She has also visited Raja in prison despite being warned against it.\nShe said it was a cathartic experience. \"I needed to face him and I needed to look him in the eye.\" However he still wouldn't fully acknowledge what happened. He has also sent her letters in which he said he was \"proud\" of the way she had dealt with the attack. She sees this as an attempt at controlling behaviour.  \nI asked her whether she ever thought she would be able to achieve closure.\n\"Anyone who's been through a major trauma will say you never get over it, you learn to live with it and it becomes part of your life. I've dealt with it by all my fundraising and talking to young people about the reality of knife crime\u2026 to me that's the best way of coming to terms with everything.\" \nNatalie's positivity is clear in the work she's undertaken since the attack. She has already raised tens of thousands of pounds for Midlands Air Ambulance and is to walk the 140 miles between its three bases in four days as soon as it is possible. \nShe also has something else to look forward to. Last year she got engaged to Simon Lyttle, a fellow fundraiser, and once lockdown is over they will be married. \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Ministers will not try to cap any pay rise for Welsh NHS staff in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Wales' health minister has said.\nThe UK government has faced a backlash after saying a pay rise for staff in England should be capped at 1%.\nVaughan Gething MS said on Friday that Welsh NHS workers \"deserved a pay rise\".\nHe said the Welsh Government had \"not tried to set a ceiling\" on any proposed wage increase.\nThe NHS Pay Review Body - an independent body - looks at potential wage increases for NHS workers.\nIt then recommends what pay rises - if any - should take place.\nBoth governments had made suggestions to the body. In England, the nurses' union has threatened possible strike action after the Department of Health suggested the 1% pay rise.\nMr Gething said the Welsh submission would be made public, saying Wales had not suggested a \"ceiling\" on any increase in the same way.\n\"We're waiting to see the outcome of the pay review body and we expect to publish the evidence we've provided to that pay review body if not today then in the very near future,\" he said.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said it had met with Mr Gething on Friday, and made it clear that England's proposals were \"nothing short of an insult to a profession which has gone above and beyond during the pandemic\". \nChair of the Welsh council, Dr David Bailey said: \"We implore him to ensure that [the pay rise] is fair, given that doctors have given their all during the last year - their sacrifices deserve to be recognised.\"\nThe Royal College of Nurses (RCN), who are threatening strikes over the proposals in England, said the Welsh Government should commit to a \"12.5% increase\" for all staff.\nNicky Hughes, RCN Wales Associate Director of Nursing, said the sector was struggling with staff shortages and could not attract graduates if the pay was not fair.\n\"In a week's time, we will be holding a memorial for all those health and social care workers who lost their lives during Covid-19,\" she said.\n\"This was the ultimate sacrifice. What more do nurses have to do to prove their valuable contribution to health care? A one-percent up-rise in pay is non-negotiable. We don't want excuses; we need action.\"\nThe UK government said the 1% pay rise for NHS workers was \"what's affordable\" whilst acknowledging the \"work and commitment\" of staff over the last 12 months. \nA spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Westminster had done all it can \"to protect jobs and save livelihoods\", and over a million NHS staff in England continued to benefit from existing multi-year pay deals. \nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the proposed 1% pay rise in England was \"absolutely disgusting\" and represents a real terms pay cut.\"We support the call from the RCN and other health unions for a meaningful pay rise\".\"This 1% isn't even a pay rise. Inflation is running at around 1.5 to 1.8%. It's a pay cut\"."

Those in their third year will have had two successive years of disruption.\nBut rebates for students should be funded by the government, because many universities \"cannot afford to pay\", said Sir Anthony.\nThis week the university complaints watchdog, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, revealed that a university had to pay a student \u00a35,000 in compensation for lost teaching time during lockdown.\nIn Northern Ireland, students are to receive \u00a3500 each in recognition of the disruption caused to their studies during the pandemic.\nSir Anthony, also writing in the Times, says universities should be more assertive in \"challenging the government to come up with money to compensate students\".\nHe argues that universities should have a higher status after their role in tackling the pandemic, including developing Covid vaccines.\nBut instead, Sir Anthony says universities are being publicly blamed by ministers for \"one misdemeanour after another\" and \"put on the naughty step\".\nHe wants universities to take a tougher collective line with politicians and to start \"punching their weight\".\nOn rebates on tuition fees, Universities UK said: \"The government is clear that there should not be blanket tuition refunds.\"\nA spokesman said additional measures were in place for students, such as online learning, \"enhanced wellbeing and mental health support and significant hardship funding\".\nMany student rooms are privately rented, but Universities UK said universities were \"actively working with government and looking at ways to ensure a fair deal for students\".\nNUS president, Ms Kennedy, warned the \"economic strain\" of the pandemic meant many students faced \"difficult decisions as to whether they will be able to continue their education\".\nThe Department for Education (DfE) said universities were autonomous and claims for a fee refund would depend on the contract between the individual student and university.\nA DfE spokeswoman said: \"We have been clear that universities should maintain the quality and quantity of tuition, and ensure it is accessible to all students, regardless of their background, and the Office for Students is monitoring online teaching to ensure this is the case.\""

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Brazil coronavirus variant now found in the UK appears more contagious and may evade immunity provided by past infection, scientists say.\nExperiences from Manaus - the Amazonian city hit hard by the P.1 variant - suggest it could be up to twice as transmissible as earlier Covid there, the first detailed study suggests.\nThe preliminary work puts the chance of reinfection at between 25% and 60%.\nBut experts say this should not be used to predict what may happen in the UK.  \nIndeed, one of the lead researchers said it was unlikely P.1 would quickly take off in Britain when only six cases had been identified and these were being closely monitored. \nInfectious diseases expert Prof Ester Sabino, from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, said: \"You need many introductions [of a virus] to start an epidemic. Six is very few. I would say if you take care and do contact tracing, this is going to decrease.\"\nProfessor Sharon Peacock, who is director of the UK's centre leading on genetic testing of coronavirus, said: \"We are taking appropriate action. These are very interesting and important findings for Brazil, but how they relate to the UK is yet to be determined.\"\nUpdating MPs on the six cases of the Brazil variant seen in the UK, Health Secretary Hancock said: \"We have no information to suggest the variant has spread further.\"\nOne of the six people affected has not yet been identified, but the search has narrowed from the whole country down to 379 households in the south-east of England.\nMr Hancock said: \"We're contacting each one.\"\nThe researchers have been tracking coronavirus in Brazil for nearly a year now. Manaus, like many other regions around the world, encountered a large first wave in the spring of 2020. \nLots of people were infected with the original version of the virus at that time, with blood test results suggesting as many as three-quarters of the population getting some degree of protection or immunity from this exposure. \nDespite this, people in Manaus were hit badly by another wave of coronavirus in the winter. \nThe research team from Brazil and Imperial College London have been studying the genetic makeup of coronavirus in some of those who were infected between November and December, as well as modelling the pandemic outcomes. \nThey say the P.1 variant probably emerged in early November, dominated and spread quickly, and caused many reinfections. \nThe data is preliminary, but fits with what experts have suspected - that some of these new variants of coronavirus the world is seeing are more infectious and can evade some of the immunity people may have already built against Covid. \nThis raises questions about how well current vaccines, which were designed around earlier versions of the virus, might work and how countries can ease restrictions without case levels rising too high.  \nWork is already under way to redesign or tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new \"variants of concern\", although existing ones should still provide some protection, particularly against severe disease. \nUpdated vaccines could be ready within months, meaning the UK would have millions of doses ready to give people a booster shot before next winter to make sure the population is protected. \nThe priority, along with mass vaccination, is to keep cases low to reduce the chance of new and emerging variants from spreading. \nMr Hancock said: \"Our current vaccines have not yet been studied against this variant and we're working to understand what impact it might have, but we do know that this variant has caused significant challenges in Brazil, so we're doing all we can to stop the spread of this new variant in the UK, to analyse its effects and to develop an updated vaccine that works on all these variants of concern and protect the progress that we've made as a nation.\""

      "text": "Covid was \"completely underestimated\" and not enough was done to prepare for a pandemic in the UK, one of Wales' most senior doctors has said.\nProf Sir Mansel Aylward, ex-chairman of Public Health Wales, said he was \"to blame as much as anyone\".\nSir Mansel has spoken of struggling for months with physical and mental health issues after testing positive.\nHe also spoke about Covid's impact on his community in Merthyr Tydfil - one of the worst-hit areas in Wales.\nSir Mansel, who was one of the first on the scene in the wake of the Aberfan disaster in 1966, said he initially mistook his symptoms for the asthma he has suffered with since childhood. \nBut the 78-year-old soon began to deteriorate and went into hospital in April. \n\"I had multiple clots - emboli in both of my lungs and it was quite serious, a life threatening disease,\" he said.\n\"Later, they showed me the X-ray and I thought, 'Oh my God that's me, I'm off, you know, I've had a good life', and all that sort of stuff, I really did feel that, I was at my lowest at that point.\"\nHe found the disease's long-term effects, which included severe depression, more debilitating than the initial illness and said without the help of professionals and support from his family \"I dread to think what would have happened\".\nAlthough he said the NHS \"did as well as it could\" in dealing with the pandemic's effects, Sir Mansel claimed governments and health organisations failed to appreciate how serious Covid was in the early stages.\nHe also said there was a failure to properly plan for the risk of a global pandemic over a number of years.\n\"The big lesson that has to be learnt is that the virus itself and its effect was completely underestimated,\" he said.\nSir Mansel has had a distinguished career, holding some of the most important medical and scientific posts in the UK - a world away from the Merthyr Tydfil pub and social club he grew up in.\nHe began his career as a GP in the town after changing his mind about wanting to become a surgeon.\nThat decision came after he witnessed one of the biggest tragedies in Welsh history, and it would go on to shape the rest of his life. \n\"My life was changed after the experiences I had after the Aberfan disaster in 1966,\" he said. \n\"I was then a final year medical student, my wife and I and my small son came home, by chance, on that day and were stopped at the top of Dowlais and told there'd been a disaster in Aberfan.\n\"I thought it was a mining disaster because my family are from Aberfan and many of them were colliers, but it turned out to be the school. \n\"I was one of the first responders and spent two days in Aberfan and saw things which I could not [until recently] even think about.\"\nThe effect of Covid on his home community has rekindled the memories of the disaster's aftermath.\n\"I'm very upset at the number of people who were in my class at school who have died with Covid or suspected Covid,\" he said.\n\"I'm talking about seven or eight people the same age as me. It's had a major effect on the way I think.\n\"I've been to seven or eight funerals in the last two months and it's really soul-destroying.\n\"I never thought, after Aberfan, that I'd face any experience like that again and even though Covid is not at that level, it has been something that's deeply affected me, my family and my friends.\"\nIt would take Sir Mansel - also chairman of the Bevan Commission health think-tank as well as the Life Sciences Hub Wales - nine months to recover from the virus.\n\"The long-Covid as it's known, started two or three weeks after my acute attack and that disabled me even more,\" he said. \n\"I couldn't sleep, I couldn't even get out of a chair, I had to be helped, I had difficulties getting in and out of bed.\n\"I felt dreadful, I had days when I had depression. I wasn't thinking properly - that's a thing my family noticed. I found difficulty finding a word, I forgot things quickly. I said some silly things and did some silly things.\"\nHe said he \"needed confidence\" he would not remain like that for the rest of his life. \n\"[But] that support came from my family in particular, from physicians, endocrinologists, psychiatrists, GPs - they all needed to be there as Covid is a multi-faceted disease,\" he said.\n\"I had initial depression because I thought I was going to die - and the later depression when I thought I wasn't going to recover from it. I'm very lucky I had so much support, understanding and empathy.\"\nThe under-estimation of the virus meant people \"understandably said, including my colleagues, it's only a mild cold, sniffles, mild influenza. That was wrong and we should have been on to that much more quickly\".\nHe added: \"I'm to blame as much as anybody else. I was chair of Public Health Wales for eight years. And each year we had a couple of days where we planned for a pandemic. \n\"So yes, I think we were prepared 'theoretically' about what we should be doing, But we weren't prepared in the way of doing something concrete at the beginning, well-planned, well-written out.\n\"We could have done more much more quickly, but when the NHS got around to it, once we got moving we did go 'above and beyond' and that's the silver lining, the way people worked together, communities understood and listened and there was much closer working between health and social care.\"\nHe said the challenges facing the health service would last for many years and the pandemic had proved there was a clear need to \"spend more money on the NHS\"."

      "text": "The UK government has announced unilateral moves to ease the trade in plants from GB to NI.\nNorthern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods, which includes following EU plant health rules.\nThis has meant soil from other parts of the UK cannot legally enter NI, causing difficulties for garden centres.\nThe government is now temporarily relaxing that rule.\nIt means that bulbs or vegetables that have been grown in soil can be sent from GB to NI with soil attached.\nThe move has been taken without the agreement of the EU which has already said it is preparing legal action against the UK for changing the implementation of the NI Brexit deal without its agreement.\nPlants grown in soil can also be moved with soil attached, provided they are from an authorised business meeting GB plant passporting requirements for soil.\nTraders can move used agricultural machinery without the need for a plant health certificate, providing they have been washed to remove excessive soil and plant debris. \nThis means machinery can still be moved if small amounts of soil remain.\nThe government said: \"These temporary, practical arrangements recognise the need to ensure biosecurity on the island of Ireland is not compromised whilst addressing barriers which stop goods moving into Northern Ireland.\"\nEU Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said the UK still remained bound to take \"practical steps\" relating to the implementation of the NI Protocol.\n\"If people are talking about us trying to find agreement on prolonging the grace periods, which must be a joint decision in the context of the joint committee, then the UK also has to do its homework on those practical steps that it has to implement.\n\"It should have implemented some of them already some time ago.\n\"We are looking to the UK to respect and implement those commitments.\"\nDUP Agriculture Minister Gordon Lyons acknowledged the announcements to extend grace periods. He said he was sure it was \"a welcome breathing space for local businesses\".\n\"However, I will continue to press both the UK and EU for permanent solutions that ensure GB's agri-food business can trade unfettered with NI,\" he added.\nShadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said that the action did not take Northern Ireland \"a single step closer to any lasting solutions that ease the red tape the prime minister's deal created\".\n\"Ministers have a responsibility to secure lasting solutions that benefit Northern Ireland, and ensure stability,\" she added.\n\"Without trust that will be impossible, and that trust is being undermined.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in MP Chris Hazzard said the UK government had \"gone off on a further solo run\".\n\"This is another reckless and unnecessary move by the British government and, instead of providing the certainty required, only adds to the confusion,\" he said.

      "tags": "Public sector,Nursing,NHS,Pay",
      "text": "The government can expect a \"backlash\" if it goes ahead with a proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England next year, a nursing union has warned.\nThe health department has made the recommendation in a submission to the independent panel that advises on NHS salaries. \nThe Royal College of Nursing called the suggested rise \"pitiful\" and said nurses should be getting 12.5% more.\nNHS staff have been excluded from a pay freeze for most public sector workers.\nThe NHS Pay Review Body is due to recommend salary levels for health service staff before early May, before ministers then make a final decision. \nIn its submission, the health department said awarding NHS staff a \"headline\" pay increase of more than 1% \"would require re-prioritisation\".\nHealth department officials said the Covid pandemic had placed a \"huge strain\" on NHS finances, whilst the economic outlook \"remains uncertain\".\nThey added that this increase was still above the CPI rate of inflation, whilst some staff would see a higher rise under a previously agreed three-year deal. \nSome 1.3 million public sector workers will see a pay freeze next year, while those earning less than \u00a324,000 guaranteed a pay rise of at least \u00a3250.\nSpeaking on BBC's Question Time, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he was sure the pay round \"has been discussed and established at the right level\". \n\"No one is doubting that the NHS hasn't been absolutely first class in this pandemic. What I am suggesting is that the whole economy has been under pressure,\" he added. \nBut Labour said a 1% increase for NHS staff was \"the ultimate kick in teeth to our NHS heroes who have done so much to keep us safe over the past year\".\nThe party's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said staff \"deserve a fair pay rise,\" adding the proposal was \"an absolute insult\".\nNHS pay in England has been out of the news since 2018 when a three year deal was agreed and welcomed by unions.\nBut the issue is firmly back on the agenda with a new deal needed for the upcoming financial year. \nThis is just the start of the process. \nThe government has made its submission to the NHS Pay Review Body. But the fact that ministers think a 1% pay rise is reasonable has angered health unions. \nThey see it as scant reward for the huge efforts of staff during the pandemic. \nGovernment sources say that inflation is so low that 1% still represents a real terms increase and that public finances are constrained. \nThis is shaping up to be a tense few months with pay added to the many difficult issues facing the NHS.  \nRCN Chief Executive Dame Donna Kinnair said the government was \"dangerously out of touch with nursing staff, NHS workers and the public\".\n\"Nursing staff would feel they are being punished and made to pay for the cost of the pandemic. It is a political decision to underfund and undervalue nursing staff.\n\"With the time remaining before the Pay Review Body recommendation, the government can expect a backlash from a million NHS workers. Taxpayers are supportive of a significant and fair pay rise for NHS workers - this year of all years.\" \nOne nurse, Carmel O'Boyle, said she was \"disgusted\".\n\"We just want something that reflects the work that we do. We want a fair wage and I don't think the government understands at all what the nursing workforce does,\" she said.\n\"I understand it is a very difficult year for the whole world... but this is a political decision,\" she added. \nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said the recommendation was \"a kick in the teeth\".\nIts chair of council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, accused the government of a \"total dereliction\" of its \"moral duty and obligation to a workforce that is keeping the NHS on its feet and patients alive\".\nHe said: \"Throughout the pandemic, doctors have cared for more critically ill patients than was ever thought possible and worked round the clock despite suffering from extreme stress and exhaustion. \n\"The government should demonstrate that it recognises the contribution of a workforce that has literally kept this country alive for the past 10 months.\"\nA government spokesperson said they would \"consider carefully\" the recommendations made by the NHS Pay Review Body when it reports in the spring.\nThe government \"will continue to provide pay rises for NHS workers\", despite the wider freeze on pay in the rest of the public sector, the spokesperson said. \nThey added multi-year pay deals had delivered a pay rise of over 12% for newly qualified nurses, and will increase junior doctors' pay scales by 8.2%.\nIf you are an NHS worker, what are your views about your pay?

      "text": "A-level and GCSE pupils in Wales will be told provisional grades by teachers in June, ahead of official results days in August.\nQualifications Wales said it meant pupils could appeal to the school or college before final results were confirmed.\nThis summer's grades will be decided by teachers, after exams were cancelled.\nResults days will be earlier than usual - A-levels and AS-levels on 10 August and GCSEs on 12 August.\nExams regulator Qualification Wales said in its latest guidance on how A-levels, AS-levels and GCSEs will be assessed, that there would be a three-stage appeals process, beginning with the release of provisional grades in June.\nExam board the Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) will not change the grades once they have been submitted by schools or colleges, but they can approach them about \"atypical\" grading.\nA second stage, after official results are published, would be an appeal to the exam board if candidates feel the grades given by their school or college are unreasonable or a procedural error has been made. \nThe final stage of appeal is to the watchdog, Qualifications Wales.\nBut Gareth Evans, director of education policy at the University of Wales Trinity St David's, said it was \"another very, very late decision, another change\" and that \"there are going to be number of very frustrated and disappointed teachers\".\nHe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"I think this is a way of building in another safety net to give pupils that opportunity to challenge and to probe the rationale behind the awarding of their grades. \n\"That doesn't however excuse the fact this announcement has been made in March when I think decisions could have been taken in the autumn if not earlier.\"\nThe process is different to what is happening in England, where appeals are only possible after results day in August.\nPhilip Blaker, chief executive of Qualifications Wales, said they had been working with the WJEC exam board and the Design and Delivery Advisory group of schools and college leaders to come up with an effective appeals process.\nThey had also considered the recommendations of a highly critical independent review into last summer's exams fiasco.\n\"As with all the decisions being taken for this summer, there are no easy answers,\" Mr Blaker said.\n\"We are committed to putting the needs of the learner at the heart of our work.\"\nThe guidance also covers arrangements for private candidates, who are not registered at a particular school or college, including home-educated children and some students who are resitting.\nSchools and colleges across Wales will be identified as hubs for some private candidates to take assessments which will be graded by the exam board.\nWales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams announced summer exams were cancelled in November, and a system of assessments was put in place instead.\nHowever they also had to be scrapped when schools and colleges were closed in January, and it was decided that teachers and lecturers would determine their students' grades.\nSummer 2020 grades were eventually based on teachers' grades after uproar about the \"downgrading\" of results as a result of a standardisation process."

      "text": "Ministers will not try to cap any pay rise for Welsh NHS staff in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Wales' health minister has said.\nThe UK government has faced a backlash after saying a pay rise for staff in England should be capped at 1%.\nVaughan Gething MS said on Friday that Welsh NHS workers \"deserved a pay rise\".\nHe said the Welsh Government had \"not tried to set a ceiling\" on any proposed wage increase.\nThe NHS Pay Review Body - an independent body - looks at potential wage increases for NHS workers.\nIt then recommends what pay rises - if any - should take place.\nBoth governments had made suggestions to the body. In England, the nurses' union has threatened possible strike action after the Department of Health suggested the 1% pay rise.\nMr Gething said the Welsh submission would be made public, saying Wales had not suggested a \"ceiling\" on any increase in the same way.\n\"We're waiting to see the outcome of the pay review body and we expect to publish the evidence we've provided to that pay review body if not today then in the very near future,\" he said.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said it had met with Mr Gething on Friday, and made it clear that England's proposals were \"nothing short of an insult to a profession which has gone above and beyond during the pandemic\". \nChair of the Welsh council, Dr David Bailey said: \"We implore him to ensure that [the pay rise] is fair, given that doctors have given their all during the last year - their sacrifices deserve to be recognised.\"\nThe Royal College of Nurses (RCN), who are threatening strikes over the proposals in England, said the Welsh Government should commit to a \"12.5% increase\" for all staff.\nNicky Hughes, RCN Wales Associate Director of Nursing, said the sector was struggling with staff shortages and could not attract graduates if the pay was not fair.\n\"In a week's time, we will be holding a memorial for all those health and social care workers who lost their lives during Covid-19,\" she said.\n\"This was the ultimate sacrifice. What more do nurses have to do to prove their valuable contribution to health care? A one-percent up-rise in pay is non-negotiable. We don't want excuses; we need action.\"\nThe UK government said the 1% pay rise for NHS workers was \"what's affordable\" whilst acknowledging the \"work and commitment\" of staff over the last 12 months. \nA spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Westminster had done all it can \"to protect jobs and save livelihoods\", and over a million NHS staff in England continued to benefit from existing multi-year pay deals. \nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the proposed 1% pay rise in England was \"absolutely disgusting\" and represents a real terms pay cut.\"We support the call from the RCN and other health unions for a meaningful pay rise\".\"This 1% isn't even a pay rise. Inflation is running at around 1.5 to 1.8%. It's a pay cut\"."

      "text": "Dozens of Covid contracts had not been published when Boris Johnson told MPs they were \"on the record for everyone to see\".\nThe High Court has confirmed that 100 contracts had yet to be revealed at the time the PM made his comments.\nLast month, a judge ruled the health secretary had acted unlawfully by not publishing contracts in the required timeframe.\nMinisters said remaining contracts would be published as soon as possible.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care struck deals worth hundreds of millions of pounds during the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe government is required by law to publish a \"contract award notice\" within 30 days of the awarding any contracts for public goods or services worth more than \u00a3120,000.\nIn the High Court in February, Mr Justice Chamberlain said the public were entitled to see who the money was going to, what it was being spent on and how the relevant contracts were awarded.\nHe ruled that Health Secretary Matt Hancock acted unlawfully when his department failed to publish award notices for contracts it had agreed during the Covid pandemic within 30 days of them being signed.\nThe judge also found the health secretary had acted unlawfully by failing to comply with the government's own policy of publishing the contracts within 20 days of them being awarded.\nThe contracts have attracted scrutiny because many were awarded directly, without being opened to competition, because of the urgency of the pandemic.\nChallenged about the ruling in the House of Commons on 22 February, Mr Johnson said: \"All the details are on the record.\"\nThe prime minister added: \"The contracts are there on the record for everybody to see.\"\nBut three days later, in a written legal response to the Good Law Project, seen by the BBC, government lawyers admitted 100 contracts for suppliers and services relating to Covid-19 signed before 7 October had yet to be published.\nThe court had asked the government to declare the number of contracts which had been published late.\nGovernment lawyers also confirmed that 482 out of 513 contract award notices - 94% of them - had been published outside the 30 days required by law.\n\"It is only when details of contracts are published that they can be properly scrutinised, otherwise there is no way of knowing where taxpayers' money is going and why,\" says Gemma Abbott, the Good Law Project's legal director.\n\"We have a government contemptuous of transparency and apparently allergic to accountability.\"\nThe court order handed down on Friday by the High Court confirmed that 608 out of 708 relevant contracts had been published and that in some or all of these cases, the health secretary had acted unlawfully by not making them public in the required timeframe.\nThe Good Law Project said this showed the prime minister had \"falsely reassured\" MPs about the number of contracts that remained to be published.\nThe judge also ordered the government to pay \u00a385,000 towards the campaign group's costs.\nAs officials attempt to the clear the backlog of unpublished contracts, more evidence is emerging of personal protective equipment (PPE) bought at vast expense that cannot be used as intended.\nLast October the government published a contract summary detailing PPE worth \u00a334m it had bought from the Chinese firm Qingzhou Yaowang Pharmaceutical.\nThe firm was contracted to supply high-grade FFP3 masks, which are used by medics working in intensive care units.\nBut the contract, which was only published this week, has revealed that officials knew the masks they had bought came only with ear loops. \nSince signing the deal, the government has changed its technical requirements to say that these should not be used in masks of such a high grade because of concerns they do not fit securely enough. \nRachel Reeves MP, Labour's shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, responding to reports that dozens of Covid contracts were yet to be published, said: \"It is deeply concerning how much the government has relied on crony contracts throughout the pandemic, while leaving our frontline workers exposed. \n\"First the government acted unlawfully, then the prime minister falsely claimed everything had been published. \n\"It is a basic right for the public to know where and how our cash is being spent. The government needs to come out of hiding, simply publish the contracts it has sitting around and support our frontline staff with PPE not pay cuts.\"\nA government spokesman said: \"We have been working tirelessly to deliver what is needed to protect our health and social care staff throughout this pandemic, within very short timescales and against a backdrop of unparalleled global demand.\n\"This has often meant having to award contracts at speed to secure the vital supplies required to protect NHS workers and the public. We are committed to publishing all contracts and to date have published 99% of these in the Official Journal of the EU and we are working to publish outstanding contracts as soon as possible.\n\"As the 2020 NAO report recognised, all of the NHS providers audited were always able to get what they needed in time, thanks to the effort of government, the NHS, Armed Forces, civil servants and industry, who delivered over 8.8 billion items of PPE to the frontline at record speed.\""

      "text": "Businessman John McAfee, creator of the McAfee anti-virus software, has been charged in the US with conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering.\nMr McAfee and his bodyguard Jimmy Gale Watson Jr are accused of promoting cryptocurrencies to Mr McAfee's large Twitter following to inflate prices.\nThe currencies were then allegedly sold, making the pair $2m (\u00a31.45m), prosecutors said.\nThe men have not commented on the charges.\nMr McAfee, 75, is currently being detained in Spain in relation to separate criminal charges relating to tax, which he denies. He faces possible extradition to the US.\nMr Watson was arrested in Texas on Thursday. \n\"Jimmy Watson is a decorated veteran and former Navy Seal. He fought for other people's rights and liberties, and he is entitled to and looks forward to his day in court to exercise some of those very rights,\" said his lawyer Arnold Spencer.\nThe latest charges were filed in the Manhattan federal court in New York. The pair are accused of buying the cryptocurrency assets before promoting them on Twitter, where Mr McAfee has more than one million followers.\nThey would then sell the assets as soon as Mr McAfee's endorsements saw prices rise, according to the US justice department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nThey allegedly made a further $11m (\u00a38m) in payments from cryptocurrency start-ups for promoting their assets on Twitter, payments which were not disclosed to investors who  bought them. \nThat amounted to having \"exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception,\" federal prosecutor Audrey Strauss said.\nIn the separate tax evasion case - which was announced last October - Mr McAfee is accused of failing to file any tax returns from 2014 to 2018. Prosecutors also say he used other people's names to conceal his assets, including a yacht and property.\nA controversial figure, he came to prominence in the 1980s when his company released the first commercial anti-virus software - McAfee VirusScan - and helped spark a multi-billion dollar industry.\nAlthough that business has since been sold to Intel, he still develops cyber-security products of his own.\nThe entrepreneur, who was born in the UK, also launched unsuccessful bids to become the Libertarian Party's candidate for the US presidential elections in 2016 and 2020. \nMr McAfee has previously expressed his disdain for taxes, tweeting in 2019 that he had not filed tax returns for years because \"taxation is illegal\".\nIn 2012, he made headlines after police in the Central American country of Belize investigated the death of one Mr McAfee's neighbours and named him as a \"person of interest\". \nMr McAfee left the country saying he feared for his own safety. Officials ultimately said he was not a suspect."

      "text": "The Premier League and English Football League have been asked by a senior officer to work better with police to tackle racist abuse against players.\nDeputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts, wrote to both in January, but only had replies to his letter this week.\nWith more online abuse against players, he wants leagues and clubs to use the time without fans in grounds to work out how to stop the problem growing.\nSupporters could return in May, with some possible pilot events in April.\nMr Roberts fears that with some people thinking racism is acceptable online, there will be a new spike in hate crimes once fans are back inside stadiums.\n\"Before the lockdown we were already seeing a rise,\" he said. \"So the plea to the leagues and the clubs is while we have got this short hiatus, where we don't have fans in the stadium, let's be ready.\"    \nThe BBC obtained a copy of the letter sent to the English Football League (EFL) by Mr Roberts, who leads on football for the National Police Chiefs' Council, under Freedom of Information legislation. \nIn it, he calls for a single reporting mechanism for racist incidents both at grounds and on social media. \n\"Currently reports go to forces, leagues, Kick it Out, clubs and Crimestoppers to name the obvious ones,\" he writes. \n\"This inevitably leads to confusion on the part of the public, fragmentation of the information and inconsistencies in response.\"\nThe letter was emailed to EFL chairman Rick Parry, and a very similar one was emailed to Premier League chief executive Richard Masters.\nThe BBC contacted both organisations this week, and a few hours later, the EFL replied to the letter. It said it was working with stakeholders, including the police, to combat racism. \nThe Premier League said Mr Masters was only made aware of the letter after the BBC got in contact. However, it has now replied and said it had been involved in regular discussions with Mr Roberts and his colleagues, responding to the points he had raised. \nMr Roberts said: \"It is disappointing it has taken so long to receive a response to the letter sent to the Premier League and English Football League as it outlines the positive action we can take together to deal with this.\" \nHe added that he wants better co-operation from clubs in getting access to players who have suffered abuse.  \n\"We have had experiences where a force has been making real attempts to try to get to a player and they've hit this wall at a club. \n\"And publicly the player is saying: 'Where are the police, why are they not making contact?'.\" \nMr Roberts also described delays by social media giants, saying Twitter took nearly six months to respond to a request for information about one incident of racist abuse.  \n\"Their answer was that the account had by then been deleted and they couldn't provide any information. That denies justice to the player, and it means that someone gets away with it.\" \nThere are currently 16 live investigations where police forces in England are awaiting details from Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, he said.\nIt is understood the majority involve Twitter but the platform declined to comment. \nIn a statement, Facebook, which also owns Instagram, said: \"We do not want discriminatory abuse on Facebook or Instagram.\n\"We work closely with UK law enforcement and respond to valid legal requests for information in hate speech cases.\"\nDCC Roberts wants:\nThis would not cost the leagues anything, he says: \"The request isn't for cash, it's a request for focus and commitment and to back up all the things that people have been saying. \n\"Let's see some action as well and let's look after the players.\" \nA Premier League spokesperson said: \"We are doing everything possible to eradicate online racial abuse being experienced by players.\"\nAnd the EFL said it had now written to DCC Roberts to suggest how football and policing could work together better to combat racist abuse.

      "title": "'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering?",
      "tags": "Long Covid,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "For most people, Covid-19 is a brief and mild disease but some are left struggling with symptoms including lasting fatigue, persistent pain and breathlessness for months.  \nThe condition known as \"long Covid\" is having a debilitating effect on people's lives, and stories of being left exhausted after even a short walk are now common.\nSo far, the focus has been on saving lives during the pandemic, but there is now a growing recognition that people are facing long-term consequences of a Covid infection. \nYet even basic questions - such as why people get long Covid or whether everyone will fully recover - are riddled with uncertainty.\nThere is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences. \nHowever, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. \nOthers symptoms include: breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut.\nMental health problems have been reported including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. \nIt can utterly destroy people's quality of life. \"My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before,\" said one sufferer Jade Gray-Christie, \nLong Covid is not just people taking time to recover from a stay in intensive care. Even people with relatively mild infections can be left with lasting and severe health problems.\n\"We've got no doubt long Covid exists,\" Prof David Strain, from the University of Exeter, who is already seeing long-Covid patients at his Chronic Fatigue Syndrome clinic, told the BBC. \nA study of 143 people in Rome's biggest hospital, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, followed hospital patients after they were discharged.\nIt showed 87% had at least one symptom nearly two months later and more than half still had fatigue. \nHowever, such studies focus only on the minority of people who end up needing hospital treatment. \nThe Covid Symptom Tracker App - used by around four million people in the UK - found 12% of people still had symptoms after 30 days. Its latest, unpublished data, suggests as many as one in 50 (2%) of all people infected have long-Covid symptoms after 90 days. \nIt appears not. \nHalf of people in a study in Dublin still had fatigue 10 weeks after being infected with coronavirus. A third were physically unable to return to work. \nCrucially, doctors found no link between the severity of the infection and fatigue. \nHowever, extreme exhaustion is only one symptom of long Covid.\nProf Chris Brightling, from the University of Leicester and the chief investigator in the PHOSP-Covid project which is tracking people's recovery, believes people who developed pneumonia may have more problems because of damage to the lungs. \nThere are lots of ideas, but no definitive answers.\nThe virus may have been cleared from most of the body, but continues to linger in some small pockets. \n\"If there's long-term diarrhoea then you find the virus in the gut, if there's loss of smell it is in the nerves - so that could be what's causing the problem,\" says Prof Tim Spector, from King's College London.\nThe coronavirus can directly infect a wide variety of cells in the body and trigger an overactive immune response which also causes damage throughout the body. \nOne thought is the immune system does not return to normal after Covid and this causes ill-health. \nThe infection may also alter how people's organs function. This is most obvious with the lungs if they become scarred - long-term problems have been seen after infection with Sars or Mers, which are both types of coronavirus.\nBut Covid may also alter people's metabolism. There have been cases of people struggling to control their blood sugar levels after developing diabetes as a result of Covid, and Sars led to changes in the way the body processed fats for at least 12 years. \nThere are early signs of changes to brain structure, but these are still being investigated. And Covid-19 also does strange things to the blood, including abnormal clotting, and damaging the network of tubes that carry blood around the body. \nProf Strain told the BBC: \"The theory I'm working on is a premature ageing of the small blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues.\" But he warned that until we figure out what is causing long Covid \"it is difficult to figure out treatments.\"\nPost-viral fatigue or a post-viral cough are well documented and common - we've probably all had an infection that has taken ages to fully recover from.\nAround one in 10 people with glandular fever has fatigue which lasts for months. And there have even been suggestions that flu, particularly after the 1918 pandemic, may be linked to Parkinson's-like symptoms.\n\"With Covid there seem to be more far-reaching symptoms and the number of people seems to be much greater,\" says Prof Brightling. \nThe emphasis though is on the word \"seems\" as until we have a true picture of how many people have been infected we won't know exactly how common these symptoms are, he says. \nHe told the BBC: \"The uniqueness of the way the virus attacks the host and the different ways it then alters the way cells behave seem to be both giving people more severe infection than other viruses and persistent symptoms.\" \nThe number of people with long-Covid appears to be falling with time.\nHowever, the virus emerged only at the end of 2019 before going global earlier this year so there is a lack of long-term data. \n\"We've asked, deliberately, to follow people for 25 years, I certainly hope only a very small number will have problems going beyond a year, but I could be wrong,\" said Prof Brightling. \nHowever, there are concerns that even if people appear to recover now, they could face lifelong risks.\nPeople who have had chronic fatigue syndrome are more likely to have it again and the concern is that future infections may cause more flare-ups.\n\"If long Covid follows the same pattern I'd expect some recovery, but if it takes just another coronavirus infection to react then this could be every winter,\" said Prof Strain.\nIt is still possible more problems could emerge in the future. \nThe World Health Organization has warned that widespread inflammation caused by coronavirus could lead to people having heart problems at a much younger age. \nThe NHS has a \"Your Covid Recovery Plan\" which has advice, particularly for those who needed hospital treatment. \nIt recommends the \"three Ps\" in order to conserve energy:\nIt advises speaking to either your hospital team or your GP if you are not recovering as quickly as you might expect. \nSome have raised concerns that there is not enough support for people with long-Covid.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "text": "The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said that legal action is imminent over the UK's move to unilaterally extend grace periods on Irish Sea border checks.\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told the Financial Times that \"infringement proceedings\" are being prepared.\nHe said: \"We are currently preparing it and it would be really something coming to our table very soon.\"\nThe EU has two legal avenues open to it under the Brexit deals.\nUnder the NI part of the Brexit deal, the Protocol, it can launch infringement proceedings which could lead to a case at the European Court of Justice\nIt took this action at the time when the UK threatened to breach the NI deal through the Internal Market Bill.\nIn that case the legal proceedings were overtaken by political agreement.\nThe EU could also seek arbitration under the terms of the wider EU-UK trade deal.\nEarlier on Thursday, the UK government extended another of the Irish Sea border grace periods, this time for parcels.\nIt came a day after the UK extended grace periods for checks on agri-foods, a move the EU said was illegal.\nNorthern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures.\nThe grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied.\nThe first of these periods was to expire at the end of March; the UK says they will be extended until October.\nAll parcels entering Northern Ireland would have required customs declarations from 1 April.\nThe logistics industry said it was not ready to deal with that volume of new administration.\nThe government says the grace period for business-to-business deliveries will be extended until 1 October.\nFor all other deliveries, for example businesses to consumers, businesses will be given six months to prepare for new arrangements from the date those arrangements are announced.\nIn a protest against the UK's unilateral changes, the European Parliament has declined to set a date for its vote to ratify the EU-UK Brexit deal. \nEU parliament group chiefs had been expected to set a date this month for its vote at a meeting on Thursday.\nOn Wednesday, Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the UK's move amounted to \"a violation of the relevant substantive provisions\" of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe protocol is part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the EU could not trust the UK in post-Brexit talks.\nHe said progress had been made on the protocol and the timing of the UK's moves could not be worse.  \nBut UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the problems were technical and \"eminently solvable\".\nArlene Foster, Northern Ireland's first minister, told a news conference the British government had a commitment to protect the UK's internal market.\nThe DUP leader accused the Irish government of ignoring unionist concerns over the NI Protocol.\nBut her deputy first minister, Sinn F\u00e9in's Vice-President Michelle O'Neill, accused the British government of \"acting in bad faith\" over the protocol.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the grace period extensions were aimed at helping consumers and businesses in Northern Ireland, suggesting the EU needed to adapt its timeframe to fit the supply chain requirements of supermarkets and businesses.\n\"If we'd have left it any longer we'd have had a risk for businesses and livelihoods of people in just a few weeks time,\" he said during a visit to Northern Ireland on Thursday.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal aimed at ensuring there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. \nIt does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.\nThat has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\nUnionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union.\nBut anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes."

      "text": "Levels of coronavirus infections in the UK have continued to fall, Office for National Statistics data shows. \nThe figures, for the seven days up to 27 February, reveal around 1-in-230 people has the virus in the community.\nIt suggests that the number infected has fallen by about a third in the most recent week of data. \nInfections have also dropped in the over 70s age group in England, potentially as a result of the vaccine rollout, say experts.\nThe latest R number - 0.7 and 0.9 - suggests infection numbers are shrinking overall in the UK. It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 7 and 9 other people.\nPeople are still being advised to take precautions to stop the spread.  \nLow virus levels are needed to get the best out of the vaccination programme. It takes time for immunity to build after having a jab and protection may not be absolute even after two doses. People who are vaccinated may still be able to pass on the virus to others. \nHigh infection rates also give the virus more opportunities to mutate. Experts are already concerned about new and emerging variants that could evade some immunity from vaccination or prior infection.\nMore than 20 million people across the UK have now received a first dose, with a target to invite all over-50s by mid-April and people in their 40s and 30s after that.\nSchools are reopening on Monday in England in the first easing of rules. It remains to be seen what effect this will have on infection rates. \nThe ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest:\nSarah Crofts from the ONS said: \"Infections continue to head in the right direction across the UK, with levels now similar to what we saw in early October and around a quarter of levels seen at the start of the year.\"\nThere is some regional variation, with the rate decreasing faster in some areas than others. \nThe trend in the north-east England, the East Midlands and eastern England is uncertain, the ONS said.\nNorth-east England had the highest proportion of people of any region in England likely to test positive for coronavirus at around one in 150 people.\nThe West Midlands had the next highest estimate, one in 160.\nThe other estimates are:\nProf Kevin McConway, Emeritus Professor of Applied Statistics with The Open University, said: \"Overall, the position is looking good.  The virus hasn't gone away yet, and hasn't yet fallen to levels that we could live with in the longer term, in my view.  But we're getting there, and we've got effective vaccines now.\""

I thank God he had the strength and courage to FaceTime his mum; she was there with him and I believe that's what kept him alive, the fact his mum was coming to him,\" she said. \nMs Duncan said the stabbing had left the entire family feeling \"broken\" and that his mum would \"never be the same again\". \nShe described her nephew as a \"bubbly, funny person who is always caring for others\". \nShe said he had always been involved in community projects and had never been involved in gangs. \n\"The way the media portray young black boys as being that boy out there in a gang, that's not James. He's not like that at all. He doesn't have time to think about being in a gang. He's always with his family or studying.\"\nMs Duncan added: \"We need to find the people who did this... I know there's been stabbings since James's attack - why are they still doing it? Why do they want families to go through this?\"\nShe has implored anyone who knows what happened to James to share the information with the police. \nThe Met Police has said the driver of a white van who was in the area between 18:15 and 18:20 GMT on Tuesday 23 February might have vital information and officers are urging that person to come forward.

      "text": "Street artist Banksy has confirmed he was behind the artwork that appeared on the wall of Reading Prison on Monday.\nThe picture shows a prisoner - possibly resembling famous inmate Oscar Wilde - escaping on a rope made of bedsheets tied to a typewriter.\nIt comes as campaigners continue to lobby for the former jail to be turned into an arts hub rather than being sold for housing.\nThe guerilla artist confirmed the work through a video on his website.\nThe clip - entitled Create Escape - shows the piece being created under the cover of darkness, set to archive commentary from American painter Bob Ross. \nThe Ministry of Justice said it was \"aware that Banksy has confirmed he is responsible for the graffiti\".\n\"We are considering next steps and will provide an update in due course,\" it added.\nReading Borough Council said Banksy's involvement suggested he was backing the campaign to save the prison.\nIt said: \"We are thrilled that Banksy appears to have thrown his support behind the council's desire to transform the vacant Reading Gaol into a beacon of arts, heritage and culture with this piece of artwork he has aptly called Create Escape. \n\"The council is pushing the Ministry of Justice, who own the site, to make suitable arrangements to protect the image.\"\nMatt Rodda, the Labour MP for Reading East, said there was a \"growing sense of excitement\" in the town since the artwork had been confirmed as real.\nThe Save Reading Gaol campaign tweeted: \"We're thrilled to hear it is, after all, a Banksy! \n\"Thanks to the elusive artist & their team. We are incredibly grateful. Your support & gift to the town will be appreciated for many years to come!\"\nToby Davies, the artistic director for Rabble Theatre in Reading, described it as \"fantastic\".\nHe said: \"It adds real kudos to the whole campaign to have someone who knows a thing or two about culture take a risk and come and do this on a Ministry of Justice building.\n\"It is phenomenal, it really displays how much it means to people.\n\"Whenever I speak to people, not just those in the culture world but those who walk past it every single day, they get very emotional about it.\"\nHe added: \"Reading has never had the opportunity to have a go at an international culture centre that brings people together.\n\"It should be a bubbling centre of UK culture but it isn't and that's because we've never been given a chance.\n\"If there was ever a chance then this is it and it won't come again.\"\nMr Davies said having created the piece during lockdown would have been a \"significant personal risk\" for Banksy.\n\"It speaks volumes. He could have gone to wider issues around the world, there are plenty of them, but he has come to Reading to highlight this.\"\nThe jail famously housed Wilde between 1895 and 1897 and was immortalised by his poem Ballad of Reading Gaol during his stay, which reflected on the brutality of the Victorian penal system.\nHe was convicted after his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas was exposed.\nThe prison has been derelict since 2013 and was put up for sale by the government in 2019.\nHowever, a deal to sell the Grade II-listed building to developers fell through last year and Reading council said it hoped to revive its bid to turn it into an arts complex.\nHollywood actors Sir Kenneth Branagh, Natalie Dormer and Dame Judi Dench are among the stars who have lent their support to the campaign.\nBanksy expert and vice-chancellor of Arts University Bournemouth, Prof Paul Gough, said the artwork could possibly be about the future use of the building or commentary on what is happening with news media and Facebook.\u00a0\nHe said: \"It's probably one of Banksy's less well-known features is that he has in the past donated quite a lot of work to what he thinks are charitable causes.\u00a0\n\"So to give a piece of work to an organisation or at least in the interest of art has happened before - he's painted pictures on the side of youth clubs or in organisations he wants to be seen lending a hand.\u00a0\n\"So there is a charitable arm to Banksy, which doesn't get written about or get celebrated very often.\"\nHe added: \"I think it's terrific for art, public discourse, and draws attention to a brick wall - a lovely brick wall - that normally people would walk straight past, so it helps you see your public realm in different ways.\" "

      "tags": "Money,Tax,Personal finance,Housing market,Personal debt,UK taxes,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021",
      "text": "With lives and livelihoods still at risk, Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget is focused on short-term support for people's jobs and finances.\nBut there are signs of what will happen next and how this will affect the money in your pocket.\nAlthough it was announced in advance, like many other key measures, the extension of furlough is significant for millions of people.\nThe scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic -\u00a0has been extended until September.\nYoung and lower-paid people have been among the most likely to have been furloughed during the pandemic.\nWhile this is designed to protect their jobs from redundancy, many will have found that their income has been a fifth less than they had anticipated over the course of 18 months.\nThe National Living Wage will rise to \u00a38.91 from April, from \u00a38.72. That is a 2.2% rise and will be for people aged 23 and over.\nMoney promised for the vaccine rollout does not directly affect the amount of money that goes into the pockets of individuals.\nBut the extra \u00a31.65bn to help vaccinate every adult by the end of July should mean people can get back to work and the economy can start to recover. \nQuicker jabs mean more jobs protected, which means that incomes can recover or be maintained.\nFurlough supports employed people. The equivalent for the self-employed comes in the form of grants through the Coronavirus Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS).\nFrom next month, claims can be made for a fourth grant worth 80% of three months' average trading profits, up to \u00a37,500 in total.\nThis will then be followed by a fifth grant later in the year, covering May to September.\nHowever, the amount paid will depend on the amount of turnover lost. People whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will receive a grant that is equivalent to 30% of average trading profits.\nWhile many self-employed people remain ineligible - the source of considerable debate - those who can show they were trading in 2019-20 from their tax returns will now be eligible for the first time. They can receive the fourth and fifth grants.\nAnother source of speculation for months has been the future for a \u00a320-a-week top-up to universal credit.\nThis has been described as a financial lifeline during the pandemic for many of those who have lost jobs or whose finances were already stretched.\nThe chancellor said this would continue for another six months, but would then be withdrawn. \nThose on working tax credits will receive a one-off \u00a3500 payment.\nThe government pledged in its manifesto not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT.\nAlthough income tax is not rising, the tax bill that people may face in future years could go up.\nAt present, people start paying 20% income tax when they earn \u00a312,500 a year. The starting point for paying the higher 40% rate is \u00a350,000.\nThese thresholds will go up to \u00a312,570 and \u00a350,270 in April, but will then be frozen for five years.\nWith these thresholds maintained at the same level until April 2026, many people receiving a pay rise may find themselves in a new tax bracket and having to pay more. \nThe government's official forecaster said this would mean 1.3 million more people paying income tax and one million more paying the higher rate of tax.\nThat will raise a significant amount of money for the Treasury, estimated to be an extra \u00a38bn a year by 2025-26, compared to what would have been the case if thresholds rose in line with the cost of living. \nScotland has some tax-raising powers of its own.\nThe chancellor confirmed that a government guarantee means first-time buyers should get a wider choice of mortgages that require a deposit of just 5% of the loan.\nThis will be available when buying properties worth up to \u00a3600,000.\nHowever, some potential homeowners may still find it hard to get a mortgage if they do not have a regular income, while getting into negative equity if house prices fall is a threat.\nThe new products will be available from next month.\nHowever, while there is support for homeownership, there are no specific policies to help those behind on their rents.\nThis tax break for homebuyers in England and Northern Ireland - as well as similar relief in Scotland and Wales - was due to finish at the end of March. This created a rush, as well as difficulties for some buyers to complete in time.\nThe chancellor has now said that the current stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland - which means no stamp duty is paid on the first \u00a3500,000 of a property purchase - will be extended until 30 June.\nThis relief will be reduced to the first \u00a3250,000 of a purchase until the end of September, before returning to its pre-pandemic level of \u00a3125,000 from the start of October.\nIn total, 46% of sales would be exempt from stamp duty as a result of this policy, according to property portal Zoopla.\nMinisters in Wales have extended its stamp duty break until the end of June.\nAll duties on alcohol will stay as they are, for a second year in a row. These had been earmarked to rise.\nThere has been a freeze on fuel duty for a decade and this will continue for at least another year.\nAbout 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT.\nThere will be a new savings product designed to raise money for environmental projects.\nThis \"green bond\" will be issued by the government-backed National Savings and Investments (NS&I), which has been criticised by savers and MPs for its customer service performance during the pandemic.\nIt will be issued in the summer, but there are no details yet on the interest rate that will be paid to savers.\nWhat is your reaction to this year's Budget?

      "tags": "Policing,Teaching,Doctors,Nursing,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Every Thursday evening the UK is clapping for NHS staff, carers and other key workers. But many are on low pay. \nThe weekly applause ran for 10 weeks during the UK's first coronavirus lockdown last spring and is set to return from 7 January.\nKey workers are the individuals recognised by the government as being critical to the running of the country, ranging from NHS and care workers to delivery drivers and shop workers. \nAcross the UK, the median salary for all full-time employees last year was \u00a331,461. \nWe use the median income - the salary right in the middle of all employees - because, unlike the (mean) average, it doesn't get pushed up by the small number of extremely well-paid individuals at the top. It can therefore be seen as a better indicator of the \"typical\" income. \nThe Office for National Statistics' (ONS) annual earnings survey provides a detailed picture of key workers' pay, as well as higher and lower pay brackets.\nThe following chart represents where most workers - 60% - sit in the salary range. But 20% of people in each profession earn less than the bottom of this range. And 20% earn more than the top of the range.\nAnd in many cases, those starting out earn significantly less than the bottom of the range -  police officers can expect a salary of around \u00a325,400 a year to start with, the lowest NHS pay band for a nurse is under \u00a320,000 and junior doctors receive under \u00a330,000 for their first foundation year. \nThere are dozens of professions and roles that count as key workers. This selection has been chosen to cover a number of sectors but is not exhaustive. \nThe average full-time cashier, shop assistant, care worker, food processor, bus driver and postal worker all earn below the median income. \nNurses and primary teachers are paid just above the median income, while doctors and pharmacists earn substantially above it. \nHowever, working out average salaries is an inexact science with various factors affecting pay - like overtime, part-time work or extra money for working in an expensive area. \nLow income employees, for example, are more likely to work part-time or hour-by-hour (such as through zero-hour contracts). This means a large number will not earn anything close to their occupation's full-time median income.\nThe ONS estimates that the hourly pay for a care worker, cashier or shelf stacker is under \u00a39 - which is more or less in line with the minimum wage (\u00a38.72 for those aged 25 and over). But that falls short of what the Living Wage Foundation charity calculates is necessary to meet basic needs. It recommends \u00a39.50 - or \u00a310.85 in London. \nAnalysis by the BBC's Shared Data Unit last year found that hundreds of thousands of key workers earn below that. \nThe government plays a large role in the pay of individuals working in the public sector - that's anyone whose job is directly funded by taxes. \nPolice officers, nurses, civil servants and teachers all have representatives who work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with annual recommendations for how much pay should change. \nThe government sets \"remits\" on these boards. \nBetween 2011 and 2018, most public sector pay was either frozen or capped at 1%, as part of the government's austerity measures aimed at reducing the deficit.\nThis meant that as prices increased with inflation, salaries did not keep up. \nThe government has less control over private sector pay. \nThis includes people who work in transport, supermarkets, postal and courier services.\nIt also includes most care home staff and any services (such as cleaning or catering) the NHS might outsource.\nThe government does not directly set their wages, but they can lower taxes, provide benefits and increase the minimum wage. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak announced in November's Spending Review that 1.3 million public sector workers would be getting their pay frozen again.\nBut 2.1 million workers earning less than \u00a324,000 a year were promised a pay rise of at least \u00a3250.\nAnd more than a million NHS workers will get an increase.\nThe minimum wage will go up by 19p to \u00a38.91 an hour in April 2021. The Conservatives have pledged to increase this to \u00a310.50 by 2024.\nSome private companies, including supermarkets and delivery services, have already increased pay for staff during the coronavirus crisis.

      "text": "Head teachers are warning of problems getting parental consent for Covid tests, ahead of pupils returning to school in England next week.\nA survey found more than half of secondary head teachers had faced difficulties getting parental approval.\nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL union which carried out the survey, said parents might have heard \"misinformation\" about testing.\nThe Covid tests for pupils are voluntary and need parents' permission.\nThe survey of more than 930 head teachers also found 76% of secondary schools have planned a phased return next week, such as different year groups starting on different days, allowing time for pupils to have Covid tests.\nIn 7% of schools, this staggered return will stretch into a second week.\n\"There will be a full return but it will be from - not on - Monday, 8 March,\" said Mr Barton.\nThe head teachers' union says the biggest problem, reported by 52% of heads, has been obtaining parental consent to carry out Covid tests on pupils.\n\"This is most likely to be simply a matter of oversight with some parents not returning forms,\" said Mr Barton.\n\"There may also be parents who are nervous about testing because they have seen or heard misinformation,\" he said.\nLabour MP Siobhain McDonagh has raised concerns about this in the House of Commons, calling for parental consent for testing to be \"opt out rather than opt in\".\nShe told MPs last week that in some schools up to half of pupils did not have parental consent for testing - and warned that could put other pupils at risk.\nSchool Standards Minister Nick Gibb responded:  \"We expect parents to give permission to the school to allow secondary school pupils to be tested twice a week. \n\"This is an important initiative that helps to minimise the risk of transmission in the secondary school estate. \n\"After the first three tests, home-testing kits will be sent to homes with pupils, and we hope that the twice-weekly testing of pupils will continue for the foreseeable future.\"\nThe Department for Education says it does not have data on levels of parental consent for testing.\nSecondary schools will have to carry out three swab tests on pupils as they start returning from Monday - and Mr Barton said schools had to set up testing centres that looked like \"field hospitals\".\nSchools also reported difficulties in finding staff to run the Covid testing.\nPupils in secondary schools will be expected to wear face masks in classrooms, where social distancing is not possible, but few heads anticipated any \"significant numbers\" refusing to comply.\nBut there were concerns about a lack of clarity in guidance, which recommends wearing face masks, but does not make them mandatory.\nMr Barton said the government had left schools with a logistical \"nightmare\" to sort out testing arrangements, when it had \"nothing to do with the core business of education\".\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"Secondary schools and colleges can stagger the return of their students over the first week to help them offer rapid testing in a safe and orderly way, but all students should be back no later than Monday 15 March.\"\n\n"

They are now recovering.\nConservationists are concerned about the threat of Covid-19 to great apes.\nThey are particularly worried about the danger to gorillas, which have populations that are listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.\n\"This isn't the norm,\" Nadine Lamberski, chief conservation officer at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, told National Geographic.\n\"In my career, I haven't had access to an experimental vaccine this early in the process and haven't had such an overwhelming desire to want to use one,\"\nKaren, the first orangutan in the world to have open-heart surgery in 1994, was among those to get a jab.\nMs Lamberski said the apes had not suffered any adverse reactions and would soon be tested for antibodies to determine if the shots were a success.\nCases of the virus have also been found in animals at other zoos, including lions and tigers in the Bronx Zoo in New York, and lions at Barcelona Zoo in Spain.\nCovid-19 infections have been confirmed in various animals worldwide, from dogs and cats to ferrets and mink. However, cases are generally quite rare.\nZoetis started developing a Covid-19 vaccine for cats and dogs in February last year after a dog tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong.\nThe vaccine was deemed safe and effective in cats and dogs by October last year.\nUntil February this year, the jab had not been tested on any other animals. \nBut Ms Lamberski told National Geographic that vaccinating the zoo's great apes was worth the risk.\n\"We commonly use vaccines designed with dogs and cats for lions and tigers,\" Ms Lamberski said."

      "text": "About 100 high-profile figures have signed a letter to the Treccani Italian dictionary calling on it to change its definition of the word \"woman\".\nThe campaign argues that derogatory terms such as \"puttana\" (whore) should be removed from the list of synonyms.\nSuch words reinforce \"misogynist stereotypes that objectify women and present them as inferior\", it adds.\nTreccani, a leading online Italian dictionary, has not yet responded, but previously defended its approach.\nAmong the letter's signatories are LGBTQ+ activist and politician Imma Battaglia, politician Laura Boldrini, and Alessandra Perrazzelli, deputy director general of the Bank of Italy.\nIt was written by activist Maria Beatrice Giovanardi, who was also behind an earlier campaign to get the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) to remove words such as \"bint\" and \"bird\" as other ways of saying \"woman\". After a similar petition attracted tens of thousands of signatures, Oxford University Press updated its definition.\nThe synonyms given in Treccani's definition are even worse than the OED's because there are 30 terms used to describe sex workers, Ms Giovanardi told Reuters. \nMeanwhile, she added, the word \"man\" was associated with positive terms such as \"businessman\".\n\"Language shapes reality and influences the way women are perceived and treated,\" she wrote in her letter.\n\"Vocabularies, dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms, encyclopaedias are educational tools of reference and Treccani.it, as such, is consulted in schools, libraries and in all of our homes.\"\n\"This will not put an end to everyday sexism, but it could contribute to a correct description and vision of women and their role in today's society.\"\nIn a blog post published in November, Treccani said that the dictionary did not \"select lexicon based on moral judgment or prejudices\".\n\"If society and culture express negativity through words, a dictionary cannot refuse to document them,\" it added."

Dyfed Powys Police are being assisted by the Royal Military Police in the investigation.\nThe Defence Accident Investigation Branch is also involved in inquiries into the soldier's death.\n\"It is with great sadness we can confirm the death of a soldier on 4th March. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this tragic time,\" an Army spokesman said.\n\"The circumstances surrounding this death are being investigated and it would be inappropriate to comment any further.\"\nIt the latest in a number of accidents at Castlemartin.\nIn 2017, two soldiers died in a tank explosion, which a coroner ruled was due to a design flaw.\nAn Army captain was jailed in July 2018 after a 21-year-old soldier was killed by a stray bullet during an exercise at the range in 2012.\nAccording to the MoD, the Welsh Guards have a \"dual role\" as \"light role infantry\" and \"world class ceremonial soldiers, guarding the Royal Family and Royal palaces such as Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London and conducting state ceremonial duties\"."

      "tags": "Tourism,Cyprus,Travel",
      "text": "Cyprus and Portugal say they hope to welcome vaccinated British tourists from May - the month when travel restrictions may be lifted in the UK.\nThe Cypriot government said those who had two Covid jabs could travel, while Portugal said those who tested negative or were \"immune\" could also visit.\nIt is not known how vaccine status would be proved. \nThe earliest date those in England could go abroad for holidays is 17 May, following a review on travel rules.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has said it is still \"too early\" to book a foreign trip.\nUnder current rules, foreign travel from the UK is banned apart from for exceptional reasons.\nFrom Monday, passengers travelling internationally from England will have to carry a form stating their trip is permitted, the Department for Transport has announced. It will be an offence to fail to produce a completed form. Those who do not have one could be fined \u00a3200. \nBut once travel is allowed again, the success of the UK's vaccination programme makes Britons especially attractive to countries wanting to attract holidaymakers, especially those European countries which are traditionally popular with British tourists.\nPortugal is currently on the UK's red list, meaning travellers coming from there have to quarantine in the UK when they arrive. \nRita Marques, Portugal's secretary of state for tourism, told the BBC: \"I do believe that Portugal will soon allow restriction-free travel, not only for vaccinated people, but those who are immune or who test negative. We hope to welcome British tourists from 17 May.\"\nShe added that the situation in Portugal was \"stable\" and said, \"Everything will be ready by mid May.\"\nThe UK government says the red list remains under review, with public health the UK's top priority.\nInternational travel from England will not start until 17 May at the earliest, with a global travel taskforce reporting in April. The UK government has not yet approved any kind of vaccination certificate but Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is looking into possible measures.\nThe decision to lift restrictions on travel abroad still depends on vaccine rollout in the UK and abroad, the effectiveness of the vaccine, the prevalence of the virus and its variants. \nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have not set a date for the start of international travel.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she hopes a certification scheme could allow vaccinated holidaymakers to journey abroad - but warned Scotland was still \"some way away\" from such a programme. She said she could not advise people to \"fly off to the sun\" before there was a degree of certainty it could be done without risk. \nGoing on holiday is currently still illegal, but the prime minister's roadmap last week has left many optimistic that that will change soon.\nAlthough international travel is not guaranteed to start on 17 May, countries and companies are already gearing up to have British tourists back and making a bid for them to book.\nWhen travel does restart, it's likely to be in tiers, with some countries more open than others. \nBe warned, just because a country may say it is happy to have us, doesn't mean that they will be on that list; those discussions are still ongoing and will ultimately rest on how the vaccine, virus and variants look in the next few months.\nCyprus's deputy tourism minister, Savvas Perdios, said the country would allow Britons who had been given vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to enter without the need for a negative test or to quarantine.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna jabs have been approved for use by the EMA.\nTourists would be required to have had their second dose at least seven days before travelling, the minister added.\nBritish tourists make up the largest group of visitors to the island and made more than a million trips to Cyprus in 2019, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nOther countries are optimistic they could be seeing British tourists back soon. \n\"We believe that summer has to be the beginning of the end of this bad experience,\" says Fernando Valdes, Spain's secretary of state for tourism. \"I can't give a specific date, that will depend on how the pandemic evolves.\"\nHe said it depended how the vaccination programme was going in both countries - but noted \"the UK is increasingly moving towards their goals\".  \nGreece has also said it hopes to open this summer, saying its government is taking all the necessary actions for this to happen.\nSimon Calder, travel editor at the Independent, said, with the UK's vaccine programme ahead of the rest of Europe, the British holidaymaker was going to become \"quite appealing to countries who are working out how to rebuild their tourist industries while at the same time minimising risk\".\nAlthough family members might have different vaccination statuses, potentially meaning only some were able to travel unrestricted, he told BBC Breakfast he thought there would be \"a way found\".\nMr Calder said it was possible Cyprus would reflect its travel rules from last summer when visitors were able to get a test three days before their flight and noted that under-12s are excluded from the current travel restrictions.\nHolidays in the UK could begin more than a month earlier, with people in England potentially permitted to stay in self-contained accommodation such as holiday lets from 12 April under Mr Johnson's road map for easing lockdown restrictions.\nThis has led to many people opting to plan a holiday at home, resulting in them becoming more expensive, according to researchers at Which."

      "tags": "Alok Sharma,COP26,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "The government has been hit by a double whammy of reports from MPs criticising its performance on climate change.\nThe influential Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says ministers have \"no plan\" to meet climate change targets, two years after setting them in law.\nAnd the business committee says the vital UN climate conference scheduled for Glasgow in November will fail unless its goals are made clear. \nThe government says both reports are inaccurate and unfair.\nThe PAC's report says ministers still don't have a coordinated strategy to realise the goal of removing almost all the carbon emissions from Britain by 2050. \nThe report notes that the government intends to publish what the MPs call a \"plethora\" of strategies setting out how it will reduce emissions in sectors ranging from transport to heating buildings. \nBut, it says, the policies aren't agreed yet.\nThe MPs say the Treasury has changed its guidance to ensure departments place greater emphasis on the environmental impacts of their policies, but hasn't explained how this will work in practice.\nWhat's more, the MPs say, the government is not yet ensuring that its activities to reduce emissions in Britain are not simply transferring those emissions overseas - where so many of the carbon-intensive goods bought in Britain's shops are made.\nThey also blame the government for failing to engage with the public. \nMeg Hillier, the committee's Labour chairwoman, said: \"The government has set itself a huge test in committing the UK to a net zero economy by 2050 - but there is little sign that it understands how to get there.\n\" We must see a clear path plotted, with interim goals set and reached - it will not do to dump our emissions on poorer countries to hit UK targets. \n\"Our new international trade deals, the levelling up agenda - all must fit in the plan to reach net zero.\n\"COP26 (the vital climate conference in Glasgow in November) is a few months away. The eyes of the world, its scientists and policymakers are on the UK - big promises full of fine words won't stand up.\"\nMeanwhile, the business committee says the government has provided no details so far about how success at the conference will be measured.\nTheir report urges the prime minister to set out a clear list of ambitions for the summit, with a set of accompanying measures of success.\nIt points out that the UK is currently guiding the summit to focus on key areas for change chosen by Britain.\nThese are:\nBut the committee says: \"We have concluded the current 'themes'-based approach is too broad, without clear measures for success.\n\"More focus needs to be given to the overriding necessity to agree deliverable policies that keep global temperature rises to as close to 1.5C as possible.\"\nA COP26 spokesperson said the government was making \"good progress\" but added \"there is no time to waste\". \n\"The COP26 President, Alok Sharma, our teams, and the full weight of our diplomatic network are all working tirelessly to push for accelerated action from our partners around the world\" the spokesperson added. \nNick Mabey, from the think tank e3g, argues that multiple potential goals must be achieved - and he believes those goals should be debated publicly. \nThe aims would include: \n\"This debate is up for grabs\" he told BBC News. \n\"It should be a public debate because we're talking out how to change whole economies. A lot of the outcomes from Glasgow will be decided in the court of public opinion.\"\nRichard Black from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said: \"The lack of clarity on the vision for COP26 is seriously concerning. It is surely obvious that COP26 has to set the global economy on track to net zero emissions by mid-century. \n\"This means brokering agreements that kick-start decarbonisation in various sectors and it also means Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak stepping up to the plate on finance to help the poorest nations. \n\"Failure to sort this will fatally compromise COP26 - and the failure will lie squarely at the door of Downing St.\"\nWhatever global goals are eventually agreed, green groups warn the UK's negotiating position will be weakened unless it consistently cuts carbon domestically - it's currently slipping away from its long-term targets. \nMr Black added: \"Coming on the back of a Budget that didn't even try to get the Conservatives on track to their net zero target, the conclusion that they don't have a plan for reaching it, just months before the UK hosts a major UN climate summit for the first time, should stimulate some serious thinking right across Whitehall.\"\nA government spokeswoman said: \"It is nonsense to say the government does not have a plan when we have been leading the world in tackling climate change, cutting emissions by almost 44 per cent since 1990 and doing so faster than any other developed nation in recent years.\n\"Only this week in the Budget we built on the prime minister's Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution by encouraging private investment in green growth, and we are bringing forward bold proposals to cut emissions and create new jobs and industries across the whole country.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

We're looking at all our options at the moment because the pandemic makes that hard.\"\nThe most recent series of Love Island took place in the winter, concluding in February 2020, when Paige Turley and Finley Tapp were crowned the winners. (They're still together, a year later.)\nThat series took place just before the coronavirus pandemic, and marked the first winter run for a show which had previously only aired during summer months.\nSince the series has been off air, ITV2 has been broadcasting international editions of the series in its place to fill the air time, such as Love Island Australia.\nLaura Whitmore will likely return to hosting duties, after she previously stood in for former presenter Caroline Flack, who died last February.\nIt's unclear how the show would operate if social distancing measures remain in place by this summer.\nHowever, it's likely that Covid-19 restrictions will be significantly reduced by then, in light of the government's four-step plan to ease most lockdown rules by June, and the continued success of the coronavirus vaccine rollout.\nEven if some measures are still in place, other series like Strictly have used daily testing and contestant bubbles as a way to stay on air. \nBut the pandemic has caused significant disruption to TV productions. Both Strictly and Dancing On Ice saw contestants leave after testing positive for Covid-19, while I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here relocated from Australia to Wales.\nLove Island was one of several commissions ITV confirmed on Thursday, as it announced details of its summer programming.\nITV also announced:\nThe channel will also air a previously-announced new drama about the killing of Stephen Lawrence, which will star Steve Coogan as DCI Clive Driscoll.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Pope Francis,Roman Catholic Church,Middle East Christians,Iraq,Christianity,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Pope Francis has called for an end to violence and extremism, on the first ever papal visit to Iraq.\nThe pontiff is making his first international trip since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. \nCovid and security fears have made this his riskiest visit yet, but the 84-year-old insisted he was \"duty bound\".\nHe also said Iraq's dwindling Christian community should have a more prominent role as citizens with full rights, freedoms and responsibilities.\nHe is hoping to foster inter-religious dialogue - meeting Iraq's most revered Shia Muslim cleric - and will celebrate Mass at a stadium in Irbil in the north.\nAbout 10,000 Iraqi Security Forces personnel are being deployed to protect the Pope, while round-the-clock curfews are also being imposed to limit the spread of Covid.\nIraq's PM Mustafa al-Kadhimi greeted him at the airport, with a red carpet, Iraqis in national dress and songs from a largely unmasked choir.\nHundreds of people lined the airport road as the Pope's convoy, heavily chaperoned by police motorcycles, left for the city.\nBut the Pope was seen to have a pronounced limp, suggesting that his sciatica condition continues to bother him.\nIn a speech after being welcomed by Iraqi President Barham Salih, Pope Francis said he was very pleased to come to Iraq, which he described as the \"cradle of civilisation\".\n\"May the clash of arms be silenced... may there be an end to acts of violence and extremism, factions and intolerance!\" he said. \n\"Iraq has suffered the disastrous effects of wars, the scourge of terrorism and sectarian conflicts often grounded in a fundamentalism incapable of accepting the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic and religious groups.\" \nHe turned to the country's Christians, who he said should have a greater role in public life.\n\"The age-old presence of Christians in this land, and their contributions to the life of the nation, constitute a rich heritage that they wish to continue to place at the service of all,\" he said.\nHe said Iraq's diversity was a \"precious resource on which to draw, not an obstacle to eliminate\".\nPope Francis later went to hold Mass in Baghdad's Syriac Catholic church of Our Lady of Salvation, targeted in an attack in 2010 by jihadists which left 52 Christians and police dead.\nThis is a pilgrimage by a Pope who has made reaching out to the persecuted and to other faiths a cornerstone of his papacy. \nPope Francis's trip is rich in symbolism but fraught with danger - not just the security concerns of a country torn by inter-religious and sectarian conflict but also in the midst of its highest infection levels since the start of the pandemic.\nThere is the risk that the importance of this trip is overshadowed by Covid - particularly that a mass in Irbil on Sunday, at which up to 10,000 people are expected, could become a super-spreader.\nBut Pope Francis is defiant, telling me on the plane from Rome that he is \"very happy\" to be on a \"special trip\". He clearly feels that this land, so central to Christianity, has waited too long for a papal visit, that its dwindling and long-terrorised Christian community needs to feel emboldened so as to remain here - and that there is no time to lose to bring a message of peace and hope to Iraq.\nOne of the world's oldest Christian communities has seen its numbers plummet over the last two decades from 1.4 million to about 250,000, less than 1% of the population.\nMany have fled abroad to escape the violence that has plagued the country since the US-led invasion in 2003 that ousted Saddam.\nTens of thousands were also displaced when Islamic State (IS) militants overran northern Iraq in 2014, destroying their historic churches, seizing their property, and giving them the choice to pay a tax, convert, leave or face death.\nSecurity arrangements are massive, with the Pope mostly flying to make his visits, and possibly using an armoured car for shorter trips. In central Baghdad, billboards welcome the Pope, and Iraqi and Vatican flags fly together.\nThe Christians of Iraq are hoping the Pope will help them overcome discrimination.\nIn Baghdad, there was joy that he was visiting.\n\"I feel an indescribable happiness. We're all brothers and sisters, we're all one hand. We're all going to greet someone great, the greatest figure, the Pope,\" Naem Faouzi told Reuters news agency.\nFather Martin Ra'ad, a Christian priest said: \"Today, Pope Francis is realising the dream that Iraqis have had for the past 20 years, waiting for him to arrive on Iraqi soil.\"\nChristians in the north were also looking forward to his visit. Alla Hana Shaba, who fled to Irbil in Iraq's Kurdistan region after the IS invaded in 2014, told Iraqi TV: \"We want the Pope to help the displaced find a place to settle. We have lost our houses and money.\"\nDue to security concerns and a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections, the Pope will have limited exposure to the public, our correspondent says.\nThe Pope himself has had two shots of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, and his entourage will have been inoculated, but there are fears the trip could become a super-spreader event given the large crowds expected.\nOn Saturday, the Pope will fly south to the Shia holy city of Najaf, where he will visit 90-year-old Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the spiritual reference for millions of Shia in Iraq and elsewhere.\nThe following day in Mosul he will say a prayer of suffrage in Church Square for the victims of the war with IS, which left tens of thousands of civilians dead.\nThe Pope will also visit nearby Qaraqosh, where Christians have returned since the defeat of IS in 2017."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer is calling on the government to give the NHS's \"Covid heroes\" a bigger pay rise than the 1% increase for NHS staff in England recommended by the Department of Health. Unions are calling the suggested rise a \"kick in the teeth\" for staff who have given \"absolutely everything\" during the pandemic. But ministers say the economy is under \"huge pressure\".\nAnyone who has \"ever had an emergency asthma admission\" to hospital is currently eligible for a Covid vaccine, according to NHS England, but some are being refused jabs unless they have been admitted in the last 12 months. Among them is Sonja Chenier, 47, who was told her three hospital admissions in 15 years weren't \"relevant\" and that she should expect a call in June. GPs say factors including age, ethnicity and \"some degree of clinical judgement\" are taken into account when prioritising patients.\nDozens of Covid contracts had not been published when Boris Johnson told MPs they were \"on the record for everyone to see\", campaigners say. The Good Law Project says the PM's assurance last month was \"not true\" because government lawyers had said 100 contracts were yet to be revealed. The government says remaining contracts will be published as soon as possible.\nLike many people with dementia, Michael Benyo hasn't been able to properly see his family for a year because of Covid-19 restrictions in his care home. Ahead of a relaxation in the rules, his daughters tell us how lockdown has affected him, and why they are apprehensive about their next visit.\nAre there signs of light for those desperate to get away from it all? Cyprus says from 1 May it will open its borders to Britons who have had both vaccine doses. However, there's a catch: that date is more than a fortnight before government travel restrictions allow those in England to head overseas, while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have yet to put a date on the resumption of foreign holidays.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nTrying to plan a holiday?

It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 7 and 9 other people.\nPeople are still being advised to take precautions to stop the spread.  \nLow virus levels are needed to get the best out of the vaccination programme. It takes time for immunity to build after having a jab and protection may not be absolute even after two doses. People who are vaccinated may still be able to pass on the virus to others. \nHigh infection rates also give the virus more opportunities to mutate. Experts are already concerned about new and emerging variants that could evade some immunity from vaccination or prior infection.\nMore than 20 million people across the UK have now received a first dose, with a target to invite all over-50s by mid-April and people in their 40s and 30s after that.\nSchools are reopening on Monday in England in the first easing of rules. It remains to be seen what effect this will have on infection rates. \nThe ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest:\nSarah Crofts from the ONS said: \"Infections continue to head in the right direction across the UK, with levels now similar to what we saw in early October and around a quarter of levels seen at the start of the year.\"\nThere is some regional variation, with the rate decreasing faster in some areas than others. \nThe trend in the north-east England, the East Midlands and eastern England is uncertain, the ONS said.\nNorth-east England had the highest proportion of people of any region in England likely to test positive for coronavirus at around one in 150 people.\nThe West Midlands had the next highest estimate, one in 160.\nThe other estimates are:\nProf Kevin McConway, Emeritus Professor of Applied Statistics with The Open University, said: \"Overall, the position is looking good.  The virus hasn't gone away yet, and hasn't yet fallen to levels that we could live with in the longer term, in my view.  But we're getting there, and we've got effective vaccines now.\""

Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

      "title": "China NPC: Beijing to overhaul Hong Kong electoral system",
      "tags": "Xi Jinping,China,Hong Kong national security law,Hong Kong",
      "text": "China's top law-making body has unveiled plans to ensure only \"patriots\" can govern Hong Kong, as Beijing tightens its grip on the city with changes to the electoral system.\nPremier Li Keqiang, addressing the National People's Congress (NPC), warned the world not to interfere.\nThe move follows the imposition of a tough security law.\nCritics say Beijing is crushing dissent and removing the \"one country, two systems\" agreement it made with the UK.\nUnder the agreement, Hong Kong, a former British colony, was allowed to continue with its own legal system and have rights including free speech and freedom of the press.\nLord Chris Patten, former governor of Hong Kong, said China's Communist Party had \"taken the biggest step so far to obliterate Hong Kong's freedoms and aspirations for greater democracy under the rule of law\". \nThe EU has warned that it may take \"additional steps\" over the plans announced on Friday. \nIt called on Beijing to \"carefully consider the political and economic implications on any decision to reform the electoral system of Hong Kong that would undermine fundamental freedoms, political pluralism and democratic principles\".\nFears that Hong Kong's \"one country, two systems model\" was being eroded led to huge pro-democracy protests in 2019. Some turned violent and Beijing imposed the National Security Law, which it said would target \"sedition\" and bring stability.\nThousands of lawmakers have gathered for the annual NPC meeting in Beijing. The rubber-stamp parliament is expected to also discuss and approve economic growth targets and environmental policies from the central government.\nNPC vice-chairman Wang Chen announced to the NPC that changes were needed as \"the rioting and turbulence that occurred in Hong Kong society reveals that the existing electoral system has clear loopholes and deficiencies\". He said \"risks in the system\" needed to be removed to ensure \"patriots\" were in charge.\nPremier Li warned that China would \"resolutely guard against and deter\" interference by external forces in Hong Kong's affairs.\nThe week-long NPC will discuss the elections issue and no text has yet been made public, although Mr Wang and media sources did set out some areas to be discussed.\nThe city's heavily pro-Beijing electoral committee would get new powers over the parliament, or Legislative Council (LegCo).\nThe committee would effectively be able to vet all LegCo candidates and elect many of its members, diluting the number directly elected by the public.\nIan Chong, politics professor at the National University of Singapore, told the BBC: \"In 2019, the pan-democrats did extremely well [in local elections], which was alarming to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], because it showed that all their negative rhetoric didn't seem to be working.\n\"I think for the CCP, they really want to remove the voices that they don't like to hear.\"\nWillie Lam, China analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told the AFP news agency that if the new NPC measures passed as he expected they would \"effectively wipe out any remaining opposition\".\nIt's kind of incredible that the Chinese government felt the need to change what was already an electoral system heavily rigged in favour of the pro-Beijing camp.\nWith only half the members of the territory's mini parliament directly elected, and the other half installed by political allies, why the change?\nWhat must have spooked the Communist Party was the drubbing handed to them at the hands of pro-democracy candidates at the most recent district council elections - with those advocating democratic reform taking control of all but one municipality.\nNow, after the coming electoral \"rebuild\" is ushered in - and it will be, given that it has been introduced to the rubber-stamp National People's Congress process - there won't be even the pretence of democratic elections in Hong Kong.\nAn election committee - controlled by Beijing - will not only screen all candidates standing in elections, but also directly appoint \"a large proportion\" of the Legislative Council.\nIt will be almost impossible for any candidate advocating democratic change to be elected to office - and that's the way China's senior leadership likes it.\nThe Basic Law, agreed with the UK before the return of sovereignty in 1997, allowed for an \"ultimate aim\" of universal suffrage, including the choice of leader, or chief executive.\nSubsequent NPC Standing Committee rulings, however, ensured Beijing would have control over who was appointed.\nPro-democracy moves continued and came to a head with mass rallies in 2019. Last year, Beijing imposed the security law.\nScores of arrests have been made. Last week, 47 pro-democracy activists were charged with \"subversion\" under the new law and could face life in prison.\nThey were involved in preparations for last year's LegCo elections, which the government then postponed.\nBenedict Rogers, chief executive of Hong Kong Watch, an NGO that monitors developments in the city, said: \"Under these reforms, the majority of Hong Kongers face permanent political disenfranchisement, with any candidate who offers criticism of Beijing or support for Hong Kong's autonomy and democracy effectively barred from participation. \n\"Of course, most of the democratic slate [protesters] are now in jail anyway,\" he said in a statement.\nThe annual meeting has nearly 3,000 delegates representing provinces, autonomous regions, and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\nWhile the NPC in theory is the country's most powerful institution, in reality the lawmakers usually end up approving plans and policies decided beforehand by the central government.\nOn Friday, Mr Li said the country had set its economic growth target at above 6%.  and updated the NPC on climate control targets.\nOver the next few days, the congress will also formally approve the 14th Five-Year-Plan - the economic strategy for the country.\nPresident Xi Jinping is also likely to highlight China's achievement in \"eradicating absolute poverty\" - something the country announced last week.\nProf Chong told the BBC that the \"success of China in dealing with Covid\" was also set to feature large.\nThe pandemic is largely under control, and for the majority of people, life has gone back to normal.\nReporting by Yvette Tan"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nA mystery person infected with the Covid variant of concern first found in Brazil has now been traced. Six cases of the apparently more contagious P.1 variant had been located in the UK - but the identity of one patient remained unknown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street briefing the person concerned has been staying at home - and there was no sign of further transmission. But extra testing is being put in place in Croydon, where they live. Read more about the Brazil variant here. - and watch Mr Hancock's comments below.\nThe number of people infected with coronavirus in the UK has continued to decrease. The weekly survey carried out by the Office for National Statistics indicates about one in 230 people had the virus in the seven days ending on 27 February, compared with one in 155 the previous week. The health secretary called the figures \"encouraging news\" ahead of the opening up of schools to all pupils in England on Monday. Matt Hancock added an extra \u00a379m would be spent on mental health support for pupils - saying the return to school was a \"long-awaited day for many... but for some it's also a moment of unease and anxiety\".\nAt the same briefing, the health secretary defended a proposed 1% pay increase for NHS staff in England this year, amid a backlash from unions. Mr Hancock said the proposal was \"what we think is affordable\" given financial pressures caused by the pandemic. But the union the Royal College of Nursing has set up a fund to prepare for possible strike action over the proposals, which it calls derisory. Our health editor says the unions see the proposal as scant reward for the huge efforts of staff during the pandemic. \nAnyone travelling overseas from England from Monday will have to prove they are allowed to travel, or risk being turned away from the airport and fined. A \"Declaration to Travel\" document - available on  a government website - sets out that the trip is permitted under current restrictions, such as for education or work. Individuals could face a \u00a3200 penalty if they fail to produce a completed form.\nDuring the pandemic, the government has awarded thousands of contracts to private companies, spending billions of pounds of public money in the process. But the way these contracts have been awarded - and the huge sums of money involved - have led to accusations of a lack of transparency. So what are the rules on government contracts, and has anything changed during the pandemic? Our explainer has all the details.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: Rules around outdoor mixing set to ease next week",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Rules around outdoor socialising are likely to ease next week, the first minister has said.\nNicola Sturgeon said more opportunities to see loved ones would be the \"first steps\" taken out of lockdown.\nOnly two people from two households are currently allowed to meet outdoors, with people being urged to stay at home apart from for essential reasons.\nMs Sturgeon said she hoped to announce \"relatively minor but important\" changes on Tuesday.\nShe said these would relate to restrictions on meeting outdoors and how young people are able to interact with friends.\nThe government's recent plan for easing lockdown said that allowing four people from two households to meet outdoors was unlikely to happen before 15 March. \nMs Sturgeon said the progress with the vaccine programme and the decline in hospital admissions and case number should give encouragement that \"greater normality is firmly on the horizon\".\nBut she added: \"It's really important we don't get carried away yet.\n\"The overall stay at home message needs to stay for a bit longer so that we don't send our progress into reverse.\n\"But I'm very keen if we can we should all get a bit more opportunities to see loved ones as the first steps we take out of this lockdown.\"\nThe Scottish government has been considering accelerating its exit plan out of lockdown, which currently says that the country will return to a levels system towards the end of April.\nHowever, new rules are set to make it harder for areas to drop down to lower tiers of these restrictions.\nIf an area is to see restrictions lifted, the number of positive cases will need to be far lower than when the system operated last year.\nIt is also expected that non-essential retail, hospitality and services such as gyms and hairdressers will reopen as part of the levels system.\nBut business leaders have said a return to this framework would be \"devastating\" and have called for more clarity on how the system would work.\nThe first minister and Chief Medical Officer haven't quite started playing Ian Dury's Reasons To Be Cheerful Part 3 during the daily briefing, but the change of tone in recent days has been dramatic.\nFrankly, the figures are improving far faster than anyone dared hope.\nThe rolling death toll is falling and is at its lowest since early October. The number of patients in hospital with Covid - while still high - is falling rapidly, as are new Covid admissions.\nThere is growing confidence this is down to the vaccination programme as well as lockdown.\nVirtually everyone over 65 has now had their first jab as have nearly 40% of those between 60 and 64 and a third of those aged 55 to 59. \nPositive tests are falling and the proportion of positive tests is consistently below the crucial 5pc benchmark.\nBecause those most at risk are being vaccinated first, jabs should mean far fewer hospital admissions or deaths. The portion of positive tests where the patient is asymptomatic or only mildly unwell may rise. Vaccinations also appear to cut transmission rates. \nWhile some scientists argue for a strategy based around the complete elimination of Covid, the argument made to the public has always been about saving lives and protecting the NHS. \nThere is a question over whether the public would support harsh measures if the risk of death and hospitalisation had been greatly reduced.\nThe challenge for those responsible for regulations is to strike the right balance between persuading people that difficult measures are still needed, ensuring people follow the rules and offering the tantalising prospect that the dark clouds may now be lifting and the sun will soon shine again.\nAs part of the lockdown easing plans, it was announced on Tuesday that all secondary school pupils in Scotland will return to classrooms part-time from 15 March - a month earlier than originally planned. \nThe latest statistics showed that further 498 people have tested positive for Covid-19 - the lowest daily figure since 27 September - representing 3.1% of the tests carried out.\nThe FM said 11 new deaths had been reported of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within 28 days, bringing the total under that measure to 7,409.\nA further 29,064 people received the first dose of the vaccine while 8,139 received the second dose.\nAnd the number of people in hospital with the virus has fallen by 52 to 666, with 64 patients in intensive care - three fewer than yesterday's figures.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar welcomed the improving statistics, but said the number of vaccinations and tests being carried out was \"nowhere near\" the level it should be.\nHe added: \"The vaccine is the way that we try to defeat the virus - or defeat it as best we can. \n\"The target was 400,000 vaccinations a week and we are nowhere near that.\n\"But the vaccine is only one part of this. People need to see that testing and tracing is still a huge, huge part of getting back some level of normality.\""
