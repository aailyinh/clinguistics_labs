      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales will be the first UK nation to have offered the top four priority groups a Covid jab, the Welsh Government has said.\nWithin hours, officials say, all over-70s including care home residents, will have been offered a first dose.\nWales and the other UK nations have aimed to hit the target by mid-February.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford thanked \"everyone who had been working around the clock to reach this point\".\nIt follows a warning that vaccine supplies will fall in the coming weeks.\nThe UK Government's Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said Wales' milestone was \"fantastic news\" and testament to the continued effort made by NHS and military staff.\nThe country currently leads the UK in the percentage of the population that has received a first jab - at least 715,944 doses have been given out.\nFigures up to Thursday night show 22.7% of the population have been vaccinated, compared to 21% in England, 20.4% in Scotland and 19.7% in Northern Ireland.\nBut there were more than 87,000 people from target groups, including more than 37,000 in their early 70s, still to get a first dose.\nThe picture is complicated by a built-in delay on data being published while figures are checked and verified.\nThere are also issues involving some care home residents having to wait for doses, because of isolation due to Covid outbreaks.\nBut Mr Drakeford said he was confident the programme remained on track - with plans remaining in place to reach the next five priority groups by the spring.\nHe said: \"We're the first UK nation to reach this milestone, others will follow in a couple of days.\"\nAsked how many people in those top groups who will not have had vaccine appointments by the weekend, he said it would be \"a very small number\".\n\"We've already completed 92% of all the people in those priority groups thanks to the amazing efforts of our NHS and other staff,\" he said. \n\"There will be some people who were ill when they were offered and need to be re-book. There will be some people who chose not to have a vaccine when they were first offered it, who may have changed their minds.\"\nMr Drakeford said the NHS was \"checking and rechecking\" whether anyone had been left out and final appointments were being arranged for the weekend.\n\"Anybody who knows of somebody who may have missed out, it is not too late at all,\" he said.\n\"We will make sure that those people have an appointment as fast as possible.\"\nHealth minister Vaughan Gething said \"a leave no-one behind approach\" was being taken. \n\"The next group, those people 65 and over, all health boards are already sending out invites for those people to come forward as well,\" he said. \n\"We're not looking to miss a step, we're carrying on with the vaccine we have available.\"\nThe top four priority groups include:\nFigures show 88.4% of those aged 80 or older have had a first dose, compared to 86.3% for 75 to 79 year olds and 79.8% of 70 to 74 year olds.\nPublic Health Wales said a total of 80.3% of care home residents have had a first dose, and 83.5% of care home workers.\nBritish Medical Association chairman Dr David Bailey said Wales was \"hopefully on the home straight\".\nHe told BBC Radio Wales: \"People are really making an effort to make the thing go smoothly as possible, and it is a credit to the Welsh public, as well as everyone who has actually been delivering the vaccine, because it has gone smoothly and everyone has been trying to do their part.\"\nMr Drakeford said: \"To have achieved this first milestone and offered vaccination to everyone in the first four priority groups - those who are most vulnerable to coronavirus - is a truly phenomenal effort. \n\"Of course, the hard work has only just begun - there are many, many more people to vaccinate yet and a lot of second doses still to give.\"\nWelsh Conservative's Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called the milestone a \"true British and Welsh success story\".\nHe said it showed the UK Government had \"ensured Wales has had the vaccines available to protect the most vulnerable in our society and meet this target\" and hoped Wales could soon reopen its economy.\nHowever he added there was a still a \"long way to go\" with 80% of the population yet to be offered the vaccine.\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesperson Rhun ap Iorwerth, said it was thanks to NHS staff and volunteers \"that Wales has been able to accelerate the vaccination effort to its current levels\".\nMr ap Iorwerth added his party would continue to call for \"those in all care settings, not just the elderly, to be vaccinated as a matter of priority, and for key workers in schools, the emergency services and public transport to be brought in to the priority system sooner.\""

      "title": "Covax: How many Covid vaccines have the US and the other G7 countries pledged?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US has pledged to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to poorer nations from next year - bringing its total commitment to more than one billion.\n\"To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,\" US President Joe Biden told a virtual Covid-19 summit.\nThe donation will be routed through Covax - the international scheme designed to ensure low-income countries aren't left behind in the fight against Covid.\nIt came amid growing warnings over the pace of global vaccinations, and inequity of access.\nCovax was created last year to ensure that Covid vaccines are made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations.\nThe scheme hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the population in 92 low- or medium-income countries - starting with healthcare workers and the most vulnerable groups.\nIts initial goal was to provide two billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 poorer countries by early 2022. \nCovax is run by a number of international organisations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's charity, Unicef. \nGhana was the first country to receive Covax vaccines in February. \nSince then, more than 303 million doses have been shipped through Covax to 142 countries around the world, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Fiji. \nMost doses are going to poorer countries, but some have been sent to wealthier countries such as Canada, which defended its request.\nCovax works with with governments and vaccine manufacturers around the world. Supporters include the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UAE, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Portugal.  \nCountries have pledged to donate both money and surplus doses from their own vaccine supplies.\nThe UK, Japan, Canada and the European Union are among those to have committed to supplying tens of millions of doses.\nWHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously criticised wealthier nations for \"gobbling up\" the global vaccine supply. \nG7 countries have purchased over a third of the world's vaccine supply, despite making up only 13% of the global population.\nSix vaccines have been given \"emergency use authorisation\" by the WHO, meaning they can be shared via Covax: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and Sinovac.\nHowever, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses have been delivered so far. \nModerna has agreed to supply 500 million doses at its \"lowest-tiered price\", but most won't be available until 2022. \nCovax has been criticised for being slow. Some initial targets were missed, partly as a result of the poor health infrastructure in many of the recipient countries, and partly because of vaccine hesitancy. \nDeliveries were also delayed because of the deteriorating situation in India. Officials there restricted exports to protect their own population amid soaring infection rates. These are set to resume from October. \nCovax has told the BBC that too many donations have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. This makes it very hard to get them to where they are needed. \nRepresentatives of the scheme also note that only a small percentage of the pledges made earlier this year have turned into actual doses. \nUnicef executive director Henrietta Fore said countries needed to \"accelerate their donation plans\", with low-income nations unable to wait any longer. \nWhile many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford.\nCovax says it is now expecting to hit its \"key milestone\" of releasing two billion doses for delivery some time early next year. \nIn total, some six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 195 countries worldwide.\nHowever, while some countries have fully vaccinated a large amount of their population, many others have only just begun, or in some cases are still waiting for their first doses to arrive.\nCovax aims to close that gap. \"With a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe,\" the WHO says on its website. \nBut even if Covax meets its goal to vaccinate 20% of the population in its 92 target countries, that's well short of the level of immunity that experts say is needed to end the pandemic.\nThe WHO has suggested that figure is at least 70%. People may also need booster doses to remain protected. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "Swansea University,Coronavirus vaccines,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The roll out of the Covid-19 vaccine can now \"fly\", the doctor in charge of Wales' programme has said.\nDr Gill Richardson added ongoing studies were looking at whether the immunisations would become regular and routine, similar to the flu jab.\nIt comes as figures show one in four people in Wales has received a vaccine.\nDr Richardson said vaccine supply would increase in March and, by April, there would be \"levels of supply that we haven't hitherto seen\".\n\"We will have more than enough vaccines to give the first doses to all of those who require it,\" she said.\nDr Richardson added that the infrastructure put in place to immunise the population took \"slightly longer to build\" but now that it's in place the process could \"fly\".\n\"You've seen how incredible the NHS efforts have been in delivering that vaccine and we have nowhere near maximized our capacity to immunise,\" she said.\n\"We would have wanted that Oxford-AstraZeneca in every general practice and every pharmacy in the land that would like to give it and the supply has constrained that ability, but we will be rolling out to more and more in that sector.\"\nIt is expected the Moderna vaccine, the third Covid vaccine approved in the UK, will bolster vaccination supplies later in the year.\nIn the meantime, the number of vaccines supplied to Wales is expected to fall over the next fortnight, affecting some of the country's vaccination centres.\nDr Richardson also said several studies were looking at what immunisations may be needed in future.\n\"It could be that it's just certain clinical risk factors or age factors that will mean that those people have to have it.\n\"Ever since we started this program we've always had an eye for what is the sustainability route for this course of immunity.\"\nDr Richardson said it was difficult to establish the full impact of the vaccination programme while the country was in lockdown, but suggested early signs were positive.\n\"On a UK basis, it looks like the death rate for those in the vaccinated cohorts is decreasing which is really encouraging news. The rate of deceleration is faster than the rate of deceleration for those in younger groups, so that's a really good sign.\"\nBut she stressed that lockdown rules must be adhered to in the meantime as there was uncertainty whether the vaccine interrupts transmission.\nLeading statistician Prof Jennifer Rogers said there was a sharper drop in deaths of those aged 90 and over compared with those aged 50 to 59, who had not been vaccinated.\n\"It definitely suggests that it is not an anomaly,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said on Sunday that everyone aged 50 and over will receive a first dose by the end of April.\nThose aged 80 and over were in the groups that were the top priority to get vaccinated first.\nProf Rogers, who is a member of the Royal Statistical Society, said older people \"make up 10% of cases but 80% of deaths\".\nAcross England, she said there had been a 35% reduction each week for the past fortnight in the number of deaths among people aged 90 and over, compared with a 22% drop among people aged 50 to 59.\nIn Wales, a total of 784,809 people have been given their first dose of vaccine, according to the latest figures, which is 24.9% of the population.\nThe over-70s, care home residents and staff, health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable have already been offered the jab.\nThere is a similar prioritisation of vaccine rollout in England, where Boris Johnson has said he would set out a roadmap next week providing a \"route to normality\" to move England out of lockdown.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething said Wales' reduction in Covid-19 transmission showed lockdown had worked.\nBut, he told a press conference on Monday, it was \"harder to tell\" what impact the early stages of the vaccine roll-out was having on case rate numbers.\nHe said vaccines \"will help to protect people when there is some more mixing\".\nAn updated roadmap out of lockdown in Wales is due to be published by the Welsh Government on Friday.\nOn Sunday, Mr Drakeford said the government will prioritise the return of three-to-seven year olds to school, along with some older children on vocational courses.\nMinisters have started \"cautious\" talks about Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter.\nPeople in Wales largely support remaining in lockdown for longer if it means avoiding the \"emotional rollercoaster\" of going in and out of tighter restrictions, according to an academic.\nSimon Williams, senior lecturer at Swansea University's school of management, told BBC Radio Wales people were not \"overly optimistic\" of restrictions easing significantly because they had been \"burned in the past.\"\nMr Williams said surveys from Public Health Wales (PHW) suggested as many as a quarter of people would be willing to stick to tighter restrictions for up to a year if it meant greater freedoms afterwards.\n\"So people are remarkably willing to stick in lockdown as long as it takes.\"\nAsked about a vaccine passport, of those people who had received the vaccine, Mr Williams said he believed \"the vast majority\" would be comfortable carrying \"proof of immunity\".\nHe added it was \"inevitable\" for a vaccine passports to play a role in international travel in the future.\nThe proportion of people who have so far refused the vaccine is \"negligible\" and a \"very, very small proportion\", according to Dr Giri Shankar, PHW incident director for Covid-19.\nHe told Radio Wales the first dose is \"offering a level of protection\" and that \"all indications are suggestive of an improving picture\", but added it was important people received their second dose when called upon.\nFielding questions from listeners, Dr Shankar urged people who had previously been ill with Covid-19 to accept the vaccine.\nIf people who are in the top four priority groups had not been contacted about a vaccine, Dr Shankar said they should contact their local health board.\nAll information is available on a dedicated Welsh Government website, he added."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Robert Halfon,Boris Johnson,Steven Baker,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government's plan to move England out of lockdown will be \"cautious but irreversible\", Boris Johnson has said.\nThe prime minister is due to set out the roadmap for ending restrictions next Monday.\nHe told reporters the plan would include target dates for changes \"if we possibly can\", but he warned high rates of infection could lead to delays.\nIt comes as a group of Tory MPs call for a commitment to a \"free life\" and ending of lockdown measures before May.\nSenior backbencher Steve Baker said he wants the prime minister to \"let us reclaim our lives, once and for all\".\nThe PM is likely to be questioned about his plans later when he hosts a Downing Street press conference at 17:00 GMT - alongside England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens. \nOn Sunday, the government said it met its target to offer a vaccine to the 15 million most vulnerable people across the UK.\nFigures on Monday showed a 29% drop in the number of positive cases across the country, down to 9,765 - the lowest figure since 2 October.\nBut there are still concerns over the numbers, with over 88,000 cases recorded in the last week - an average of 157 cases per 100,000 - and 4,598 people dying within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. \nLabour said the government must \"lock in the gains of the vaccine\" and ensure more measures were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus - such as financial support for self-isolation and updated workplace guidance. \nMr Johnson and senior members of his cabinet are set to spend the week looking into the latest coronavirus statistics before making an announcement on its plans. \nHe said: \"The dates that we'll be setting out will be the dates by which we hope we can do something at the earliest.\"\nThere has been a raft of speculation on the date of re-openings of businesses and hospitality - much of which has been dismissed by Downing Street.\nBut sources in No 10 told the BBC they were increasingly confident pupils in England would return to school on 8 March - the earliest the PM said the move could happen.\nMr Johnson said no decisions had been taken yet, but the March date for schools had \"for a long time been a priority of the government and families up and down the country\".\nHe added: \"We will do everything we can to make that happen, but we have got to keep looking at the data. \n\"There are still 23,000 or so Covid patients in the NHS - more than at the April peak last year - there are still sadly too many people dying of this disease; and rates of infection, although they are coming down, are still comparatively high.\n\"So we have got to be very prudent and what we want to see is progress that is cautious but irreversible. I think that is what the public, people up and down the country, want to see.\" \nOver the weekend, 63 Tory MPs wrote to Mr Johnson, calling for easing to begin in March and for analysis to be released justifying any measures staying in place.\nMr Baker, who is the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should re-open by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine. \nThe proposal was rejected by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday that the government would be \"cautious\". \nBut writing in the Telegraph, Mr Baker reasserted his plan, saying: \"As the prime minister said, let us reclaim our lives, once and for all. This can be a moment of unity - for our country and the Conservative Party - as we look ahead with confidence, hope and optimism to a much brighter future.\"\nFellow CRG member and Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price said the government \"have to think about livelihoods\", telling BBC Radio Essex: \"The moment you open schools up then there is no excuse for not opening up the rest of the economy.\" \nHospitality bosses are asking the government to reopen pubs by April, with the chairman of Wetherspoon warning the industry is \"on its knees\" and jobs are on the line.\nThe plea comes after industry figures showed the plight the sector is facing, with a net loss of almost 6,000 licensed premises last year - triple the tally in 2019.\nMore than a dozen MPs have also called on Mr Johnson to allow restricted weddings to return from 8 March, followed by restriction-free weddings from 1 May.\nTory former minister Esther McVey said after the top nine groups of people are vaccinated, it should be \"a huge moment for the UK to hold its head up high, for couples to walk down the aisle, and for families up and down the country to reunite, to celebrate and to plan their futures\".\nAny broad political consensus that existed in the early days of this pandemic has long gone. \nThe Tory MPs that make up the Covid Recovery Group have been increasingly critical of prolonged restrictions. \nThis is a group containing some senior Conservatives who are willing to be vocal, and willing to exert pressure on the prime minister. Their stance will no doubt be a factor in Downing Street's thinking. \nBut it would be wrong to assume lockdown scepticism is representative of everyone on the Tory benches. Of more than 360 Conservative MPs, 63 signed the latest letter to Boris Johnson urging an easing of restrictions as soon as possible. That's not an inconsiderable number. \nHowever, there are also Tory MPs that advocate a more cautious approach, as do plenty on the opposition benches. \nThe pressure from some in his party to move quickly out of lockdown creates tricky political tension for the prime minister - but it's not necessarily a majority view.\nAnother senior Tory backbencher, Robert Halfon, said the PM needed to \"provide some kind of optimism to the public\" over lockdown easing, but warned against people relaxing too soon.\nThe chair of the Education Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: \"I understand where [the Covid Recovery Group] are coming from and my heart has a lot of sympathy.\n\"I just don't want a repetition of what went on last year where we thought we were over the worst and then we're suddenly back in tiers of lockdown.\"\nMeanwhile, Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not want to give a \"cast iron guarantee\" about future lockdowns.\nHe said: \"The danger is we try to set out absolutes - with talk of whether this is irreversible, or whether nothing else will happen in the future.\n\"What we want to do is make choices based on the best available data and information, to see case rates driven as low as possible, and then to have a cautious exit out of the current lockdown we're in.\"  "

      "title": "At-home food selling concerning, says Food Standards Agency",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Food,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There has been a \"concerning\" rise in food businesses operating out of people's homes during lockdown, according to the food safety watchdog.\nMany of them are selling food through social media, putting further pressure on a hygiene inspection system that is under strain because of the crisis.\nAnd other experts are also worried. \n\"Little food businesses are popping up like mushrooms in lockdown,\" said Julie Barratt from the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH).\n\"There are rank outsiders operating off the radar, who think, 'Oh, my mum can cook', and confuse cooking with catering,\" she added. They sell to locals on apps such as Whatsapp, Instagram and Nextdoor.\nMany are failing to register as food businesses, meaning their hygiene arrangements are not checked by local authorities.\nBut even those that do register are often not getting an inspection - despite new businesses usually being a priority - because the system is struggling to keep up during the pandemic.\nHygiene inspections ceased completely during the first lockdown and since then a scaled-back operation has focused on high-risk cases. \nLocal authorities are using video calls in a bid to clear the backlog. They allow basic issues to be resolved and reduce the time environmental health officers need to spend on-site. They could be used, for example, to ensure there is a separate sink for washing hands.\nBut these video calls can never be as effective as in-person, surprise inspections, says Ms Barratt.\nThey are unable to reveal things such as ingredients past their use-by date, or rat droppings under the cooker.\nIndeed, a challenge posed by the new legion of at-home businesses is that even if a physical inspection is required, a 24-hour warning has to be given because it is a private address, so the surprise element is lost.\nAbout 44% of new food businesses started since the first lockdown are home-based, according to a new centralised online registration system used by nearly 200 local authorities, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has revealed. \nThe full picture will be clearer when all local authorities report their registration figures in the new financial year in April.\n\"The growth of at-home food businesses is a concern,\" the FSA said.\n\"Local authority resources are already stretched and many are finding it difficult to keep on top of the workload [these at-home food businesses] are generating,\" says Michael Jackson, the FSA's head of regulatory compliance. \nSome people are starting food businesses from their home because they have lost work and need to generate income - including professional chefs who have been hit by the closure of restaurants. \nOthers are on furlough and have time to set up \"side hustles\". Takeaway eating and the idea of cooking for neighbours in need has also become more common in lockdown. \nAs well as social media platforms, websites such as Olio and Cook My Grub also now allow this new army of at-home food entrepreneurs to find customers, selling everything from cakes to Sunday roasts. \nEvery new food business must register before it starts selling food. Once registered with the local authority, an environmental health officer can visit in person and this eventually leads to an official food hygiene rating of 0-5 (or pass-fail in Scotland). The business can still trade prior to gaining its rating. \nHowever, the rating is a vital tool for customers to gauge the safety of an establishment and can be a selling point.\nIndeed, many new at-home food businesses that are well-run and take hygiene seriously are frustrated that they haven't been able to secure a rating yet, due to the backlog.\nThe FSA described the situation with inspections as \"at the edge of our risk appetite\" back in early December, before the current lockdown was announced.\nThere have been no reported outbreaks of food poisoning connected to new at-home businesses so far. However, the FSA wants the public to be aware of the risks.\n\"Our advice to people when ordering food online is to check that the business has a food hygiene rating and choose only those with a rating of 3 or above, this can be checked on our website,\" says Mr Jackson of the FSA. \n\"If a consumer has any doubts about a food seller or a food product, they should report them to the local authority,\" he adds.\n\"Where sellers do not follow the rules, they may be fined, imprisoned for up to two years, or both.\"\nHowever, others think the system itself needs an overhaul to protect the public.\nThe law should be changed so that food businesses of any type cannot trade until they have been inspected and rated, says the CIEH's Ms Barratt.\nYou can follow Dougal on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc"

It is very important that you come forward and take up this vaccine. It's important for you, it's important for your patients and of course it's important for the whole of society.\" \nAnalysis from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust has revealed lower proportions of black and Asian staff being vaccinated.\nIt found that 70.9% of white staff had come forward, compared with 58.5% of South Asian staff and 36.8% of black staff.\nUniversity of Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust said: \"The data is two weeks old and three in four Leicester hospital staff have now been vaccinated, with uptake rising across all ethnic groups, and others taking up the offer of a jab in their local community.

Email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged those eligible to receive the vaccine to come forward.\n\"These jabs, these vaccines are safe, they are efficacious, they will help protect you against disease and against death and they're a wonderful thing to have - they help protect you, your family, your neighbours,\" Mr Johnson said.\nProf Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said he would be talking to clinical leaders from various ethnic groups \"to work out together how we can encourage everybody to take up the vaccine\".\nChristina McAnea, general secretary of the trade union, Unison, said getting as many care workers as possible to have the Covid jab should be achieved through \"encouragement and persuasion\".\nShe said care workers must be provided with \"the correct information\" and \"time to ask the experts about their concerns, think things through and talk to colleagues who've had the jab\".\nThe uptake among care workers isn't surprising - they tend to come forward in lower numbers for the flu jab.\nIt illustrates the need to continue reaching out to those who have not taken up the offer.\nThe fear is some of the most vulnerable and deprived communities have the lowest levels of uptake, which would widen inequalities in the future.\nToday, though, marks an important milestone. But that is all it is.\nMost Covid deaths have come in the over-70s, but just over half of hospitalisations have.\nIt means there are a significant number at risk in the 50 to 70 age group as well as younger adults with health conditions. They have been promised a jab by the end of April.\nAchieving that will not be easy. From March people will start needing second doses, which means the rate at which first doses are given is expected to tail off.\nAs always, everything depends on supply. Ministers are confident in the supply of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines and by Easter the deliveries of a third jab made by Moderna should arrive. There can be no let up.\nMeanwhile, Mr Hancock said that there was still \"some way to go\" before easing lockdown.\nHe said: \"At the latest count there are still over 23,000 people in hospital with Covid - that's more than in the April peak.\" \nIt is 69 days since the UK began its mass vaccination programme - and six weeks since the prime minister set out the pledge to offer a first dose to the four priority groups by 15 February.\nThat meant vaccinating all elderly care home residents and their carers; everyone over 70; all frontline health and social care workers; and everyone with a condition that makes them extremely vulnerable to the virus - a total of 14.6 million people.\nSpeaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing Mr Johnson hailed the vaccine rollout as an \"unprecedented achievement\" and said the country can go into the next stage \"with great confidence\".\nBut while the UK's vaccination rate is third in the world, behind only Israel and the United Arab Emirates, there have been reports that some people in priority groups - including those who are housebound - are still waiting for their first dose.\nAnd a small number of the 15 million people vaccinated will have been outside these initial priority groups as some NHS regions had already begun giving jabs to younger people.\nAs well as the over-65s, the next group to be offered the vaccine is the estimated 7.3 million people aged 16 to 65 with a range of health conditions that put them at risk from the virus.\nThe rollout will then be extended to the remaining over-50 age groups, with the aim of offering a first dose to another 17.2 million people before the end of April.\nMeanwhile, the government has confirmed that millions of people whose asthma is under control will not be prioritised for the vaccine.\nMr Hancock said that 90% of the over-70s had accepted the vaccine and one in four adults were now starting to receive protection against Covid-19. \nThe Department of Health said 88% of the UK's coronavirus deaths occurred in the priority groups who have now been offered the vaccine.\nOn Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections, according to the latest government figures. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October.\nA further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend.\nWith the expectation that increasing numbers of people will be protected from serious illness, ministers will this week finalise plans on how England's coronavirus measures can be eased.\nThe government has said it will take \"cautious\" steps, rejecting calls from Conservative MPs to commit to abolishing all Covid-19 restrictions by the end of April."

      "text": "People whose asthma is under control will not be prioritised for the Covid vaccine, the government has confirmed. \nSufferers of the condition will not be on the list ahead of their peers unless they are formally shielding, regularly take steroid tablets or have ever had an emergency hospital admission.\nThis appears to be a rowing back from previous guidance indicating steroid-inhaler users would be eligible.\nIt has since been judged this group is not at increased risk of death.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it was following independent advice that the immediate priority should be to \"prevent deaths and protect health and care staff, with old age deemed the single biggest factor determining mortality\".\nA DHSC spokesperson said: \"This prioritisation captures almost all preventable deaths from Covid-19.\" \nPeople with non-severe asthma are considered by the NHS to be at increased risk from Covid - but not at risk of dying from the virus. \nAsthma has also been linked to an increased risk of \"long Covid\" -  an array of different symptoms suffered by some people weeks or months after the initial infection has cleared. \nAnyone with the condition requiring a steroid inhaler or tablets will be offered a free annual flu jab. And that's led some people to question why they are being treated differently when it comes to Covid where only oral (tablet or liquid) steroids are considered. \nJeff Hunt, a 50-year-old from Somerset, said his moderate asthma had not required hospitalisation for the condition because he had been \"extremely cautious\" - but that didn't mean his condition didn't put him at risk. \n\"I'm really frustrated with the government guidance being so unclear,\" he said. \"It doesn't feel like it makes sense.\n\"We're all being called for an annual flu jab but now we're being told we're at no greater risk than the average population,\" he added.\nHowever, Asthma UK said the government had assessed evidence suggesting people with mild or moderate asthma, even those using high doses of inhaled steroids, were not at greater risk of dying.\nA study tried to correct for this behavioural effect - the fact people with asthma may have been particularly careful - by only looking at the outcomes of people with asthma who had contracted Covid. \nThe most severe asthma sufferers will be vaccinated in the fourth priority group if they have received a letter advising them to shield.\nPeople with asthma will be vaccinated in the sixth priority group, after the over-65s and frontline staff, if they:\nThe first five groups cover care-home residents and staff, over-80s and front-line health and care workers, the over-75s, \"clinically extremely vulnerable\" people (shielders) and the over-65s.\nThere are nine priority groups in total, which the government says it will offer a first jab to by the end of April - including all over-50s regardless of health status.\nThe next set of priority groups has yet to be laid out.\nBut it is expected to include people with both a wider range of health conditions and in a broader group of occupations, like police officers and teachers. \nSarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: \"The government have advised people with asthma that they are clinically vulnerable to Covid, throughout the pandemic, leaving many people to believe that they were going to be in priority group six for the vaccine. \n\"However, based on evidence that a lot of people with asthma are at no increased risk of dying from coronavirus, it has changed the eligibility for category six, which means many people with asthma no longer fall into this group.\"\nShe added: \"The government must urgently communicate directly to people with asthma why it has made this  decision, and explain the reasoning behind it.\"\nThe charity is calling for people with non-severe asthma to be prioritised ahead of their peers after the first nine groups have been vaccinated.\n\"The government's lack of attention, urgency and confused messaging around this issue from the start of the pandemic has caused needless anxiety for people and it needs to be put right,\" she said.

      "text": "Jaguar Land Rover's Jaguar brand will be all-electric by 2025, the carmaker has said.\nThe company will launch electric models of its entire Jaguar and Land Rover line-up by 2030, it added.\nThe firm said it would keep all three of its three British plants open as part of its new strategy.\nBut it has dropped plans to build an electric version of its XJ saloon at the Castle Bromwich plant, meaning the site will eventually stop making cars.\nChief executive Thierry Bollor\u00e9 said the plant would focus instead on \"non-production\" activities in the long term, without giving details.\nThe company plans to spend about \u00a32.5bn a year on new technology for its cars.\nThis is a big move for Jaguar Land Rover, but the reality is it has little choice. \nLike other manufacturers, it is under pressure to reduce the CO2 emissions from its fleet, as new regulations come into force in Europe and elsewhere. At the same time, sales of diesels - which generally produce less CO2 than petrol engines - have been plummeting.\nAnd in the longer term, the UK government wants to outlaw the sale of all wholly petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Governments in other countries are moving in the same general direction.  \nThe problem is, electric cars cost more to design and build than conventional models, meaning it is currently hard to make a profit from them. Bigger manufacturers can throw money at the problem now, and hope to benefit from economies of scale later. \nJLR is a smaller company and can't do that - so instead it will re-emphasise Jaguar's credentials as a luxury brand when it goes all-electric.\nThat might make sense from a marketing point of view, but making the sums add up looks like a steep challenge.\nIt will also invest in hydrogen fuel cell technology. Fuel cells provide electric power, without producing tailpipe emissions - water is the only by-product. \nHowever, in order for them to be truly environmentally friendly, the hydrogen itself needs to be produced using renewable sources.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the announcement was \"a huge step for British car manufacturing\".\nCarmakers are under pressure to meet stringent carbon emission demands in Europe and China, as well as customer demand for high-performance electric cars with a luxury or performance feel.\nThe UK plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.\nLuxury car brand Bentley Motors, owned by Germany's Volkswagen, said in November its range will be fully electric by 2030, and last month General Motors said it aimed to have a zero tailpipe emission line-up by 2035."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "text": "The name may be synonymous with a space on a Monopoly board and its connection to the birth of professional policing - but Bow Street has got its station back.\nHowever, it is not the Bow Street near Covent Garden in central London but its namesake near Aberystwyth in mid Wales.\nFor the first time in 56 years, the village was joined to the rail network as the first train stopped on Sunday.\nThe opening was kept low key as Wales is under a strict Covid-19 lockdown.\nSo there was little fanfare when the 09:12 GMT service from Machynlleth to Aberystwyth stopped to pick up passengers at the Ceredigion village for the first time since 1965.\nIt was just a precaution in case any overeager railway enthusiasts had been tempted to break the restrictions for that shot of the first diesel multiple-unit train parked up at Bow Street.\n\"This is an important milestone for us and we'd have liked to celebrate it more but that is not appropriate and safe at the moment,\" acknowledged Transport for Wales chief executive James Price.\nThe \u00a38m project to reopen the station on the Cambrian Line that connects Aberystwyth and Pwllheli to Birmingham and Shrewsbury has been 11 years in the making.\nThe new single-track halt with a park-and-ride is south of the old station.\nIt closed after 101 years in the 1960s Beeching cuts which saw the end of thousands of stations around the UK. The former site now houses a builders' merchant.\nBow Street is the first station to open in Wales since Pye Corner in Newport more than six years ago - and other than some new trains, this is the first tangible marker for the Transport for Wales rail franchise.\nBut Welsh ministers and rail bosses hope it is the first of many stations around Wales that are being considered to improve public transport infrastructure.\nA project to reopen St Clears station in Carmarthenshire has secured \u00a34.7m of UK government funding while the Welsh Government wants UK government cash help to build stations at Carno in Powys, Deeside Parkway in Flintshire and Ely Mill in Cardiff.\nA privately funded \u00a330m Cardiff Parkway station at St Mellons has also been backed by ministers in Wales.\nFour more stations - three in Newport and one at Magor in Monmouthshire - have also been recommended by a Welsh Government-backed commission looking to alleviate congestion on the M4 following the scrapping of a new \u00a31.6bn motorway south of Newport.\nBut although Transport for Wales - which runs the Wales and Border rail franchise - is Welsh Government-owned, most rail infrastructure in Wales and across the UK is under Westminster control.\n\"We have lots of ambitions for reopening a number of railway stations and increasing the number of services but railways are run by the UK government,\" said Welsh Deputy Transport Minister Lee Waters.\n\"We're stuck in the sidings a little bit. Without UK government stepping up to the plate, we don't have the means to deliver them.\n\"We've called for extra powers to be given to Wales for railway infrastructure. We are being short-changed by \u00a35bn over the next 10 years for the investment we need. \"\nThe UK Government said the Welsh Government can and does invest in station construction and upgrade, in addition to the funding provided Westminster.\n\"This Government has committed a record \u00a31.5 billion to the Welsh railways in recent years,\" added a Department for Transport spokesperson.\n\"The specification, procurement and management of rail services in Wales is devolved to Welsh ministers and we work closely with them.\"\nPre-Covid estimates made for the Welsh Government suggested Bow Street station would \"generate\" 30,000 annual trips and take nearly 466,000 vehicle miles (750,000km) off the local road network a year - helping reduce carbon emissions and congestion and parking issues in nearby Aberystwyth.\n\"The benefit for the amount of money invested here was higher here than anywhere else,\" said Mr Price.\nWith its 70-space car park, bike shelter and 110-yard (100m) platform, the idea is for the station to be a local travel hub to take the pressure off the seaside and busy university town of Aberystwyth less than four miles away.\n\"Especially at rush hour and peak tourist season traffic is a problem,\" said Aberystwyth Business Club chairman John Glasby. \n\"Especially in a tight, cramped town with only two ways in and out - so hopefully a new park-and-ride station on the edge of town might alleviate that pressure on infrastructure and boost local trade.\n\"The estimate is if you invest \u00a38m on local public transport infrastructure, the local economic benefit is three times that - so in this case about \u00a324m.\"\nBut Mr Glasby, head of commercial services at Aberystwyth University, did say local businesses were \"split\" on whether Bow Street station was \"good value for money\" and could the \"money be better spent elsewhere helping the town\".\n\"The railway project people in Aberystwyth really want is the reopening of the line to Carmarthen and the south Wales main line,\" he said. \"But that is massive, massive investment.\"\nAbout \u00a3755m to be precise, according to a feasibility study published in 2018. \nTravelling between Aberystwyth and Carmarthen on the train currently takes about six hours compared with an hour and a half in the car - and the line is one of many across Wales people want to reopen.\nThe Welsh Government states railway infrastructure is the UK government's \"responsibility\" and Mr Waters said it was money ministers in Cardiff Bay \"don't have\".\n\"I understand the strong wishes to do something to reinstate it,\" said Mr Price. \"But people will also understand that at the minute the significant cost involved.\"\nBut Transport for Wales engineers are looking at \"slightly different railway technologies\" to reinstate routes in \"a more cost-effective way\".\nSome people in the village have previously said they would continue to use the regular and quick bus service to Aberystwyth.\nSo there are a few envious eyes in Bow Street's direction from people who have been campaigning for a station in their village for years.\nA campaign group at Carno in Powys claim the 27-minute journey between Machynlleth and Caersws is the \"longest stretch of railway in Wales without a station\" - and part of the reason why their station should be the one reopening, more than 50 years after the Beeching axe.\n\"It's fair to say we were disappointed when it was announced Bow Street would open,\" said Carno Station Action Group secretary John Ellison.\n\"Especially when other groups like ours have been continually campaigning so hard and have such local support. \n\"But, on the other hand, we're heartened to see stations anywhere reopen for communities - and it gives groups of volunteers like us hope to keep campaigning and hopefully one day we will get our station back.\""

      "text": "A year ago families across the UK were packing suitcases, organising play dates and planning day trips - all in preparation for the February half-term break.\nBut this year's school holidays are set to look very different, with travel and social mixing restricted to stem the spread of Covid-19. \nSo, as children take a week off from Zoom lessons or socially distanced classrooms, what can parents do to keep the family entertained without burning themselves out?\n\"Children are going to have to be quite resourceful to keep active during this half-term,\" says former England footballer Rachel Yankey.\nShe has been coaching children remotely as part of the Youth Sport Trust's After School Sport Club, which takes place most weekday evenings.\n\"If kids don't have an outdoor space, parents might need to make an exception and allow them to dribble a football inside in a controlled way.\n\"Even half an hour of physical activity makes a big difference to a child's day.\"\nJason Sugrue, a former British table-tennis champion who works with London-based charity Greenhouse Sports, says children should be \"left to their own devices\" as much as possible.\n\"Kids are bored of adults telling them what to do by now - so we've been doing a lot of peer-to-peer fitness classes online. \n\"Kids will work with their friends to find an object in their house [in a treasure hunt, for example] - it's simple, free and fun.\"\nGreenhouse Sports organised more than 1,500 virtual coaching sessions for children in east London during the first nationwide lockdown. \nUnder lockdown rules, families can still get out of the house for exercise once a day, provided they remain within their local area.\n\"It's really important young people make the most of that time outside,\" says Sugrue. \"Nothing beats fresh air.\"\n\"Whether it's a cycle ride, drills or just walking, families must try and find a designated time each day to do an activity together during half-term.\"\n\"It's always said about books that they take you to another place,\" says children's author Michael Rosen. \"It may be to the inside of a mind that's not theirs or a physical place, but that feels especially important for kids during lockdown.\" \nRosen says parents must try to make reading \"feel relevant\" to children's interests.\n\"My trick was always to try and connect books up to theatre, live readings and movies,\" he explains.\n\"Obviously, we can't do that now but parents must be open to using digital tools to trigger more interest.\" \nThe National Literacy Trust and Oak National Academy are offering online activities and making hundreds of e-books available to children through the virtual school library project.  \nBut Rosen recommends parents let children's reading habits over the holidays \"emerge organically instead of foisting their anxiety about the need to read on [them]\".\n\"If ever there's a time to relax the rules on screen time, it's this February half-term,\" says child psychologist Laverne Antrobus. \"Especially as it will be the main way for them to stay connected with their friends.\"\nOxford University research on more than 17,000 teenagers in the US, UK and Ireland showed higher levels of screen time had little discernible effect on their mental health, but many parents are still cautious.\n\"Screen time doesn't have to be isolating,\" adds Antrobus. \"Choosing a film or a TV show for the family to watch in the evening is something that brings everyone together.\"\nVirtual events are also accessible to families over half-term: the Royal Observatory Greenwich is putting on stargazing workshops and the Shakespeare's Globe festival is offering family tickets for storytelling masterclasses.\nAntrobus warns it may be \"easier\" for parents to get younger children engaged than teenagers. \n\"With teenagers, it's a case of checking in on them and showing interest in the video game they're playing - they love to teach us dinosaurs about tech,\" she explains.\n\"Arts and crafts is all about making the most of everyday objects - in the house or in nature,\" says illustrator Rob Biddulph, whose online drawing tutorials have become increasingly popular during the pandemic. \n\"We've been going out on walks as a family and we'll pick up beautiful leaves, pebbles and sticks.\n\"And when we get home we'll paint eyes on them and turn them into characters - all that takes is two splodges of white paint.\"\nThe Tate Museum and the Southbank Centre also have virtual art events available to children over half-term. \nBiddulph says his 11-year-old daughter is less \"receptive\" to drawing and painting than she used to be \"but can still be tempted away from the screen when she sees the rest of the family having fun together\".

      "tags": "Recession,GDP,Japan,Economic growth",
      "text": "Japan's economy surged in the fourth quarter of 2020, but it was not enough to keep the country from negative growth for the year.  \nThe economy beat expectations to grow by 3% between October and December compared to the same period in 2019.\nBut growth was considerably slower than in the previous quarter, when the economy expanded 5.3%.   \nJapan's economy shrank 4.8% over the full year, its first contraction since 2009. \nThe growth figures come as Japan's Nikkei index briefly hit 30,000 for the first time since 1990. \nThe world's third-largest economy suffered its worst post-war quarterly contraction between April and June, as the global pandemic hit domestic consumption and exports. \nBut consumption and exports, which are both key drivers of the Japanese economy, also fuelled a rebound in the second half of the year.   \nPrivate consumption, which makes up more than half of the economy, rose 2.2% in the final quarter of 2020, slowing from the 5.1% increase in the previous quarter. \nStronger economic growth globally in the third and fourth quarters also helped Japanese businesses sell more of their products overseas.  \nAnnualised growth - which assumes the quarter's growth will be maintained for the whole year - was 12.7%, suggesting Japan could be on track for a strong and rapid recovery.  \nBut growth is still fragile, and could be hampered by restrictions aimed at limiting another wave of Covid-19. \nTakumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research, expects the recovery to struggle because Japan lags behind western economies in vaccine distribution. \n\"The conditions are such that Japan will not be able to avoid negative growth in the first quarter,\" he told Reuters.\n\"There is a high possibility that there will be a repeating cycle of coronavirus infections spreading and being contained this year, which means that consumption is not likely to recover at the expected pace.\"\nIn December, the government announced another round of stimulus aimed at pulling the world's second largest economy out of its slump. \nThe 73.6tr yen ($708bn; \u00a3530bn) package took Japan's total stimulus spending to around $3tr."

And we're delighted now, I'm very delighted, to have a good relationship with the White House, which is an important part of any UK prime minister's mission.\n\"I've had some good conversations already with President Biden, fantastic conversations about the way he sees things.\"\nFive people died in the violence in Washington on 6 January.\nEarlier on Sunday, Mr Biden described democracy - in contrast to Mr Johnson - as \"fragile\" in the face of \"violence and extremism\".\nHe said of Mr Trump's trial: \"While the final vote did not lead to a conviction, the substance of the charge is not in dispute.\"\nBut Mr Trump welcomed his acquittal, calling his impeachment a \"witch hunt\".\nIn his first telephone call to the prime minister last month, Mr Biden said he wanted to \"strengthen the special relationship\" between the  US and UK."

      "text": "The Scottish government is \"satisfied\" it has hit its latest vaccination target - but has warned that progress is set to slow down in the coming days.\nMinisters aimed to give a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine to all over-70s and the clinically vulnerable by Monday.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said everyone in this group should have been offered an appointment.\nShe urged anyone who had not received one to contact the government, and said \"nobody is going to be left behind\".\nHowever, she said the rate of progress was set to \"decline a bit\" due to supply issues, with health teams \"unlikely to vaccinate more than 30,000 people a day this week\".\nThis would be fewer than half of the number of people vaccinated on several days over the past week, but Ms Sturgeon said staff \"stand ready to pick up the pace as soon as supplies allow\".\nMonday is the final day for the government to reach its target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all over-70s and those deemed to be extremely clinically vulnerable.\nMs Sturgeon said she was \"satisfied we have met that target\", and that everyone in these groups had been offered the vaccine.\nA \"significant number of people\" had to rebook appointments due to the severe weather over the past week, but Ms Sturgeon said levels of uptake were already \"well beyond the 80% target we set out in our deployment plan\".\nThe first minister said \"close to 100%\" of older care home residents and over-80s in the community had been given a first dose, along with 99% of 75 to 79-year-olds.\nAnd she said the uptake rate for those aged 70 to 74 was already at 85%, with more booked in for Monday.\nMs Sturgeon said this was \"without a doubt a significant achievement\", which in time would \"reduce deaths from Covid-19 significantly\".\nThe vaccination rate is expected to dip over the coming weeks due to a combination of factors, including a reduction in supplies.\nMs Sturgeon said Pfizer had \"re-phased its delivery over the coming period\". The same number of vials will be delivered, but over a different timescale.\nShe also said the higher than expected uptake of vaccines meant more doses had been used than anticipated, while more stocks would have to start being held back for second doses.\nSome vaccination centres like the NHS Louisa Jordan may move from seven days a week operation to five to reflect this.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon stressed that \"we are not talking about closing vaccination centres\" and said the system could pick up pace \"very rapidly\" once supplies are available.\nShe said: \"We're going to see these issues through this programme, that's in the nature of it, but it shouldn't take away from the fact we are in a much better position than we thought we would be in.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the vaccination target being hit was \"great news\" and that the government must now work on a \"route map\" towards easing lockdown.\nHe said: \"Understandably specific dates set in stone are not possible because as the virus mutates it can get stronger variants, as we've seen over the last 10 or 11 months.\n\"But we need to know the triggers that will be in place for all school pupils to go back, for businesses to reopen - will we have a tiered approach or a national approach?\n\"These are the crucial points that businesses really need to be aware of so we can see our way out of this crisis.\"\nMs Sturgeon's cabinet is due to decide on Tuesday morning whether more pupils can return to Scotland's schools in the coming weeks, with an announcement to follow at Holyrood in the afternoon.\nThe first minister said she was \"very keen\" to go ahead with the phased return of children to schools.\nShe said there would be \"trade-offs\" over the coming months as the country eases out of lockdown, with schools and care home visiting \"the kind of things we focus on first as we try to get things back to normal\"."

      "tags": "Israel,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Asthma,Coronavirus vaccines,Blackburn,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nPeople must be \"optimistic but patient\" about the coronavirus situation in the UK and the end to restrictions, Boris Johnson has said. In a government briefing, the prime minister hailed the \"achievement\" of the vaccine rollout, but warned that now was not the time to relax. He said he would set out a roadmap next week, providing a \"route to normality\" to move England out of lockdown - but he could not guarantee that this would be the final one. It comes after No 10 said it had hit its target to offer a jab to the UK's 15 million most vulnerable people.\nThe first travellers required to stay at quarantine hotels have been arriving at Heathrow Airport today. All British and Irish citizens and UK residents who arrive in England after being in one of 33 high-risk Covid countries now have to self-isolate in hotels. The new regulations, which aim to stop Covid variants entering the country, apply to arrivals who have been in a \"red list\" country in the past 10 days. One traveller newly quarantining at the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel near Heathrow Airport said he was \"feeling sad\" at the prospect of isolating.  Roger Goncalves, 23, from Belo Horizonte in Brazil, said: \"I did my test for coronavirus. The test was negative. Why do I need to stay in my room for 10 days?\"\nPeople whose asthma is under control will not be prioritised for the Covid vaccine, the government has confirmed. Those with the condition will not get the jab earlier unless they are formally shielding, regularly take steroid tablets or have ever had an emergency hospital admission. Previous guidance indicated steroid-inhaler users would be eligible - but it has since been judged this group is not at increased risk of death. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was following independent advice that the immediate priority should be to \"prevent deaths and protect health and care staff, with old age deemed the single biggest factor determining mortality\". Asthma UK is calling for people with non-severe asthma to be given the jab after the first nine priority groups have been vaccinated.\nThere appears to be some positive news emerging about one of the Covid vaccines currently being used in the UK. More data from Israel's vaccination programme is suggesting the Pfizer jab prevents 94% of symptomatic infections. This indicates the vaccine is performing just as well in a larger population as it did in the clinical trials. It is proving highly effective at preventing illness and severe disease among all age groups, according to public health doctor Prof Hagai Levine. He said experts \"still don't know what the impact is on transmission\" but can say, at least, \"the vaccine is useful for personal protection\".\nBlackburn with Darwen Mayor Iftakhar Hussain has resigned after breaching lockdown rules by visiting a house where police said people were \"celebrating a wedding\". He was one of nine people who were fined by Lancashire Police after being found at an address in the town on Saturday. Mr Hussain said he regretted the \"momentary lapse of judgment\", adding that he \"should have known better\". In a statement, he said he believed resigning was \"the right thing to do\", as he no longer believed he could \"continue to serve as mayor to the best of my ability\".\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page, including this helpful piece detailing five ways to avoid lockdown eye strain.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "NI education,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Schools - including special schools - are not a major source of transmission of coronavirus, the Public Health Agency (PHA) has said.\nThe comments were made in a PHA presentation to education officials and some school principals last week, seen by BBC News NI.\nIt said that school transmission \"does occur but tends to be small scale\".\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is yet to decide if some or all pupils can return to school on Monday 8 March.\nOn Monday, four more Covid-related deaths were announced by the Department of Health, bringing its total since the start of the pandemic to 2,000.\nIn Scotland and Wales, the youngest primary school pupils are due to go back to class on 22 February.\nOn Sunday, Dr Tom Black, the chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, said he was hopeful primary schools could reopen on 8 March.\nBut he said it would be a \"big ask\" to reopen post-primary schools on that date.\nA number of meetings have been taking place between education officials, some principals and union representatives ahead of any decision on schools by the NI Executive, BBC News NI understands.\nAs part of those meetings, a presentation on Covid-19 in schools from the PHA was given.\nIt shows that 190 out of 194 post-primaries have had at least one case of coronavirus in the 2020-21 school year and almost 70% of 792 primary schools.\nHowever, the PHA presentation indicated that schools were not a major source of transmission nor a \"major driver\" of the second wave of Covid-19.\nInstead, cases in schools \"reflect community prevalence\" and as cases fall in the wider community \"we expect to see reducing numbers of positive cases in schools\", said the PHA.\nWhile school transmission does occur, the presentation said, it \"tends to be small scale\".\nAccording to the PHA, children were less affected by Covid-19 in \"prevalence and severity\".\nWhile the agency warns that new coronavirus variants are more infectious in general across all age groups, it said they are not worse in children.\nThe PHA presentation said that non-pharmacological interventions in schools were effective.\nThese include social distancing, hand and respiratory hygiene, children kept in class \"bubbles\", cleaning and the circulation of fresh air.\nDr Joanne McClean, from the PHA, said that the presentation given to reassure staff at special schools that \"while schools are a source of transmission\" they were not at high risk from working in a classroom.\nHowever, she added that the transmission risk in schools was not limited to classrooms, where social distancing and other measures are enforced, but that interactions in and around schools had to be considered.\n\"We know that schools add to that R rate and we're not trying to argue with that,\" she said on The Stephen Nolan Show.\n\"We've all been to schools around entry and exit time - it's around the social gathering that takes place after that.\"\nDr McClean said the risk in classrooms can be controlled by schools and that they had \"done a huge amount of work\" in introducing measures to mitigate transmission.\nBut the \"bit that goes on outside the class\", such as in the morning and afternoon when children are arriving and leaving, is more difficult. \nOne principal told BBC Radio Foyle that schools should return as soon as possible. \n\"Staff are on their knees at the moment,\" said Colin Torrens, principal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry.\n\"Online learning takes an awful lot more preparation, my staff are working from 08:30 right through, some are telling me they are still working at midnight.\nHe added: \"Staff want back to school because the pressure they are under at the moment is tremendous, and I think our children need to get back to school.\"\nSpecial schools have remained open to all pupils since the start of January but the vast majority of pupils in pre-schools, primary schools and post-primaries have been learning remotely.\nThe National Education Union has previously said that a full return to school by all pupils \"may not be possible for some time\".\nThe NI Executive is expected to discuss the return of pupils to schools at their meeting on 18 February but it is not clear if ministers will make a final decision on an 8 March return at that point."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A senior rabbi in London's strictly Orthodox Jewish community has condemned those holding large celebrations, after police broke up a 150-strong wedding party in the area last month. \nThe BBC has been sent a video of guests dancing at another wedding in Stamford Hill, also believed to be last month. \nResearch shows the community has one of the world's highest past Covid rates. \n\"Weddings should not go on under these circumstances,\" Rabbi Herschel Gluck told the BBC.\nHigh rates of Covid-19 in the community have been partly blamed on misleading legal advice that has been circulating in community newsletters, which says celebrations can have \"as many guests as one likes\".\nCommunity leaders told the BBC they hope media attention following January's police raid on a wedding at a school in the Stamford Hill area of north London, will have reduced the number of gatherings. \nAsking to remain anonymous, a senior source from the community said weddings were widespread apart from on religious festivals and on the sabbath or Shabbat: \"When the custom allowed it, weddings were happening every single night.\" \nRabbi Gluck, president of Shromrim, a neighbourhood watch group in Stamford Hill, confirmed: \"Weddings are very central in Judaism. \n\"In the Torah the first commandment is 'be fruitful and multiply'. \n\"It goes to the very core of the Jewish experience. Therefore there is a great need and a great urge to have weddings - but we need to put the brakes on,\" he said.\nLegal advice was distributed to thousands of homes in the community and could have convinced some they could continue because it said \"simchos\", or celebrations \"have a communal prayer element\". \nOne edition, dated 10 December, wrongly said this sort of event \"can have as many guests as one likes\". \nCommunal worship is allowed under the current lockdown, with strict social distancing. \nBut weddings are banned apart from in exceptional circumstances, and with no more than six people. \nThe human rights barrister and expert on coronavirus restrictions Adam Wagner said the advice had \"hit the wrong tone\".\n\"It was really about getting around the rules rather than keeping to the rules because of the danger of the virus,\" he said.\nThe guidance has since been revised and a senior representative of the strict Orthodox community said the overwhelming majority were making sacrifices every day to comply with the restrictions.\nJoel Friedman, director of public affairs at the Interlink Foundation, a representative body for ultra-Orthodox organisations, said: \"We have worked consistently throughout lockdown with local authorities to promote the guidance and are all disappointed when we hear about actions that put lives at risk.\"\nSeveral sources said a large traditional wedding captured in a video sent to the BBC, had taken place in early January with dancing, and little evidence of social distancing or mask wearing.\nThe UK went into national lockdown on 6 January, but even before that large events were banned.\nAfter we emailed a representative of a senior figure who appeared to have attended the event, an audio message was circulated on WhatsApp groups in North London warning that the BBC had video of the event. \n\"Friends we have to do something here,\" the message said, referring to \"the wedding last month\". \n\"This is no joke mail, most of all, we need to kill this,\" it said. \nLondon's ultra-Orthodox community took part in a study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  which showed it had a past infection rate of 64%, nine times higher than the UK average of 7%. \nThis means the Stamford Hill community's infection rate is \"among the highest reported anywhere in the world,\" researchers said. \nMany families in the community are larger than average and prayer is an important part of the daily routine, with worshippers going to their local synagogue several times a day, increasing the risk of transmission of the virus. \nThe government has decided not to close places of worship, and in many Orthodox areas they remain open, with prayers throughout the day and evening.  \nLegally there are no limits on numbers, and though risk assessments should be done, there is no requirement to publish them."

      "text": "Jaguar Land Rover's Jaguar brand will be all-electric by 2025, the carmaker has said.\nThe company will launch electric models of its entire Jaguar and Land Rover line-up by 2030, it added.\nThe firm said it would keep all three of its three British plants open as part of its new strategy.\nBut it has dropped plans to build an electric version of its XJ saloon at the Castle Bromwich plant, meaning the site will eventually stop making cars.\nChief executive Thierry Bollor\u00e9 said the plant would focus instead on \"non-production\" activities in the long term, without giving details.\nThe company plans to spend about \u00a32.5bn a year on new technology for its cars.\nThis is a big move for Jaguar Land Rover, but the reality is it has little choice. \nLike other manufacturers, it is under pressure to reduce the CO2 emissions from its fleet, as new regulations come into force in Europe and elsewhere. At the same time, sales of diesels - which generally produce less CO2 than petrol engines - have been plummeting.\nAnd in the longer term, the UK government wants to outlaw the sale of all wholly petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Governments in other countries are moving in the same general direction.  \nThe problem is, electric cars cost more to design and build than conventional models, meaning it is currently hard to make a profit from them. Bigger manufacturers can throw money at the problem now, and hope to benefit from economies of scale later. \nJLR is a smaller company and can't do that - so instead it will re-emphasise Jaguar's credentials as a luxury brand when it goes all-electric.\nThat might make sense from a marketing point of view, but making the sums add up looks like a steep challenge.\nIt will also invest in hydrogen fuel cell technology. Fuel cells provide electric power, without producing tailpipe emissions - water is the only by-product. \nHowever, in order for them to be truly environmentally friendly, the hydrogen itself needs to be produced using renewable sources.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the announcement was \"a huge step for British car manufacturing\".\nCarmakers are under pressure to meet stringent carbon emission demands in Europe and China, as well as customer demand for high-performance electric cars with a luxury or performance feel.\nThe UK plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.\nLuxury car brand Bentley Motors, owned by Germany's Volkswagen, said in November its range will be fully electric by 2030, and last month General Motors said it aimed to have a zero tailpipe emission line-up by 2035."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "tags": "Swansea University,Coronavirus vaccines,Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The roll out of the Covid-19 vaccine can now \"fly\", the doctor in charge of Wales' programme has said.\nDr Gill Richardson added ongoing studies were looking at whether the immunisations would become regular and routine, similar to the flu jab.\nIt comes as figures show one in four people in Wales has received a vaccine.\nDr Richardson said vaccine supply would increase in March and, by April, there would be \"levels of supply that we haven't hitherto seen\".\n\"We will have more than enough vaccines to give the first doses to all of those who require it,\" she said.\nDr Richardson added that the infrastructure put in place to immunise the population took \"slightly longer to build\" but now that it's in place the process could \"fly\".\n\"You've seen how incredible the NHS efforts have been in delivering that vaccine and we have nowhere near maximized our capacity to immunise,\" she said.\n\"We would have wanted that Oxford-AstraZeneca in every general practice and every pharmacy in the land that would like to give it and the supply has constrained that ability, but we will be rolling out to more and more in that sector.\"\nIt is expected the Moderna vaccine, the third Covid vaccine approved in the UK, will bolster vaccination supplies later in the year.\nIn the meantime, the number of vaccines supplied to Wales is expected to fall over the next fortnight, affecting some of the country's vaccination centres.\nDr Richardson also said several studies were looking at what immunisations may be needed in future.\n\"It could be that it's just certain clinical risk factors or age factors that will mean that those people have to have it.\n\"Ever since we started this program we've always had an eye for what is the sustainability route for this course of immunity.\"\nDr Richardson said it was difficult to establish the full impact of the vaccination programme while the country was in lockdown, but suggested early signs were positive.\n\"On a UK basis, it looks like the death rate for those in the vaccinated cohorts is decreasing which is really encouraging news. The rate of deceleration is faster than the rate of deceleration for those in younger groups, so that's a really good sign.\"\nBut she stressed that lockdown rules must be adhered to in the meantime as there was uncertainty whether the vaccine interrupts transmission.\nLeading statistician Prof Jennifer Rogers said there was a sharper drop in deaths of those aged 90 and over compared with those aged 50 to 59, who had not been vaccinated.\n\"It definitely suggests that it is not an anomaly,\" she told BBC Radio Wales.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said on Sunday that everyone aged 50 and over will receive a first dose by the end of April.\nThose aged 80 and over were in the groups that were the top priority to get vaccinated first.\nProf Rogers, who is a member of the Royal Statistical Society, said older people \"make up 10% of cases but 80% of deaths\".\nAcross England, she said there had been a 35% reduction each week for the past fortnight in the number of deaths among people aged 90 and over, compared with a 22% drop among people aged 50 to 59.\nIn Wales, a total of 784,809 people have been given their first dose of vaccine, according to the latest figures, which is 24.9% of the population.\nThe over-70s, care home residents and staff, health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable have already been offered the jab.\nThere is a similar prioritisation of vaccine rollout in England, where Boris Johnson has said he would set out a roadmap next week providing a \"route to normality\" to move England out of lockdown.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething said Wales' reduction in Covid-19 transmission showed lockdown had worked.\nBut, he told a press conference on Monday, it was \"harder to tell\" what impact the early stages of the vaccine roll-out was having on case rate numbers.\nHe said vaccines \"will help to protect people when there is some more mixing\".\nAn updated roadmap out of lockdown in Wales is due to be published by the Welsh Government on Friday.\nOn Sunday, Mr Drakeford said the government will prioritise the return of three-to-seven year olds to school, along with some older children on vocational courses.\nMinisters have started \"cautious\" talks about Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter.\nPeople in Wales largely support remaining in lockdown for longer if it means avoiding the \"emotional rollercoaster\" of going in and out of tighter restrictions, according to an academic.\nSimon Williams, senior lecturer at Swansea University's school of management, told BBC Radio Wales people were not \"overly optimistic\" of restrictions easing significantly because they had been \"burned in the past.\"\nMr Williams said surveys from Public Health Wales (PHW) suggested as many as a quarter of people would be willing to stick to tighter restrictions for up to a year if it meant greater freedoms afterwards.\n\"So people are remarkably willing to stick in lockdown as long as it takes.\"\nAsked about a vaccine passport, of those people who had received the vaccine, Mr Williams said he believed \"the vast majority\" would be comfortable carrying \"proof of immunity\".\nHe added it was \"inevitable\" for a vaccine passports to play a role in international travel in the future.\nThe proportion of people who have so far refused the vaccine is \"negligible\" and a \"very, very small proportion\", according to Dr Giri Shankar, PHW incident director for Covid-19.\nHe told Radio Wales the first dose is \"offering a level of protection\" and that \"all indications are suggestive of an improving picture\", but added it was important people received their second dose when called upon.\nFielding questions from listeners, Dr Shankar urged people who had previously been ill with Covid-19 to accept the vaccine.\nIf people who are in the top four priority groups had not been contacted about a vaccine, Dr Shankar said they should contact their local health board.\nAll information is available on a dedicated Welsh Government website, he added."

The impact was felt after the scheme ended too. \n\"The boost the scheme provided not only helped protect restaurants from closure but also showed customers the work we have done to make sure they are safe and can get back to enjoying great food,\" the letter said. \nIt also called for support measures including:\nIn a separate letter to the prime minister, Young's & Co's Mr Dardis accused the government of a \"lack of interest and respect\" regarding the plight of pubs. \nHe said major pub chief executives, including himself, were quitting an industry forum set up by small business minister Paul Scully. He declined to name the executives. \nHe added that the industry needed a \"road map\" to reopening with social distancing restrictions in place, but that these should only be in place for a few months.\nQuestioning the science behind the current pub restrictions, he said: \"We are shocked and appalled that the government is basing its decisions to keep the great British pub closed on unproven and unfounded statistics.\"\nA government spokesman said: \"We are deeply disappointed that some pub leaders have decided to step back from meetings with ministers. \n\"As we plan our way out of restrictions, we will continue to engage relentlessly with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic, and our door remains firmly open,\" he said.\nDr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, said talk of reopening pubs by April was premature.\n\"What the executives of pubs need to know is that failure to get it right equals back to square one. And back to square one equals much more pain economically, much more hardship.\"\nHe added: \"Whichever way you want to cut it, you drink alcohol to relax and have a bonhomie with your friends.\n\"One of the consequences of relaxing is that you drop your guard,\" he said.\nDr Julian Tang, honorary associate professor at the University of Leicester, agreed. \nThe consultant virologist said: \"Opening pubs will bring more people into closer contact with each other - this will allow the virus to spread - we already know and understand this concept.\""

      "tags": "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,Climate change,Environment,Bill Gates,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fifty-one billion and zero - the two numbers Bill Gates says you need to know about climate.\nSolving climate change would be \"the most amazing thing humanity has ever done\", says the billionaire founder of Microsoft.\nBy comparison, ending the pandemic is \"very, very easy\", he claims.\nMr Gates's new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, is a guide to tackling global warming.\nDon't underestimate the scale of the challenge, he told me when we spoke last week. \n\"We've never made a transition like we're talking about doing in the next 30 years. There is no precedent for this.\"\nFifty-one billion is how many tonnes of greenhouse gases the world typically adds to the atmosphere each year.\nNet zero is where we need to get to. \nThis means cutting emissions to a level where any remaining greenhouse gas releases are balanced out by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. One way to do this is by planting trees, which soak up CO2 through their leaves.\nMr Gates' focus is on how technology can help us make that journey.\nRenewable sources like wind and solar can help us decarbonise electricity but, as Mr Gates points out, that's less than 30% of total emissions.\nWe are also going to have to decarbonise the other 70% of the world economy - steel, cement, transport systems, fertiliser production and much, much more.\nWe simply don't have ways of doing that at the moment for many of these sectors.\nThe answer, says Mr Gates, will be an innovation effort on a scale the world has never seen before.\nThis has to start with governments, he argues.\nAt the moment, the economic system doesn't price in the real cost of using fossil fuels. \nMost users don't pay anything for the damage to the environment done by pollution from the petrol in their car or the coal or gas that created the electricity in their home. \n\"Right now, you don't see the pain you're causing as you emit carbon dioxide,\" is how Mr Gates puts it.\nThat's why he says governments have to intervene. \n\"We need to have price signals to tell the private sector that we want green products,\" he says. \nThat is going to require a huge investment by governments in research and development, Mr Gates argues, as well as support to allow the market for new products and technologies to grow, thereby helping drive down prices.\nYet Mr Gates was famous for arguing that regulation stifled innovation when he was building Microsoft into the multi-billion-dollar behemoth it is now. \nSo isn't it a bit rich for him now to demand government intervention?  \nHe replies he has always supported \"the basic role of government in terms of roads and justice and education and scientific research\".\nAnd, on the climate issue, he maintains it will be impossible to avoid a disaster, particularly for those who live near the equator, without governments around the world getting behind the effort.\nThe Republican Party in America needs to recognise the importance of tackling climate change, says Mr Gates.\nThis needs to be a \"constant 30-year push\", he maintains. \"Business just can't change all that physical infrastructure unless the market signals are constant and very clear.\"\nSimply consuming less stuff - fewer flights, local food, less electricity and gas - won't solve the problem.  \n\"India is going to build housing for their people, provide lighting at night, air conditioning to make conditions liveable,\" Mr Gates believes, so global demand will not reduce.\nHe argues political action is more important, demanding government do the right thing, and, using our voices as consumers, insisting the same of companies.\n\"If you buy an electric car, a hamburger made of a meat substitute, an electric heat pump for your home you are helping increase the production of these products and therefore helping drive prices down.\"\nMr Gates still enjoys the trappings of the billionaire lifestyle.   \nHe uses private jets, but insists that they are powered by biofuels - aviation fuels made from plant products.\n\"I pay three times as much now for my aviation fuel, you know, over $7m [\u00a35m] a year in all my offset spending.\" \nAnd he has joined a \u00a33bn bidding war to buy one of the world's largest private jet services companies, a business called Signature Aviation.\nIs that appropriate when you've just written a book telling the world how to avoid a climate disaster?\n\"I don't think getting rid of flying would make sense,\" he replies. \"That type of brute force technique won't get us there.\"\nHe says the answer has to be \"a type of aviation fuel that doesn't cost much extra and is zero emission and that's got to be biofuels or electric fuels or perhaps using green hydrogen to power the plane\".\nMr Gates has become something of a bogeyman for coronavirus conspiracy theorists.\nHe has been accused of everything from concocting the virus in a secret laboratory as part of a project by global elites to depopulate the world, to using vaccinations to implant microchips in people to track and control them.\nHe laughs when asked about this.\n\"Why would I want to track people? You know, I'm just not that interested in where people are going.\"\nThe main focus for his huge charitable efforts to date has been tackling health issues in developing countries. \nHe tells me he is used to people getting bored when he talks about tuberculosis and malaria at cocktail parties, so this is a real change from what he calls \"the normal obscurity of working on infectious disease\".\nBut he says he was worried that speaking out on climate might attract similar controversy.  \n\"I don't want to dilute my voice on issues like polio eradication or malaria,\" Mr Gates explains, but says he felt this was the right time to publish his plan for tackling climate change.  \nHe says he wants his ideas to feed into the green stimulus packages being proposed around the world and to be discussed in the run-up to the crucial climate conference the UK is hosting in Glasgow in November this year. \nWe are at a crucial point in the climate debate, Mr Gates believes.\nHe describes the young generation as having a \"moral conviction\" that they have to be involved in bringing change on the issue.  \n\"Now we have to take that energy and make sure it's directed at the policies that will make a difference,\" he argues.\nBut it isn't going to be easy, he warns. \nThis has to continue to be a huge priority for the world year in, year out.\nThe hope is \"we get a bit lucky\" and succeed in developing innovative new technologies that really do solve the hard areas, he says.\nBut he is optimistic that we can still avoid the worst effects of climate change.  \n\"You know, I've seen many times, innovation surprises us in a positive way.\"\nFollow Justin on Twitter.\nI've travelled all over the world for the BBC and seen evidence of environmental damage and climate change everywhere. It's the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. Tackling it means changing how we do virtually everything. We are right to be anxious and afraid at the prospect, but I reckon we should also see this as a thrilling story of exploration, and I'm delighted to have been given the chance of a ringside seat as chief environment correspondent."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People must be \"optimistic but patient\" about the coronavirus situation in the UK and the end to restrictions, Boris Johnson has said.\nThe PM hailed the vaccine rollout, but warned that now was not the time to \"relax\".\nHe said there were still more people in hospital than at the peak of the first wave, and steps taken to ease lockdown should be \"cautious but irreversible\".\nHe is to set out a roadmap next week for lifting England's restrictions.\nThe government said on Sunday that it had met its pledge to offer at least one Covid vaccine dose to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK. More than 15 million people have received a first dose, according to the latest government figures.\nSpeaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson hailed the \"unprecedented national achievement\" of hitting the target, but warned the threat from the virus remained \"very real\". \nThe prime minister warned that the government did not have all the \"hard facts\" about how the vaccine impacted infections and that there were still more people in hospital with Covid-19 than in April - with admissions running at 1,600 a day across the UK.\n\"We have to keep our foot to the floor,\" he said.\nMr Johnson said no decisions were being taken before he unveiled his roadmap for ending England's restrictions, but that the government wanted this lockdown \"to be the last\", with \"cautious but irreversible\" progress.\nHe added his plan next week would set out \"as much as we possibly can about the route to normality, even though some things are very uncertain\".\nAlthough he said he was \"increasingly optimistic\" he admitted he could not give \"an absolute cast-iron guarantee that we won't face further difficulties\".\n\"I don't want people to think I'm not optimistic. There's been a big change - science is now in the ascendency over the disease,\" he added.\nMr Johnson also said the government was looking at introducing rapid lateral flow testing for venues such as nightclubs and some theatres that were unable to open last year.\n\"I think that, in combination with vaccination, will probably be the route forward,\" he said.\nMichael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said the \"acknowledgement\" would give late night businesses \"the opportunity to deliver pilot schemes which will substantiate the ability for this sector to open safely at the appropriate time\".\n\"But more importantly we will be able to plan and prepare for that opportunity,\" he added.\nCould this be the last lockdown?\nThat is, of course, a huge shared hope and the government's stated aim.\nIt will soon be exactly a year since the first lockdown was brought in. \nWho knew then that we'd be in a third period of national restrictions 12 months later?\nBoris Johnson has been accused, at times, of over-promising and under-delivering during this crisis.\nToday, again, he's urging caution - even as case rates fall and the vaccine rollout goes well.\nThat's because ministers really don't want to lift restrictions only to reimpose them again on a weary nation.\nIt comes after more than 60 Conservative MPs wrote to Mr Johnson over the weekend, calling for a commitment to a \"free life\" and the ending of lockdown measures before May.\nSteve Baker, the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should reopen by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine.\nEarlier, No 10 said the intention was to \"start getting\" pupils back into school on 8 March, but was not ruling out the possibility that they could be sent back in stages.\nThe PM's official spokesman said it was \"important\" the planned review of restrictions was carried out this week, with details to be set out in Mr Johnson's road map on Monday.\nThe spokesman said he would not \"pre-empt\" what the road map might contain, but added: \"It remains our priority to get kids back to school and we always said we want that to start from 8 March, if the science and evidence allows.\"\nThe government is hoping to offer a jab to everyone in the first nine priority groups - including everyone over the age of 50 - by the end of April, Mr Johnson said.\nThis would run alongside giving second doses within the 12-week window to those in the top four priority groups, who have already had a first dose.\nAll those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers, are being contacted with the offer of a vaccination. \nWith every day that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that the UK is winning its fight against Covid.\nScience, as Boris Johnson said, is in the ascendancy.\nIt is easy to forget this virus only emerged just over a year ago.\nBut now the UK has approved three vaccines for use - two of which have already started to be rolled out at speed. Another two are being assessed by the regulator after promising trial results.\nThere is confidence the mutations, while presenting a challenge, can be overcome. Plans are already being made to update the vaccines if needed to work better against new variants.\nNo vaccine is 100% effective and some people may choose not to take it. That's why advances in treatment are vital, too.\nA cheap steroid, dexamethasone, is being widely used to improve the survival rates of the sickest patients. And last week it emerged an arthritis drug, tocilizumab, could also further improve survival chances.\nThere is still a long way to go, but there is a cautious belief in both Westminster and among scientists that each step made from now on should be forward not back.\nSpeaking at the same Downing Street briefing, NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens described the vaccine rollout as \"two sprints and a marathon\".\nHe said the UK had passed the \"finishing line of the first sprint\" and now had a \"second sprint between now and 30 April\" to extend the vaccine rollout to higher risk groups.\nThe \"marathon\" will involve vaccinating everybody in the country who is eligible, alongside the winter flu campaign and further booster shots if needed, Sir Simon added.\nMeanwhile, on Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections, according to the latest government figures. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October.\nA further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend.\nIn other developments:"

      "text": "Inclusion of a question on gender for the first time in the UK census has been welcomed as a \"good first step\" by some in the transgender community.\nThe voluntary question in the 2021 survey reads: \"Is the gender you identify with the same as your sex registered at birth?\"\nPeople over 16 can tick yes or no and specify their gender identity. \nThe Office for National Statistics, which will run the census on 21 March, said the details were clearly needed.\nOwen Hurcum, 23, is the mayor-elect of Bangor, and due to take over the position in May.\nThey said they would fill in the form to say non-binary agender.\n\"I think it is great that we can finally put our real genders on the census,\" they said.\n\"I do see this as a token gesture from the government [but], it's at least a single step in the right direction and I for one look forward to putting my real gender on the census.\"\nOwen said more change was needed: \"As nice and as validating as that will feel for us to do, it really is only the tip of the iceberg for what the government can do.\n\"We need to be able to put genders other than M/F on our passports and they need to improve the access to gender identity clinics as well as moving towards legal gender self ID.\n\"Moreover, they need to reword the 2010 Equalities Act to unambiguously include non-binary identities as protected characteristics.\"\nThey also want younger respondents to be able to answer the question: \"People begin to know their gender from way below the age of 16, so the fact this option won't be available and excludes trans and non-binary children is inherently discriminatory.\"\nShash Appan, 24, is a trans activist from Cardiff and said she would fill in the form to say \"trans woman\".\nShe also backs the idea of under-16s being able to answer the question.\n\"I definitely think it should be available to under-16s, because people do transition under that age,\" she said.\nAn ONS spokesman said the question was only being asked of people aged 16 and over because \"we anticipate gender identity data collected from persons below this age is likely to be of low quality\". \nHe said this was partly due to the likelihood of the information being supplied by a parent or guardian.\nHe said the \"key data need\" for gender identity was for information on those aged 16 and over.\nMs Appan welcomed the addition of the question: \"It's a good first step forward, definitely and it's much-needed.\n\"It is very important because at the moment we don't have any kind of definitive stats in any way. \n\"It is especially important when it comes to things like NHS funding.\"\nShe said the length of time trans people were kept waiting to be seen at NHS gender clinics was \"not humane.\"\n\"At the moment non-binary people don't have legal recognition in law, which it makes it difficult for them to navigate society, because when your gender identity doesn't match your ID or when you're mis-gendered it can make interactions with our mostly cis, heteronormative society difficult to say the least,\" she said.\n\"Having an idea of how many trans people are in the UK will give an idea for people who do control funding and hopefully they'll allocate more.\" \nShe said she disclosed her sexuality on the previous census: \"One thing I would worry about is people answering the questions in a spiteful way, transphobic tropes like 'I identify, like an attack helicopter' or other things like that. \n\"When and if that does happen, are they going to filter it out? While, if they are filtering out, are they actually going to have a trans person filter out, or someone who understands?\"\nAn ONS spokesman said it would use an automatic system to process answers to many of the census questions where one can write in an answer, adding: \"These tools will then be refined once census data is received, to ensure that this data is being appropriately coded.\"\nHe said the ONS had undertaken extensive research to ensure only genuine identities were recorded.\nThe voluntary question on gender has been included in this year's census for the first time, along with new guidance on how the mandatory question on \"what is your sex?\" should be answered.\nThe ONS said respondents should use the sex recorded on one of their official documents like birth certificate or gender recognition certificate.\nThis has drawn criticism from some women's groups who fear the data gathered from this question could be compromised.\nFair Play For Women, which posted on social media: \"An undefined number of people will be allowed to put the wrong answer to the sex question... This has alarmed scientists who need accurate data on sex.\"\nHowever the organisation said the inclusion of the gender question in the census was \"a move welcomed by everyone\".\nStonewall, which campaigns for the equality of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people across Britain, said there was not currently an accurate figure for how big the trans community was because there has been no research done that covers enough people to be statistically significant.\nStonewall Cymru's campaigns, policy and research manager Iestyn Wyn said it was something the organisation campaigned for over many years. \n\"Previous statistics about LGBT+ people have been little more than estimates and the needs and experiences of our community have been hidden,\" he said.\n\"Census data on age, ethnicity and a range of other characteristics have been key to showing inequality and the need for support, and the same will be true for tackling barriers that LGBT+ people face.\"\nThe ONS said: \"Three years of evidence gathering by the ONS to inform the 2021 census showed that there is a clear need for this information at both a national and local level.\n\"Without robust data on the size of the LGBT population at a national and local level, decision-makers are operating in a vacuum, unaware of the extent and nature of disadvantage which LGBT people may be experiencing in terms of health, educational outcomes, employment and housing, and unable to design and monitor the effectiveness of policies to address this.\"\nThe census is a count of all people and households in Wales and England, which takes place every 10 years.\nScotland's census, which is run separately by National Records of Scotland, has been postponed by a year to March 2022 because of coronavirus. \nThe census is the only exercise that provides a detailed snapshot of the whole population and is unique because everyone in the country answers the same questions about the same day.\nPeople are asked about who was in their home overnight, as well as details of jobs, education and ethnic background.\nThe findings mean central and local government can use resources effectively for things such as housing, education, health and transport.\nThe Census Act 1920 makes it compulsory for everyone in England and Wales to take part in the census.\nThe 2021 census for England and Wales will be predominantly online for the first time."

      "text": "The government's plan to move England out of lockdown will be \"cautious but irreversible\", Boris Johnson has said.\nThe prime minister is due to set out the roadmap for ending restrictions next Monday.\nHe told reporters the plan would include target dates for changes \"if we possibly can\", but he warned high rates of infection could lead to delays.\nIt comes as a group of Tory MPs call for a commitment to a \"free life\" and ending of lockdown measures before May.\nSenior backbencher Steve Baker said he wants the prime minister to \"let us reclaim our lives, once and for all\".\nThe PM is likely to be questioned about his plans later when he hosts a Downing Street press conference at 17:00 GMT - alongside England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens. \nOn Sunday, the government said it met its target to offer a vaccine to the 15 million most vulnerable people across the UK.\nFigures on Monday showed a 29% drop in the number of positive cases across the country, down to 9,765 - the lowest figure since 2 October.\nBut there are still concerns over the numbers, with over 88,000 cases recorded in the last week - an average of 157 cases per 100,000 - and 4,598 people dying within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. \nLabour said the government must \"lock in the gains of the vaccine\" and ensure more measures were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus - such as financial support for self-isolation and updated workplace guidance. \nMr Johnson and senior members of his cabinet are set to spend the week looking into the latest coronavirus statistics before making an announcement on its plans. \nHe said: \"The dates that we'll be setting out will be the dates by which we hope we can do something at the earliest.\"\nThere has been a raft of speculation on the date of re-openings of businesses and hospitality - much of which has been dismissed by Downing Street.\nBut sources in No 10 told the BBC they were increasingly confident pupils in England would return to school on 8 March - the earliest the PM said the move could happen.\nMr Johnson said no decisions had been taken yet, but the March date for schools had \"for a long time been a priority of the government and families up and down the country\".\nHe added: \"We will do everything we can to make that happen, but we have got to keep looking at the data. \n\"There are still 23,000 or so Covid patients in the NHS - more than at the April peak last year - there are still sadly too many people dying of this disease; and rates of infection, although they are coming down, are still comparatively high.\n\"So we have got to be very prudent and what we want to see is progress that is cautious but irreversible. I think that is what the public, people up and down the country, want to see.\" \nOver the weekend, 63 Tory MPs wrote to Mr Johnson, calling for easing to begin in March and for analysis to be released justifying any measures staying in place.\nMr Baker, who is the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should re-open by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine. \nThe proposal was rejected by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday that the government would be \"cautious\". \nBut writing in the Telegraph, Mr Baker reasserted his plan, saying: \"As the prime minister said, let us reclaim our lives, once and for all. This can be a moment of unity - for our country and the Conservative Party - as we look ahead with confidence, hope and optimism to a much brighter future.\"\nFellow CRG member and Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price said the government \"have to think about livelihoods\", telling BBC Radio Essex: \"The moment you open schools up then there is no excuse for not opening up the rest of the economy.\" \nHospitality bosses are asking the government to reopen pubs by April, with the chairman of Wetherspoon warning the industry is \"on its knees\" and jobs are on the line.\nThe plea comes after industry figures showed the plight the sector is facing, with a net loss of almost 6,000 licensed premises last year - triple the tally in 2019.\nMore than a dozen MPs have also called on Mr Johnson to allow restricted weddings to return from 8 March, followed by restriction-free weddings from 1 May.\nTory former minister Esther McVey said after the top nine groups of people are vaccinated, it should be \"a huge moment for the UK to hold its head up high, for couples to walk down the aisle, and for families up and down the country to reunite, to celebrate and to plan their futures\".\nAny broad political consensus that existed in the early days of this pandemic has long gone. \nThe Tory MPs that make up the Covid Recovery Group have been increasingly critical of prolonged restrictions. \nThis is a group containing some senior Conservatives who are willing to be vocal, and willing to exert pressure on the prime minister. Their stance will no doubt be a factor in Downing Street's thinking. \nBut it would be wrong to assume lockdown scepticism is representative of everyone on the Tory benches. Of more than 360 Conservative MPs, 63 signed the latest letter to Boris Johnson urging an easing of restrictions as soon as possible. That's not an inconsiderable number. \nHowever, there are also Tory MPs that advocate a more cautious approach, as do plenty on the opposition benches. \nThe pressure from some in his party to move quickly out of lockdown creates tricky political tension for the prime minister - but it's not necessarily a majority view.\nAnother senior Tory backbencher, Robert Halfon, said the PM needed to \"provide some kind of optimism to the public\" over lockdown easing, but warned against people relaxing too soon.\nThe chair of the Education Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: \"I understand where [the Covid Recovery Group] are coming from and my heart has a lot of sympathy.\n\"I just don't want a repetition of what went on last year where we thought we were over the worst and then we're suddenly back in tiers of lockdown.\"\nMeanwhile, Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not want to give a \"cast iron guarantee\" about future lockdowns.\nHe said: \"The danger is we try to set out absolutes - with talk of whether this is irreversible, or whether nothing else will happen in the future.\n\"What we want to do is make choices based on the best available data and information, to see case rates driven as low as possible, and then to have a cautious exit out of the current lockdown we're in.\"  "

And that's led some people to question why they are being treated differently when it comes to Covid where only oral (tablet or liquid) steroids are considered. \nJeff Hunt, a 50-year-old from Somerset, said his moderate asthma had not required hospitalisation for the condition because he had been \"extremely cautious\" - but that didn't mean his condition didn't put him at risk. \n\"I'm really frustrated with the government guidance being so unclear,\" he said. \"It doesn't feel like it makes sense.\n\"We're all being called for an annual flu jab but now we're being told we're at no greater risk than the average population,\" he added.\nHowever, Asthma UK said the government had assessed evidence suggesting people with mild or moderate asthma, even those using high doses of inhaled steroids, were not at greater risk of dying.\nA study tried to correct for this behavioural effect - the fact people with asthma may have been particularly careful - by only looking at the outcomes of people with asthma who had contracted Covid. \nThe most severe asthma sufferers will be vaccinated in the fourth priority group if they have received a letter advising them to shield.\nPeople with asthma will be vaccinated in the sixth priority group, after the over-65s and frontline staff, if they:\nThe first five groups cover care-home residents and staff, over-80s and front-line health and care workers, the over-75s, \"clinically extremely vulnerable\" people (shielders) and the over-65s.\nThere are nine priority groups in total, which the government says it will offer a first jab to by the end of April - including all over-50s regardless of health status.\nThe next set of priority groups has yet to be laid out.\nBut it is expected to include people with both a wider range of health conditions and in a broader group of occupations, like police officers and teachers. \nSarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: \"The government have advised people with asthma that they are clinically vulnerable to Covid, throughout the pandemic, leaving many people to believe that they were going to be in priority group six for the vaccine. \n\"However, based on evidence that a lot of people with asthma are at no increased risk of dying from coronavirus, it has changed the eligibility for category six, which means many people with asthma no longer fall into this group.\"\nShe added: \"The government must urgently communicate directly to people with asthma why it has made this  decision, and explain the reasoning behind it.\"\nThe charity is calling for people with non-severe asthma to be prioritised ahead of their peers after the first nine groups have been vaccinated.\n\"The government's lack of attention, urgency and confused messaging around this issue from the start of the pandemic has caused needless anxiety for people and it needs to be put right,\" she said.

I think that is what the public, people up and down the country, want to see.\"\nAt Monday's press conference, Mr Gething warned there was a \"danger\" of setting out \"absolutes\" by talking about whether lockdown lifting was \"irreversible\".\n\"If we make cautious steps outwards, then it will still very much feel like a form of lockdown for most people, because we're not going to be returning straight away to what we thought of as our normal lives just over a year ago. \n\"So yes we don't want to see a return to having to introduce more restrictions, but I wouldn't say we can give a cast iron guarantee that would never happen.\" \nMr Gething said if a number of restrictions were removed but there was then a \"significant upswing\" in the virus - such as a new variant - then ministers \"would have a responsibility to act\".\nHe added that the majority of people would rather see lockdown rules continue until it is safe to ease them.\nMinisters are looking at \"small things\" to ease out of lockdown, he said, but would not speculate on what measures were being discussed. \nMeanwhile, Mr Gething said the next stage of the vaccine programme began on Monday.\nHe said appointments would be offered to people aged 65 to 69, people aged 16 to 69 with an underlying health condition, younger adults in residential care and unpaid carers.\nAn expected drop in the supply of vaccines to Wales will not delay anybody's second dose appointment, he added.\nThe Welsh Government's lockdown easing roadmap has to be \"built around data not dates\", said the Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.\n\"That's absolutely critical, so you can't set an arbitrary date\", he said, adding there should be a \"phased step by step approach rather than all at once\".\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said it was right to be cautious over easing lockdown restrictions, but he hoped gyms could be reopened \"in an organised manner\".\n\"I'd like to see some sort of consideration around gyms being allowed to come forward in an organised manner so that people can look to those avenues to help them with their well-being\"."

The same number of vials will be delivered, but over a different timescale.\nShe also said the higher than expected uptake of vaccines meant more doses had been used than anticipated, while more stocks would have to start being held back for second doses.\nSome vaccination centres like the NHS Louisa Jordan may move from seven days a week operation to five to reflect this.\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon stressed that \"we are not talking about closing vaccination centres\" and said the system could pick up pace \"very rapidly\" once supplies are available.\nShe said: \"We're going to see these issues through this programme, that's in the nature of it, but it shouldn't take away from the fact we are in a much better position than we thought we would be in.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the vaccination target being hit was \"great news\" and that the government must now work on a \"route map\" towards easing lockdown.\nHe said: \"Understandably specific dates set in stone are not possible because as the virus mutates it can get stronger variants, as we've seen over the last 10 or 11 months.\n\"But we need to know the triggers that will be in place for all school pupils to go back, for businesses to reopen - will we have a tiered approach or a national approach?\n\"These are the crucial points that businesses really need to be aware of so we can see our way out of this crisis.\"\nMs Sturgeon's cabinet is due to decide on Tuesday morning whether more pupils can return to Scotland's schools in the coming weeks, with an announcement to follow at Holyrood in the afternoon.\nThe first minister said she was \"very keen\" to go ahead with the phased return of children to schools.\nShe said there would be \"trade-offs\" over the coming months as the country eases out of lockdown, with schools and care home visiting \"the kind of things we focus on first as we try to get things back to normal\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": " The rate at which coronavirus infection is falling in the UK - as measured by the R number - has continued to level off. \nThe latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage, is between 0.7 and 0.9, up slightly from the week before.\nIt means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people.\nThe R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. \nR is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average.\nMeasles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity. \nThat means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others. \nCoronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about three if no action was taken to stop it spreading.\nYou can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards.  \nData - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading. \nIf the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing.\nBut if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.\nGovernments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one.\nThe R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops. \nMathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in spring of 2020. \nBefore any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one. \nAlthough the R number across the UK is now between 0.7 and 0.9, there are regional differences.\nScotland's estimated R number is between 0.8 and 1.0, up slightly on the previous week.\nIn Wales the number is between 0.6 and 0.9 - while in Northern Ireland it remains between 0.75 and 0.95.\nIn England, the number is risen slightly to between 0.8 and 1.0.\nThe R number is one of the big three.\nAnother is severity - some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly. \nThe last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.\nA vaccination programme, like the one currently under way in the UK, is another way to bring down the reproduction number.\nA coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one."

      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

      "text": "An eight-year-old girl and her father, wrongly quarantined under Scotland's new hotel isolation rules, have been reunited with the girl's mother after just one day in the UK.\nChun Wong and his daughter Kiernan got the hugs they were desperate for with his wife Danielle on Tuesday after immigration delays kept them apart for 16 months.\nThey were allowed to leave their hotel after an error was discovered. \nThey will now isolate at home in Fife.\nSince Monday, all passengers arriving in Scotland on international flights have to enter \"managed isolation\". \nHowever, this does not apply to those coming from within the Common Travel Area, including the UK and Ireland.\nMr Wong and Kiernan had arrived in Edinburgh from the US via Dublin.\nThey had gone straight to a hotel at Edinburgh airport, following advice they had been given.\nLater that night they were told that as they had got a connecting flight from Ireland, they could instead isolate at home. \nThe family was finally reunited on Tuesday afternoon.\nMrs Wong told BBC Scotland about the moment she got to hug Kiernan for the first time in more than a year.\nShe said: \"I have never had that level of anxiety on my life. My legs were shaking so much and when she came out of the hotel she was scared to run to me. It was lovely and I didn't want to let her go.\"\nMr Wong added: \"I just told her to run to mummy. What a reunion to remember.\"\nHe said an official from the airport had come to see him in the hotel on Monday night. \n\"He said that it was an error on their part that since we came into the country through Dublin we didn't need to quarantine,\" he said.\n\"They were very apologetic. They said they screwed up, which I understand. It was day one and what process is perfect on day one?\"\nThe new arrivals will still carry out self-testing on the second and eighth day, in line with the isolation rules.\nTravellers who are required to self-isolate in hotels have to pay \u00a31,750 each, plus an extra fee for additional isolating guests. In Mr Wong's case that was a further \u00a3325 for Kiernan.\nThe Scottish government said it was investigating why he was \"wrongly advised\" at the airport.\nBut Mrs Wong said she had found it difficult to get the right information ahead of her family's arrival.\nShe said: \"We believed because they came from the US and the Scottish rule says that is international travel regardless of whether it is a red list country or not, they have to quarantine.\"\nShe was advised to book a quarantine hotel but again found problems with the England-based system. She said that online forms had no prompts for Scotland. \nShe added: \"It is confusing. I believe based on the regulations they should be at the hotel. I don't disagree with the stance Scotland is taking. \n\"We were willing and happy to do it. It's an appropriate measure but it needs to be made simpler for people coming here. \n\"I didn't expect this. But I am thankful because I get to see my daughter. I was frantically running to the shops this morning to stock up on food.\"\nMr Wong and Kiernan have moved to Scotland to be with Mrs Wong who has been in the country since November 2019. A dual UK/US citizen, she is a front-line NHS worker, involved in addiction services.\nThe family have been separated for 16 months, after the pandemic hit the immigration system.\nOn Monday Mr Wong said it would be \"heartbreaking\" to be apart for another 10 days if they had to isolate in a hotel.\nHe said his daughter was \"ecstatic, overjoyed and a little nervous\" as it had been more than a year since she had seen her mum.\n\"The last time she saw her she was seven and in April she'll be nine. Crazy.\"\nOn Tuesday Kiernan had two Christmases' worth of presents waiting for her at her new home.\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"We are looking into the circumstances that led to Mr Wong being wrongly advised at the airport that he needed to book a managed isolation package. This is a very new system, being implemented at pace, and some initial challenges are to be expected.  \n\"We are following up with the travel management company to ensure a full refund is provided to Mr Wong.\"\nAn Edinburgh Airport spokesman wished the Wong family well as they settled into their new life in Scotland.\nHowever, he insisted that \"inaccurate advice\" had come from the government which was evidence of the \"confusion\" the policy had created. \nThe spokesman added: \"It is a clear example of the loophole that our governments have created in action and they should work together to close it before this happens again.\"\nAll those arriving into Scotland directly from outside the Common Travel Area must pay to isolate for 10 days in a quarantine hotel.\nBut Scotland's first minister has raised concerns about the risk of people spreading new Covid variants if they arrive at airports and ferry terminals elsewhere, then travel to Scotland on public transport.\nFor example, in England only travellers from 33 \"red list\" countries must enter managed quarantine.\nUK minister Nadhim Zahawi claimed on Tuesday that the quarantine rollout had \"gone smoothly\" in England.\nMr Zahawi told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"As for day one, it's gone reasonably well, we can always do better and, of course, work with Scotland.\"\nHe added: \"Our discussions with the Scottish government will lead to a better operating system. I think it would be unwise to close the border, we are one United Kingdom.\"\nThe guidelines for international travel are published on the Scottish government website. \nA section of it says:\n\"You must also book and pay for managed isolation if you travel to Scotland from the Republic of Ireland, and have been in an acute risk country (a \"red list\" country) in the 10 days before your arrival.\n\"If you arrive in Scotland from within the Common Travel Area, but have been in a country not on the acute risk list in the 10 days before your arrival, you must self-isolate.\n\"There are some limited exemptions from isolation. You may still be required to self-isolate when you are not doing the essential activity the exemption allows.\"\nAre you currently in hotel quarantine?

      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Cabinet Office,National Audit Office,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The government's decision to hire a firm with links to the PM's ex-chief adviser Dominic Cummings has been challenged at the High Court.\nCampaign group The Good Law Project has complained of \"apparent bias\" in the decision to recruit Public First for Covid-19 opinion polling last year.\nDuring a hearing on Monday, the group's lawyer argued emergency rules used to award the work should not have applied. \nBut Mr Cummings said the \u00a3540,000 contract had been \"entirely justified\". \nIn a written statement, he said although he was \"friends\" with the company's founding directors, he had not recommended them for that reason.\nHe added there had been \"no time\" to follow usual procurement rules, and the work was \"crucial\" to the government's early pandemic response. \nPublic First was founded by James Frayne and Rachel Wolf, whom Mr Cummings said he knew from previous roles both inside and outside government. \nAccording to a November report into Covid-19 contracts by the National Audit Office, it was initially hired \"on an informal basis\" in March 2020 to do focus group research.\nThe spending watchdog added the company was then given a \"retrospective contract\" in June, covering work from March and \"potential future work\". \nThe Cabinet Office's decision to award the work under emergency tendering rules is subject to a legal challenge from The Good Law Project. \nAt a High Court hearing on Monday, the group's lawyer Jason Coppel QC told judge Mrs Justice O'Farrell that \"no other provider was considered\" for the work.\nHe added that although other firms already working for the government had been able to bid, \"no thought was given to any other provider because Dominic Cummings wanted Public First to have the contract\".\nArguing that rules allowing the \"direct award\" of contracts did not apply, he added awarding the contract without open competition had not been \"strictly necessary\". \nMr Cummings, who was working as Boris Johnson's senior adviser at the time the work was awarded, did not give evidence in person during the hearing. \nBut in a written statement, he defended his decision to recommend the firm for the work. \nHe said he was friends with both Mr Frayne and Ms Wolf, as well as ex-civil servant Gabriel Milland, who is also a partner at Public First. \nHe said he had not met Mr Frayne since 2016, and had \"no involvement\" in the \"contractual arrangements\" with the firm.  \n\"Obviously I did not request Public First be brought in because they were my friends. I would never do such a thing,\" he added. \nHe said he had recommended the firm because he knew the company was \"very good\" at running focus groups, and he could \"rely on them to make an extra effort\".\nAlthough he added he was not allowed to \"direct\" civil servants, he said he expected Public First to be hired \"as a result of my suggestion,\" adding that he was an \"expert in the interaction between policy, mass communication and focus groups\". \n\"Civil servants could have disagreed and did disagree with my suggestions all the time, and my response depends on my expertise of the matter in hand and other circumstances.\"\n\"On this occasion, I was an expert,\" he added. \nArguing for the legal challenge to be dismissed, lawyers for the Cabinet Office told the judge Mr Cummings made a recommendation, not a decision, on awarding the work.\nRepresenting the Cabinet Office, Michael Bowsher QC said Mr Frayne and Ms Wolf had \"professional and personal connections\" with Mr Cummings, as well as Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove.\nBut it was \"emphatically denied\" that there was \"any bias, or apparent bias\" in the award of the work to Public First, he added.\nHe said: \"At a time of national emergency Dominic Cummings recommended a firm he knew could get the job done.\"\nHe added Mr Gove did not have any involvement in the decision or influence it in any way.\nIn an outline argument earlier this month, government lawyers said it was \"clear\" that the conditions for allowing emergency procurement rules to apply had been met.\nThey said the research Public First had been hired to do was required \"immediately,\" and there was \"no time to conduct even an accelerated procurement exercise\". \nFormer Labour MP Natascha Engel, who is now a partner at Public First, defended the firm's involvement. \nSpeaking after the hearing, she said: \"Given James Frayne hasn't spoken to Dominic Cummings in several years and neither he nor Rachel Wolf spoke to Dominic Cummings or Michael Gove about Covid research, the idea this was some sort of quiet arrangement between friends is clearly wrong.\"\n\"Everyone in government knows which research agencies can deliver in a crisis, and it's no surprise Public First was chosen given our record.\" \nHaving heard rival arguments, Mrs Justice O'Farrell said she would deliver a ruling on a date to be fixed."

Telecoms operator said they had been told to shut off services from 01:00 to 09:00 local time, Sunday into Monday (18:30 to 02:30 GMT). \nInternet traffic was at 14% of normal levels after the order came into force, according to NetBlocks, a monitoring group. \nAcross the country on Sunday, hundreds of thousands of protesters rallied against the military for the ninth day in a row. \nIn the city of Myitkyina, in Kachin state, shooting could be heard as security forces clashed with anti-coup demonstrators. It was not clear whether rubber bullets or live rounds were being fired. \nFive journalists were among those arrested. \nIn Yangon, armoured vehicles were seen on the streets for the first time since the coup. Monks and engineers led a rally there, while motorcyclists drove through the streets of the capital, Nay Pyi Taw.\nA doctor at a hospital in Nay Pyi Taw told the BBC the security forces were carrying out night-time raids on homes. \n\"I'm still worrying because they make a curfew statement just not to go outside between 20:00 and 04:00, but this makes a time for the police and soldiers to arrest people like us,\" said the doctor, who cannot be named for safety reasons.  \n\"The previous day they stole into the house, cut down the fence, entered and arrested people unlawfully. That's why I'm also worrying.\"\nAn office of the US embassy in Yangon warned US nationals to stay indoors during curfew hours. \nOn Saturday, the military said arrest warrants had been issued for seven prominent opposition campaigners and warned the public not to harbour opposition activists fleeing arrest. \nVideo footage showed people reacting with defiance, banging pots and pans to warn their neighbours of night-time raids by the security forces. \nThe military on Saturday also suspended laws requiring court orders for detaining people longer than 24 hours and for searching private property. \nA UN official accused the military of \"declaring war\" on the people.\nTom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on Myanmar (also known as Burma), said the generals were showing \"signs of desperation\" and would be held accountable. \nWestern embassies urged the military to show restraint. \nA statement signed by the EU, the US and the UK said: \"We call on security forces to refrain from violence against demonstrators, who are protesting the overthrow of their legitimate government.\""

      "text": "Schools do not appear to play a big role in spreading coronavirus, say UK researchers who have studied teacher and pupil absences during the pandemic. \nThe University of Warwick team looked at sick days taken because of Covid during the autumn 2020 term in schools across England.\nAbsences matched infection rates in the wider community, with no evidence schools were a major driver of cases. \nThe prime minister is yet to announce plans for reopening schools.\nEnglish schools will not return before 8 March, Boris Johnson has said.\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is also yet to decide if some or all pupils can return on 8 March.\nBut in Scotland and Wales the youngest primary-school pupils are due to return on 22 February.\nSince the beginning of January, when the current lockdown began, primary and secondary schools have offered remote learning for most pupils.\nVulnerable pupils and children of key workers have been able to attend for face-to-face learning. \nThe University of Warwick researchers say the decision on schools must be a political one, balancing the social and educational benefits of letting more children return to the classroom against the potential Covid harms. \nChildren can catch and spread coronavirus but are unlikely to become very sick with it. \nThe study was unable to determine whether any infected staff or pupils had caught the virus in the school setting. \nCo-researcher Dr Mike Tildesley said: \"We are not saying there is no risk. \n\"It's an absence of evidence.\"\nThere was continuing uncertainty about the impact reopening schools might have on the pandemic.\nAnd a cautious approach was needed, he said.\nIn the study, Covid-related absences were lower in primary schools than secondary.  \nAnd there was a significant rise in secondary schools in the South East and Greater London in December, which might be linked to the more transmissible variant of the virus identified in Kent.\nDr Tildesley said: \"You could potentially think about doing early years first.\n\"But this is a political decision.\"\nThe Public Health Agency says school transmission \"does occur but tends to be small scale\".\nProf Sarah Lewis, an epidemiology expert at the University of Bristol, said it appeared that cases in the community were spilling into schools rather than vice versa, based on the available data."

      "text": "Wales' top nine priority groups will have received a first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of April, the first minister has said.\nThe over-70s, care home residents and staff, health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable have already been offered the jab. \nMark Drakeford is \"confident\" on vaccinating the next five groups \"provided nothing gets in the way\".\nAn updated roadmap out of lockdown will be published on Friday.\nAt the next lockdown review on 19 February, the government will prioritise the return of three-to-seven year olds to school, along with some older children on vocational courses, said Mr Drakeford. \nSpeaking on the BBC Politics Wales programme, the first minister said other changes would be \"very marginal\", including the possibility of allowing \"the outdoors to be used a little more\" and more flexibility for families.\n\"But the cabinet will not make those decisions until Thursday when we have the very latest information,\" he added.\nMr Drakeford said he hoped on Friday to be able to indicate \"how we will plan\" to get more children back to the classroom, possibly from the following review on 12 March.\nMinisters have started \"cautious\" talks about Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter.\nThe reopening of self-contained holiday accommodation is likely to be prioritised in the first instance.\nAlthough he has not ruled it out, Mr Drakeford has suggested it is unlikely pubs and restaurants would be open at the start of April.\nFrom Monday, UK residents and Irish nationals arriving in England from 33 red-list countries will have to quarantine for 10 days in hotels selected by the government.\nPeople entering Scotland from any country by air will have to isolate in hotels.\nFrom 04:00 GMT on Monday, people arriving in England and Scotland from red-list countries will be fined if they break their 10-day quarantine and enter Wales.\nAsked whether people arriving at Cardiff Airport once commercial flights restart will have to quarantine regardless of which country they have flown from, Mr Drakeford said: \"It may be that later on in March, if and when flights resume, that we will need to put those things in place.\n\"We will learn from the next few weeks, see what is necessary, see how the regimes are being put in place in the seven entry ports in Scotland and England, and then make a decision about what's needed here in Wales,\" he added.\nPeople aged five and over arriving into Wales from abroad are already required to isolate for 10 days.\nThey will now also be required to undertake a Covid-19 test on the second and eighth day of their 10-day isolation period.\nFailure to do so will be a criminal offence, liable to a fine, and failure to undertake both tests will also mean that the isolation period is extended to 14 days."

      "text": "Lower proportions of black and Asian staff at a hospital trust have come forward to have a Covid-19 vaccine, according to a study.\nThe analysis found 70.9% of white staff at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust had received the jab, compared with 58.5% of South Asian staff and 36.8% of black staff.\nThis could have \"major implications\" for vaccine roll-out, the report said.\nA union said it was important to understand \"any reasons for hesitancy\".\nThe study, yet to be peer-reviewed, was co-authored by Prof Kamlesh Khunti, a diabetes expert from the University of Leicester who is also a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage).\nThe trust, where 36% of staff are from minority ethnic backgrounds, has been running vaccination hubs for staff at each of its three hospital sites.\nThe report - which covers the period from 9 December to 3 February - found 12,278 staff from a total of 19,044 had come forward to have a jab since it was offered in mid-December.\nFurther analysis of the South Asian group found a much lower take-up among Pakistani and Bangladeshi healthcare staff (43.2%) than the Indian cohort (60.3%).\nHowever the rate between Black Caribbean and Black African staff was quite similar.\nThe study also noted a lower take-up among staff under 30.\nStaff in this age range made up 18.7% of the vaccinated group compared with 31.7% in the group who had not come forward for a jab.\nThe report said: \"These findings give significant cause for concern, as ethnic minority groups (especially those working in healthcare) are at higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 [coronavirus] and adverse outcome from COVID-19, yet are not taking up this critical preventative intervention.\n\"Furthermore, healthcare workers are an important source of health information for ethnic minority communities and so our findings may also have implications for vaccine uptake in the population at large.\"\nThe authors called for the findings to be \"acted upon urgently to prevent the disparities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic from being allowed to widen further\".\nProfessor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"We need to understand the reasons as to why there is hesitancy amongst people from BAME communities, so that it can be properly addressed. \n\"Some reasons we've been told include misinformation about the virus and vaccine, mistrust in health interventions more generally, and some people have said they want to wait until there is more certainty about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.\"\nSara Gorton, Unison's head of health, said: \"Encouraging vaccination for all is the key to getting us out of this crisis. It's important to have as much understanding as possible about any reasons for hesitancy. \n\"Health workers gather information from many sources, so it's vital to ensure those they turn to are correct.\n\"NHS staff also need to be given time to ask vaccination teams about their concerns, talk to those who've had the jab and think things through. It can't just be a one-off opportunity.\"\nDr Habib Naqvi, director of the NHS Race and Health Observatory, said the organisation was \"deeply concerned that vaccine uptake for Covid-19 is lower among black and minority ethnic hospital staff\".\n\"Amongst those most at risk of dying from Covid-19 are also those that are most vaccine-hesitant,\" he said.\n\"More needs to be done to mediate and ensure accurate information, based upon facts, is targeted in culturally appropriate ways, to reach those who need the vaccination the most.\"\nUniversity of Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust said: \"The data is two weeks old and three in four Leicester hospital staff have now been vaccinated, with uptake rising across all ethnic groups, and others taking up the offer of a jab in their local community.\n\"We want everyone to get the jab when they are called to do so.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

      "tags": "Evolution,Birds,The Himalayas",
      "text": "A study of 250 species of Himalayan songbirds has revealed how their feathers evolved for higher altitudes. \nThe birds in colder, more elevated environments had feathers with more fluffy down - providing them with thicker \"jackets\". \nThe insight reveals how feathers provide the tiniest birds with such efficient protection from extreme cold. \nIt also provides clues about which species are most at risk from climate change, the scientists say.\nThe study, in the journal Ecography, was inspired by a tiny bird lead researcher Dr Sahas Barve saw during an icy day of fieldwork in the Himalayas, in 2014.\n\"It was -10C,\" said the researcher from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, in Washington DC.\n\"And there was this little bird, a goldcrest, which weighs about the same as a teaspoon of sugar. \n\"It was just zipping around catching bugs.\" \nDr Barve's fingers went numb as he tried to take notes.\nBut he remembers being \"blown away by the little goldcrest\". \n\"To survive, this bird has to keep its heart at about 40C,\" he said. \n\"So it has to maintain a difference of 50C in that little space. \n\"I was like, 'OK, I really need to understand how feathers work.'\"\nFortunately, Dr Barve's home institution has one of the largest bird collections in the world. \nExamining the feathers of nearly 2,000 individual birds, in microscopic detail, he noticed a pattern linked their structure to their habitat. \nEach feather has an outer part and a hidden downy portion. \nAnd Dr Barve's measurements revealed those living at higher elevations had more of the lower fluffy down. \n\"They had fluffier jackets,\" he said. \nSmaller birds, which lose heat faster, also tend to have longer feathers in proportion to their body size, revealing the little goldcrest's secret.\nDr Carla Dove, who runs the museum's\u00a0Feather Identification Lab\u00a0and contributed to the study, said she was excited to use the Smithsonian's collections in a new way. \n\"Having them all in one place, as opposed to having to go to the Himalayas and study these birds in the wild, obviously makes a big difference,\" she said. \nDr Barve said: \"It would take me a decade to go out, find the birds and study their feathers.\n\"We've been using down jackets for a long time.\n\"But we haven't understood how those feathers work on a bird.\n\"We don't know what discoveries our specimens will be used for down the line. \n\"That's why we have to maintain them and keep enhancing them. \n\"These specimens from the past can be used to predict the future.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter."

      "text": "Myanmar's military has warned anti-coup protesters across the country that they could face up to 20 years in prison if they obstruct the armed forces.\nLong sentences and fines will also apply to those found to incite \"hatred or contempt\" towards the coup leaders, the military said.\nThe legal changes were announced as armoured vehicles appeared on the streets of several cities.\nHundreds of thousands of people have taken part in protests in recent days.\nThe demonstrators are demanding the release from detention of their elected leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and the restoration of democracy in Myanmar, also known as Burma.\nOn Monday, Ms Suu Kyi's lawyer said she would be detained for a further two days. She will then be tried via video link at a court in the capital Nay Pyi Taw on Wednesday, Khin Maung Zaw added. \nMs Suu Kyi was rounded up with other members of the government on 1 February, but her detention was due to end on 15 February, according to Reuters news agency.\nThe charges against her include possession of unlawful communication devices - walkie-talkies used by her security staff.\nHer party was elected in a resounding victory last November, but the military has alleged voter fraud without providing proof.\nInternet access in Myanmar is being blocked for a second consecutive night, an internet service provider has told BBC Burmese. \nThe ruling junta has threatened long prison sentences and fines on anyone found to incite hatred towards the military, \"by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation\". \nIn a statement posted on a military website on Monday, it said that people preventing the security forces from carrying out their duties could face 20 years in prison, while those found to stir up fear or unrest in public could be imprisoned for terms of three to seven years.\nThe military government on Saturday gave itself the power to make arrests, carry out searches and hold people for more than 24 hours without a court ruling.  \nIt has also told journalists not to describe the military's takeover as a coup. \nThe military's heightened presence is the latest sign of a potential crackdown on opposition to the coup. At many strategic locations, soldiers have replaced the police. \nIn the main city, Yangon, eight-wheeled armoured vehicles have been seen trying to navigate the rush-hour traffic, sometimes surrounded by cars honking their opposition to the coup. \nProtests focused on the central bank building, the US and Chinese embassies, and the city headquarters of Ms Su Kyi's National League for Democracy. \nAs demonstrators gathered in the central city of Mandalay again on Monday, there were reports of security forces firing rubber bullets to disperse crowds.\nIn footage posted on social media, the sound of what appears to be gunshots can be heard as crowds flee, with several people later appearing to display injuries. \nPolice in the city were also reported to have used sling-shots against protesters and were met with volleys of bricks. \nA leading student activist who has gone into hiding, Myo Ko Ko, told the BBC why he and others were willing to risk their lives.\n\"We strongly believe in democracy and human rights. We know that it's risky,\" he said.\n\"I have to move to another place day by day because of being searched (for) by police. We hope the international community will help us.\"\nIn the city of Myitkyina, in Kachin state, shooting could also be heard as security forces clashed with anti-coup demonstrators. It was not clear whether rubber bullets or live rounds were fired. \nStudents also protested in Nay Pyi Taw. Dozens were arrested and later released.  \nA doctor at a hospital in Nay Pyi Taw told the BBC the security forces were carrying out night-time raids on homes. \n\"I'm still worrying because they [made] a curfew statement... not to go outside between 20:00 and 04:00, but this makes a time for the police and soldiers to arrest people like us,\" said the doctor, who cannot be named for safety reasons.  \n\"The previous day they [broke] into the house, cut down the fence, entered and arrested people unlawfully. That's why I'm also worrying.\"\nResidents in several cities are reported to have formed night-watch groups to deter mobs rumoured to have been dispatched by the military to cause unrest. \nThousands of prisoners have been been given amnesty. Though this is normal to deal with prison overcrowding, there are fears that the military will use some of those released to exert pressure on anyone opposing the regime. "

A dual UK/US citizen, she is a front-line worker, involved in the care of people with addictions.\nBut the plan for her husband and daughter to join her in Glenrothes, Fife, was hit by the pandemic.\nDanielle said: \"Because of Covid, immigration was completely shut down. So what would normally have been a six-month process has turned into 16 months - and a lot of heartache.\n\"I've missed holidays, I've missed birthdays,\" she said. \"And then on top of that both Chun and Kiernan both contracted Covid, so watching that from Facetime and not being able to be there was extremely difficult.\"\nBoth parents agree that the rules must be followed and both understand the reasons for them.\nBut they are frustrated that after waiting for so long, and being asked to arrive before 3 March to collect visas, they ended up arriving on day one of travel quarantine.\nAll arrivals must isolate for 10 days in a quarantine hotel in Scotland. In England this only applies to people from 33 \"red list\" countries.\nDanielle said: \"I think what is frustrating and what needs to be remembered is there are visa processes in place.\n\"This wasn't a choice, they had to come by a particular date or the visa would be null and void. Unfortunately, their date of arrival was the date that this started. \"\nHowever, she accepts what has to happen.\n\"Theoretically, another 10/11 days is a drop in the bucket for how long we have had to wait. But I can't wait to give her a hug. It's been too long.\"\nChun and Kiernan have settled into the hotel room that will be their fist experience of Scotland as well as their home for the next 10 days.\nHe and his wife have had to pay about \u00a32,500 for the stay, on top of about \u00a310,000 in immigration fees.\nTravellers who are required to self-isolate in hotels have to pay \u00a31,750 each, plus an extra fee for additional isolating guests for their managed quarantine.\nChun, who worked in healthcare in the US, also accepts the process is necessary. Even though he was fully vaccinated in America.\nHe said: \"The one drawback is that the expense is a little much, but you do what you have got to do to keep everyone safe. I understand it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\"It sucks that we have to be here another 10 days and it's coming out of my pocket but these are lives we are talking about here.\"\nAnd Keirnan is also taking it in her stride.\n\"I am kind of upset that I can't see my mum,\" she said. \"But I am kind of ok because at least we are in Scotland now.\"\nChun told reporters at the airport he would do whatever it takes.\nHe said he was preparing to play a lot of board games with his daughter and might teach her poker before the family is reunited on 26 February."

      "text": "Will I need to avoid getting pregnant after having the coronavirus vaccine?\nAnd can I drink alcohol before or after the jab?\nWe answer some of the common vaccine questions.\nThree vaccines have been approved for use in the UK so far - Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna.\nPfizer, which was the first to be authorised and used here, works in a similar way to Moderna, the first batches of which are expected in the spring.\nThey are both called RNA vaccines, which means the genetic code of the virus is made into a vaccine and injected into the body.\nThe vaccine mimics the virus itself and the body's immune system reacts by making antibodies and T-cells.\nIf a person is later exposed to the virus, the body remembers what to do and this triggers an immune response.\nThe Oxford vaccine works in a different way, as it is a viral vector - a genetically modified virus.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees, which has been modified to look more like coronavirus - although it cannot cause illness.\nLike the other vaccines, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus, should it need to.\nAnd all three vaccines require a second dose for longer-lasting protection.\nThe Pfizer jab is not a live vaccine, meaning it does not contain any live viruses - nor does the Moderna one.\nThe Oxford vaccine contains a harmless form of a different virus, which has been altered so it cannot cause an illness.\nThere is no evidence the Covid-19 vaccine is unsafe if you are pregnant, but more evidence is needed that it is safe.\nThat is why pregnant women are not currently being offered the jab - but you can have the vaccine if you are breastfeeding.\nYou do not need to avoid pregnancy after vaccination, and the vaccine cannot give you or your baby Covid.\nIt is normal to feel a bit under the weather after any vaccine, or equally you might escape any side effects at all.\nMost are mild and should not last longer than a week.\nAccording to the NHS, they include:\nYou can take painkillers such as paracetamol if you need to. If you have a high temperature you may have coronavirus or another infection.\nIf your symptoms get worse or you are worried, call 111 or 0845 46 47 if it is not available in your area.\nThe vaccines approved for use in the UK have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.\nTo be approved in the first place, they have to go through all the clinical trials and safety checks other licensed medicines go through. \nOther vaccines are being developed, but they will only be available on the NHS once they have been thoroughly tested to make sure they are safe and effective.\nSo far, reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, have been very rare and no long-term complications have been reported.\nThe alcohol education charity Drinkaware is urging people to get vaccinated whether or not they drink alcohol.\nBut it is also asking people to think of the benefits of not drinking just before and just after being vaccinated.\nThere is no published data about the specific effects of alcohol on the body's response to the jab, Drinkaware says, but there is some evidence that drinking alcohol - especially heavily - could interfere with your body's ability to build immunity.\nThe charity advises people to consider not drinking for two days before and up to two weeks after being vaccinated.\nIt stressed that people should not turn down the jab if they feel unable or unwilling to abstain - and said regular heavy drinkers are at risk of becoming seriously ill if they do contract Covid-19.\nAll over-70s, care home residents and staff, front-line health workers and those extremely vulnerable to the virus were top of the list to be vaccinated against coronavirus.\nOver-50s and younger people with health conditions that put them at higher risk should follow by the spring, all depending on supplies of the vaccine arriving.\nAll other adults - nearly 1.1 million people - may have to wait until the autumn.\nThe priority groups used in Wales mirror those in the rest of the UK."

Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "A third of social care staff in England have not had the Covid-19 vaccine, the health secretary has said, despite them being among the groups prioritised. \nMatt Hancock said it was \"very important\" for the staff, patients and society that they get the jab.\nMeanwhile, a hospital trust has revealed that only 36.8% of its black staff have had the vaccine.\nEveryone in the top four groups has had a jab offer and 15 million people have had a first dose, the government says.\nThe rollout in England has officially been expanded to those aged 65 and over and younger people in at-risk groups.\nIn a bid to encourage more social care staff to have the jab, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: \"It is the right thing to do. It is very important that you come forward and take up this vaccine. It's important for you, it's important for your patients and of course it's important for the whole of society.\" \nAnalysis from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust has revealed lower proportions of black and Asian staff being vaccinated.\nIt found that 70.9% of white staff had come forward, compared with 58.5% of South Asian staff and 36.8% of black staff.\nUniversity of Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust said: \"The data is two weeks old and three in four Leicester hospital staff have now been vaccinated, with uptake rising across all ethnic groups, and others taking up the offer of a jab in their local community. We want everyone to get the jab when they are called to do so.\"\nAre you a social care or NHS worker who has yet to be vaccinated? Email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson urged those eligible to receive the vaccine to come forward.\n\"These jabs, these vaccines are safe, they are efficacious, they will help protect you against disease and against death and they're a wonderful thing to have - they help protect you, your family, your neighbours,\" Mr Johnson said.\nProf Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said he would be talking to clinical leaders from various ethnic groups \"to work out together how we can encourage everybody to take up the vaccine\".\nChristina McAnea, general secretary of the trade union, Unison, said getting as many care workers as possible to have the Covid jab should be achieved through \"encouragement and persuasion\".\nShe said care workers must be provided with \"the correct information\" and \"time to ask the experts about their concerns, think things through and talk to colleagues who've had the jab\".\nThe uptake among care workers isn't surprising - they tend to come forward in lower numbers for the flu jab.\nIt illustrates the need to continue reaching out to those who have not taken up the offer.\nThe fear is some of the most vulnerable and deprived communities have the lowest levels of uptake, which would widen inequalities in the future.\nToday, though, marks an important milestone. But that is all it is.\nMost Covid deaths have come in the over-70s, but just over half of hospitalisations have.\nIt means there are a significant number at risk in the 50 to 70 age group as well as younger adults with health conditions. They have been promised a jab by the end of April.\nAchieving that will not be easy. From March people will start needing second doses, which means the rate at which first doses are given is expected to tail off.\nAs always, everything depends on supply. Ministers are confident in the supply of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines and by Easter the deliveries of a third jab made by Moderna should arrive. There can be no let up.\nMeanwhile, Mr Hancock said that there was still \"some way to go\" before easing lockdown.\nHe said: \"At the latest count there are still over 23,000 people in hospital with Covid - that's more than in the April peak.\" \nIt is 69 days since the UK began its mass vaccination programme - and six weeks since the prime minister set out the pledge to offer a first dose to the four priority groups by 15 February.\nThat meant vaccinating all elderly care home residents and their carers; everyone over 70; all frontline health and social care workers; and everyone with a condition that makes them extremely vulnerable to the virus - a total of 14.6 million people.\nSpeaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing Mr Johnson hailed the vaccine rollout as an \"unprecedented achievement\" and said the country can go into the next stage \"with great confidence\".\nBut while the UK's vaccination rate is third in the world, behind only Israel and the United Arab Emirates, there have been reports that some people in priority groups - including those who are housebound - are still waiting for their first dose.\nAnd a small number of the 15 million people vaccinated will have been outside these initial priority groups as some NHS regions had already begun giving jabs to younger people.\nAs well as the over-65s, the next group to be offered the vaccine is the estimated 7.3 million people aged 16 to 65 with a range of health conditions that put them at risk from the virus.\nThe rollout will then be extended to the remaining over-50 age groups, with the aim of offering a first dose to another 17.2 million people before the end of April.\nMeanwhile, the government has confirmed that millions of people whose asthma is under control will not be prioritised for the vaccine.\nMr Hancock said that 90% of the over-70s had accepted the vaccine and one in four adults were now starting to receive protection against Covid-19. \nThe Department of Health said 88% of the UK's coronavirus deaths occurred in the priority groups who have now been offered the vaccine.\nOn Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections, according to the latest government figures. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October.\nA further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend.\nWith the expectation that increasing numbers of people will be protected from serious illness, ministers will this week finalise plans on how England's coronavirus measures can be eased.\nThe government has said it will take \"cautious\" steps, rejecting calls from Conservative MPs to commit to abolishing all Covid-19 restrictions by the end of April."

      "tags": "Snow,Texas,United States,Severe weather,Canada",
      "text": "Texas is known for its sprawling deserts and excruciating heatwaves - but right now, it's blanketed in a thick layer of ice.\nThe state is seeing some of its coldest temperatures in more than 30 years, with some areas breaking records that are more than a century old.\nParts of Texas hit 0F (-18C) on Sunday, and weather warnings are going to stay in place through the week.\nSo why is this normally boiling state suddenly freezing over?\nAccording to the US National Weather Service (NWS), this is down to an \"Arctic outbreak\" that originated just above the US-Canada border, bringing a winter snow storm as well as plummeting temperatures. \nCold air outbreaks such as these are normally kept in the Arctic by a series of low-pressure systems, the NWS said. However, this one moved through Canada and spilled out into the US last week.\nTemperatures in the city of Dallas for example will reach a high of 14F (-10C) on Monday when it should be more like 59F (15C) at this time of year.\nFor the first time in the US state, all 254 counties are under a winter storm warning, US media report. The temperature in Dallas is already colder than in Anchorage, Alaska, CBS News reports.\nIn a statement on Sunday night, President Joe Biden declared an emergency in Texas, which authorises US agencies to co-ordinate disaster relief in the state.\nRotating power outages have been initiated by the state's power grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot), early on Monday, to reduce demand on the electricity system.\n\"Traffic lights and other infrastructure may be temporarily without power,\" it added in a tweet.\nIt has also issued a level-three energy emergency alert, urging consumers to reduce electricity use.\nNearly 120 car accidents were reported on Sunday, Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a tweeted.\nHundreds of flights in and out of the state have also been cancelled. \nThe weather has already proved deadly. On Thursday, icy roads led to a massive crash involving more than 100 vehicles in Fort Worth, killing six people and leaving dozens more needing hospital treatment.\n\"The expansive dome of sub-freezing temperatures across the northern tier of the country has laid the foundation for winter storms to wreak havoc from coast to coast, not only going into this weekend, but also into next week,\" the NWS said in a statement released on Friday.\nWeather warnings for severe winter conditions are going to remain in place until at least Tuesday, when the weather system will begin to move north.\nAmarillo will see a high temperature of just 2F (-17C), breaking the city's previous record of 12F (-11C) that was set in 1895, a forecaster from the service's Weather Prediction Centre, Marc Chenard, told Reuters news agency. \nSimilarly, Lubbock will only reach a high of 9F (-13C). These temperatures are \"40 to 50 degrees [Fahrenheit] below average\", Mr Chenard said.\nParts of Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle are predicted to see as much as a foot of snow this week, while Dallas will have four inches. \nMr Chenard warns of more dangerous road conditions in Houston, caused by sleet and freezing rain."

      "text": "A British-Pakistani activist, Yousaf Ali Khan, is facing trial in Pakistan on charges of sedition and \"conspiring to wage war\" against the state.\nMr Khan is accused of making incendiary remarks advocating violence in a speech in London broadcast on social media.\nA British citizen, he heads the UK branch of a protest movement critical of Pakistan's powerful military.\nMr Khan has lived in the UK for some 20 years, and was visiting Pakistan for a family funeral when he was detained.\nYousaf Ali Khan was arrested on Saturday night, when a large number of heavily armed police surrounded the family's home in Swabi in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in the north of the country, his brother told the BBC's Secunder Kermani in Islamabad.\nMr Khan is president of the UK chapter of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), which campaigns for accountability for alleged human rights abuses committed by the Pakistani army whilst fighting against Islamist militants on the border with Afghanistan. It draws support from sections of Pakistan's ethnic Pashtun population. \nLegal documents show Mr Khan is accused of promoting \"hatred\" and \"violence\". At one point in a speech made in north London in December 2019, Mr Khan appears to suggest whenever a bomb blast occurs in a Pashtun-dominated area either in Pakistan or neighbouring Afghanistan, it should be reciprocated with an explosion in Lahore, a majority non-Pashtun city. \nThe PTM has consistently stressed it is a peaceful movement. Some members of the group distanced themselves from Mr Khan's comments, whilst others suggested they were not intended to be taken literally. His lawyer has dismissed the charges as unfounded.\nHuman rights groups have in the past raised concerns about a number of separate legal cases against other figures linked to the PTM, suggesting they form part of a wider clampdown on dissenting voices in Pakistan. \nMr Khan's trial will be conducted by an anti-terrorism court in the northern city of Mardan. The UK's Foreign Office has told the BBC it is in contact with local authorities about the arrest of a British man in Pakistan."

      "text": "US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says Congress will establish an \"outside, independent\" commission to investigate the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump.\nIn a letter to lawmakers, she said the commission would be modelled on the inquiry into the 11 September 2001 attacks on New York and the Pentagon.\n\"We must get to the truth of how this happened,\" she said.\nFormer President Trump was acquitted by the Senate of inciting the violence.\nBut Democrats and some Republicans have backed an independent investigation into the riots, which left five people dead.\nMrs Pelosi said that retired US Army Lt Gen Russel Honor\u00e9 had, over the past few weeks, been assessing the security needs of the Capitol in light of the attack.\nThe commission, she said, \"would investigate and report on the facts and causes\" of the attack; \"the interference with the peaceful transfer of power\"; and the \"preparedness and response\" of both the Capitol police and other branches of law enforcement.\nShe also said that, based on Lt Gen Honor\u00e9's initial findings, Congress needed to allocate additional funding to \"provide for the safety of members and the security of the Capitol\".\nA group of House Republicans wrote to Mrs Pelosi on Monday complaining that their party had not been consulted about the general's security review.\nIn the letter, they also demanded to know what Mrs Pelosi knew and the instructions she gave to secure the Capitol ahead of 6 January. \nHouse Republican Adam Kinzinger, who called for Mr Trump's removal after the riots, was condemned by 11 members of his family in a handwritten letter, in which they said he was in cahoots with \"the devil's army\".\n\"Oh my, what a disappointment you are to us and to God!\" they wrote to the Illinois representative, who was one of 10 Republicans to vote to impeach Mr Trump last month, denouncing his \"horrible, rude accusations of President Trump\", the New York Times reports.\n\"It is now most embarrassing to us that we are related to you,\" they said in the 8 January letter. \"You have embarrassed the Kinzinger family name!\"\nMr Trump survived his second impeachment trial on Saturday, after Democrat prosecutors failed to secure the two-thirds majority needed to convict him. He is the only president to have faced the process twice.\nThe vote split largely along party lines, with seven Republicans joining the Senate's 48 Democrats and two independents in voting to convict.\nThe senior Republican in Congress, Senator Mitch McConnell, had voted against conviction on constitutional grounds, but after the vote declared Mr Trump \"responsible\" for the assault on the Capitol.\n\"President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office,\" Mr McConnell told the chamber. \"He didn't get away with anything yet.\"\nOther Republicans have also expressed support for an independent inquiry into the riots, including a close ally of Mr Trump, Senator Lindsay Graham. He told Fox News Sunday that the former president bore some culpability. \n\"His behaviour after the election was over the top,\" he said. \"We need a 9/11 commission to find out what happened and make sure it never happens again.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,London Heathrow Airport,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The first travellers required to stay at quarantine hotels have begun arriving in the UK.\nAll British and Irish citizens and UK residents who arrive in England after being in a high-risk Covid country now have to self-isolate in hotels. \nThe \"red list\" of 33 countries includes Portugal, Brazil and South Africa. \nThe new regulations, which aim to stop Covid variants entering the country, apply to arrivals who have been in one of those places in the past 10 days. \nThey have to pre-book and pay \u00a31,750 to spend 10 days in government-sanctioned hotels. The cost covers the hotel stay, transport and testing.\nIn Scotland, the rule to stay in a hotel applies to travellers arriving directly by air from all countries outside the Common Travel Area (the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) - rather than just those from the list of 33 countries.\nOne traveller newly quarantining at the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel near Heathrow Airport said he was \"feeling sad\" at the prospect of isolating for 10 days.\nRoger Goncalves, 23, from Belo Horizonte in Brazil, said: \"I did my test for coronavirus. The test was negative. Why do I need to stay in my room for 10 days?\"\nMr Goncalves, a delivery driver who lives in London, flew into the capital from Sao Paolo, via Madrid in Spain because he needed to come back to work.\nHe said the \u00a31,750 cost of his stay was \"too high\" and \"crazy for 10 days\", but described his room as \"not bad\" and said he had been told food will be left at his door.\nMeanwhile, Zari Tadayon, 66, from north London, faces spending her birthday in isolation after flying in from Dubai, via Frankfurt.\nAsked how she felt about spending 10 days in isolation, she said: \"I feel horrible because I live here, I have my own individual home, and also I have some medical issues which I was hoping they would consider.\n\"I'm not prepared. I didn't bring books and stuff.\"\nShe added that she wasn't feeling happy \"because tomorrow is my birthday and I would have wanted to be with my family... those are the rules, what can you do?\"\nIn Scotland, the first passenger to go into quarantine hotel was Chun Wong, an American medical worker, who had travelled from America to Edinburgh via Dublin with his eight-year-old daughter Kiernan - to join his wife in Fife.\nHe told the BBC he would do \"whatever it takes\" to stay, adding: \"Even though I got my Covid shot already, whatever it takes to make everybody safe.\"\nHowever, he and his daughter were later allowed to leave the hotel after it was realised that as they had arrived from the US - which is not on the red list - via Dublin, which is in the Common Travel Area, they were allowed to isolate at home instead.\nThe government has defended the arrangements after questions were raised about the ability of passengers from \"red list\" countries to mingle with other travellers on flights and at airports before being moved to their accommodation.\nA spokesman said: \"Separation cannot always be easily implemented at airports, but every step is taken to reduce risks and to minimise any potential for passenger interaction, including Covid-19 tests prior to departure and routine protocols like mandatory mask wearing, social distances and regular cleaning of facilities.\n\"A number of airports, including Britain's busiest airport, Heathrow, have introduced additional measures to segregate passengers from red list destinations ahead of the immigration hall to limit the possibility of mixing.\"\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Times Radio the hotel quarantine system had been operating \"smoothly\" since it came into force at 04:00 GMT on Monday.\nMeanwhile, Heathrow said in a statement that the measures had come into effect \"successfully\", and it would continue to monitor whether Border Force had adequate resource and processes \"to avoid unacceptable waiting times and compromising the safety of passengers\". \nIt comes after the airport warned of delays caused by the rules.\nAre you travelling to the UK from a \"red list\" location? Tell us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nHeathrow Airport is one of five in England where people requiring hotel quarantine can enter the UK and is expected to receive the largest number of passengers. The other four are Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough.\nPassengers arriving at London's Heathrow Airport on Monday were escorted by security personnel to coaches, which took them to nearby hotels, including the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel.\nAt Birmingham Airport, there were just four flights touching down on Monday, including a plane from Istanbul with about 100 passengers, some of whom are believed to be from a red list country.\nThe government says it has struck deals with 16 hotels so far, providing 4,963 rooms for the new quarantine system, with a further 58,000 rooms currently on standby.\nPeople travelling from red list countries to Wales and Northern Ireland will be required to book and pay for quarantine in England, as neither destination has any direct international flights.\nAny passenger required to stay in a quarantine hotel in England needs to reserve a room online in advance using a government portal.\nThe additional rate for one extra adult or a child aged over 12 is \u00a3650, and for a child aged five to 12 it is \u00a3325. \nThose who fail to quarantine in such hotels face fines of \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000, while anyone who lies on their passenger locator form about having been in a country on the red list faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years.\nAsked at a No 10 briefing on Monday what would happen if someone staying in a hotel had to extend their stay due to a positive test, Prime Minister Boris Johnson stressed it was currently illegal to travel abroad for holidays and that people going into quarantine should be able to \"cover their costs\".\nA new testing regime for all travellers arriving in England has also started, with two tests required during the quarantine process.\nThey will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The tests, conducted by NHS Test and Trace, will cost travellers \u00a3210.\nThose who do not take the tests could face a \u00a32,000 fine.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the nation had decided to adopt stricter rules \"because we think it is important to go as far as we can\".\nAt her daily Covid briefing, she also stressed a common approach to travel restrictions across the four nations of the UK would be \"preferable\" and she said Scottish ministers would try to persuade the UK government \"to adopt more comprehensive measures\".\nWelsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said he also wanted to see \"a stronger set of defences at our borders\" and described the UK government's measures as \"the bare minimum of what needs to be done\".\nLast week, Labour's shadow health secretary said the public wanted the government to \"go further\" on border quarantine measures.\nTravellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry.\nAnd all travellers - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 10 days when they get to the UK.\nLockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons.

There are 477 Covid inpatients in NI hospitals, with 59 in intensive care.\nThere are 79 care home outbreaks.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said it must not be forgotten that \"behind every death will be a family left in grief\".\n\"While we are seeing good progress in the rollout of our vaccination programme we must remain cautious and cannot be tempted to get ahead of ourselves,\" said Mr Swann.\nThe reduction in transmission needed to be sustained in order to \"preserve life and support our health service\", he added.\nThe latest figures from Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout show 397,243 people have received the first dose.\nA total of 29,005 people have received both the first and second jab.\nIt comes as those who received a shielding letter because they are classed as clinically extremely vulnerable can now book vaccinations over the phone. The online booking system went live on Friday.\nAppointments are available at Northern Ireland's seven regional vaccination centres.\nPatricia Donnelly, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, has urged anyone who is eligible to make an appointment to do so without delay.\nThose who have already been contacted by their GP for vaccination are advised against booking a slot. \nA lockdown began in Northern Ireland on 26 December with schools closed along with non-essential shops.\nThe NI Executive is to review coronavirus restrictions on Thursday.\nIt is thought unlikely the lockdown will be eased before Easter, with Health Minister Robin Swann already hinting at this in a previous paper to his executive colleagues.\nOfficials say with St Patrick's Day and the Easter holidays around the corner, they do not want to prematurely allow more opportunities for people to mix, which would likely lead to another rise in cases.\nThe executive is yet to decide if some or all pupils can return to school on Monday 8 March.\nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) has said schools - including special schools - are not a major source of transmission of coronavirus.\nThe comments were made in a PHA presentation to education officials and some school principals last week, seen by BBC News NI.\nNorthern Ireland's reproduction (R) number, which measures how quickly the virus is spreading, has fallen from a peak of about 1.9 in the community last month to about 0.75-0.85.\nOn Monday is was announced Northern Ireland is to get a further \u00a3300m from the UK government to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic."

      "tags": "Companies,Wetherspoons,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Hospitality industry,Pubs",
      "text": "The chairman of JD Wetherspoon is calling for pubs to reopen at the same time as non-essential shops.\nTim Martin warned that the pub industry was \"on its knees\" and needed to reopen to save jobs.\nHe said pubs made a massive contribution to the economy, with the Wetherspoons chain paying about \u00a310 of tax for every pound of profit it made.\nHis call comes after the boss of rival pub chain Young's said pubs should be reopened by April.\nPubs, bars and restaurants across most of the UK are currently closed, although they can offer takeaway food and drink within certain restrictions. Scientists have said talk of reopening them is premature.\nBut Mr Martin argued that pubs and restaurants were \"Covid-secure environments\", having invested in safety measures such as plastic screens in front of tills, table service-only and floor markings to illustrate one-way systems around pub venues.\n\"Surely it is possible for the hospitality industry to reopen at the same time as non-essential shops, now that a vaccine exists, on the basis of the social distancing and hygiene regulations,\" he said. \nHe also suggested that various lockdown measures imposed on pubs since March last year could spell a \"disaster\" for the public finances.\nIn the financial year to July 2019, before the coronavirus crisis started, JD Wetherspoon, its customers and employees generated \u00a3764m of taxes, he said.\n\"The amount of tax paid by Wetherspoon is replicated, according to the size of the company, throughout the pub industry, and shows just how important pubs are to the economy,\" he said.\nOn Sunday, the chief executive of the Young's pub chain, Patrick Dardis, accused the prime minister of a \"lack of respect\" for the sector and of basing the decision to close pubs on \"unproven\" science - a claim that experts dispute.\nHe said major pub chief executives, including himself, were leaving an industry forum set up by small business minister Paul Scully. He declined to name the executives.\nHe said the industry needed a \"road map\" to reopening with social distancing restrictions in place, but that these should only last for a few months.\nMr Dardis suggested during an interview with the BBC's World at One programme on Monday that pubs should reopen for Easter weekend, \"accepting that there would be social distancing\" measures in place.\nHowever, Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, said talk of reopening pubs by April was premature.\n\"What the executives of pubs need to know is that failure to get it right equals back to square one. And back to square one equals much more pain economically, much more hardship.\"\nHe said people drank alcohol to relax and \"one of the consequences of relaxing is that you drop your guard\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said he is \"optimistic\" he will be able to set out plans on 22 February for a \"cautious\" easing of England's lockdown - despite scientists' warnings against measures being rolled back too quickly.\nOn Saturday, he said \"huge progress\" had been made with the rollout of vaccines, with ministers hopeful that schools can reopen from 8 March.\nAfter this, the government would look to open non-essential shops, followed by the hospitality sector, he said.\nUK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls recently warned that a May restart would be later than had been expected and that there could be \"very little\" left to reopen if closures last that long.\nIndustry figures released last week show the plight the sector is facing, with a net loss of almost 6,000 licensed premises last year, triple the tally in 2019.\nWith the pub and restaurant industry one of the hardest-hit sectors during the pandemic, Wetherspoons last year slumped to its first annual pre-tax loss since 1984.\nMr Martin also sold more than \u00a350m worth of shares in the company in January. \nIt came amid \"significant buying interest\" following a previous share placing announced by Wetherspoons, the company said. Some of those funds will go towards buying new pubs, which it expected to produce higher returns when they are allowed to reopen."

      "text": "Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has rejected calls from Conservative MPs to put a date on when England's lockdown measures will be eased, saying the government will be \"cautious\".\nThe lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG) said all restrictions must be lifted by the end of April.\nMr Raab told the BBC he was \"confident\" in the vaccine rollout, but added: \"You can't get ahead of the evidence.\"\nSo far 14.5 million people have had at least one dose of the vaccine.\nMr Raab said that the government was \"on track\" to hit its target of offering the vaccine to 15 million people from the top four priority groups by Monday.\nThe CRG has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say there will be no justification for Covid laws once the top nine priority groups have been vaccinated - which the government is planning to have done by May. \nMr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr: \"We share all of the ambition and the desire to get out of this lockdown. We want to do it responsibly and safely and therefore it's got to be based on the evidence,\" adding, \"You can't get ahead of the evidence of the impact of the vaccine on the transmission.\"\nHe said the R-rate was between 0.7 and 1 and, as of Friday, the seven-day totals for admissions, cases and fatalities were down by between a fifth and a quarter respectively.\nBut developments needed to be monitored \"in real time\", making it difficult to give guarantees or be precise about an end of April or beginning of May date for easing, he said. \nMr Johnson said on Saturday he planned a \"cautious\" reopening - the road map for which will be unveiled on 22 February, with restrictions on outdoor recreation expected to be among the first to be relaxed.\nThe CRG - which was formed in November to oppose a third lockdown and says it has the backing of 63 MPs for its letter - said the prime minister should set out a plan for \"a return to normal life\" from 8 March.\nThat is three weeks after Monday's target date for vaccinating 15 million of the most vulnerable - the same length of time the vaccine is believed to need to start taking effect - and the date pencilled in by the government for schools reopening.\nThe top four priority groups, targeted for vaccination by 15 February include:\nThe vaccine rollout has already been officially extended to people outside these groups, with invitations going out in England to people aged 65 to 69 and younger people who are in an at-risk group. \nBoris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before deciding how quickly to reopen society.\nWe know roughly what the order will be: schools, followed by outdoor mixing, non-essential shops then hospitality.\nSome Conservative MPs - who have been close to the prime minister in recent years - are urging Mr Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50.\nBut Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and having to re-impose restrictions in a matter of weeks. \nThat's why ministers are being cautious at the moment - and why the foreign secretary said it would be wrong to set an arbitrary date. \nThe CRG called for pubs and restaurants to open by Easter in a \"Covid-secure\" and \"commercially viable\" way, saying two-thirds of the people in the top nine priority groups should have had a first vaccine dose by then.\nAnd by the end of the April, when all the priority groups should have had one jab of vaccine, they say all lockdown laws should be removed.\nThe group says the burden of proof should be on ministers to show restrictions are necessary.\nScientists and medics have urged caution, saying there is still potential for another surge in cases.\nDr Shondipon Laha, a member of the Intensive Care Society, dismissed the idea that Covid-19 could end up being seen on the same level as the flu - something that has been suggested by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Mr Johnson.\n\"It's not just deadlier, it's more debilitating. So we're expecting to see significant numbers of patients who have had Covid who need intense rehabilitation.\"\n\"We know that every patient that comes to an intensive care unit that needs ventilation loses muscle mass at 2-3% per day,\" Dr Laha said, adding that many such patients cannot stand and have problems with their long-term memories.\nDr Sarah Pitt, a virologist at the University of Brighton, said the variations of coronavirus were becoming more infectious and more dangerous, also dismissing suggestions it could be treated the same as flu.\nShe said restrictions should be lifted \"very gently\", and that, in the future, \"short, sharp\" lockdowns should be introduced for a few days to target smaller, localised outbreaks - similar to those being used in Australia."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More than 15 million people in the UK have now had their first coronavirus vaccine, in what Boris Johnson described as a \"significant milestone\".\nThe PM hailed the \"extraordinary feat\", reached just over two months after the first jab was given on 8 December.\nIt comes as the government is expected to announce on Monday it has met its pledge to offer a jab to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK.\nThe rollout is now being expanded to over-65s and the clinically vulnerable.\nIn a video, Mr Johnson praised a \"truly national, UK-wide effort\", adding that in England the jab had been offered to all those in the top four priority groups. \nWales has also met the target.\nBut \"no-one is resting on their laurels,\" Mr Johnson said. \"We've still got a long way to go to. And there will undoubtedly be bumps in the road. But after all we've achieved, I know we can go forward with great confidence.\"\nSunday's daily coronavirus figures show 15,062,189 people have now received an initial vaccine dose - after 505,362 first jabs were given out on Saturday. \nA further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, taking the death toll by that measure to 117,166. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend.\nThere were 10,972 new cases reported, bringing the total number of recorded infections to 4,038,078. \nNHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the 15 million milestone was a \"remarkable shared achievement\" - reached 10 weeks after the first vaccine was administered in the UK.\n\"The NHS vaccination programme is the biggest and fastest in Europe - and in the health service's history - and that is down to the skill, care, and downright hard work of our fantastic staff, supported by local communities, volunteers and the armed forces,\" he said. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said it meant one in every four adults was now \"starting to receive protection from this dreadful disease\". \nBut he cautioned: \"There is so much more to do and I urge anyone eligible to step forward and take up their appointment. The vaccine is our route to freedom - we will beat this virus jab by jab.\"\nSo far the vaccination programme has been aimed at the top four priority groups, including NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, over-70s, and people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable.\nThese groups have accounted for 88% of the UK's Covid-19 deaths so far, according to the Department of Health and Social Care and are estimated by the JCVI to be some 15 million people. \nA small number of the 15 million to receive a jab will have been outside these priority groups.\nRuth Rankine, director of the NHS Confederation's PCN Network of GP practices, paid tribute to the \"incredible accomplishment\" but added that \"until everyone is protected, no one is protected\".\n\"There is still work to do to administer first doses to all the remaining people from the first four cohorts, as well as moving down the cohorts until everyone has at least been offered a jab, not to mention beginning the work of administering second doses,\" she said.  \nLabour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said ministers needed to \"lock in the gains of vaccination\" and introduce further measures to reduce the spread of the disease. \nThis included increased financial support for those who have to self-isolate, updated guidance on masks and help to make workplaces Covid secure. \nIt is undeniable the vaccine programme has overall been a success - only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have done more jabs per head.\nBut as well as pushing ahead with the under-70s, efforts need to continue to reach out to those not yet vaccinated in these first groups.\nThere have been reports of housebound patients still waiting, while some have questioned whether enough has been done to reach out to those who have concerns and have not taken up the offer.\nThe fear is uptake may be lowest in some of the most vulnerable communities and that risks widening health inequalities.\nPeople will also ask what this means for unlocking. Those offered the jab account for around five in six deaths but just over half of hospitalisations.\nThat leaves a lot of vulnerable at risk - and with the numbers in hospital still above the peak in the first wave, the NHS isn't yet out of the woods.\nFrom Monday, the vaccination programme enters a new phase, with over-65s and the clinically vulnerable being invited to book a jab. \nThe JCVI defines clinically vulnerable people as those with conditions including chronic respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and severe asthma.\nSome regions have already started vaccinating people aged 65 to 69, with NHS England having previously said that people in this age group could get a vaccine if GPs had supplies.\nEarlier, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab rejected calls from MPs in his party to put a date on when England's lockdown measures will be eased, saying the government will be \"cautious\".\nOn Saturday, the prime minister said he was \"optimistic\" he will be able to set out plans later this month for a \"cautious\" easing of England's lockdown, citing \"huge progress\" made with the vaccine rollout.\nThe UK is currently administering doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator - the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and the one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.\nA third vaccine, made by US company Moderna, has been approved but supplies are not expected to be available until spring.\nThe UK is also lined up to receive at least three other vaccines if they are approved for use.\nIts vaccination rate is the third highest in the world, behind only Israel and the UAE.

Schools and non-essential shops will close, and entry in and out of the city restricted.\nMs Ardern said three days should allow the government to get more information and get more testing done, and would also help determine if there was any community transmission.\nShe said the country was going \"hard and early\" after the cases were identified.\nThe rest of the country is moving to a higher level of alert, with schools and businesses remaining open but people encouraged to find alternative ways of working if possible.\nThe three community cases were identified in a mother, father and daughter from South Auckland.

      "text": "Boris Johnson has said he is \"optimistic\" he will be able to set out plans later this month for a \"cautious\" easing of England's lockdown.\nThe prime minister said \"huge progress\" had been made with the rollout of vaccines, with ministers hopeful that schools can reopen from 8 March.\nAfter this, the government would look to open non-essential shops and then later the hospitality sector, he said. \nIt comes as scientists warned against easing lockdown measures too quickly.\nMr Johnson will set out his \"road map\" out of lockdown on 22 February.\nSo far, more than 14.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, according to Saturday's government figures. \nThe government is aiming to offer a first jab to everyone in the top four priority groups - about 15 million people - by Monday.\nThe figures also show a further 612 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, taking the total number of deaths by that measure to 116,908. \nSpeaking at a visit to the Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies plant in Billingham, Teesside, Mr Johnson said: \"I'm optimistic, I won't hide it from you. I'm optimistic but we have to be cautious.\"\nSetting out the government's priorities, he said: \"Our children's education is our number one priority, but then working forward, getting non-essential retail open as well and then, in due course, as and when we can prudently and cautiously, of course we want to be opening hospitality as well.\n\"I will be trying to set out as much as I possibly can in as much detail as I can, always understanding that we have to be wary of the pattern of disease. \n\"We don't want to be forced into any kind of retreat or reverse ferret,\" the PM added.\nHe also echoed comments made earlier by Health Secretary Matt Hancock that Covid-19 could become an illness that we live with - like the flu - by the end of the year.\n\"A nasty disease like this will roll through. A new disease like this will take time for humanity to adapt to, but we are,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"I do think that in due time it will become something that we simply live with. Some people will be more vulnerable than others - that's inevitable.\"\nMr Hancock told the Daily Telegraph that he hoped new drugs by the end of 2021 could make Covid a \"treatable disease\", and one that we live with \"like we do the flu\".\nThis suggested that he was ruling out a \"zero Covid\" strategy, aimed at eliminating the virus entirely from the UK.\nHowever, scientists said coronavirus mutations were getting \"more dangerous\" and \"more infectious\" and warned against treating it like the flu.\nDr Sarah Pitt, a virologist at the University of Brighton, told the BBC: \"It's not a type of flu. It's not the same sort of virus. It doesn't cause the same sort of disease, it's very, very nasty.\"\nShe added: \"The mutations, the variations, that we're seeing are becoming more infectious, not less infectious and a bit more dangerous, not less dangerous.\"\nProf Steven Riley, a member of the SPI-M modelling group, told BBC Radio 4 Today: \"If for some reason we were to choose to just pretend it (coronavirus) wasn't here anymore, then there is the potential to go back to a wave that is a similar size to the one that we are in now.\"\nAdam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said vaccines were \"doing what we wanted them to do\", particularly among the very elderly and vulnerable, who were among the first to receive the jab.\nAlthough acknowledging that it was \"desperately important\" for schools to return and society to reopen, he cautioned against getting into a cycle \"where we are constantly opening up and then closing down again and everything is very unstable\".\n\"It's worse to open up, have another wave of pandemic, another bunch of hospitalisations and have to close down again than to be able to progressively normalise things,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nNHS Confederation chairman Lord Victor Adebowale said 8 March for schools could still be too soon, adding that the NHS workforce was \"on its knees\".\n\"I understand the pressure to open schools. We need to do so very safely. I think mid or late March is when we should be reassessing.\n\"We have had a number of false dawns when we have set dates, taken the action, then find ourselves having to row back very quickly,\" Lord Adebowale told Today.\nBut the prime minister is facing calls from some MPs in his party to ease restrictions.\nMeanwhile, UK Hospitality said for every week the hospitality sector remains shut down more companies are being placed in jeopardy and millions of jobs across hospitality and the supply chain are being put at risk.\nThe trade association's chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: \"That is why we urge the prime minister to work with us on delivering a safe, swift and sustainable exit from lockdown for hospitality.\" \nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "Indian farmers protest 2020,Climate change,India,Greta Thunberg",
      "text": "In India's southern city of Bangalore, Disha Ravi was a cheerful, familiar figure among local climate activists.\nThe sprightly 22-year-old helped clean up lakes, plant trees and campaigned against plastic. She attended workshops, walked the streets demanding climate action, loved animals and spoke out against sexism and capital punishment. A vegan and the sole-earning member in her family, she worked with a local company that makes plant-based food.\nMs Ravi is also one of the founders of the local wing of Fridays For Future, a global movement begun by climate change activist Greta Thunberg. Here, she participated in campaigns to preserve the lion-tailed macaque in an Indian bio-diversity spot, and stall a hydro power plant, among other causes.\nLiving in a low-lying neighbourhood in a city which would get easily flooded during rains, she worried about climate change. Bangalore, she said, was experiencing severe rainfall and flooding these days. She had lived in the family home for 13 years, and found that the city had never experienced such heavy rains as it had in recent years.\nMs Ravi did not mince her words. \"People of colour are suffering from the climate crisis first-hand - a lot of people don't give us attention that we need. The fact that you would choose to listen to a white person on the same issue rather than a person of colour, to me, is environmental racism,\"  she told Vogue magazine last year.\nFriends and fellow campaigners say she is a law-abiding activist. During a recent campaign to save trees in her city, Ms Ravi went to the police and sought permission. \"We have interacted during many campaigns to protect the environment. I always noticed she never transgressed the law,\" said Tara Krishnaswamy, a veteran activist.\nAt the weekend, Ms Ravi was arrested after sharing a document intended to help farmers protest against new agriculture reform laws. The police say she was a \"key conspirator\" in the formulation and dissemination\" of the document. The so-called \"toolkit\", which suggested ways of helping the farmers, was tweeted by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. \"The call was to wage economic, social, cultural and regional war against India,\" the police said.\nThey say Ms Ravi \"collaborated\" with separatist groups to \"spread disaffection against the Indian state\". \nIn court, Ms Ravi, accused of sedition and conspiracy, broke down and told the judge she had merely edited two lines of the document. But police believe she shared the document with Ms Thunberg, and then asked her to remove it after it was \"accidentally\" leaked. The court remanded her to police custody.\nMs Ravi's arrest has sparked a firestorm of protest and shocked many Indians. The chief minister of Delhi, run by an opposition party, has called the arrest \"an unprecedented attack on democracy\". A journalist wondered how \"editing publicly available documents that help people coordinate views disagreeing with those of the government can be an act of sedition\". Yet another journalist tweeted: \"The message is clear: lock up your children, stop them protesting, or we will\". \nLast July, the Delhi police temporarily blocked the website of Fridays For Future India, describing its content as \"objectionable\" and depicting an \"unlawful or terrorist act\". Members said all that it had done was swamp the environment ministry with thousands of emails in  protest against an environmental law.\n\"In India, people continue to suffer because of laws that are anti-people. We live in a country where dissent is suppressed. We in Fridays For Future India were labelled terrorists for objecting to the law]. Only a government that puts profit over people would consider asking for clean air, clean water and a liveable planet, an act of terrorism,\" Ms Ravi told an interviewer at the time.\nIn September, she told The Guardian: \"Countries like India are already experiencing a climate crisis. We are just not fighting for our future, we are fighting for our present. We, the people from the most affected [regions], are going to change the conversation in climate negotiations and lead a just recovery plan that benefits people and not the pockets of our government\".\nIn a video interview, the feisty and outspoken young campaigner made it clear that she is no fan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \n\"Mr Modi has convinced everybody that everything he is doing is good. There are so many questionable things about his governance. Not just in terms of equal rights but environmental rights or human rights.\"\n\"My parents support him, I know.\"\nHer friends describe Ms Ravi as a bright student, who won debates in college, where she graduated in business administration with a specialisation in finance. Like many young people of her generation, she loves Bollywood songs, binge-watches Netflix shows, loves cooking and pampers her dog. She plans on doing a masters in conservation: her role model is the world-famous conservation activist, Jane Goodall.\nMs Ravi's friends and co-workers say she is a \"funny, goofy girl\" who is often late to events. \"We get irritated but we never say anything to her because she is so passionate about what she does,\" a friend said.\nThe website of the Bangalore-based food company where she works mentions her as the \"youngest member\" who joined as an intern and then came on \"full time to work her magic on our customers by leading the company's direct-to-consumer efforts\". \nOn social media, Ms Ravi has posted about Olive Ridley turtles, doing away with plastic and posed for pictures with her kitten and her dog. A Harry Potter fan, she has also shared pictures of Evanna Lynch. On Facebook, she calls herself a \"carrot enthusiast\". On Instagram, she describes herself as \"climate worried.\" \n Her profile says: \"People united will never be defeated.\"\nWith additional reporting by Imran Qureshi in Bangalore"

      "tags": "Israel,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More data from Israel's vaccination programme is suggesting the Pfizer jab prevents 94% of symptomatic infections. \nThis indicates the vaccine is performing just as well in a larger population as it did in the clinical trials. \nIt is proving highly effective at preventing illness and severe disease among all age groups, according to public health doctor Prof Hagai Levine. \n\"High vaccination coverage of the most susceptible groups\" was key, he said. \nIsrael's largest health fund Clalit looked at positive tests in 600,000 vaccinated people and the same number of unvaccinated people, matched by age and health status. \nIt found 94% fewer infections among the vaccinated group.\nThis was based on test results in people's medical records, usually taken if they had symptoms or were a close contact of someone who had tested positive.\nAnd the vaccine prevented almost all cases of serious illness.\nThis pattern was the same in all age groups - including the over-70s, who may have been under-represented in clinical trials.\nThe data has not yet been formally published. \nBut it \"sends a message to other countries such as the UK\" about the usefulness of the vaccine, said Prof Levine, and the need to get \"very high\" coverage of the groups most likely to become very ill from the virus. \nHe said he could not put a number on what proportion of the population would need to be immunised before restrictions could ease.\n\"We still don't know what the impact is on transmission,\" he said. \nBut we can say that, at least, \"the vaccine is useful for personal protection\", he added.\nProf Eran Segal, who is analysing data for the Israeli Ministry of Health, suggested Israel had to vaccinate 80% of its over-60s before learning of its effect on Covid-19 cases. \nIsrael is the first country in the world to see the impact of its vaccination programme, but it took significant population coverage and several weeks to reach this milestone. \nGreater falls were seen in the over-60s who were vaccinated first and in cities that vaccinated their populations earlier - patterns not seen in earlier lockdowns. This provides strong evidence it was the vaccine, and not just the lockdown, driving down cases.\nBut Prof Segal warned falls had happened more slowly than expected, possibly because of the effect of the UK variant, which has become the dominant strain in Israel. \nAnd he cautioned that, even with the \"very rapid pace\" of Israel's vaccination programme, there were still tens of thousands of people who were unprotected and could become severely ill if infected.\n\"We still have to exit our lockdown very cautiously,\" he said, or risk large numbers of people being hospitalised. \nIsrael has been experiencing a significant wave of infection and remains under strict measures - but with everyone over the age of 16 now entitled to get vaccine, the hope is at least the education system could be reopened too. \nThe country has also been met with criticism over questions about who should provide vaccines to the Palestinian territories.\nIsrael has only just also started to transfer some doses to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, so that vaccinations can begin for front-line health workers.\nMeanwhile it has given the full two doses to a quarter of its resident population.

The cost covers the hotel stay, transport and testing.\nIn Scotland, the rule to stay in a hotel applies to travellers arriving directly by air from all countries outside the Common Travel Area (the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) - rather than just those from the list of 33 countries.\nOne traveller newly quarantining at the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel near Heathrow Airport said he was \"feeling sad\" at the prospect of isolating for 10 days.\nRoger Goncalves, 23, from Belo Horizonte in Brazil, said: \"I did my test for coronavirus. The test was negative. Why do I need to stay in my room for 10 days?\"\nMr Goncalves, a delivery driver who lives in London, flew into the capital from Sao Paolo, via Madrid in Spain because he needed to come back to work.\nHe said the \u00a31,750 cost of his stay was \"too high\" and \"crazy for 10 days\", but described his room as \"not bad\" and said he had been told food will be left at his door.\nMeanwhile, Zari Tadayon, 66, from north London, faces spending her birthday in isolation after flying in from Dubai, via Frankfurt.\nAsked how she felt about spending 10 days in isolation, she said: \"I feel horrible because I live here, I have my own individual home, and also I have some medical issues which I was hoping they would consider.\n\"I'm not prepared. I didn't bring books and stuff.\"\nShe added that she wasn't feeling happy \"because tomorrow is my birthday and I would have wanted to be with my family... those are the rules, what can you do?\"\nIn Scotland, the first passenger to go into quarantine hotel was Chun Wong, an American medical worker, who had travelled from America to Edinburgh via Dublin with his eight-year-old daughter Kiernan - to join his wife in Fife.\nHe told the BBC he would do \"whatever it takes\" to stay, adding: \"Even though I got my Covid shot already, whatever it takes to make everybody safe.\"\nHowever, he and his daughter were later allowed to leave the hotel after it was realised that as they had arrived from the US - which is not on the red list - via Dublin, which is in the Common Travel Area, they were allowed to isolate at home instead.\nThe government has defended the arrangements after questions were raised about the ability of passengers from \"red list\" countries to mingle with other travellers on flights and at airports before being moved to their accommodation.\nA spokesman said: \"Separation cannot always be easily implemented at airports, but every step is taken to reduce risks and to minimise any potential for passenger interaction, including Covid-19 tests prior to departure and routine protocols like mandatory mask wearing, social distances and regular cleaning of facilities.\n\"A number of airports, including Britain's busiest airport, Heathrow, have introduced additional measures to segregate passengers from red list destinations ahead of the immigration hall to limit the possibility of mixing.\"\nEarlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Times Radio the hotel quarantine system had been operating \"smoothly\" since it came into force at 04:00 GMT on Monday.\nMeanwhile, Heathrow said in a statement that the measures had come into effect \"successfully\", and it would continue to monitor whether Border Force had adequate resource and processes \"to avoid unacceptable waiting times and compromising the safety of passengers\". \nIt comes after the airport warned of delays caused by the rules.\nAre you travelling to the UK from a \"red list\" location? Tell us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\nHeathrow Airport is one of five in England where people requiring hotel quarantine can enter the UK and is expected to receive the largest number of passengers. The other four are Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough.\nPassengers arriving at London's Heathrow Airport on Monday were escorted by security personnel to coaches, which took them to nearby hotels, including the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel.\nAt Birmingham Airport, there were just four flights touching down on Monday, including a plane from Istanbul with about 100 passengers, some of whom are believed to be from a red list country.\nThe government says it has struck deals with 16 hotels so far, providing 4,963 rooms for the new quarantine system, with a further 58,000 rooms currently on standby.\nPeople travelling from red list countries to Wales and Northern Ireland will be required to book and pay for quarantine in England, as neither destination has any direct international flights.\nAny passenger required to stay in a quarantine hotel in England needs to reserve a room online in advance using a government portal.\nThe additional rate for one extra adult or a child aged over 12 is \u00a3650, and for a child aged five to 12 it is \u00a3325. \nThose who fail to quarantine in such hotels face fines of \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000, while anyone who lies on their passenger locator form about having been in a country on the red list faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years.\nAsked at a No 10 briefing on Monday what would happen if someone staying in a hotel had to extend their stay due to a positive test, Prime Minister Boris Johnson stressed it was currently illegal to travel abroad for holidays and that people going into quarantine should be able to \"cover their costs\".\nA new testing regime for all travellers arriving in England has also started, with two tests required during the quarantine process.\nThey will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The tests, conducted by NHS Test and Trace, will cost travellers \u00a3210.\nThose who do not take the tests could face a \u00a32,000 fine.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the nation had decided to adopt stricter rules \"because we think it is important to go as far as we can\".\nAt her daily Covid briefing, she also stressed a common approach to travel restrictions across the four nations of the UK would be \"preferable\" and she said Scottish ministers would try to persuade the UK government \"to adopt more comprehensive measures\".\nWelsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said he also wanted to see \"a stronger set of defences at our borders\" and described the UK government's measures as \"the bare minimum of what needs to be done\".\nLast week, Labour's shadow health secretary said the public wanted the government to \"go further\" on border quarantine measures.\nTravellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry.\nAnd all travellers - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 10 days when they get to the UK.\nLockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons.

      "text": "The Masked Singer finale was watched by an average audience of 8.6 million viewers, overnight figures show.\nThat's the biggest live TV audience for any programme so far this year, outside of news and sport.\nThe series culminated on Saturday with a pregnant Joss Stone, who had been cunningly disguised as Sausage, revealed as this year's winner.\nThe final attracted 2.2m more viewers than last year's, which saw Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud triumph.\nSaturday's finale also more than doubled the audience of the first episode of this series.\nWhen asked why she decided to take part in the show, UK soul singer Stone said: \"Why not? Life can be too serious.\"\n\"We should just dress up in chips and sausage and have a sing-song!\" she added.\nThe Telegraph's Michael Hogan described this year's final as \"a banger\" - sausage pun no doubt intended. \n\"It made for an irresistibly compelling climax to the reality phenomenon,\" he wrote. \"This Saturday night hit has been a welcome burst of day-glo entertainment during a grey winter.\"\nThe whole series was recorded last September, and it was \"impressive\" therefore, Hogan noted, how the makers kept the big reveal so secret.\n\"The lack of tabloid leaks or social media spoilers is testament to how, even in our age of instant information, audiences still appreciate a surprise,\" he said.\nThe paper also pointed out how the \"trashily addictive success\" had already been renewed for a third series, with a sister show, The Masked Dancer, on the way too.\nJames Jackson of The Times also opted for four stars. He noted how \"the phenomenal success\" of the show has \"no doubt been a symptom of enforced confinement\".\n\"The image of a bored nation slumped recumbent, accepting any imbecilic nonsense, is hard to disregard,\" he wrote. \"But perhaps this show really is - whisper it - great, silly entertainment in the grand tradition of music hall.\"\nHe added that while the programme probably \"won't have done much for the nation's IQ\", it will have made for \"a happy living room\" for many families. \"You could hardly ask for more during our winter of discontent.\"\nThe Evening Standard's Katie Rosseinsky, meanwhile, labelled The Masked Singer as \"one of the most chaotic but ingenious formats ever to grace the weekend TV schedule.\"\nThe Masked Singer originated in South Korea and has also since been a hit on US TV.\nIt sees famous contestants don elaborate costumes and sing in front of a celebrity panel, who attempt to guess their identity. \nJonathan Ross, Rita Ora, Mo Gilligan and Davina McCall made up the panel for this series, and were joined by Roberts, last year's winner, for the final.\nThe five detectives were tasked with guessing the identities of the three remaining singers, before a small socially-distanced studio audience voted on the winner.\nHidden under the sausage-and-fries costume was Stone, who managed to fool all of the judges throughout, with renditions of Whitney Houston's I Wanna Dance With Somebody and Rise Up by Andra Day.\nRoberts was convinced Sausage was actually former X-Factor contestant Stacey Solomon. Others had said they thought it was Sheridan Smith, which the actress and singer herself appeared to enjoy on Twitter.\n\"I do very much love eating chips & sausage with gravy,\" she joked.\nStone - not Smith then - beat the Robin and Badger characters to the crown. The bird turned out to be Aston Merrygold from the boyband JLS, who finished third. Badger, meanwhile, was un-masked as the Grammy-winning US singer Ne-Yo, who attempted to put everyone off the scent with a mockney accent.\nITV's managing director Kevin Lygo said in a statement: \"In these testing times, we're delighted that The Masked Singer has brought some escapist joy and light relief to so many viewers at home.\n\"At the end of a long week in lockdown we're all coming together and trying to guess who's dressed as a giant sausage, and quite frankly, it's been a brilliantly entertaining tonic.\"\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Children,Early education,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children,Mental health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "For children under the age of five, Covid restrictions have been in place for a big chunk of their lives. For the very youngest, daily life has never been Covid-free.\nWhat should parents and carers of young children be concerned about? Five experts offer advice and support. \nFor most families with a new baby, there's no need to worry, Alison Morton, of the Institute of Health Visiting, says.\n\"In those first few months, parents are babies' most favourite things,\" she says.\n\"Sitting on your lap, taking turns, mimicking - they're very happy with just that.\"\nSally Hogg, from the Parent-Infant Foundation, which supports teams working with new parents, agrees. \n\"You don't go to a parent-and-baby group with a three-month-old because baby needs to learn to sing,\" she says.\n\"It's because you need the company and positive baby-friendly ideas.\n\"To get those things in lockdown, you might chat on the phone with friends, family and other parents or join groups online.\"\nAs older babies become more aware of the world around them, Alison says, they remember someone or something exists, such as a parent, even when they can't see them. \n\"As a result, babies experience separation anxiety and may get upset if they're left with unfamiliar people. \n\"This is totally normal and nothing to do with any lack of socialisation because of Covid.\"\nOnce they're more inquisitive and confident, toddlers want to play with other youngsters.\n\"If your child has no older siblings, then clearly - because of Covid - those contacts will be restricted,\" Alison says. \n\"But studies of children with restricted play - like those in hospital long-term - found youngsters adapted and found other ways to play.\"\nMost children should recover long-term, even though the pandemic has changed play, she says.\nAnd if you're a single parent, or know one, you can always \"bubble\" with them.\nUse your daily home routine to help your child develop.\nLearning through play\n\"Be imaginative,\" paediatric registrar Dr Rakhee Shah, at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, says.\n\"Make laundry-folding into a game\n\"Get them to pick out specific colours or items. \n\"Young children love to copy and mimic family life.\"\nThrough domestic role-play children learn to:\nAnd play has become Covid-related, Alison says, \"doing handwashing and putting face masks on Teddy\".\nEveryday routine \nHave a regular snack time, walk time and reading time, Alison says.\n\"People worry about children looking at screens too much,\" Dr Bernadka Dubicka, who chairs the child-and-adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says. \n\"But they've been lockdown lifesavers.\" \nThere should be balance, though.\n\"Have meals together, make eye contact and keep screens out of bedrooms,\" Bernadka says.\nBut how do you persuade two-year-olds to engage in a Zoom conversation with Grandma and Grandad?\n\"Young children will chat for a bit, then just wander off,\" Sally says. \n\"But you can share stories and play games.\n\"Get grandparents to ask them to find things, a certain toy or something that's a specific colour.\"\nGet outside\nAll our experts spoke of the value of going out to play. \nParks and playgrounds remain open. \nEngland's current lockdown restrictions allow under-fives to go with you when you meet someone you don't live with for exercise. \nIn Wales, children aged 10 or below can accompany you. \nAnd in Scotland, the age limit is 11.\nRules by nation:\nNurseries also remain open. \nAlthough, in Scotland only key-worker children can attend.\n\"Sending a child to nursery must be a parent's individual decision,\" Dr Paul Ramchandani, Lego professor of play in education, development and learning, at Cambridge University, says.\n\"I'd say it depends on local Covid levels and how comfortable you feel.\"  \nWatch out for persistent changes in their behaviour.\nFor example, if they:\n\"Stress in very young children can often present with physical symptoms,\" Bernadka says. \n\"They'll describe stomach pains, because they don't have the verbal skills to express themselves accurately.\"\nHealth-visitor appointments were cut when the pandemic started.\nAnd many became online only.\nHealth-visiting services have now restarted.\nBut in practice, Alison says, there are huge local variations. \n\"There's particular worry for small premature babies and for others where conditions like cerebral palsy have been missed,\" she says. \n\"It's been up to parents to acknowledge problems. \n\"Many have been anxious about asking for help.\"\nIf you're concerned about your child, contact your GP, midwife or health visitor.\nParents are anxious, Alison says. \n\"But it's important to know most children are going to be fine,\" she says.\n\"And you can ask for help if you're worried.\"\nPaul agrees. \n\"It's normal to feel extra stressed,\" he says.\n\"Family life has adapted.\n\"But chances are you're still being a good-enough parent.\"\nParent and child mental-health problems go hand-in-hand, Bernadka says. \n\"If more adults are struggling, then it's not going to have a positive impact on children,\" she says.\nAnd those parents need to find help for themselves first.\nSigns you might be struggling include:\nIn a recent survey of pregnancy and young children's providers, by the First 1001 Days Movement, nearly all (98%) said parental anxiety or depression had affected babies. \n\"Not everyone needs to be labelled with a mental-health problem,\" Alison says. \n\"Parents often just lack confidence.\"\n\"I've worked with hundreds of new mums who've had a wobble and needed ideas or a bit of extra support. \n\"Everything's soon back to normal.\"\nSpeak to your partner, family or friends first if you can.\nBut professional advice is available.\nHealth visitors would rather hear from people early, Alison says, before more serious conditions, such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and post-natal depression, develop.\nIn an Ofsted survey of 208 nurseries in England, most reported children returning after the spring 2020 lockdown had fallen behind in personal, social and emotional development. \nSome returned less confident, while others were using nappies and dummies at an older age than nursery staff would expect.\nBut Paul offers words of reassurance. \n\"There are very few developmental goals which most children won't be able to catch up with,\" he says.\nOur experts agree youngsters with special needs or living in poverty or homes where there's conflict or abuse could have longer-term issues and need more support.\nIn the first lockdown, babies and toddlers from disadvantaged backgrounds, according to university researchers in Oxford, missed out on activities to support their development, compared with those with more highly educated and well paid parents.\nThe government says 4.2 million children were living in poverty in 2020. \nBut it's \"committed to making sure every child gets the best start in life\" and has targeted support by:\n\"We know the biggest driver for mental-health problems is poverty,\" Bernadka says. \n\"But for all children, one of the most important things that parents can do is just to be there for their child.\""

She reportedly answered questions about legal arrangements and representation. \nHer next court appearance is scheduled to take place on 1 March. \nZaw Min Tun said that Ms Suu Kyi had been confined to her home for her own safety, and that she was \"comfortable and healthy\".\nHe used the news conference to accuse anti-coup protesters of violence and intimidation against the security forces. \nA police officer had been wounded by \"lawless actions\" and had later died from his injuries, he said.\nProtesters have clashed with security officers and there have been recent reports of police using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. \nOne protester remains in a critical condition after being shot in the head on 9 February.\nMya Thwe Thwe Khaing, 19, was hurt while taking part in a protest - though it is not clear exactly what she was hit by. Rights groups say her wound is consistent with one from live ammunition. \nZaw Min Tun said some measures taken to control crowds of protesters were in response to bricks being thrown at police. \nThe UN has warned Myanmar's military - which on Monday announced penalties of up to 20 years in prison for those opposing the coup leaders - that there would be \"severe consequences\" for any brutal suppression of the ongoing anti-coup protests there.\nMeanwhile, access to the internet in Myanmar was restored on Tuesday morning after it had been cut off for a second night.\nThe junta has been regularly blocking the web to try to stifle dissent since the coup began.\nOn Saturday, the military gave itself the power to make arrests, carry out searches and hold people for more than 24 hours without a court ruling, while telling journalists not to describe the military's takeover as a coup.\nProtesters were out again early on Tuesday, with crowds gathering in cities including Yangon and Mandalay. BBC Burmese reports monks were seen heading out onto the streets of Yangon in a mostly peaceful scene. \nHuge queues have formed at banks running out of cash as people fearing further instability rush to withdraw money, reports the BBC's Jonathan Head.\nTesting for Covid-19 has also collapsed because health workers are staying away from hospitals.\nOutside Yangon, protesters were pictured lying down on rail tracks in an attempt to disrupt services. According to Reuters, train services between Yangon and the southern city of Mawlamyine were blocked as a result. \nThe turnout at recent protests appeared to have grown smaller than at the ones seen last week, which saw tens of thousands of people in attendance, as the military has stepped up its presence. \nWith the reports of violent clashes, residents in several cities are reported to have formed night-watch groups to deter mobs rumoured to have been dispatched by the military to cause unrest."

      "tags": "Ebola virus,Guinea",
      "text": "Guinea has officially declared that it is dealing with an Ebola epidemic after the deaths of at least three people from the virus.\nThey - and four others - fell ill with diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding after attending the burial of a nurse.\nNewly developed vaccines will be acquired through the World Health Organization (WHO), officials said.\nBetween 2013 and 2016 more than 11,000 people died in the West Africa Ebola epidemic, which began in Guinea.\nIn response to that epidemic, which mainly affected Guinea and its neighbours Liberia and Sierra Leone, several vaccines were trialled, which have since been successfully used to fight outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\"The WHO is on full alert and is in contact with the manufacturer [of a vaccine] to ensure the necessary doses are made available as quickly as possible to help fight back,\" the AFP news agency quotes Alfred George Ki-Zerbo, the WHO representative in Guinea, as saying.\nAn Ebola vaccine was first trialled over four months in 2015 in Guinea - and drugs that can increase the survival rate of patients have also been developed in recent years. \nA nurse who worked a health centre in Gouek\u00e9, near the south-eastern city of Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9, died on 28 January and her funeral was held four days later.\nCommunity funerals, where people help wash the body of the person who has died, can be a key way of spreading Ebola in the earlier stages of an outbreak.\nThe bodies of victims are particularly toxic. The incubation period can last from two days to three weeks.\nEbola jumps to humans from infected animals, such as chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope. Bushmeat - non-domesticated forest animals hunted for human consumption - is thought to be the natural reservoir of the Ebola virus.\nIt then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments. \nAll those infected at the funeral of the nurse were over the age of 25, health officials say.\nFollowing a crisis meeting on Sunday, the health ministry said all cases had been isolated, contact tracing was ongoing and a treatment centre was to be set up in Gouek\u00e9.\nThis new outbreak is in roughly the same area where the epidemic began in December 2013.\nGiven the cross border trade between Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and their relatively weak healthcare systems, there is concern the outbreak could spread.\nLiberia's President George Weah has put the health authorities on heightened alert.\nThe BBC's Umaru Fofana in Sierra Leone says there is far more fear of Ebola in the country than Covid-19.\nHe says the existence of new vaccines does provide some sense of relief - there is a global emergency stockpile of 500,000, made available through Gavi, the international vaccine alliance.\nThe three countries have a joint population of 22.5 million, prompting concerns that manufacturers would have little time to produce more if needed at a time when Covid vaccines are their preoccupation, our reporter says.\nExperts say containment is key to fighting the disease. During the 2015 trial in Guinea - 100 patients were identified and then close contacts were either vaccinated immediately, or three weeks later. In the 2,014 close contacts who were vaccinated immediately there were no subsequent cases of Ebola.\nFrom Ebola survivor to trainee doctor"

      "text": "A return to lockdown in Wales cannot be ruled once the current restrictions are lifted, the health minister has warned.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK government's plan to move England out of lockdown would be \"cautious but irreversible\". \nBut Vaughan Gething said ministers would have a \"responsibility to act\" if there was an upswing in the virus.\nA revised plan out of Wales' lockdown, which began in December, is expected in the next few days.\nWelsh cabinet ministers are considering the latest scientific evidence this week before any changes to restrictions are announced on Friday. \nBut First Minister Mark Drakeford has suggested any initial easing may be limited.\nHe said at the weekend that \"cautious\" talks had begun on Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter.\nThe Welsh Conservatives called for consideration to be given to a reopening of gyms, while Plaid Cymru said easing lockdown should be based on data, rather than dates.\nMr Johnson is due to announce his road map for ending restrictions next Monday.\nHe told reporters the plan would include target dates for changes \"if we possibly can\", but warned high rates of infection could lead to delays.\nHe added: \"So we have got to be very prudent and what we want to see is progress that is cautious but irreversible. I think that is what the public, people up and down the country, want to see.\"\nAt Monday's press conference, Mr Gething warned there was a \"danger\" of setting out \"absolutes\" by talking about whether lockdown lifting was \"irreversible\".\n\"If we make cautious steps outwards, then it will still very much feel like a form of lockdown for most people, because we're not going to be returning straight away to what we thought of as our normal lives just over a year ago. \n\"So yes we don't want to see a return to having to introduce more restrictions, but I wouldn't say we can give a cast iron guarantee that would never happen.\" \nMr Gething said if a number of restrictions were removed but there was then a \"significant upswing\" in the virus - such as a new variant - then ministers \"would have a responsibility to act\".\nHe added that the majority of people would rather see lockdown rules continue until it is safe to ease them.\nMinisters are looking at \"small things\" to ease out of lockdown, he said, but would not speculate on what measures were being discussed. \nMeanwhile, Mr Gething said the next stage of the vaccine programme began on Monday.\nHe said appointments would be offered to people aged 65 to 69, people aged 16 to 69 with an underlying health condition, younger adults in residential care and unpaid carers.\nAn expected drop in the supply of vaccines to Wales will not delay anybody's second dose appointment, he added.\nThe Welsh Government's lockdown easing roadmap has to be \"built around data not dates\", said the Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.\n\"That's absolutely critical, so you can't set an arbitrary date\", he said, adding there should be a \"phased step by step approach rather than all at once\".\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said it was right to be cautious over easing lockdown restrictions, but he hoped gyms could be reopened \"in an organised manner\".\n\"I'd like to see some sort of consideration around gyms being allowed to come forward in an organised manner so that people can look to those avenues to help them with their well-being\"."

      "tags": "Indian farmers protest 2020,Bangalore,India,Greta Thunberg",
      "text": "The arrest of 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling it an attack on free speech. \nShe was arrested on Saturday over a shared document to help farmers protest against new agricultural laws.\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal described her arrest as an \"unprecedented attack on democracy\". \nSeveral activists and journalists have also been arrested in recent weeks in connection with the protests. \nNow in their third month, the protests have come to represent one of the biggest challenges faced by prime minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. \nPolice said Ms Ravi was a \"key conspirator\" in the \"formulation and dissemination\" of the document - a protest \"toolkit\". \nThey said Ms Ravi, one of the founders of the Indian branch of the Fridays for Future climate strike, was an editor of the document and had shared it with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. \n\"I did not make the toolkit. We wanted to support the farmers. I edited two lines on 3 February,\" Ms Ravi told the court, according to the NDTV news site.\nMr Kejriwal has joined several prominent voices online, including activists, journalists and opposition politicians (such as former finance minister P Chidambaram), all of whom appear both shocked and furious over the arrest. \nMs Ravi, who lives in the southern city of Bangalore, was flown to the capital Delhi where she appeared before a magistrate on Sunday. She was sent to judicial custody for five days. \nQuestions have been raised over the fact that Ms Ravi did not have a lawyer during her hearing - a fact which criminal lawyer Rebecca John, who has been tracking the case, described as \"a shocking abdication of judicial duties\" in a Facebook post. \n\"If the accused was not being represented by counsel at the time of the hearing, the magistrate should have waited till her counsel arrived or in the alternate, provided her with legal aid,\" Ms John wrote. \nIt's unclear still what Ms Ravi is being charged with, but many fear she is being held under a colonial-era sedition law that has been used in recent arrests against journalists. \nPeople charged under the draconian law have to surrender their passports, are not eligible for government jobs and must produce themselves in the court as and when required. \nThe Delhi police, who arrested Ms Ravi, invoked the same law earlier this month when they said they were investigating the toolkit. They said it suggested a conspiracy in the run up to a huge rally on 26 January, which saw protesting farmers clash with police. \nThe toolkit was hugely publicised about two weeks ago when Ms Thunberg tweeted it, voicing her support for protesting farmers.\nThe farmers are seeking the repeal of new agriculture reform laws that will further open up India's farming sector to corporate buyers and investment. \nThe government, which has offered to suspend the laws, says they will improve farming incomes. But farmers, who want nothing short of a complete withdrawal, say the opposite will happen. They fear the laws will threaten decades-old concessions guaranteed by the government and leave them vulnerable to the private market. \nMs Ravi's arrest is being seen by many as an intimidation tactic by the federal government, which oversees the Delhi police. \n\"This is a new low, even for India,\" environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman told the BBC. \"These are the kinds of young people we should be celebrating, and not jailing.\"\nHe described her as \"conscientious, outspoken youngster who has constantly defended and fought for India's rights on the global stage\" on the issue of climate change. \nHe said this runs contrary to PM Modi's efforts to enlist youth in cleaning up cities as part of his flagship Swachh Bharat (Clean India) Campaign\nMy Jayaraman added that it sent a clear message to young people that \"they should restrict themselves to picking up garbage on the streets or planting trees, and not come into the arena of policy-making\". \nFarmers' group Samyukta Kisan Morcha, one of the main groups behind the protests, expressed their support for Ms Ravi and demanded her release. \nSupport has poured in from everywhere, including Indian film actor Siddharth, Canadian poet Rupi Kaur and US Vice President Kamala Harris's niece Meena Harris.

      "tags": "Companies,Wetherspoons,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Hospitality industry,Pubs",
      "text": "The chairman of JD Wetherspoon is calling for pubs to reopen at the same time as non-essential shops.\nTim Martin warned that the pub industry was \"on its knees\" and needed to reopen to save jobs.\nHe said pubs made a massive contribution to the economy, with the Wetherspoons chain paying about \u00a310 of tax for every pound of profit it made.\nHis call comes after the boss of rival pub chain Young's said pubs should be reopened by April.\nPubs, bars and restaurants across most of the UK are currently closed, although they can offer takeaway food and drink within certain restrictions. Scientists have said talk of reopening them is premature.\nBut Mr Martin argued that pubs and restaurants were \"Covid-secure environments\", having invested in safety measures such as plastic screens in front of tills, table service-only and floor markings to illustrate one-way systems around pub venues.\n\"Surely it is possible for the hospitality industry to reopen at the same time as non-essential shops, now that a vaccine exists, on the basis of the social distancing and hygiene regulations,\" he said. \nHe also suggested that various lockdown measures imposed on pubs since March last year could spell a \"disaster\" for the public finances.\nIn the financial year to July 2019, before the coronavirus crisis started, JD Wetherspoon, its customers and employees generated \u00a3764m of taxes, he said.\n\"The amount of tax paid by Wetherspoon is replicated, according to the size of the company, throughout the pub industry, and shows just how important pubs are to the economy,\" he said.\nOn Sunday, the chief executive of the Young's pub chain, Patrick Dardis, accused the prime minister of a \"lack of respect\" for the sector and of basing the decision to close pubs on \"unproven\" science - a claim that experts dispute.\nHe said major pub chief executives, including himself, were leaving an industry forum set up by small business minister Paul Scully. He declined to name the executives.\nHe said the industry needed a \"road map\" to reopening with social distancing restrictions in place, but that these should only last for a few months.\nMr Dardis suggested during an interview with the BBC's World at One programme on Monday that pubs should reopen for Easter weekend, \"accepting that there would be social distancing\" measures in place.\nHowever, Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, said talk of reopening pubs by April was premature.\n\"What the executives of pubs need to know is that failure to get it right equals back to square one. And back to square one equals much more pain economically, much more hardship.\"\nHe said people drank alcohol to relax and \"one of the consequences of relaxing is that you drop your guard\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said he is \"optimistic\" he will be able to set out plans on 22 February for a \"cautious\" easing of England's lockdown - despite scientists' warnings against measures being rolled back too quickly.\nOn Saturday, he said \"huge progress\" had been made with the rollout of vaccines, with ministers hopeful that schools can reopen from 8 March.\nAfter this, the government would look to open non-essential shops, followed by the hospitality sector, he said.\nUK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls recently warned that a May restart would be later than had been expected and that there could be \"very little\" left to reopen if closures last that long.\nIndustry figures released last week show the plight the sector is facing, with a net loss of almost 6,000 licensed premises last year, triple the tally in 2019.\nWith the pub and restaurant industry one of the hardest-hit sectors during the pandemic, Wetherspoons last year slumped to its first annual pre-tax loss since 1984.\nMr Martin also sold more than \u00a350m worth of shares in the company in January. \nIt came amid \"significant buying interest\" following a previous share placing announced by Wetherspoons, the company said. Some of those funds will go towards buying new pubs, which it expected to produce higher returns when they are allowed to reopen."

We'll have another update for you this evening.\nPeople aged over 65 in England - along with younger people in at-risk groups - will be the next in line to be offered their coronavirus jabs after the UK government announced it had hit\u00a0its initial target for offering the vaccine to the most vulnerable people, including the over-70s, care home residents and staff and front-line health workers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to confirm later on Monday that 15 million first doses have been received across the UK.\u00a0\nThe UK's latest attempt to stop new variants of coronavirus being imported\u00a0from overseas comes into force today. Any British or Irish citizen arriving in England from one of the 33 \"red list\" countries will be required to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days at their own expense.\u00a0Failure to comply could result in a fine of up to \u00a310,000. Scotland has gone a step further by insisting that anyone arriving from any country will need to go into hotel quarantine. \nWhile most people in the UK say they want to get their Covid vaccine, there are groups out there seeking to exploit people's nervousness about the jab. The BBC's specialist disinformation reporter Marianna Spring has been examining their tactics for the BBC's Panorama programme. It's not just convincing-looking videos of conspiracy theories that are circulating via messaging platforms - research by BBC Monitoring has found a huge increase in followers of social media accounts promoting anti-vaccine material during the pandemic. Read more here about how our volunteer panel was affected by misinformation - and the actions being taken to remove such content from popular internet sites.\nThe Food Standards Agency says there has been a \"concerning rise\" in the number of food businesses operating from people's homes during the various coronavirus lockdowns, with one hygiene expert saying they are \"rank outsiders operating off the radar\", who \"confuse cooking with catering\". Many are failing to register with the authorities, and are therefore not being inspected to ensure they're complying with food hygiene rules. The FSA is urging people to check that whoever is providing takeaway food has a hygiene rating of three or above - and that the business is registered on the official website.\nOne of the things we've learned from the pandemic is that there are lots of different ways to cover your face. And while it's always good to know which one works the best and provides the greatest protection for you and others, the rules on face coverings can also vary from country to country around the world. And now we're also seeing the rise of the \"double-masker\".

      "tags": "Social media,Apps",
      "text": "Controversial social-media app Parler has come back online after more than a month without service. \nThe Twitter-like app was a favourite among supporters of former US President Donald Trump and right-wing conservatives. \nIt was banned from Google and Apple's app stores and Amazon's web-hosting service, after an armed mob broke into the US Capitol building on 6 January.\nBut now, the self-styled free-speech platform says it is \"here to stay\". \nThe app was not available for all users immediately, however.\nAnd users reported their posts from the previous version had vanished from their profiles. \nParler said the plan was to bring the service back online for existing users first, with new users able to sign up in a week's time.\nAnd it was no longer working with a \"big-tech\" provider but was \"built on sustainable, independent technology\". \nDuring its gap in service, the company also sacked vocal chief executive John Matze, replacing him with interim boss Mark Meckler.\n\"We will thrive as the premier social-media platform dedicated to free speech, privacy, and civil dialogue,\" Mr Meckler said.\nAnd the decision of other technology companies to cut ties with Parler had been taken \"by those who desire to silence tens of millions of Americans\". \nWhile users who already have the app downloaded can log in, it is more difficult to install onto phones that did not have it before.\nAndroid users must \"sideload\" the software, meaning it has to be sourced and installed without using Google's Play Store. \nAnd iPhone users trying to reinstall the app or download it for the first time from Apple's App Store are told it is \"not currently available\".\nLate last year, as Twitter banned some Trump supporters and then President Trump himself, Parler soared up the app charts. It had what every fledgling online business seeks, momentum - until it was stopped in its tracks.\nNow it is back, but in a very limited form. It is still unavailable on app stores and with no way yet for new users to sign up. It feels as though its moment has passed - even if its old members do manage to get back online they may find Parler just a little dull. \nThe past - and the evidence of its use to plan the invasion of Congress - has been wiped clean. \nTrue, the Trump acolyte and Fox firebrand Sean Hannity is back, already posting half a dozen Parleys in the first couple of hours. But while he has over five million followers on Twitter, on Parler he's bellowing into a mostly empty space where a few like-minded people nod quietly in agreement. \nWhere's the fun in that?\nThere's probably only one person who could give Parler its mojo back - Donald J Trump. But so far he seems reluctant to show up at a party which feels like it's over.           \nThe app's popularity was in part fuelled by President Trump's supporters, who often claimed \"censorship\" by the largest online platforms. \nThe former president had allegedly been offered a significant stake in the company if he joined, Buzzfeed News reported earlier this month - something rival politicians are now investigating. \nBut he never joined Parler while in power and does not appear to have joined the relaunched version. \nIts main selling point had been light-touch moderation, which it said was to encourage free speech. \nBut Google and Apple banned the app for failing to remove posts they felt had incited violence.\nAnd Amazon pulled its web-hosting service days later for similar reasons.  \nBefore the app was knocked offline, however, hackers said they had managed to access an archive of posts and downloads - more than one million videos and images, including some from the 6 January riots.  \nCarolyn Maloney, who chairs the House oversight committee, has asked the FBI to investigate the role of Parler in the violence at the Capitol.

Saga and P&O have said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. \nThere is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes in England, Scotland or Wales. \nHowever people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. \nThere are still some restrictions in place in Northern Ireland:\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September.\nFace coverings are no longer required by law in England, although the government \"expects and recommends\" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. \nHowever, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets.\nWearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. \nMuseums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. \nHowever, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. \nYou may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. \nBusinesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. \nIndoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue to collect customer contact details. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. \nNightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.\nThe Common Travel Area (CTA) is a term which covers the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \nTravel within the CTA is not considered international travel. \nFully vaccinated adults or under-18s travelling from the UK to other CTA destinations may not need to do any travel-related testing or quarantine on arrival, but the rules do vary, so you need to check before arranging a trip. \nAs long as you've not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days, you do not have to complete a passenger locator form, take any Covid tests or quarantine on your return to the UK.\nForeign travel is allowed, but people must follow different rules about testing and quarantine according to the traffic light status of their destination country. \nVisitors to green-list countries do not need to isolate on their return home. Under-18s and fully vaccinated people returning to the UK from amber-list countries also no longer have to self-isolate on arrival."

      "text": "Schools - including special schools - are not a major source of transmission of coronavirus, the Public Health Agency (PHA) has said.\nThe comments were made in a PHA presentation to education officials and some school principals last week, seen by BBC News NI.\nIt said that school transmission \"does occur but tends to be small scale\".\nThe Northern Ireland Executive is yet to decide if some or all pupils can return to school on Monday 8 March.\nOn Monday, four more Covid-related deaths were announced by the Department of Health, bringing its total since the start of the pandemic to 2,000.\nIn Scotland and Wales, the youngest primary school pupils are due to go back to class on 22 February.\nOn Sunday, Dr Tom Black, the chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, said he was hopeful primary schools could reopen on 8 March.\nBut he said it would be a \"big ask\" to reopen post-primary schools on that date.\nA number of meetings have been taking place between education officials, some principals and union representatives ahead of any decision on schools by the NI Executive, BBC News NI understands.\nAs part of those meetings, a presentation on Covid-19 in schools from the PHA was given.\nIt shows that 190 out of 194 post-primaries have had at least one case of coronavirus in the 2020-21 school year and almost 70% of 792 primary schools.\nHowever, the PHA presentation indicated that schools were not a major source of transmission nor a \"major driver\" of the second wave of Covid-19.\nInstead, cases in schools \"reflect community prevalence\" and as cases fall in the wider community \"we expect to see reducing numbers of positive cases in schools\", said the PHA.\nWhile school transmission does occur, the presentation said, it \"tends to be small scale\".\nAccording to the PHA, children were less affected by Covid-19 in \"prevalence and severity\".\nWhile the agency warns that new coronavirus variants are more infectious in general across all age groups, it said they are not worse in children.\nThe PHA presentation said that non-pharmacological interventions in schools were effective.\nThese include social distancing, hand and respiratory hygiene, children kept in class \"bubbles\", cleaning and the circulation of fresh air.\nDr Joanne McClean, from the PHA, said that the presentation given to reassure staff at special schools that \"while schools are a source of transmission\" they were not at high risk from working in a classroom.\nHowever, she added that the transmission risk in schools was not limited to classrooms, where social distancing and other measures are enforced, but that interactions in and around schools had to be considered.\n\"We know that schools add to that R rate and we're not trying to argue with that,\" she said on The Stephen Nolan Show.\n\"We've all been to schools around entry and exit time - it's around the social gathering that takes place after that.\"\nDr McClean said the risk in classrooms can be controlled by schools and that they had \"done a huge amount of work\" in introducing measures to mitigate transmission.\nBut the \"bit that goes on outside the class\", such as in the morning and afternoon when children are arriving and leaving, is more difficult. \nOne principal told BBC Radio Foyle that schools should return as soon as possible. \n\"Staff are on their knees at the moment,\" said Colin Torrens, principal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry.\n\"Online learning takes an awful lot more preparation, my staff are working from 08:30 right through, some are telling me they are still working at midnight.\nHe added: \"Staff want back to school because the pressure they are under at the moment is tremendous, and I think our children need to get back to school.\"\nSpecial schools have remained open to all pupils since the start of January but the vast majority of pupils in pre-schools, primary schools and post-primaries have been learning remotely.\nThe National Education Union has previously said that a full return to school by all pupils \"may not be possible for some time\".\nThe NI Executive is expected to discuss the return of pupils to schools at their meeting on 18 February but it is not clear if ministers will make a final decision on an 8 March return at that point."

      "text": "A man has been found not guilty of murdering his wife, just days into the first national Covid lockdown.\nAnthony Williams, 70, said he \"just flipped\" and strangled his wife Ruth at their home in Cwmbran, Torfaen.\nWilliams, of Brynglas, Hollybush, denied murdering the 67-year-old in March 2020, but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility.\nA jury at Swansea Crown Court took just over five hours to find the retired factory worker not guilty of murder.\nWilliams will be sentenced on Thursday.\nThe trial heard Williams strangled his wife of 46 years on the morning of 28 March after an argument.\nThe defence said Williams had not slept properly for several nights because of worries over coronavirus, money and his health.\nHe told police he had \"choked the living daylights\" out of Mrs Williams.\nWilliams had been suffering from depression and anxiety in the weeks before he killed his wife, the jury heard, and \"just snapped\" and attacked her when she told him to \"get over it\".\nThe attack began in the bedroom of their house at about 07:00 but continued downstairs after Mrs Williams fled.\nShe was found slumped in the porch of their home with a pair of keys in her hand, which the prosecution said showed she was trying to escape.\nAfter the attack, Williams went to his next door neighbours' house and told them his wife was dead, telling them to \"call the police, I've killed her\".\nThe jury listened to a 999 call where Williams was heard saying: \"She's dead, I've killed her - we had an argument and I've strangled her. You have to come straight away.\"\nShe was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport where she was pronounced dead.\nThe court heard how - while being driven to the police station - Williams told officers: \"It wasn't murder and I didn't mean to murder her.\n\"I just flipped, it wasn't me. I wouldn't hurt a fly, it wasn't me, I'm not like that and I don't know what came over me.\"\nThe court also head from Williams' daughter Emma, who said she told her father she feared he was \"spiralling out of control\".\nMs Williams said her father told her he thought he was going to \"lose the house and not be able to pay the bills\" despite having no mortgage on their house and \u00a3148,000 in savings.\nConsultant psychiatrist Dr Alison Witts said she believed Williams' mental health had dramatically deteriorated after retiring in 2019 and the coronavirus pandemic had made it worse.\nA pathologist found Mrs Williams died from pressure to the neck and had three fractured bones in her neck."

      "text": "People travelling to England from 33 high-risk countries may face suspended flights and long queues at the border, Heathrow Airport has said.\nThe airport said \"good progress\" had been made on a \"number of issues\" with the government's hotel quarantine plan, which comes into force on Monday.\nBut it said it was concerned about whether UK Border Force could \"cope\".\nThe government said it was working closely with airports and hotels to manage any issues that arose.\nFrom Monday, British and Irish citizens and UK residents arriving in England from a \"red list\" country will have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels for 10 days to try to stop new coronavirus variants entering the country.\nThey will have to pay \u00a31,750 for their stay, which covers the cost of the hotel, transport and testing, and book it in advance using a government portal.\nThose who fail to quarantine in such hotels face fines of \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000, while anyone who lies on their passenger locator form about having been in a country on the red list faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years.\nThe \"red list\" mainly consists of countries in South America and Africa, as well as Portugal.\nHeathrow Airport said it had been \"working hard\" with the government to make sure the plan works.\nHowever, in a statement it said \"queues at the border in recent days of almost five hours are totally unacceptable\". \n\"Ministers need to ensure there is adequate resource and effective processes at the border to avoid compromising the safety of passengers and those working at the airport, which could necessitate the suspension of some arriving flights,\" it added.\nThe airport is one of five in England where people requiring hotel quarantine can enter the UK and is expected to receive the largest number of passengers. \nThe other four are Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough Airfield.\nRegulations for the hotel quarantine measures, which come into force from 04:00 GMT on Monday, have been published.\nBut on Friday the Immigration Services Union said its officials had yet to receive guidance on how the system would work. \nThe union said officials still did not know what levels of checks they should be conducting on travellers.\nIt also raised concerns about the safety of security halls.\nAnd the GMB union has warned that \"rushed\" government plans are not thorough enough to make sure workers on the front line in quarantine hotels are protected.\nThe union said security guards were one of the occupations worst hit by Covid deaths, adding that it wanted to meet employers to develop a strategy to better protect workers.\nMeanwhile, a family returning to the UK after four years living in Abu Dhabi said travellers should not be used as \"guinea pigs\", amid confusion over hotel quarantine rules.\nBeckie Morris, 30, planned to repatriate to the UK with husband Matthew and their five-week-old daughter, but they now face a quarantine bill of thousands of pounds if they do.\nThe new mother said there was \"no information\" on the government website about what to do with young children.\nShe said: \"We'd have to arrange all the formula. I don't know what we do about sterilising bottles, or nappies or washing their clothes - there's all this unknown. I tried to reach out, and I know it's still really early days, but there's just no information.\n\"They haven't really laid out what actually happens when you get to that hotel and I don't think that's going to be known until the first person goes in there.\n\"People shouldn't be used as guinea pigs - especially not paying that amount, that is an extortionate amount of money.\"\nA government spokeswoman said: \"Every essential check - from pre-departure testing to the passenger locator form - will help prevent the importing of new coronavirus variants into the UK.\n\"We are working closely with airports and hotels to manage any issues that arise and ensure the new process runs as smoothly as possible, and we are clear the safety of all staff and passengers is a priority.\" \nAre you due to arrive in the UK from a \"red list\" country?

      "text": "With children in England back in the classroom, teachers face the massive task of making up for months of missed learning.\nA \u00a3720m package has been announced to help pupils in England catch up - although teachers' unions say more is needed. \nHere are some of the measures which could be used to help pupils.\nThe government has asked schools to consider offering face-to-face learning over the summer holidays this year.\nIt is to provide \u00a3200m to secondary schools to fund summer classes for pupils who need it most, especially those children moving up to Year 7.\nSummer schools with qualified teachers leading small groups can help children make up to four months of academic progress, according to the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF). \nThey need a strong academic element, chief executive Becky Francis says, although sporting and other fun activities can also contribute to children's emotional wellbeing.\nShe adds: \"Staffing summer schools will be a challenge because of burnout among teachers.\"\nThe government's education catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, has said that the idea of summer schools has \"promise\".\nAnd Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she was \"willing to discuss all possibilities\" for keeping schools open over the summer. \nHowever, evidence suggests that disadvantaged pupils, who would benefit the most, are less likely to take up the offer.\nTwo summer school trials run by the EEF saw less than 50% attendance among students in the target group.\nOne-to-one tuition is seen as a proven method of helping children catch up. \nWeekly sessions could help a student make three to six months of academic progress, with particularly large gains in literacy and numeracy among primary-school pupils, according to four recent UK studies.\nThe government is pledging money to an expanded National Tutoring Programme (NTP) for primary and secondary pupils, and an extended tuition fund for 16 to 19-year-olds. \nMore than 100,000 disadvantaged pupils have accessed the service since it began, in November.\nBut the NTP has largely offered online tuition since January, and many of the tutors are university students. \nProf Lee Elliott Major, from the University of Exeter, who first proposed the scheme, early last year, says: \"The evidence is thin about tutoring done online not by professionals.\n\"So the exact impact of the NTP is unclear at the moment.\"\nThe practice of retaking a whole year is common in some countries, such as Germany and the US, but rare in the UK.\nThe Education Policy Institute (EPI) think tank has suggested it could help pupils whose education has fallen behind.\nBut the Association of School and College Leaders says the idea would be practical for a small number of students only.\nLarge-scale repetition would create \"a log-jam in the system\" and have huge knock-on effects on funding for universities.\nThe EEF estimates it would cost \u00a36,000 per pupil per year in England.\nAnd pupils who repeat a year make an average of four months' less academic progress than those at a similar level who continue on to the next school year, research suggests.\nDisadvantaged pupils can benefit from longer school days, US research suggests.\nAnd Robert Halfon, who chairs the Education Select Committee, told BBC News he had suggested the idea as \"a serious solution for the government to consider\" in England. \nThe extra teaching time could be provided by \"civil society instead of teachers\", he says. \nAfter-school clubs cost about \u00a37 a session, the EEF estimates.\nBut adding two extra weeks of school time a year would cost \u00a3260 per primary pupil and \u00a3360 per secondary pupil. \nThere have been calls for extra funding for mental health support for schoolchildren, to help ease their return to the classroom and improve their chances of catching up.\nTeaching staff trained to improve emotional wellbeing can help pupils make substantial attainment progress, EEF research suggests.\nAnd the EPI has proposed \u00a3650m of extra funding for additional school staff and in-school counselling programmes in England.\n\"Remedial wellbeing work will be necessary to achieve [academic] catch-up,\" it says, particularly for disadvantaged pupils."
