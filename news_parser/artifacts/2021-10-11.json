      "title": "Scottish firms raise prices 'at sharpest rate for 22 years'",
      "tags": "Manufacturing,Royal Bank of Scotland,Scotland economy,Employment",
      "text": "Scottish firms raised prices last month at the sharpest rate since at least 1999 in the face of severe inflationary pressures, according to a survey.\nThe latest Royal Bank of Scotland purchasing managers' index (PMI) suggested companies were having to pass on the rising costs of materials, pay, logistics, Covid and Brexit. \nCost burdens were reported to be rising at their quickest rate since 2008.\nRBS said firms raised average charges \"to a degree unseen\" in two decades.\nThe survey was compiled by IHS Markit from a panel of about 500 manufacturers and service providers. \nOn a positive note, the survey found manufacturing and service sector output rose for a seventh straight month.\nHowever, September saw the slowest rate of increase for five months, as a sustained upturn in services was slightly offset by a renewed fall in manufacturing output.\nFor the sixth time in as many months, inflows of new work rose, with respondents linking the latest uplift with strong client demand, in part due to the relaxation of lockdown restrictions. \nAlthough still sharp overall, expansion eased to its slowest rate since April, as sustained growth at services firms was partially offset by a fresh decline in manufacturing order book volumes.\nThe pace of expansion in new business across Scotland was broadly in line with the UK average.\nMeanwhile, the survey highlighted a sustained rise in Scottish private sector employment. Panellists linked the latest upturn in staffing levels to higher workloads. Furthermore, the rate of job creation accelerated to a four-month high and was sharp overall.\nScotland also registered the third-quickest increase in employment across the 12 monitored UK areas in September, behind only London and Wales.\nRBS Scotland board chairman Malcolm Buchanan said Scotland's private sector \"remained on a growth footing\" in September but some momentum had been lost due to fresh reductions in both output and order book volumes at goods producers.\nHe added: \"Although the latest data does indicate a slight slowdown in growth, the third quarter as a whole nonetheless saw to one of the quickest expansions of the private sector on record and it remains in a strong position as we enter the closing months of the year.\"\nColin Borland, director of devolved nations for the Federation of Small Businesses, said currently two-thirds of firms were reporting an increase in running costs compared with this time last year.\nHe added: \"In businesses who have very little, if any, headroom, something has to give. If every ounce of fat has already been trimmed, if every efficiency has been maxed out, then unfortunately you are going to have to look at price rises.\"\nThere's lots to welcome about the latest data on the Scottish economy. The PMI tells us that there's been a sustained recovery out of the winter lockdown. \nJuly to September was one of the strongest quarters for economic growth that we've ever seen. The economy was reopening, and people were out spending.\nGrowth was inevitable, although its strength in early summer surprised some forecasters.\nIt was also a certainty that the pace would slow down. It could not be sustained. \nBut what was less easy to forecast were the combined disruptions that have made price inflation one of the main concerns: Brexit making it uneconomic for some to continue trading across the North Sea, supply shortages, shipping costs and delays, the haulage driver shortage, wage inflation and an energy price boom.\nThese have not worked their way through the system. Price inflation is now being forecast to rise sharply next spring, when the cap on domestic heating costs is due to be raised next, probably by hundreds of pounds for the average gas-heated home.\nGas prices have come down off an exceptional peak, but remain well ahead of the start of this year. Oil prices are continuing to rise. With labour shortages, it seems likely that wage inflation has barely begun.\nThe questions now are how long this is sustained, and will action be required by central banks to rein in price inflation?"

      "title": "Thailand to reopen for some vaccinated visitors on 1 November",
      "text": "Thailand plans to end Covid quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated travellers from at least 10 low-risk nations from 1 November, officials say.\nPM Prayuth Chan-ocha admitted that \"this decision comes with some risk\" - but it is seen as a key step to revive the country's collapsed tourism sector.\nThe 10 nations seen as low risk include the UK, China, Germany and the US.\nThe country has been recording more than 10,000 positive infections daily since July. \nIt has fully vaccinated around 33% of its almost 70 million people. Half the population has received one dose.  \nMr Prayuth said Thailand would also allow entertainment venues to reopen on 1 December and permit alcohol sales.\nHe added that the authorities were planning to open Thailand for more countries on that date.\nMr Prayuth's comments came in a televised address on Monday. \nReferring to visitors from 10 low-risk nations, he stressed that \"when they arrive, they should present a [negative] Covid test... and test once again upon arrival\".\nIf the second test is also negative, any visitor from those countries \"can travel freely like Thais\", the prime minister said.\nBut he warned that the government would act decisively if there were to be a spike in infections or an emergence of a highly contagious variant of Covid-19.\nIt is estimated that Thailand - popular for its sandy beaches and non-stop nightlife - lost about $50bn (\u00a337bn) in tourism revenue in 2020. \nThe economy suffered its deepest contraction in more than two decades as a result of the pandemic.\nThailand was the first country outside China to record a Covid-19 case in January last year. \nIt took the drastic step of sealing its borders in April, effectively killing off a tourist industry accounting for perhaps 20% of GDP, but managed to cut new daily infections to just single figures, one of the best records anywhere. \nThis year though, with the arrival of the Delta variant, infections have soared, from a total of less than 7,000 at the end of 2020, to 1.7 million today. The argument for keeping out foreign visitors to contain Covid became much less persuasive, especially with tourist-related businesses pleading for restrictions to be eased.\nThe success in containing Covid last year had another unforeseen consequence; it led the Thai government to believe it need not rush to order vaccines. The result has been a tardy and at times confused vaccine programme, and a public outcry. \nThe need for some economic good news is in large part what has driven it to start reopening, well before reaching its own declared target of getting 70% of the population vaccinated. \nIt is proceeding cautiously though, with only 10 countries on the list until the end of the year. Like other countries in the region Thailand's health system has limited ICU capacity; in August ICU units in Bangkok were quickly overwhelmed by the number of serious Covid cases.\nIn any case, even with an end to the two week quarantine requirement, a recovery to the 40 million tourists who came in 2019 is unlikely next year, or even the year after.\nJust over 70,000 visitors came into the country in the first eight months of this year, compared with 40 million in the whole of 2019.\nThailand has reported more than 1.7 million confirmed Covid cases since the pandemic began, with nearly 18,000 deaths, according to America's Johns Hopkins University."

      "tags": "Sweden,Nobel Prize,Women",
      "text": "The head of the academy that awards the Nobel Prizes in science has said it will not introduce gender quotas.\nGoran Hansson, head of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said they want people to win \"because they made the most important discovery\".\nSince its inception in 1901, 59 Nobel Prizes have gone to women.\nMaria Ressa was the only woman honoured this year. Marie Curie was the first woman to get the prize - and remains the only woman to get it twice.\n\"It's sad that there are so few women Nobel laureates and it reflects the unfair conditions in society, particularly in years past, but still existing. And there's so much more to do,\" Mr Hansson told the AFP news agency.\n\"We have decided we will not have quotas for gender or ethnicity,\" he said, adding that the decision was \"in line with the spirit of Alfred Nobel's last will\".\nSwedish industrialist and chemist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written in 1895 - a year before his death.\n\"In the end, we will give the prize to those who are found the most worthy, those who have made the most important contributions,\" he said.\nAnd while more women are being recognised now compared to previous decades, Mr Hansson said, that number was increasing \"from a very low level\".\n\"Keep in mind that only about 10% of the professors in natural sciences in western Europe or North America are women, and even lower if you go to East Asia,\" he said.\nHowever, the scientist said they would \"make sure that we have an increasing portion of women scientists being invited to nominate, and we will continue to make sure we have women on our committees - but we need help, and society needs to help here\".\n\"We need different attitudes to women going into sciences... so that they get a chance to make these discoveries that are being awarded,\" he added.\nLast year, scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna became the first two women to share the honour when they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the tools to edit DNA.\nIt was the first time any of the science prizes had been awarded to two women without a male collaborator also listed on the award.\nAt the time, Prof Charpentier said: \"I wish that this will provide a positive message specifically for young girls who would like to follow the path of science... and to show them that women in science can also have an impact with the research they are performing.\"\nShe added that there was \"a clear lack of interest in following a scientific path, which is very worrying\".\nOther notable women to have won the award include child education activist Malala Yousafzai, who was jointly awarded the Peace prize in 2014; virologist Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi, who discovered HIV and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2008; and Toni Morrison, whose work explored the harsh realities of racism in the US, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993.\nMarie Curie was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, winning the Physics award in 1903. She was also the first person, and remains the only woman, to have won multiple Nobel Prizes, after winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911."

      "tags": "Companies,Ofgem,Energy industry,Kwasi Kwarteng,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC.\nIt comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices.\n\"As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up\", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said.\nThe government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers.\nIf an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust.\nMr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's \"number one priority\".\nHowever, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way.\nPeter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis.\nMr McGirr said the firm was in \"deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface\".\nGreen has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers.\nMr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an \"advisory and restructuring\" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks.\n\"We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support\", he added.\nThe company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support.\nMr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall.\nAsked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: \"We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications.\"\nCustomers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas.\nThe price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland.\nMr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year.\nSo far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days.\nIndustry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January.\nBut Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. \nWhen asked if Ofgem was \"asleep at the wheel\" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: \"No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies.  \n\"We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that.\" \nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: \"I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run.\"\nHowever, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust.\n\"If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,\" he added.\nMr Kwarteng also warned many UK households could face a \"very difficult winter\", with fuel prices surging and the \u00a320-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October.  \nThe government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the \"clear and agreed position\". \nThe price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. \nWhen fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs.\nRead more about the next best steps to take here.\nMr Brearley said the industry had seen \"an unprecedented rise in gas prices\".\n\"They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,\" he added.\nThe government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources \"that can more than meet demand\".\nHowever, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France.\nThe International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying \"it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels\", in preparation for the winter.\nIt added: \"Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level.\n\"This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market.\"\nStacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity.\nShe saved \u00a3300 - or so she thought. \nHer new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year.\n\"It is just like watching the meter go up and up,\" she says. \"I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.\""

      "text": "People in Wales now need an NHS Covid pass to be able to legally attend big events or nightclubs.\nThey are compulsory for over-18s, and show people have either tested negative on a lateral flow test or are fully vaccinated against Covid.\nWales' rugby game against New Zealand on 30 October will be one of the first mass events to require Covid passes.\nSome nightclub bosses said they felt \"singled out\" by the rules, but other people said they felt reassured.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the new scheme was \"vulnerable to abuse\" but the \"huge bulk of people\" will follow the new rules.\nAsked if people could falsify their lateral flow tests, Mr Drakeford said: \"It is vulnerable to people who want to abuse the system but that's why the law is there.\"\n\"I am quite sure the huge bulk of people will use the lateral flow test in the correct way,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain programme.\nHe also rejected claims the new Covid pass was a financial burden for businesses, adding: \"Nightclubs already have to check people for their age. \n\"I don't think the cost issue is a very significant one here.\"\nIn its autumn and winter plan Mr Drakeford's government has not ruled out extending the scheme if further action is needed to tackle Covid rates.\nHe suggested that could include using passes when going to care homes or visiting hospitals.\n\"If numbers in the community continue to rise... being able to show a Covid pass if you were going into a care home might be an extra defence,\" he said.\nWelsh Education Minister Jeremy Miles told BBC Politics Wales that public services were expected to face \"significant pressure\" this winter, and the pass would cut transmission of the virus.\nThe Senedd voted on the passes last Tuesday - a vote the Welsh government said will not be repeated, despite it passing by just one vote.\nAnyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass.\nThey are compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter:\nThe Welsh government says any venue that can serve alcohol, is open between midnight and 0500, and where music is provided for dancing will need to check for passes.\nThat means it could cover other venues not traditionally considered nightclubs which have a late licence.\nVenues can either apply the pass rules from when they open their doors, or when they open their dancefloor.\nNegative tests will be self-certified but the Welsh government plans to make it illegal to fake a negative test.\nLarge events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends.\nThe NHS Covid Pass is available digitally but you need to register for an NHS login via the website.\nYou need to upload a photo of your ID. That can be a passport, full UK driving licence or full European driving licence. \nThis allows you to produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, computer or laptop.\nYour NHS Covid Pass includes a barcode. The expiry date refers to the barcode and will update automatically. It does not apply to your vaccination status.\nIn Wales, you cannot get the pass via the NHS app, as this is only valid in England.\nWales is not the first nation to introduce such a pass.\nIn France, people have had to prove they are fully vaccinated, have recently tested negative or recently recovered from Covid with a \"health pass\". That must be produced on entering cafes, restaurants or public transport.\nScotland is the only other UK nation to use them after they were introduced on 1 October.\nOne nightclub and bar in Denbighshire has decided to close earlier in the evening rather than dealing with the \"complexity\" of implementing Covid passes.\nMike Murray, manager of Bar 236 in Prestatyn, said the club used to stay open past midnight with live music and DJs, but would need extra staffing to police the system, and it was not worth it financially.  \n\"We always weighed up the situation, following the government guidelines to make it a safe and comfortable environment to drink in.\n\"We've even been keeping masks on and doing table service after the government advice changed because what's wrong with doing it a little longer to keep people comfortable?\"\nHe added he received a lack of guidance from Welsh government as to \"what passes would look like or where we could get one from if people asked\". \n\"We want people to come in and let common sense prevail: If you're unwell, don't come to the bar.\"\nThe decision to introduce Covid passes has very much split opinion, which was evident in the Senedd vote.\nGuto Brychan, chief executive of Cardiff music venue Clwb Ifor Bach, said the timing made things difficult as students had just returned to university and it is \"the busiest time of year\".\nHe said this was made more difficult because many students are from outside Wales and may not understand the law.\nMr Brychan said: \"One of the main concerns as well is that the Covid pass isn't uniform across the whole of the hospitality industry.\n\"It seems to have been specifically designed to target places that supply dancing or culture, but I'd argue the high risk activity here is the consumption of alcohol, not dancing.\n\"There'll be plenty of venues open as late as ourselves that will have as many people in them but won't have the restrictions that we have in place.\"\nLidi Staffurth is one of thousands of people who have been shielding during the pandemic due to a condition which makes them extremely vulnerable to Covid-19.\nShe said Covid passes would help reassure people who might feel uncertain about attending large events, adding she felt she had her \"freedom back\".\nMs Staffurth labelled it a \"brilliant idea\", not least because there are three young people in her family.\n\"If they're in large groups then we'll know they're around people who are double vaccinated, or at least free from Covid,\" she said.\n\"I think it's a fantastic idea and for a society at large it means people are looking after each other. \n\"I think some young people just don't care - they've had it with Covid, and I think we've all had it with Covid - but they live in their own little bubble and they don't really see beyond that bubble a lot.\n\"And that's fair enough, but it means with a Covid pass they're made to consider that.\"\nDavid Chapman, executive director for UK Hospitality in Wales, called for \"tolerance\" from government, licencing authorities and the public as the passes were introduced. \nHe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast there was some \"trepidation\" in the industry, particularly about alignment with England, as well as staff shortages. \n\"We've got staffing problems as people will know already and more labour intensive moves such as this actually makes it quite difficult for a business to juggle resources well at the moment,\" he said. \nHe also called for the \"easiest possible trading conditions\" over Christmas, saying businesses had been told passes would stop \"stop at a certain point when society and the health service can cope\". \nDr Mair Hopkin, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in Wales, said the risk of Covid will increase as the weather gets worse and people spend more time indoors.\nShe said: \"They've introduced them in France and it seems to have been very acceptable to the French population, and also it seems to have coincided with a more rapid drop in their incidence rates.\n\"If that happens here then that would be a good thing.\"\nEconomy Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not \"expect perfection on day one\" as the system is introduced.  \nHe said: \"We do accept there may be problems in venues getting used to what they need to do.\""

      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\nEmissions\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov have won the Nobel Peace Prize for their fights to defend freedom of expression in the Philippines and Russia.\nThe Nobel committee called the pair \"representatives of all journalists who stand up for this ideal\".\nThey are known for investigations that have angered their countries' rulers, and have faced significant threats.\nBoth spoke in defence of freedom of the press following their win.\nMs Ressa, who co-founded the news site Rappler, was commended for using freedom of expression to \"expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in her native country, the Philippines\".\nThe Nobel committee said Mr Muratov, the co-founder and editor of independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, had for decades defended freedom of speech in Russia under increasingly challenging conditions.\n\"Free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda,\" the committee said in a statement.\n\"Without freedom of expression and freedom of the press, it will be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations, disarmament and a better world order to succeed in our time,\" it added. \nAward-winning journalist Ms Ressa was convicted last year of libel in a case seen as a test of Philippine press freedom.\nIn a live broadcast by Rappler, she said she was \"in shock\".\n\"This shows that the Nobel Peace Prize committee realised that a world without facts means a world without truth and trust,\" she said. \nMr Muratov dedicated his prize to reporters at Novaya Gazeta who had been killed because of their work. The award came a day after the 15th anniversary of the killing of Anna Politkovskaya - one of the paper's top investigative reporters and a vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, who was shot in a lift in her block of flats.\n\"I can't take all the credit. This is thanks to Novaya Gazeta and those who died while defending people's right to freedom of speech,\" he told Russian news agency Tass.\nThe winners of the prestigious prize, worth 10m Swedish krona (\u00a3836,000; $1.1m), were chosen out of 329 candidates.\nMaria Ressa, 58, co-founded Rappler in 2012. The site now has 4.5 million followers on Facebook, and has become known for its intelligent analysis and hard-hitting investigations.\nIt is one of the few Philippine media organisations to be openly critical of President Rodrigo Duterte and his policies.\nRappler has published extensively on the populist president's deadly war on drugs, as well as taking a critical look at issues of misogyny, human rights violations and corruption. Ms Ressa has personally reported on the spread of government propaganda on social media. \nMs Ressa has faced numerous legal cases, which she says are politically motivated. The government has maintained their legitimacy.\nIn a statement, Rappler said it was \"honoured and astounded\" that its chief executive had been given the prize.\n\"It could not have come at a better time - a time when journalists and the truth are being attacked and undermined,\" it said.\nDmitry Muratov, 59, co-founded Novaya Gazeta in 1993 and has since worked as its editor.\nNovaya Gazeta is one of the few remaining newspapers in Russia to be highly critical of the ruling elite, particularly President Vladimir Putin.\nPublished three times a week, it regularly runs investigations into alleged corruption and other malpractice in ruling circles, and highlights the plight of people it considers victims of official abuse.\nThe newspaper has been subjected to threats and harassment, including over its reporting of human rights abuses in Chechnya.\nMs Politkovskaya is one of six Novaya Gazeta journalists and contributors to have been killed in connection with their work since 2000.\nThe Kremlin, which has frequently opposed the paper, congratulated Mr Muratov. \n\"He persistently works in accordance with his own ideals, he is devoted to them, he is talented, he is brave,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\nHowever, allies of jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny\u00a0criticised the Nobel committee's choice.\n\"Instead of pretentious and hypocritical speeches about 'freedom', they could protect a person who survived an assassination attempt and has been taken hostage by the murderers,\" Ruslan Shaveddinov tweeted.\nAlistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring\nBoth Nobel laureates have been a thorn in the side of their respective governments for years.\nMaria Ressa and Rappler have faced concerted attacks from Rodrigo Duterte's government, and her conviction last year for \"cyber-libel\" was one of a string of cases ranging from defamation to tax avoidance.\nIf Mr Duterte is trying to silence her, it hasn't worked. Rappler continues reporting on his administration, and this award will be a huge embarrassment.\nIn her own words, Ms Ressa says: \"I've committed no crime but to speak truth to power.\"\nAnd congratulations from the Russian government to Dmitry Muratov surely came through gritted teeth.\nHe fully understands the risks that come with standing up to the state but he remains optimistic, saying of state crackdowns on opposition groups: \"It's impossible to kill dissent\".\nMs Ressa and Mr Muratov are the 102nd winners of the prize. \nLast year's winner was the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which was awarded for its efforts to combat hunger and improve conditions for peace. \nThen US President Barack Obama took the prize in 2009 and other notable winners include child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014); the United Nations and its secretary-general at the time, Kofi Annan (shared 2001); and Mother Teresa (1979)."

      "text": "Asos has announced its chief executive is leaving with immediate effect as the online fashion giant warned that rising costs are set to hit its profits.\nNick Beighton is stepping down after six years in the role and the day-to-day running of the firm will be taken over by Asos' finance chief.\nAsos also cautioned that next year's profits could fall by as much as 40%.\nThe company had benefited from lower rates of people returning clothing during Covid-19 lockdowns.  \nAsos said this had resulted in \u00a367.3m of cost savings, but it said that the levels of returns were now normalising.    \nProfits are also likely to be affected by increased freight costs, Brexit duty, outbound delivery costs and higher wages.\nWhile adjusted pre-tax profit rose 36% to \u00a3193.6m for the 12 months to 31 August, Asos now expects this figure to fall to between \u00a3110m and \u00a3140m next year.\nAsos's share price tumbled by 15% in early trading before regaining a little ground. Its share price is down 42% since the beginning of 2021.\nThe warning of lower future profits overshadowed its results for the year to 31 August, which showed sales rose 22% to \u00a33.9bn.\nAsos said it had attracted another 1.4 million customers over the past year as people turned to online shopping amid lockdowns. \nThroughout the period leisurewear became more popular, and this added to profits as it is less likely to be returned than more formal clothes. \nAsos said returns were already normalising, adding that the new customers it attracted in the last year were more likely to send clothes back.\n\"Asos has enjoyed a huge boost to trading over lockdowns, albeit for less-lucrative casual wear as its core demographic was stuck at home,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\"A reluctance to leave the house meant return rates were lower, resulting in XL margins. However, the tailwinds are easing and the Asos bubble has burst.\" \nAsos also set out changes at the top of the business to \"deliver next phase of global growth\".\nIt said Mr Beighton \"and the board have agreed that now is the right time for him to step down\" as chief executive. A search for his replacement is under way but in the meantime chief financial officer Mat Dunn will oversee the day-to-day running of the business.\nThe company's chairman, Adam Crozier - who will also be leaving Asos shortly to become chairman of BT - said the firm had a new five-year strategy and Mr Beighton had not wanted to stay for at least half of that so it was better to make the change now.\n\"Asos's management and board have spent considerable time over recent months developing and validating a clear strategic plan to accelerate international growth, building on Asos's undoubted strength in the UK,\" he said.\n\"Key to that is ensuring that we have the right leadership in place for the next phase, and the changes we are announcing today are designed to ensure we deliver against our clear strategic intent.\"\nAsos has been one of the big winners in this pandemic as people turned to online shopping during lockdowns. But it's facing the same supply chain problems as everyone else in retail including a host of increasing costs - from pay for warehouse workers to the shipping of containers of clothes from the far east, which is likely to put a huge dent in its profits for next year.\nGetting the right products at the right time is also challenging. And shoppers are now settling back into to old habits when it comes to returns.\nYounger online shoppers often order multiple products and send back those they don't want. But last year it saw fewer returns as its customers switched to less fitted items like leggings and hoodies.\nBut those charges are now starting to normalise along with overall sales.  Asos has outlined ambitious plans for expansion over the next three years but that will be without its chief executive Nick Beighton who's leaving with immediate effect - a surprise announcement after 12 years with the business. \nRichard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics said Mr Beighton's departure had come as \"huge surprise\" and Asos was \"losing someone that has been instrumental to its success over the last decade\".\n\"The share price has been under recent pressure reflecting the challenges of delivering stellar levels of growth in a more hostile environment and tough comparisons from last year. \n\"Supply chain disruptions, fierce competitor dynamics and an intense focus on sustainability have created a more challenging outlook for the business over the coming years and seemingly resulted in a big boardroom shakeup.\"\nMr Beighton, who has been with Asos for 12 years in total, said in a statement he had enjoyed \"every moment\" of his time at the firm.\nHe said when he joined Asos had fewer than 200 people and sales of \u00a3220m, turnover was now almost \u00a34bn selling to 26 million customers in 200 countries."

      "text": "The UK's Brexit minister has threatened to suspend parts of the deal with the EU if the bloc does not agree changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nLord Frost said the protocol - put in place to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland - was \"not working and needs to change\".\nHe said he worried the UK's proposals would not be agreed by the EU.\nLord Frost said triggering Article 16, which would suspend part of the deal, may end up as \"the only way\" forward. \nThe Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed by both sides as a way to protect the Good Friday Agreement by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods.\nBut Unionists have said the protocol damages trade with other parts of the UK by creating a border in the Irish Sea.\nArticle 16 can be triggered by either the UK or EU to suspend elements of the Brexit deal on the condition that the protocol is causing \"serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade\".\nBut critics say it would only be a temporary fix and not solve the long-term issues which the protocol has raised.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the government believed \"the conditions have been met\" to trigger Article 16. \nBut while he said the government was willing to trigger it, they preferred the option of negotiating a \"sustainable\" agreement with the EU.\n\"The EU has got to come to the table in good faith,\" he added. \"They have got to work with us to get a solution that delivers.\"\nAn EU spokeswoman said they would not comment on Lord Frost's remarks, \"however lyrical or aggressive they may be\".\nBut they said the bloc was \"working intensively to find practical solutions to some of the difficulties that people in Northern Ireland are experiencing\".\nSpeaking at the Conservative Party conference, Lord Frost said the government \"knew [it was] taking a risk\" when it agreed to the protocol in the autumn of 2019, claiming his team were \"worried right from the start that the protocol would not take the strain if not handled sensitively\".\nBut he said the arrangements were \"going to come apart even more quickly than we feared\", and support for the protocol had collapsed across Northern Ireland. \n\"We can still solve these problems,\" said Lord Frost, pointing to proposals he sent to the EU in July.\n\"We still await a formal response from the EU... but from what I hear, I worry that we will not get a response that enables the significant change we need,\" he added. \n\"So I urge the EU to be ambitious. There is no use tinkering around the edges. We need significant change.\"\nLater, the minister told a fringe event at the conference that he expected to get a response to the UK's proposals within the next two weeks, adding: \"We need a short, intensive and good faith talks process to happen quite soon. We need to show we've tried everything.\" \nAnd at another event, he referred to the negotiations, which, he indicated, could last \"three weeks or so\".\nThe EU has sent its own proposals to the UK on changes the protocol, but Lord Frost did not mention them in his speech. \nInstead he said if the two sides did not come up with a solution, \"using the Article 16 safeguard mechanism to address the impact the protocol is having in Northern Ireland...may in the end be the only way to protect our country, our people, our trade and our territorial integrity, the peace process and the benefits to this great UK\".\nThe threat to trigger Article 16 is not new. Lord Frost has made it a number of times.\nBut a decision is fast approaching. \nIt would not spell the end of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Article 16 only suspends limited aspects of the agreement, even though the UK government is looking for a much wider-ranging renegotiation of the deal it signed up to less than two years ago. \nAs it stands, the future of Northern Ireland looks set to bedevil relations between the UK and the EU for some time. \nAnd Lord Frost's negotiating style is certainly brusque. \nA few years ago, in another job, he was singing the praises of the single market. \nNow, in this speech, the EU is \"heavy-handed\" and British membership was a \"long bad dream\".\nIt's a challenging basis from which to launch the close partnership with its neighbours that the government says it wants. \nThe leader of the DUP, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, told an event at the Conservative conference he was \"confident\" the government was moving in the right direction and that action would be taken on the protocol. \nBut the MP said he had made it clear \"the clock was ticking\" and the government must \"arrest the harm\" the protocol is doing to Northern Ireland and the economy. \nLabour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, said: \"Lord Frost negotiated every single word of the deal he now discredits at every opportunity, and as this speech proves, their approach is inflaming tensions while solving nothing.\" "

      "tags": "Personal finance,Energy industry,Inflation,Oil & Gas industry,Natural gas",
      "text": "High energy prices are already causing problems for households in the UK and across Europe, but geopolitical tensions threaten to make matters even worse.\nWith an estimated 100,000 Russian troops massed on the border with Ukraine, there are fears that Vladimir Putin is poised to order an invasion.\nSurging gas prices have already caused a number of UK energy suppliers to go bust - and supply shortages are the last thing anyone needs.\nNot directly. The UK sources very little of its gas from Russia - less than 5%, in fact.\nHowever, that is not the case for the EU, which gets about half of its gas from there. \nAny Russian attempt to seize Ukrainian territory is likely to prompt economic sanctions by Western powers.\nIn response, Russia would be expected to \"weaponise\" its natural resources by cutting supplies of gas to Europe.\nThe wholesale cost of gas would then rocket, sending prices higher everywhere.\nAmong possible sanctions, there is talk of excluding Russia from cross-border payment systems, which would mean that European countries would have trouble even buying Russian gas in the first place.\nAbout half of UK gas supplies are of domestic origin, from the North Sea. The UK has been a big producer of gas since the mid-1960s, but output has fallen since 2000 and usage continues to rise.  \nAnother one-third of the UK's gas comes through pipelines from Norway. \nThe rest consists almost entirely of imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which arrive in Britain by sea from countries such as Qatar, the US and even Trinidad and Tobago.\nThe small amount of Russian gas that does reach the UK comes in LNG form.\nLNG supplies are particularly sensitive to global market prices and are sold to whoever pays the most, with China one of the keenest bidders.\nThe government says the UK's energy bill crisis is due to high global gas prices, not security of supply.\nIt says the UK has a \"diverse and secure\" range of suppliers. \nHowever, that could change quite rapidly if Russian gas becomes scarce, causing a knock-on effect as other countries scrabble for alternative supplies.\nDemand for gas is rising across Europe and some fear the UK could be physically - and perhaps politically - at the back of the queue. \nWhat's more, the UK has scant storage facilities. It's been increasingly operating a \"just-in-time model\", which means it's more affected by short-term price fluctuations in the wholesale gas market. \nThe government stresses it's \"not complacent\". \nAnd if needed, it does have the power to impose emergency measures, such as ordering big industrial customers to temporarily stop using gas.\nBut the biggest factor - the weather - is beyond its control. Our best hope for avoiding problems is if the rest of the winter turns out to be mild, breezy and wind power-friendly.\nA perfect energy storm was brewing during 2021. \nA cold winter around the world sent gas demand rising, depleting stores. \nThose reserves would normally have been replenished over the summer. But output dropped because many major producers were catching up with maintenance postponed during lockdowns. \nMeanwhile, calm weather reduced the amount of electricity generated by wind power. \nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have more than quadrupled over the past year.\nThe UK has been badly hit because it's one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas - 85% of homes use gas central heating, while gas also generates a third of our electricity. \nEven without a big freeze or a Russian supply squeeze, bills are heading up. \nHouseholds have seen their energy bills kept in check by the government's price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, but this is due to be revised on 1 April.\nAs a result, fuel bills could increase by another 50% in the next few months, the energy industry has said.\nWhatever happens, economists say wholesale gas prices are unlikely to drop before storage facilities fill up again - and that's not likely until spring. \nRising energy prices have already contributed to a big surge in the UK's cost of living, which is increasing at rates not seen for 30 years.\nThe energy bill crisis, along with soaring food costs, drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in another blow to struggling families.\nThe last time inflation was higher was in March 1992, when it was 7.1%.\nBusinesses too have been feeling the strain, with five business groups writing to Chancellor Rishi Sunak asking for support for firms on energy costs.\nThe rise in global wholesale gas prices has been felt across Europe.\nSome suggest Brexit has meant the UK is at a disadvantage when it comes to getting the best deal. \nWhen it was in the EU, the UK was part of the Internal Energy Market which can enable countries to access electricity more smoothly and at lower cost. \nHowever, the way gas is traded has been largely unaffected, which means leaving the EU has not had a significant impact. \nCountries that rely heavily on imported gas, such as Italy and Spain, have been particularly hard hit. Their governments have directly cut prices and raised taxes on energy company profits respectively.\nThe price cap has meant the UK's gas bills have until now been typically lower than the EU average.\nBut the rise in prices comes on top of other economic problems such as labour shortages and increasing food prices, adding up to an unwelcome rise in the cost of living."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "A Brexit deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, is at the centre of a dispute between the UK and the European Union (EU).\nSince it came into force at the start of 2021 the protocol has disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested it could suspend parts of the arrangement by triggering part of the protocol known as Article 16.\nThe protocol allows lorries to deliver goods without having paperwork and goods checked when they cross the border from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland.\nThis arrangement was easy to maintain before Brexit. When both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the EU, they automatically followed the same EU trade rules, which meant no checks were required.\nHowever, a new arrangement was needed after Northern Ireland (along with the rest of the UK) left the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods, such as milk and eggs, arrive from non-EU countries. Similar rules exist in other areas, such as medicine licensing. \nTo try to get round the problem the UK and the EU negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is now part of international law.\nRather than checks taking place along the Irish border, it was agreed any inspections and document checks would take place between Northern Ireland and  Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) instead.\nThis was allowed after it was agreed that Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on product standards (part of the EU's single market rules). \nChecks on GB goods take place at Northern Ireland ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, this has led to criticism that a new trade border has effectively been created in the Irish Sea. \nUnionists are strongly opposed to the checks because they don't want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK.\nAlso, not all checks under the protocol have been fully implemented yet. For example, supermarkets had reduced paperwork required under a temporary \"grace period\". However, the UK decided to extend these periods - something the EU said was a breach of international law. \nDespite signing up to the agreement in 2019, the UK government now says the protocol represented a huge compromise by the UK and has accused the EU of applying it too rigidly.\nThe UK is calling for changes, which include:\nArticle 16 is a set of three paragraphs in the protocol that allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes \"economic, societal or environmental difficulties\".\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss - now the UK's lead Brexit negotiator - said she would trigger Article 16 if the UK failed to secure changes.\n\"I want a negotiated solution but if we have to use legitimate provisions, including Article 16, I am willing to do that,\" she wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\nIf the UK went down this route, it could prompt the EU to respond with measures that would impose tariffs (or import taxes) on aspects of trade between the two sides.\nThe EU has warned that any such move would \"lead to instability and unpredictability\".\nThe EU has set out proposals, but says a renegotiation of the text of the Protocol is out of the question:\nIn return, the EU wants extra safeguards to prevent products from Great Britain crossing into the Republic of Ireland.\nThe border is a sensitive issue because of the history of Northern Ireland and the agreements made to bring peace, which included the removal of visible signs of the border.\nThe fear is that if any infrastructure were to be installed, such as cameras or border posts, it could become a target and lead to political instability.\nDuring negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority."

      "text": "Industries hit by soaring energy costs have made another appeal to the government for action.\nTalks with ministers will continue on Monday over a crisis that has sparked warnings about some factories.\nSectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution.\nThe Treasury has denied being in detailed talks with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng about the crisis.\nDave Dalton, chief executive of the British Glass trade body, called that \"very alarming\".\nHe was part of Friday's talks with Mr Kwarteng, but told the BBC the meeting \"was very much an introductory one. We did not get to specifics\".\nMr Dalton said he had hoped the government would have made progress over the weekend, but that appears not to have happened. \"We need immediate action,\" he said. \nHe said some members of his group may have to shut production permanently, although no firm had been forced to do so yet.\nThe nature of glass manufacturing means production cannot be just paused, he said. \"We have large furnaces that run 24/7. If you switched a furnace off, you basically destroy the infrastructure.\n\"It would have to be rebuilt at a cost of tens of millions of pounds,\" Mr Dalton said. \nMr Dalton said firms had \"hedged\" by buying gas in advance at lower prices but in some cases those deals were now expiring leaving firms facing much higher costs.\n\"We have companies that can't cope in the immediate term. And we have other companies that have to feed back to their masters overseas who will make decisions on their investment in the UK. We need a much better way to planning our way through this problem,\" he said.\nMr Kwarteng will not be involved directly at Monday's talks with industry representatives, according to BBC political correspondent Adam Fleming.\nBusiness minister Lee Rowley will lead the meeting with industry representatives later this afternoon, and is having another meeting with steel bosses on Tuesday.\nAdrian Curry, managing director of UK-based Encirc, one of the largest container glass plants in Europe, said industry was not asking for a bailout, but the situation for some companies was critical.\n\"We pay more for our energy than competitors in other countries,\" he told the BBC. He said his company would normally spend \u00a340m a year on energy, but was now looking at bills up to \u00a3100m.\n\"It's quite incredible,\" he said, adding that costs will have to be passed on to customers. And while there was not a threat to his company's survival, it was clear talking to others in industry that many companies are hurting.\nSome companies are considering stopping production to cut costs, and others \"are very close to the edge\".\nDomestic energy consumers have a certain amount of protection from rising prices due to a price cap, which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nHowever, the cap was increased on 1 October, meaning about 15 million households face a 12% rise in energy bills.\nIndustry has no such cap, meaning they are open to the risk of an unlimited rise in prices.\nAlready manufacturers and services are warning they will have to pass on their rising costs to consumers. And as energy costs are a big driver of inflation, few consumers and households will escape the consequences of the current crisis.\nTrade group UK Steel told the BBC that Boris Johnson needed to take control before it was too late - although it described as \"really good news\" an announcement that the country's third largest steel maker, Liberty Steel, would restart operations at its plant in Rotherham later this month. \nThe Unite union also called on the prime minister to \"get a grip\" to avert job losses if companies have to shut production because they cannot cope with the increased cost of energy.\nHowever, Conservative MP Mark Harper said the government should resist demands for financial support.\nThere's no single reason, but a convergence of factors nationally and globally. \nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies as countries emerged from lockdown and industry re-opened. \nA cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, stored gas levels are much lower than normal. On top of that, the UK has comparatively fewer gas storage facilities than some countries, meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. \nThere's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that major gas supplier Russia is restricting output (an accusation it denies) which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises.\nThis has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone.\nRead more here\nEd Miliband MP, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary, said: \"Yet again we see that in the face of their failed energy policy, the government has nothing to offer businesses or consumers to help them with the crisis they are facing. \n\"For firms and families waiting to hear how the Business Secretary might help, there is a total absence of a plan and no extra help.\n\"The government is squabbling amongst itself, with the Treasury even denying they are talking to BEIS about providing help for large, energy intensive industries.\"\nOn Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was \"critical\" and said he was \"looking to find a solution\".\n\"We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation,\" he said.\nHowever, a Treasury source said the business secretary had been \"mistaken\" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\nAre you a business owner?

      "text": "Looser Covid restrictions helped boost Scottish private sector output to near record levels last month, according to a report.\nA regular RBS survey of purchasing managers found a steep rise in new business, with firms hiring more staff for the third month in a row.\n\"Improved client confidence\" was among other reasons cited for the upturn.\nThe rate of output growth was slower than May's, but was still the second quickest since September 2013.\nThe survey follows a separate RBS report on jobs, which found hiring activity at Scottish businesses continued to surge last month, amid easing Covid-19 restrictions and rising economic activity.\nThe bank's latest PMI index - which measures combined manufacturing and service sector output - posted 58.4 in June, falling from May's survey record of 61.5. \nAny figure above 50 suggests economic expansion.\nThe survey indicated that the latest increase in new business was broad-based and led by services, with goods producers seeing growth slow on the month.\nMeanwhile, input prices faced by private sector firms continued to soar during June, with the rate of inflation the fastest since February 2011. \nPanellists attributed greater costs to material shortages, price hikes at suppliers, Brexit and higher fuel and utilities prices.\nIn response, Scottish private sector firms increased their average charges for the eighth month running.\nAccording to the survey, companies remained optimistic about activity over the coming year. \nThat confidence was linked to looser lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reopening of some sectors, as well as \"surging inflows\" of new work and hopes of a strong economic recovery.\nRBS Scotland board chairman Malcolm Buchanan said the June data showed \"some signs of optimism\" for the Scottish firms.\n\"The rates of increase in both business activity and new work slowed only slightly from May's respective series records and remained marked,\" he said.\n\"Inflationary pressures are a key concern, however, as material shortages and greater fuel and utilities fees continued to put severe upward pressure on input costs and, subsequently, selling prices.\"\nIn a separate development, Scotland's public spending watchdog has warned of \"acute and unpredictable\" financial pressures that will require co-operation between Scottish and UK governments. \nScotland's auditor general Stephen Boyle said in a blog on Friday that the response to Covid had made finances more complex than ever, and managing volatility would be difficult. \nHe warned that the \u00a34.6bn committed to Covid spending for this year was not guaranteed by the UK government and could be increased or reduced.\nMr Boyle said there was a need for effective communication and co-operation between Downing Street and Holyrood. \nHe added that acute and unpredictable financial pressures did not only come from the public health crisis, but from backlogs in the NHS and courts."

I've personally been double-vaxxed. I work in the music industry so I feel it's the right thing to do to make people feel safe. \n\"But I'm a bit torn, I feel some people are a bit scared and don't know enough about the vaccines.\"\nBut she said she would \"definitely\" be getting a pass.\n\"If you want to go to a club with your friends and they've got their vaccine passes and you haven't then you're going to be a bit stuck.\"\nJonathon Dawes, 18, from Rhyl, Denbighshire, who is studying politics and economics at Kings College, London, said the introduction of the pass risked eroding people's freedoms.\n\"I've had my double jab, but when it comes to Covid passes I oppose vaccine passports and the reason I do so is not only do I think they're a massive impracticality for businesses up and down the country, but I think pursuing such an avenue is a very dangerous one because we're approaching a situation now where civil liberties are under threat.\"\nSylvia Majer, 21, from Cardiff, said: \"I think they are a good idea - they don't exclude anyone, or you can just do a test.\nShe said the need for a pass meant it put \"more pressure on people testing positive not to mix and we want to keep the rates down\".\n\"There are issues with only using lateral flow tests because it is hard to police them, it's relying on the word of the person doing them if it is negative,\" she said.\nBut some business owners said the introduction of the passes was unfair and would have repercussions for those trying to recover after the Covid lockdowns.\nSkye Noman, 21, from Cardiff, who set up her Oh My Shakes business during the first national lockdown in 2020, said she thought the Covid pass would be divisive.\n\"It's different for everybody isn't it, some people will want the vaccine and then get their passport, other people won't for personal reasons,\" she said. \n\"And then to only allow those in who have got the passport seems a bit, I wouldn't say discriminatory, but it's making two different sides.\n\"We will be attending festivals and events, so it will definitely affect us because I'm sure my staff will be attending these events and will all need the passports as well.\"\nWith Tuesday's vote causing controversy after one Conservative Member of the Senedd said he was unable to vote remotely, there have been calls for another vote.\nMichael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), said his industry was \"devastated\" by the decision, particularly as it was so close.\nHe said business owners felt \"somewhat outraged\" at the circumstances.\nHe called the decision \"unfair and undemocratic\" and said the NTIA had requested another vote.\n\"This is a fundamental vote and will impact so many businesses and so many livelihoods it cannot be taken lightly,\" he said.\n\"We're still a very fragile industry and for this to be put in place at a time of such fragility, given the fact we've got some issues around staff shortages, and trade at the moment is starting to top up the losses, the huge losses and the debt that have been built up over this period. \n\"You can understand why some of the operators amongst us are very concerned at this coming in.\n\"No one wants to compromise public health, but we also want to be treated fairly,\" he said."

      "text": "Periods, low confidence and being watched by other people are factors preventing about a third of girls in England enjoying sport, a report says.\nData from the Youth Sport Trust shows over the last three years, periods have become the biggest concern for girls when doing PE in school.\nA total of 37% said periods stopped them from getting active in school last year, up from 27% in 2018-19.\nThe charity is campaigning to give girls a greater say in PE in schools.\nThe charity's Girls Active programme empowers girls in schools to help each other and support teachers to remove barriers. \n\"We want to understand further from girls what would help make a positive difference to them during their periods, so they feel that physical activity is a space that supports and helps them\", says Wendy Taylor, who runs the programme.\nThe charity asked 27,867 school-aged girls in England about their biggest concerns about participating in PE and sport.\nAt Herne Bay High School in Kent, 28 pupils from different year groups have created a magazine called Sweat Bands and Fake Tans to deal with the taboos and concerns some girls have. \nSkye, aged 16, says they are advising younger pupils with issues such as periods and low body confidence by making videos with suggestions on the best gym clothes and sports bras. \nShe says she's always struggled with body confidence, but that experience has helped her to have a positive influence on other girls.\n\"I think it's not feeling comfortable in your own body and feeling you're not good enough compared with everyone else, which I feel the media has not really helped,\" she said.\nSkye says she is lucky as her teachers have helped her embrace her periods but admits: \"Obviously, just getting changed is an issue. Sometimes you just feel so awful and you just don't want to do it, even if it's something you really look forward to like netball or basketball. \n\"But I feel you just have to push through, because you will feel better in the end.\"\nShe knows many girls feel very uncomfortable with certain types of skimpy PE clothes. \n\"You just feel a bit too exposed. I feel like sometimes you just want to put on some baggy joggers or some leggings just so you feel more comfortable.\" \nAbi loves doing sport now, but she used to feel she wasn't good enough. \nShe says, at the age of 14: \"You just feel like because everyone is watching you, that everything you do is going to be noticed, whereas that's not actually how it is.\"\nIn contrast to girls, she says: \"I think boys often come across as a bit more confident, whereas with girls, if you feel under-confident, then you're automatically going to hold back.\"\nLike Skye, Abi believes the media has affected how girls think. \nShe says: \"When you see people on Love Island and models, you think, maybe I should have to be like that. It puts such a negative on you to think, do I really have to look like that or can I just be me?\"\nIsabella says she also used to struggle with her confidence, but believes sport has helped her to overcome it, and is passionate about helping other girls through sport. \nShe says: \"I want to do my part and prove that being active can be fun and help overcome barriers. Over the years it has taught me various lessons that I will pass on to others we meet over the next couple of years at school.\" "

I think you should be able to vote only from your offices at home/Senedd/constituency.\"\n\"Not e.g. party conference,\" he added.\nNight Time Industries Association Wales, which represents 100 venues in Wales and is opposed to the plans, called for an \"urgent revote\".\nIt said it was a \"democratic outrage that one MS who wanted to vote, and who would've voted against the proposals, could not, due to a mere technical error. This shambles will cause even more uncertainty for our businesses.\"\nPresiding Officer, Elin Jones, later said in a statement: \"I gave every opportunity for the member to be present - including providing ICT support - but the member was unable to be contacted.\n\"For members to vote in the Senedd, they must be present, either in the chamber or on Zoom.\n\"It is a member's responsibility to give themselves sufficient time to secure their Zoom connection in time for voting, just as it is for any member travelling to the Senedd to vote.\"\nHundreds gathered on the Senedd steps on Tuesday to protest against the measures.\nFollowing the decision protests moved to the front of Senedd office building T\u0177 Hywel, and near the complex's car park exit, with security personnel and two armed police officers deployed on the other side of the barrier.\nTory MS Sam Kurtz said he was \"stuck in my T\u0177 Hywel office as protestors shout 'shame on you' and block us from leaving. To be fair, I'm as frustrated as them\".\nPlaid revealed in a Senedd debate on Tuesday afternoon that it would vote against the government.\nRhun ap Iorwerth said the regulations proposed by the Welsh government had raised \"more questions than they provide answers\".\n\"There is insufficient evidence and little detail on how it will work in practice. In particular, the rapid test loophole, which represents a fudge on the part of the government, makes the system open to exploitation. \n\"We've asked many questions and haven't been given the assurances we've sought. And it's for that reason that we feel unable to support these regulations today.\"\nPlaid called for ministers to withdraw the vote and said it would \"contribute to discussions on how something more robust could be brought forward, better evidenced, and with clarity on implication\".\nWelsh Lib Dem Jane Dodds said: \"Today's vote sets a dangerous precedent for bad law-making here in Wales and an unnecessary government overreach into our civil liberties without any evidence they will make us all safer.\"\nDuring the debate on Tuesday Eluned Morgan said the Welsh government had not taken the decision to introduce such measures \"lightly\".\n\"We are taking these measures to support venues to stay open and enable events to continue taking place through a potentially very difficult and challenging autumn and winter,\" she said.\nThe Welsh government is using a web-based system, rather than an app.\nMs Morgan said she was currently aware that the Covid pass shows it is valid in England.\n\"This is unfortunate and reflects the fact that we share the infrastructure with the UK government.\" \nShe said the wording will change before it becomes mandatory, and promised an app which will include a pass would be available \"early in 2022\".\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the implementation of Covid passes had been a \"complete disaster\" in Scotland.\nHe said the use of them at the Labour Party conference in Brighton had also been \"plagued with problems\".\nHe warned bringing in Covid passes in Wales risked turning the nation into a \"two-tiered society\" and \"undermines freedom of choice\".\nMr George told the Senedd the Welsh government's own technical advisory cell had warned such a policy could \"backfire\".\nBut the Welsh government hopes the passes will help prevent super-spreader events.\nDeputy chief medical officer Chris Jones said officials are \"keen to try to minimise the risk of these events while enabling them to continue so life can return to normal with some degree of protection\".\nAnyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass.\nUnder the Welsh government plan they would be compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter:\nUsers who want to show a negative test will have to self-certify their result - leading to concerns they could be faked.\nTo prevent this, the Welsh government plans to make it illegal to fake a negative test.\nLarge events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends."

State media said three people had died, and 11 of the 51 on board were missing. \nIn Shanxi, China's Meteorological Administration also told local media that heavy and prolonged rainfall and storms had hampered rescue efforts.\nShanxi is also home to a number of ancient monuments which are at major risk from the severe rainfall.\nMore than 120,000 people have been urgently transferred and resettled, and 17,000 homes have collapsed across Shanxi province, authorities told the Xinhua news agency.\nFour police officers died as a result of a landslide, according to the state-run Global Times, although information about other casualties has not been released.\nThe Shanxi flooding may have been worse than the floods in Henan earlier this year, it added.\nShanxi's provincial capital Taiyuan saw average rainfall of around 185.6mm last week, compared with the 25mm it saw in October between 1981 and 2010.\nGlobal Times spoke to a resident from Ji county on the Yellow River. \n\"This year, the level of the Yellow River is particularly high,\" she told the paper. \"Some houses in rural areas collapsed in the flood, but people were relocated in advance.\" \nRescuers in Taiyuan reportedly used megaphones to tell stranded people: \"Hold the children above your head, the elderly and women are given priority to go ashore. Don't panic, everyone will be rescued.\"\nShanxi is a major coal-producing province and the government was forced to halt operations at mines and chemical factories as a result of the rain.\nChina is already facing an energy shortage which has caused power cuts. The government has been limiting electricity usage at ports and factories.\nThe local government said it had suspended output at 60 coal mines, 372 non-coal mines and 14 dangerous chemical factories in the province. \nOperations had already been stopped at 27 other coal mines on 4 October.

      "text": "Poles backing EU membership have taken part in protests across the country, amid fears it could leave the bloc.\nThe rallies on Sunday were held in response to a top court ruling that said key EU laws were \"incompatible\" with the Polish constitution.\nProtests were held in about 100 towns and cities, with some 100,000 people gathering in the capital, Warsaw.\nThe ruling has raised concerns Poland could exit the EU, but the government has denied having any such intention.\nThe court's decision last Thursday effectively rejected the core principle that EU law has primacy over national legislation. It was the most significant challenge to the supremacy of EU law to date.\nPoland's Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has defended the decision and said his ruling party had no plans for what some are calling Polexit.\n\"This is a harmful myth, which the opposition uses for its own lack of ideas about Poland's responsible place in Europe,\" Mr Morawiecki wrote on Facebook following the pro-EU rallies.\nOn Monday, the European Commission's industry chief, Thierry Breton, said he did not believe \"for one second\" there would be a Polexit after the court ruling.\nHe said the Commission - which draws up the proposals for new EU laws - would analyse the ruling before deciding what action to take. The Commission has previously warned it will use all its powers to bring Poland into line with EU law.\nOpinion polls consistently show strong backing for EU membership among Polish voters.\nThat support was on display on Sunday, when opposition politicians, activists and artists took part in the demonstrations.\nAt the rally in the capital, Donald Tusk, former president of the European Council and now leader of the opposition party Civic Platform, called on people to \"defend a European Poland\".\nWanda Traczyk-Stawska, a 94-year-old veteran of the Warsaw Uprising against the Nazi German occupation in 1944, spoke at one event.\n\"This is our Europe and nobody is going to take us out of it,\" she said.\nProtester Janusz Kuczynski said he was worried the country was going backwards. \"I am afraid that bad times may come back,\" he said. \"There was simply no freedom.\"\nPoland's Constitutional Tribunal effectively rejected the principle of the primacy of EU law over national legislation in certain judicial matters.\nThe legal challenge was brought by the Polish prime minister in March this year.\nIt was the first time in the history of the 27-strong EU bloc that a leader of a member state had questioned wholesale EU treaties in a constitutional court.\nMr Morawiecki wanted to prevent Polish judges from using EU law to question the legitimacy of judges appointed following recent changes to the judiciary.\nThose changes have been criticised by the European Commission for undermining judicial independence and increasing political control over courts.\nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was \"deeply concerned by the ruling\" and vowed to \"uphold the founding principles of the EU's legal order\".\nThe court decision was the latest flashpoint in a deepening row between the EU and Poland.\nPoland's right-wing populist government has found itself increasingly at odds with the European Commission over issues ranging from LGBT rights to judicial independence.\nThe Commission has yet to approve Poland's \u20ac57bn (\u00a350bn; $66bn) Covid-19 recovery plan.\nNegotiations are ongoing and some analysts suggest the government is using the ruling as leverage to get the plan agreed.\nLast week Jacek Karnowski, editor-in-chief of the pro-government Sieci weekly, told the BBC that Polexit was \"unimaginable and unrealistic\", although he said the topic was now a matter of discussion."

Someone must die for the cause.\"\nHaving made their point, the Bigyn boys returned to school up the hill.\nYet Mr Grigg said it should not be underestimated how much courage it must have taken those 30 pupils to walk out.\n\"Corporal punishment worked, wrongly, on two levels: Firstly, the physical pain of being hit, but more significantly the fear of receiving a beating,\" he explained.\n\"For those 30 boys to march out of their class, either the problems they were facing were so severe that they'd overwhelmed the consequences of a thrashing, or else the prospect of the social isolation they'd have received from their classmates was more terrifying than any caning the teachers could impose.\"\nIn Wales at least, the strike was written off as little more than children acting out the industrial disputes of their parents during the Llanelli railway strike and ensuing riots.\nIndeed, one boy told a Daily Mirror reporter: \"My dad is striking for his rights, why shouldn't I?\"\nHowever, Mr Grigg said he believed there was evidence to suggest the pupil strikes were a protest in their own right.\n\"You only have to look at the range of complaints the children had, and the number of cities it spread to, to realise that this was far more than just copycat,\" he said.\n\"From Cork to the East End - with issues ranging from corporal punishment, the length of the school day, holidays and the price of books - this was a genuine sense of injustice.\"\nSpread through word of mouth and newspaper reports, thousands of pupils protested in a month of disturbances.\nIn Dublin, children pelted teachers and parents with rotten cabbages, while in London youths with sharpened sticks pillaged the streets.\nMr Grigg said the strikes highlighted the challenges and tensions in the school system.\n\"Education was far more fragmented between local authorities than it is today, so it's impossible to give one answer to what effect the strikes had,\" said Mr Grigg.\n\"From the late Victorian period, more enlightened educationalists such as the chief inspector of elementary schools Edmond Holmes had been advocating major reforms including a move away from teaching to tests, a more engaging curriculum and less discipline through fear.\n\"They hoped the 20th Century would be the century of the child with more child-centred teaching and a greater recognition of children's rights and voices.\n\"But corporal punishment remained a source of tension between teachers and pupils. While the local authorities made it clear that girls and infants were not to be hit, and reminded schools that corporal punishment should only be used as a last resort, in practice, abuses continued.\"\nThe two sides would be drawn closer together by the need to provide troops to fight in World War One.\nMr Grigg explained: \"One thing that worried the authorities was that the school system was turning out boys who were too physically unfit to fight, something that had been noticed when recruiting for the Boer War at the turn of the century. \n\"This is why there was a greater emphasis on physical training and military-style drill exercises in school. It was thought that this would instil much-needed self-discipline. Corporal punishment was part of this culture of character formation, seen by many teachers as a means of maintaining classroom order and not likely to do much harm in the long run.\"\nWhile school strikes petered out, Mr Grigg said he believed they did raise themes which continue to occupy modern-day educationalists, such as listening to what pupils have to say, creating engaging lessons and working with parents. \nCorporal punishment was eventually banned in state schools in 1986.\nScotland was the first of the UK nations to ban smacking in 2020, with Wales following suit next year."

      "text": "Industries hit by soaring energy costs have made another appeal to the government for action.\nTalks with ministers will continue on Monday over a crisis that has sparked warnings about some factories.\nSectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution.\nThe Treasury has denied being in detailed talks with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng about the crisis.\nDave Dalton, chief executive of the British Glass trade body, called that \"very alarming\".\nHe was part of Friday's talks with Mr Kwarteng, but told the BBC the meeting \"was very much an introductory one. We did not get to specifics\".\nMr Dalton said he had hoped the government would have made progress over the weekend, but that appears not to have happened. \"We need immediate action,\" he said. \nHe said some members of his group may have to shut production permanently, although no firm had been forced to do so yet.\nThe nature of glass manufacturing means production cannot be just paused, he said. \"We have large furnaces that run 24/7. If you switched a furnace off, you basically destroy the infrastructure.\n\"It would have to be rebuilt at a cost of tens of millions of pounds,\" Mr Dalton said. \nMr Dalton said firms had \"hedged\" by buying gas in advance at lower prices but in some cases those deals were now expiring leaving firms facing much higher costs.\n\"We have companies that can't cope in the immediate term. And we have other companies that have to feed back to their masters overseas who will make decisions on their investment in the UK. We need a much better way to planning our way through this problem,\" he said.\nMr Kwarteng will not be involved directly at Monday's talks with industry representatives, according to BBC political correspondent Adam Fleming.\nBusiness minister Lee Rowley will lead the meeting with industry representatives later this afternoon, and is having another meeting with steel bosses on Tuesday.\nAdrian Curry, managing director of UK-based Encirc, one of the largest container glass plants in Europe, said industry was not asking for a bailout, but the situation for some companies was critical.\n\"We pay more for our energy than competitors in other countries,\" he told the BBC. He said his company would normally spend \u00a340m a year on energy, but was now looking at bills up to \u00a3100m.\n\"It's quite incredible,\" he said, adding that costs will have to be passed on to customers. And while there was not a threat to his company's survival, it was clear talking to others in industry that many companies are hurting.\nSome companies are considering stopping production to cut costs, and others \"are very close to the edge\".\nDomestic energy consumers have a certain amount of protection from rising prices due to a price cap, which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nHowever, the cap was increased on 1 October, meaning about 15 million households face a 12% rise in energy bills.\nIndustry has no such cap, meaning they are open to the risk of an unlimited rise in prices.\nAlready manufacturers and services are warning they will have to pass on their rising costs to consumers. And as energy costs are a big driver of inflation, few consumers and households will escape the consequences of the current crisis.\nTrade group UK Steel told the BBC that Boris Johnson needed to take control before it was too late - although it described as \"really good news\" an announcement that the country's third largest steel maker, Liberty Steel, would restart operations at its plant in Rotherham later this month. \nThe Unite union also called on the prime minister to \"get a grip\" to avert job losses if companies have to shut production because they cannot cope with the increased cost of energy.\nHowever, Conservative MP Mark Harper said the government should resist demands for financial support.\nThere's no single reason, but a convergence of factors nationally and globally. \nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies as countries emerged from lockdown and industry re-opened. \nA cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, stored gas levels are much lower than normal. On top of that, the UK has comparatively fewer gas storage facilities than some countries, meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. \nThere's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that major gas supplier Russia is restricting output (an accusation it denies) which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises.\nThis has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone.\nRead more here\nEd Miliband MP, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary, said: \"Yet again we see that in the face of their failed energy policy, the government has nothing to offer businesses or consumers to help them with the crisis they are facing. \n\"For firms and families waiting to hear how the Business Secretary might help, there is a total absence of a plan and no extra help.\n\"The government is squabbling amongst itself, with the Treasury even denying they are talking to BEIS about providing help for large, energy intensive industries.\"\nOn Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was \"critical\" and said he was \"looking to find a solution\".\n\"We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation,\" he said.\nHowever, a Treasury source said the business secretary had been \"mistaken\" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\nAre you a business owner?

      "text": "The Prince of Wales has told the BBC he understands why campaigners from organisations like Extinction Rebellion take to the streets to demand action on climate change.\nIn the interview at his home in Balmoral, Prince Charles said action such as blocking roads \"isn't helpful\".\nBut he said he totally understood the \"frustration\" climate campaigners felt.\nAnd he warned of a \"catastrophic\" impact if more ambitious action isn't taken on climate change.\nSpeaking in the gardens of his house\u202fon the Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire, the prince said it had taken too long for the world to wake up to the risks of climate change.\u202f \nAnd he worried that world leaders would \"just talk\" when they meet in Glasgow in November for a crucial UN climate conference.\u202f \n\"The problem is to get action on the ground,\" he said.\nAsked if he sympathised with Greta Thunberg, the climate campaigner who has also criticised leaders for failing to act, he said:\u202f\"Of course I do, yes. \n\"All these young people feel nothing is ever happening so of course they're going to get frustrated.\u202f I totally understand because nobody would listen and they see their future being totally destroyed.\"\nThe prince also said he understood why groups such as Extinction Rebellion were taking their protests to the streets. \n\"But it isn't helpful, I don't think, to do it in a way that alienates people.\u202f \n\"So I totally understand the frustration, the difficulty is how do you direct that frustration in a way that is more constructive rather than destructive.\"\nWhen asked if the UK government was\u202fdoing enough to combat climate change, the prince replied:\u202f\u202f\"I couldn't possibly comment.\"\nThe interview took place in\u202fPrince George's Wood, an arboretum the Prince of Wales\u202fhas\u202fcreated\u202fin the gardens of\u202fBirkhall on the Balmoral estate.\nHe planted the first tree\u202fwhen Prince George,\u202fhis oldest\u202fgrandchild, was born and\u202fhe said the project had become \"an old man's obsession\".\u202f \nPrince Charles\u202fwas frank about the shortcomings of businesses to take action on climate.\u202f\u202f\u202f \nHe\u202fhas long argued engaging business leaders in tackling climate change would be crucial in limiting global temperature rises.\u202f\u202f \nThis has been a key strand of his campaigning over the years, most recently through his Sustainable Markets Initiative.\u202f\u202f\u202f \nThe prince said that, while governments can bring billions of dollars to the effort, the private sector has the potential to mobilise trillions of dollars.\u202f\u202f \nBut he told the BBC he feared many business executives still didn't give environmental issues the priority they deserved.\u202f\u202f\u202f \nMany of the young people they employ really mind about environment issues but, he said, \"they haven't quite got to the top to make a fundamental difference\".\nHe\u202fsaid the Glasgow climate conference was \"a last chance saloon\" and said it would be \"a disaster\" if the world did not come together to tackle climate change.\u202f \n\"I mean it'll be catastrophic. It is already beginning to be catastrophic because nothing in nature can survive the stress that is created by these extremes of weather,\" he said.\u202f \nChallenged about his own efforts to reduce his carbon footprint, Prince Charles said he had switched the heating of Birkhall to biomass boilers, using wood\u202fchips\u202ffrom trees felled in the\u202festate's\u202fforest.\u202f\u202f\u202f\nHe has installed solar panels at Clarence House, his London residence, and on the farm buildings of his Gloucestershire home, Highgrove.\u202f\u202f\u202f\nHe said he had\u202finstalled heat pumps at some of his properties\u202fand\u202fa hydroelectric turbine in the river that runs beside\u202fBirkhall.\u202f \nHe was also challenged on his long-standing love of cars, and asked if he was \"a bit of a Jeremy Clarkson, a bit of a petrol-head?\"\n\"Well, yes\", the prince acknowledged: \"But that was before we knew what the problems were.\"\u202f\u202f \nHe said he had\u202fconverted his favourite vehicle, an Aston Martin he has owned for 51 years, to run on what he described as \"surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process\".\nHis Aston Martin has been modified to run on a fuel called E85 - made up of 85% bioethanol and 15% unleaded petrol.\nBioethanol can be derived from different sources - including in the case of the prince's car - surplus wine and alcohol extracted from fermented whey.\nHe said most of the vehicles used on his estates were now electric but \"it can't all be done with electric vehicles\", and that hydrogen technology would need\u202fto be part of the mix as transportation was decarbonised.\u202f\u202f\u202f \nTop of the list of the concerns he had about electric vehicles was price, \"they are not cheap\", he said.\u202f He was also worried about how the materials for batteries would be sourced and how they would be recycled.\u202f\u202f\u202f \n\"At the moment there is a huge amount of waste which is really worrying,\" he said.\u202f \nThe prince acknowledged how difficult it was for most people to reduce their carbon footprint.\u202f \nHe said he had changed his diet to reduce his impact on the environment and urged\u202fothers to do the same.\u202f\u202f\u202f \nHe now doesn't eat meat and fish\u202fon\u202ftwo days each week and doesn't eat any dairy products on another day.\u202f\u202f\u202f \n\"If more people did that it would reduce a lot of the pressure on the environment,\" he\u202fsaid.\u202f\u202f\u202f \nTrees were a great way to capture carbon and improve the urban environment, he said, suggesting avenues of trees might be planted to commemorate those who had\u202fdied in the coronavirus pandemic.\u202f\u202f \nThe prince recognised that low carbon travel remains a big challenge.\u202f He said he hoped flying would become easier and more sustainable when new\u202fbio-fuels,\u202fusing carbon captured from the air with sustainably sourced hydrogen, become available.\u202f \nBut he believed\u202fsystemic change\u202fwas necessary to bring about the transformation of transportation and other industries that would\u202fbe required to drive down emissions.\u202f \n\"No one person can solve the problem,\" he\u202fsaid. \"It's a pinprick.\"\u202f\n\u202fThe prince said the key\u202fwould be making the\u202fenvironmentally friendly options cheaper for everyone.\u202f\u202f \n\"We still have fossil fuel subsidies, why?\" he asked.\u202f\u202f\u202f \nHe described as \"crazy\" the fact there were still subsidies for what he called \"insane\u202fagro-industrial approaches to farming which are a disaster in many ways, cause huge damage and contribute enormously to emissions\".\nHe said there were similar \"perverse\" subsidies for the fishing industry which he said caused\u202f\"mammoth damage\" through trawling.\u202f \nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

      "tags": "Companies,Energy industry,Food industry,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "A deal to avert another carbon dioxide crisis in the food and drink industry has been extended until early 2022.\nUS firm CF Industries, a key CO2 producer in the UK, has agreed to continue supplies of the gas. \nIt said that should give the government and firms time to find other sources of CO2, used in fizzy drinks and for keeping food fresh, as well as to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter.\nFirms will now have to pay more for their CO2, but it is unclear how much.\nLast month, the government stepped in to subsidise one of the firm's plants after its shutdown due to high gas prices threatened food supplies.\nCF Industries suspended production at two sites - Cheshire and Billingham - which make 60% of the UK's commercial carbon dioxide. \nIt reopened its Billingham plant in north-east England after the government agreed to meet the costs of running it for three weeks.\nBillingham produces up to 750 tonnes of CO2 per day as a by-product of producing ammonia for fertiliser. CF Industries' plant at Ince in Cheshire remains closed with no date given for a reopening.\nThe government said: \"CO2 suppliers have agreed to pay CF Fertilisers a price for the CO2 it produces that will enable it to continue operating while global gas prices remain high, drawing on support from industry and delivering value for money for the taxpayer.\"\nThe agreement meant industry could have confidence it would receive future CO2 supplies, without further taxpayer support, said the government.\nThe British Meat Processors Association said the agreement provided \"some reassurance that supplies will be maintained\". \n\"However, industry has been given no detail on what the price will be or how it will be calculated going forward,\" a spokesperson added. \n\"We understand that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng took the decision to temporarily exempt parts of the CO2 industry from competition law to facilitate this agreement. What we need now is some detail and transparency around how the new pricing structure will work.\"\nIan Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said the agreement was \"welcome news\".\nBut he added: \"The increased cost of buying CO2 is yet another burden on the food and drink industry, which is already facing enormous stresses. \n\"This will, of course, add more pressure on prices for shoppers and diners.\"\nBy Ben King, business reporter\nIt looks like there will be enough CO2 to keep Christmas beers bubbly - but after that, there are no guarantees.  \nThere's an ominous line in the CF Industries press release. They expect CO2 users to develop \"robust alternative sources\" between now and January. \nThat won't be easily done. Lots of industrial processes produce CO2, but few produce a stream so pure and reliable that you'd want to dissolve it in your lemonade. \nDistributor Nippon Gases has warned that supply is tight across Europe, so imports will be hard to come by. \nThe government says that the firms which need the CO2 from Billingham will be paying more for it - and whatever long-term solution does emerge, it's likely to be more expensive too.\nBut the UK only needs about 600,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. At about \u00a3200 a tonne before the current crisis, that's about \u00a3120m, relatively small beer for industries that count their turnover in the billions.\nCompared to the other pressures those industries face - staff shortages, and higher costs for energy and shipping - more expensive CO2 is an extra cost they don't need, but it won't be their biggest headache. \nWhen CF shut its facilities after making fertiliser became uneconomic because of the rising price of wholesale gas, it cut off a vital source of CO2 for other sectors.\nSupermarkets began reporting limited stocks of some food items, while the pig industry warned that if slaughterhouses could not process animals, then farmers would have to cull their stocks.\nThe US firm said it now expected the UK government and industrial gas customers to \"develop robust alternative sources of CO2 as part of a long-term solution for meeting demand in the country\".\nLast month, it emerged the British food industry would be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with CF Industries to restart production in the UK. \nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from \u00a3200 per tonne to \u00a31,000.\nHouseholds, too, are being hit by higher energy bills, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by \u00a3139 to \u00a31,277 a year on average.  \nSeveral energy suppliers, unable to pass on wholesale prices to consumers on fixed deal, have gone out of business. Their customers have been switched to other suppliers, but will be put on variable contracts that will be higher than previous deals. \nMeanwhile, the business department has sent the Treasury a formal request for support for energy-intensive industries hit by high gas prices, the BBC understands. \nIt came after talks between ministers and industry leaders earlier on Monday.\nA source said: \"Everyone in government understands the importance of this situation.\n\"We need to solve this quickly.\"\nDetails of the proposal from Mr Kwarteng have not been disclosed but are thought to focus on a temporary solution to high energy prices. \nOn Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was \"critical\" and said he was \"looking to find a solution\".\nMr Kwarteng said there were Treasury talks about support measures to ease the impact on firms. However, a Treasury source later said the business secretary had been \"mistaken\".\nSectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution."

What we are in the business of is ensuring security of supply and that is what I am focused on.\"\nWholesale gas prices have risen 250% since January.\nCEO of British Glass Dave Dalton, who was at Friday's meeting with Mr Kwarteng, said some of the confederation's \"significant\" members were \"teetering on the edge\". \n\"I think some companies are staring down the ability to survive, absolutely - ultimately that obviously cascades on to jobs and impacts on the consumer,\" he told the BBC. \nGareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said he was frustrated by the lack of action to support businesses.\nHe told the BBC that without help in the next week or so, there would be \"significant and permanent damage to the UK steel sector\".\nUnite leader Sharon Graham said the country was \"contemplating factory shutdowns across viable manufacturing and businesses\" and that workers were \"worried sick\".\nBusinesses have been shouting louder and louder for support through this period of soaring energy prices.\nThis morning, the business secretary told the BBC he was listening to their concerns - but would not commit to any extra support.\nThose industries that use a lot of energy for manufacturing say that the time for working out a way forward has long gone. \nThe director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, expressed his frustration, saying pauses in steel production will only increase. \nThe government says the current situation emphasises the need for a revolution in how we generate energy, moving towards home-grown renewables.\nBut that's little comfort for those businesses dependent on energy from fossil fuels now, competing with intense demand in a global market.\nOn the Andrew Marr show, Mr Kwarteng denied asking for \"billions\" from the Treasury to subsidise energy-intensive businesses and said supply itself was \"not an issue\".\nA Treasury source said the business secretary had been \"mistaken\" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\nBridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government \"needs to get a grip\" and called for \"urgent answers on who exactly is running the show\". \n\"The two key government departments responsible for the current cost of living crisis have spent this morning infighting about whether they were in talks with each other. What a farce,\" she said.\nShe also accused the government of having \"put its out of office on\", referring to reports that the prime minister is on holiday in Spain.\n A number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action to support heavy industry.\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on the UK government to \"nurse\" businesses through the crisis, describing it as a \"perfect storm\".\nThe domestic consumer energy price cap, which is reviewed every six months, sets the maximum level a supplier can charge a consumer on a standard tariff in England, Wales and Scotland. \nMr Kwarteng told Marr that protecting consumers was his \"first and foremost objective\" and as such the price cap would stay at its current level until its next update which is due to in April.\nSome suppliers say the cap is just delaying an inevitable increase in consumer prices and should be reviewed more regularly.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem has warned households will see further \"significant rises\" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed.\nAsked by Marr if he was sure the lights would stay on this winter, Mr Kwarteng said \"yes, I am\".\nDue to high gas prices household energy suppliers have been forced to sell gas for less than they can buy it due to the price cap, leading some to fail.\nLast month, nine domestic energy supply companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates.\nPaul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, said while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism \"is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers\".\nHe said it protected customers in the short term but somewhere between \u00a31bn and \u00a33bn in costs would be spread back across business and households as a result of suppliers going bust.\nThe founder of OVO Energy Stephen Fitzpatrick told Marr that it has been \"too easy\" for companies to enter the energy market and that there will be more companies in difficulty.\nHe said the market was a complicated one, and he thought some people had not understood the risks."

      "text": "The energy price cap protecting households from sharp rises in gas prices is \"not fit for purpose\", suppliers have said.\nNatural gas prices are at record highs, which has led to some domestic energy firms failing as they are paying more for gas than they are able to charge.\nSuppliers have warned that consumers could face a \"huge cost\" from these firms going out of business.\nThere are also calls for an energy price cap to help small businesses.\nGas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid pandemic.\nDomestic customers are partly protected from sharp rises by a price cap - which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard tariff - although energy regulator Ofgem has warned that households will see further \"significant rises\" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed.\nLast month, nine energy companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates.\nPaul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, told the BBC that while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism \"is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers\". \n\"Crazy, just crazy\" is how the nursery and soft play owner Gordon Foster describes the sharp rise in energy prices, shaking his head in dismay. \nBusinesses typically fix their energy bills a few years in advance, known as \"hedging\".\nMr Foster is one of the unlucky ones whose energy contract is up for renewal, and at the moment he's looking at paying eight times his current rate, taking up a contract that would tie him in for years. \nThe alternative is paying sky high prices now without a contract, and keeping his fingers crossed that prices will stabilise. \nFor him, as for others, this sudden jump in costs makes parts of the business unviable, and certainly means he has to put his prices up for his customers. \nWhile households might have an energy cap in place to protect them from such eye-watering spikes in global markets, we are all exposed to the impact of such costs for businesses. Ultimately they feed through to everyone. \nHe said while the cap protected customers in the short term, he thought there was somewhere between \u00a31bn and \u00a33bn in costs which would be spread back across business and households as a result of failed suppliers.\nDerek Lickorish, chairman of Utilita Energy, which has more than 800,000 customers, said there was no doubt there would be a cost paid by consumers for failed firms.\n\"The government has to look at the means by which they can support not only energy suppliers, but also big industry,\" he said. \nMr Lickorish said he would like to see the price cap reviewed four times a year, rather than the current two, and for a longer period of gas prices to be considered in setting it.\nStephen Murray, head of energy, commercial and partners at Moneysupermarket.com, said that while the usual advice for consumers was to shop around, for now it was to stay put, with those on a fixed deal likely to be better off.\nThe price cap provided \"some level of protection\", he said, but \"that comes at a cost and we've seen that through failed suppliers\".\nBusiness group the British Chambers of Commerce has called for a similar cap to be introduced for the energy bills of small and medium sized businesses - those with 250 employers or fewer.\nThese firms mostly buy their energy several years in advance, so those whose contracts are due for renewal now are facing a \"difficult time\", it said.\nThe group's co-executive director Claire Walker said the increasing pressure on these sized businesses was \"becoming dire\" and said that a price cap would give them the confidence to maintain normal business activities.\nDave Dalton, chief executive of British Glass, said he thought a cap would help but was probably \"too little, too late\" and that an \"immediate intervention\" was needed.\nThe government said it was in regular contact with business groups to explore ways to manage the impact of global prices.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng met leaders from heavy industry on Friday amid warnings that some sectors could have to shut down, but they failed to find any solutions.\nLabour has accused the government of being in denial about gas prices, with wholesale prices rising 250% since January.\nA number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action, and the Energy Intensive Users Group - which represents firms that use a lot of energy - said measures were needed \"right now\".\nThe group's chair Dr Richard Leese said that energy-heavy industries were \"intrinsically linked\" and if some sectors were forced to shut down, it would have a knock-on impact.\n\"We've seen the curtailment in production in the steel and fertiliser sector - that's had a knock-on impact into the supply chains in the industrial supply chains and domestic supply chains,\" he said.\nUK Steel boss Gareth Stace said he was \"baffled\" that the UK government had failed to find solutions because governments in the rest of Europe had stepped in to support industry - although they faced lower energy costs than in the UK."

      "tags": "Manufacturing,Royal Bank of Scotland,Scotland economy,Employment",
      "text": "Scottish firms raised prices last month at the sharpest rate since at least 1999 in the face of severe inflationary pressures, according to a survey.\nThe latest Royal Bank of Scotland purchasing managers' index (PMI) suggested companies were having to pass on the rising costs of materials, pay, logistics, Covid and Brexit. \nCost burdens were reported to be rising at their quickest rate since 2008.\nRBS said firms raised average charges \"to a degree unseen\" in two decades.\nThe survey was compiled by IHS Markit from a panel of about 500 manufacturers and service providers. \nOn a positive note, the survey found manufacturing and service sector output rose for a seventh straight month.\nHowever, September saw the slowest rate of increase for five months, as a sustained upturn in services was slightly offset by a renewed fall in manufacturing output.\nFor the sixth time in as many months, inflows of new work rose, with respondents linking the latest uplift with strong client demand, in part due to the relaxation of lockdown restrictions. \nAlthough still sharp overall, expansion eased to its slowest rate since April, as sustained growth at services firms was partially offset by a fresh decline in manufacturing order book volumes.\nThe pace of expansion in new business across Scotland was broadly in line with the UK average.\nMeanwhile, the survey highlighted a sustained rise in Scottish private sector employment. Panellists linked the latest upturn in staffing levels to higher workloads. Furthermore, the rate of job creation accelerated to a four-month high and was sharp overall.\nScotland also registered the third-quickest increase in employment across the 12 monitored UK areas in September, behind only London and Wales.\nRBS Scotland board chairman Malcolm Buchanan said Scotland's private sector \"remained on a growth footing\" in September but some momentum had been lost due to fresh reductions in both output and order book volumes at goods producers.\nHe added: \"Although the latest data does indicate a slight slowdown in growth, the third quarter as a whole nonetheless saw to one of the quickest expansions of the private sector on record and it remains in a strong position as we enter the closing months of the year.\"\nColin Borland, director of devolved nations for the Federation of Small Businesses, said currently two-thirds of firms were reporting an increase in running costs compared with this time last year.\nHe added: \"In businesses who have very little, if any, headroom, something has to give. If every ounce of fat has already been trimmed, if every efficiency has been maxed out, then unfortunately you are going to have to look at price rises.\"\nThere's lots to welcome about the latest data on the Scottish economy. The PMI tells us that there's been a sustained recovery out of the winter lockdown. \nJuly to September was one of the strongest quarters for economic growth that we've ever seen. The economy was reopening, and people were out spending.\nGrowth was inevitable, although its strength in early summer surprised some forecasters.\nIt was also a certainty that the pace would slow down. It could not be sustained. \nBut what was less easy to forecast were the combined disruptions that have made price inflation one of the main concerns: Brexit making it uneconomic for some to continue trading across the North Sea, supply shortages, shipping costs and delays, the haulage driver shortage, wage inflation and an energy price boom.\nThese have not worked their way through the system. Price inflation is now being forecast to rise sharply next spring, when the cap on domestic heating costs is due to be raised next, probably by hundreds of pounds for the average gas-heated home.\nGas prices have come down off an exceptional peak, but remain well ahead of the start of this year. Oil prices are continuing to rise. With labour shortages, it seems likely that wage inflation has barely begun.\nThe questions now are how long this is sustained, and will action be required by central banks to rein in price inflation?"

It's estimated to have around 10,000 fighters at large in the Middle East. \nFurther afield it remains a dangerous security threat in countries as far apart as Afghanistan and Mozambique.\nIraq's Security Media Cell said the detainee was close to the new leader of IS, Amir Mohammed Said Abdul Rahman al-Mawla, who replaced Baghdadi after he killed himself during a US special forces raid on his hideout in Syria in 2019. \nAlthough Mr Kadhimi did not reveal where Mr Jasim had been captured, a senior Iraqi military source told AFP news agency it had happened in Turkey. There was no immediate response from Turkish authorities to the report.\nEarlier this year, the Iraqi government announced it had killed another alleged deputy IS leader, Jabir Salman Saleh al-Isawi, as well as the leader of IS in southern Iraq, Jabbar Ali Fayadh.\nIS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from eastern Iraq to western Syria and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people.\nDespite the group's defeat on the battlefield in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria two years later, it is estimated that thousands of militants remain active in both countries."

      "text": "Wildlife expert Chris Packham has vowed that intimidation will not stop him from campaigning after a suspected arson attack at his home.\nThe broadcaster said two masked men set a vehicle on fire at the gate of his New Forest home at about 00:30 BST on Friday, causing extensive damage.\nHe said the attack was the \"cost\" of online abuse he receives, but added it would not sway him from his causes.\nHampshire Police said it was investigating the fire.\nIn a video on Twitter, Packham questioned if the men were members of one of a number of conservation organisations and rural groups \"or some of my internet trolls, who fill my timeline with hate?\"\nHe said he received many defamatory and libellous comments online, but those who posted them were getting away with it because the law, \"as it stands, means that I am unable to take any action against this form of harassment\".\nHe said it was a frustrating situation, which came at a cost.\n\"Perhaps the cost is having my gate burned down, causing thousands of pounds' worth of damage,\" he added.\nHe said he had previously had dead animals left at his home, including foxes and badgers, but actions against him had now escalated \"to damaging that property\".\nHowever, he said he would not bow to the pressure to support activities he did not agree with, such as \"illegal shooting\" and trail hunting.\n\"If you think that by burning down those gates that I'm suddenly going to become a supporter... then you're wrong,\" he said.\n\"I will just carry on, because I have no choice. I cannot and will not let your intimidation sway me from my cause.\"\nIn 2019, the BBC Springwatch presenter spoke about a \"very calculated\" death threat he received after campaigning for measures to protect birds from being shot.\nThe fire at his property came a day before he delivered a 100,000 signature petition to Buckingham Palace, which called on the Royal Family to conserve nature on their estates and reintroduce animals like beavers and wild boar."

      "tags": "Companies,Energy industry,Food industry,CO\u2082 shortage",
      "text": "A deal to avert another carbon dioxide crisis in the food and drink industry has been extended until early 2022.\nUS firm CF Industries, a key CO2 producer in the UK, has agreed to continue supplies of the gas. \nIt said that should give the government and firms time to find other sources of CO2, used in fizzy drinks and for keeping food fresh, as well as to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter.\nFirms will now have to pay more for their CO2, but it is unclear how much.\nLast month, the government stepped in to subsidise one of the firm's plants after its shutdown due to high gas prices threatened food supplies.\nCF Industries suspended production at two sites - Cheshire and Billingham - which make 60% of the UK's commercial carbon dioxide. \nIt reopened its Billingham plant in north-east England after the government agreed to meet the costs of running it for three weeks.\nBillingham produces up to 750 tonnes of CO2 per day as a by-product of producing ammonia for fertiliser. CF Industries' plant at Ince in Cheshire remains closed with no date given for a reopening.\nThe government said: \"CO2 suppliers have agreed to pay CF Fertilisers a price for the CO2 it produces that will enable it to continue operating while global gas prices remain high, drawing on support from industry and delivering value for money for the taxpayer.\"\nThe agreement meant industry could have confidence it would receive future CO2 supplies, without further taxpayer support, said the government.\nThe British Meat Processors Association said the agreement provided \"some reassurance that supplies will be maintained\". \n\"However, industry has been given no detail on what the price will be or how it will be calculated going forward,\" a spokesperson added. \n\"We understand that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng took the decision to temporarily exempt parts of the CO2 industry from competition law to facilitate this agreement. What we need now is some detail and transparency around how the new pricing structure will work.\"\nIan Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said the agreement was \"welcome news\".\nBut he added: \"The increased cost of buying CO2 is yet another burden on the food and drink industry, which is already facing enormous stresses. \n\"This will, of course, add more pressure on prices for shoppers and diners.\"\nBy Ben King, business reporter\nIt looks like there will be enough CO2 to keep Christmas beers bubbly - but after that, there are no guarantees.  \nThere's an ominous line in the CF Industries press release. They expect CO2 users to develop \"robust alternative sources\" between now and January. \nThat won't be easily done. Lots of industrial processes produce CO2, but few produce a stream so pure and reliable that you'd want to dissolve it in your lemonade. \nDistributor Nippon Gases has warned that supply is tight across Europe, so imports will be hard to come by. \nThe government says that the firms which need the CO2 from Billingham will be paying more for it - and whatever long-term solution does emerge, it's likely to be more expensive too.\nBut the UK only needs about 600,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. At about \u00a3200 a tonne before the current crisis, that's about \u00a3120m, relatively small beer for industries that count their turnover in the billions.\nCompared to the other pressures those industries face - staff shortages, and higher costs for energy and shipping - more expensive CO2 is an extra cost they don't need, but it won't be their biggest headache. \nWhen CF shut its facilities after making fertiliser became uneconomic because of the rising price of wholesale gas, it cut off a vital source of CO2 for other sectors.\nSupermarkets began reporting limited stocks of some food items, while the pig industry warned that if slaughterhouses could not process animals, then farmers would have to cull their stocks.\nThe US firm said it now expected the UK government and industrial gas customers to \"develop robust alternative sources of CO2 as part of a long-term solution for meeting demand in the country\".\nLast month, it emerged the British food industry would be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with CF Industries to restart production in the UK. \nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from \u00a3200 per tonne to \u00a31,000.\nHouseholds, too, are being hit by higher energy bills, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by \u00a3139 to \u00a31,277 a year on average.  \nSeveral energy suppliers, unable to pass on wholesale prices to consumers on fixed deal, have gone out of business. Their customers have been switched to other suppliers, but will be put on variable contracts that will be higher than previous deals. \nMeanwhile, the business department has sent the Treasury a formal request for support for energy-intensive industries hit by high gas prices, the BBC understands. \nIt came after talks between ministers and industry leaders earlier on Monday.\nA source said: \"Everyone in government understands the importance of this situation.\n\"We need to solve this quickly.\"\nDetails of the proposal from Mr Kwarteng have not been disclosed but are thought to focus on a temporary solution to high energy prices. \nOn Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was \"critical\" and said he was \"looking to find a solution\".\nMr Kwarteng said there were Treasury talks about support measures to ease the impact on firms. However, a Treasury source later said the business secretary had been \"mistaken\".\nSectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Cardiff,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Protests against Covid vaccines are \"crazy nonsense\", the South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner has said. \nAlun Michael said he was \"very angry\" after protesters in Cardiff intimidated a 15-year-old girl at a mass vaccination centre on Saturday.\nMr Michael said police had to protect the right to protest, but also questioned why some were \"completely ignoring the evidence on vaccination\".\nHe said one arrest had been made at the protest.\nGrace Barker-Earle, who has used a wheelchair since contracting Covid, was confronted after receiving a Covid jab at the centre. \nHer mother, Angela, said protesters accused her of using Grace as a \"lab rat\". \nOther parents said they felt \"shaken up\" by protesters.\nOne woman, who did not want to be named, said her car was blocked by a group of protesters while driving her 12-year-old son to the centre for his jab. \nShe said: \"They were shouting at you, it was incredibly intimidating, my son was really scared\u2026 we were both in tears by the end of it.\nShe said the group were shouting \"horrible stuff\", as if she were \"doing something horrendous\".\"By the time we got in the centre we were shaky, we considered not going in\u2026 we were so freaked out by it we wanted to come home.\n\"The staff in the centre were really nice to us, I told them we were shaken up and they did tell us that one of the male nurses had been called a child murderer on his way to work.\"\nAnother parent, whose twin sons got the jab at the centre on Saturday, said he had a woman shout abuse \"inches\" from his face. \nThe man, who also did not want to be named, said protesters held up anti-vaccine banners to the windows of the vaccination centre, before shouting abuse at his family when they left. \nHe said: \"We went to go and they started chanting. \n\"I said 'you've absolutely got the right to your opinion but we've got the right to ours as well'. Then they just started shouting abuse... really vindictive stuff.\n\"All they wanted to do was shout abuse and not listen.\"\nRuth Clogg from Dinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan, said the experience of taking her 15-year-old daughter for her vaccine was \"very intimidating\".\n\"They shouted 'shame on you as a mother' which wasn't pleasant, we all have choices and my choice was to let my daughter have the jab,\" she said.\n\"Why do they feel they have to shout it out and say things to me as a mother? I'm just protecting my daughter.\"\nIn Wales, the vaccine has been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds since 4 October. Public Health Wales figures show 34,325 people in that age group, or 23.4%, have been given a vaccine dose.\nAlun Michael told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast he would support police action which protected people from intimidation while doing what is right for public health. \n\"I'm very angry about the attitude of these particular protesters, because what they're protesting about is crazy nonsense,\" he said. \n\"It could put some people off being vaccinated and clearly it's unacceptable in the sort of example that's mentioned.\n\"It's a difficult balance because it's a matter for the whole of society. \n\"Why is it that we have this group of individuals who are completely ignoring the evidence about vaccination? But the responsibility of the police is to keep that balance right.\"\nMr Michael said he walked past the vaccination centre on Saturday and saw police were making sure the protest stayed within the law, but protesters were using slogans which were \"intended to intimidate\" both parents taking their children for jabs and the media. \nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford also condemned the actions at the protest, as did Economy Minister and MS for Cardiff South and Penarth, Vaughan Gething, who said it was \"disgraceful\" and \"did not look defensible\". \nMr Gething said: \"A lot of people protesting say they are protesting to try to protect freedom. Well that doesn't look to me like people who are committed to respecting each other's freedom.\"\nDr Bnar Talabani, a doctor from Cardiff who has been tackling vaccine misinformation on TikTok, drove past the protest on Saturday. \nShe said: \"I heard from the staff earlier that day that it wasn't just this poor girl they were intimidating they were actually intimidating older people that were trying to walk in to have their vaccine as well.\n\"They were saying things like 'it's an experimental vaccine, you're a guinea pig, stop letting them use you as a lab rat' - all the conspiracy theories that I've seen on social media over the past 18 months. \n\"Conspiracy theories that have been debunked so many times but there is a very small minority of people that are still spreading this misinformation and it's doing a lot of damage.\"\nFrancis Goncalves, from Cardiff, lost three unvaccinated family members to Covid within a week of each other earlier this year, said the protests were \"disgusting\" and \"despicable\". \nHe said those who are sceptical of the vaccine to speak to their doctors for advice. \nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

      "tags": "Barking",
      "text": "A detective investigating the circumstances of serial killer Stephen Port's first homicide felt that the case was likely to be one of murder and told senior officers of his concerns.\nAnthony Walgate, 23, was found dead outside Port's flat block in June 2014.\nDet Ch Insp Tony Kirk tried to establish a murder inquiry, an email shown to an inquest jury revealed.\nPort would go on to murder three more men using the date rape drug GHB before homicide detectives took on the case.\nThe inquest jury at Barking Town Hall also heard evidence from Det Ch Insp Christopher Jones, the senior murder detective involved in the case in the week after the death.\nDet Ch Insp Jones told the hearing it was \"not possible\" that detectives would have taken the case less seriously because Mr Walgate was \"young, gay and working as an escort\".\nThe jury, which is examining the Metropolitan Police's handling of the investigation, heard Det Ch Insp Kirk's email was sent a week after Mr Walgate's body was found outside Port's flat in Cooke Street in Barking, east London.\nIt set out that it was known to the force that Port, now 46, had lied to officers about not knowing Mr Walgate, who he had in fact arranged to meet two days before the killing. \nA post-mortem examination found that the 23-year-old died as a result of ingesting high levels of the date rape drug GHB.\nThe jury heard how Det Ch Insp Kirk pointed out in his email that Port had previously had an allegation made against him that he had drugged and raped another man, and had no means of paying the \u00a3800 Mr Walgate charged for his work as an escort - which was how the two men came to meet each other.\nIn the message, to Supt John Sweeney of Homicide Command, Det Ch Insp Kirk said: \"I feel we as an organisation have a duty to his (Mr Walgate's) friends and family to get to the bottom of his death in what are increasingly suspicious circumstances.\n\"This investigation concerns the death of a young and what appears to be a fit and healthy male and, on the balance of probabilities, at the hands of another. \n\"I appreciate that a murder charge might not be the final outcome, but the investigation is becoming increasingly complex.\"\nSupt Sweeney decided to leave the investigation with the less experienced detectives in the Barking borough command, the inquest heard.\nJurors were also told that detectives did not then carry out a vital download of Port's laptop requested by the homicide team. \nThe laptop, which had been seized by police, contained evidence of him using search terms to do with drugging and raping boys, the inquest heard.\nThe paramedic who found Mr Walgate's body previously told the jury he had regarded it as an \"unexplained suspicious death\".\nSpeaking on Monday, Det Ch Insp Jones explained that in his opinion at the time, the death was unexplained - but he said he had not been told the post-mortem examination had found bruises suggesting Mr Walgate had been moved while he was still alive. \nNor had he been told that dead man's underpants were inside out and back to front, the jury heard.\nPort's next two victims, Gabriel Kovari, 22, and Daniel Whitworth, 21, were found dead by the same dog-walker three weeks apart beneath a large maple tree in a corner of the same cemetery, at St Margaret's Church.\nMr Kovari's body was found on 28 August 2014 and Mr Whitworth's was discovered on 20 September, in almost exactly the same spot.\nThe final victim, aspiring police officer Jack Taylor, 25, was found near the cemetery on 14 September 2015.\nIn 2016, Port was found guilty at the Old Bailey of the four murders and sentenced to a whole-life order.\nThe inquest hearing continues."

She said they would come to the UK in two to three weeks.\nLeeds United and Chelsea are among a number of British football clubs who have promised to support them in the UK.\nThe young squad members have all been through an extraordinary ordeal.\nMost of them are from Herat in western Afghanistan and had made their way to Kabul when the Western airlift started, staying in safe houses.\n\"Seventy percent of them had received death threats,\" said Ms Gill. \"They were terrified.\"\nAfghanistan's former women's team was airlifted to Australia and the girls' team were later given asylum in Portugal. But the fate of the development squad was uncertain - until now.\nThe girls, along with their coaches and family members, had been due to be evacuated to Qatar at the end of August. They were almost within sight of the airport when they were pulled off their buses because of security warnings. Two hours later, the airport was attacked by a suicide bomber.\nAfter 10 days in hiding, they were eventually driven to the Afghan border, and crossed into Pakistan after being given personal permission to enter by Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nBut with their Pakistani visas about to run out, Ms Gill said, the \"platform was burning\" because it would have been far too dangerous for them to return to Afghanistan.\nWomen have not been able to take part in any sports since the Taliban takeover. The former women's football team captain, Khalida Popal, had warned players to burn their kits and delete social media images of them playing for fear of retribution from the Taliban."

      "text": "Covid passes have been extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls in Wales.\nThe new rule comes into effect from Monday.\nPeople in Wales already required an NHS Covid pass to legally enter nightclubs and large events.\nAnyone aged over 18 is required to show the pass to prove they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 24 hours.\nSo how do you get a Covid pass, how will they work and how does Wales compare with the rest of the UK?\nAnyone who is aged over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result in the previous 48 hours, can get a pass.\nHowever they are only compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter:\nPasses are also a way of proving you do not need to self-isolate, if you have been identified as a close contact of a positive Covid case and can be used when travelling abroad.\nThe Welsh government says any venue that can serve alcohol, is open between midnight and 05:00 and where music is provided for dancing will need to check for passes.\nThat means it could cover other venues not traditionally considered nightclubs that have a late licence.\nVenues can either apply the pass rules from when they open their doors, or when they open their dancefloor.\nThe NHS Covid Pass is available digitally but you need to register for an NHS login via the website.\nYou will need to upload a photo of your ID (passport, full UK driving licence, full European driving licence). \nThis will allow you to produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, a computer or laptop.\nYour NHS Covid Pass includes a barcode. The expiry date refers to the barcode and will update automatically. It does not apply to your vaccination status.\nIt's worth noting that in Wales, you cannot get the pass via the NHS app, as this is only valid in England. This is also different to the NHS Covid-19 app which alerts you if you've been close to someone with the virus.\nIf you do not have photographic ID you will need to request a paper NHS Covid certificate.\nCall 0300 303 5667 for a paper copy at least five days after your final dose.\nIt is an offence to deliberately use a fake Covid pass or produce a fake lateral flow test (LFT).\nPeople caught using fake LFTs or a fake Covid pass could be given a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) of \u00a360.\nThis can be reduced to \u00a330 if paid within 14 days, but if it's not a first offence the FPN would double to \u00a3120.\nIf there is any doubt about whether documents are real, the Welsh government said a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) should be contacted.\nIf venues do not follow the rules, they could receive an improvement or closure notice, FPN or be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nPasses have been freely available for some time and venues could already read it with existing technology.\nBut if they don't have the verifier app, they may judge them by sight.\nFestivals, such as Green Man in the Brecon Beacons, have already been using the system.\nWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said: \"These measures are examples of what Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] calls low-cost interventions, which may be enough to prevent the need for tougher restrictions later on.\"\nCouncil enforcement teams will work with businesses to check they are following the rules.\nFor those people living close to the border, your GP may actually be in England.\nIn that case you may need to use the NHS App system for England.\nSince 1 October, people in Scotland have needed a Covid vaccination certificate to enter nightclubs, adult entertainment venues and large-scale events.\nThe UK government decided not to go ahead with vaccine passports in England, despite saying they would be introduced at the end of September.\nBut they might be considered again later, if there is a Covid surge over the winter.\nNorthern Ireland has not yet announced whether it will introduce a similar scheme.\nThe rules also apply to those coming to Wales. The idea is that visiting teams will let fans know.\nThere may be some flexibility on checks to avoid long queues outside stadiums. \nBut venues should be ready to work with the police and councils to decide when it is reasonable to relax checks.\nIt renews for 30 days every time you download it.\nThis has been a tricky one that the cabinet has been wrestling with, having met four times to debate the issue.\nThe first minister said they were \"acutely aware\" of the implications for civil liberties and were giving relevant sectors time to prepare before passes were introduced on 11 October.\nHowever, he added people also had rights to live in a society where everyone takes \"reasonable measures\" to keep each other safe.\nThe Welsh government also hopes introducing Covid passes will improve vaccination rates, particularly among younger people.\nJodie Beck, from human rights group Liberty, said: \"While we welcome the decision to not exclude those who have not received the vaccine from attending large events, the introduction of a vaccine pass in Wales still sets a dangerous precedent.\n\"Vaccine passports under any name mean more coercion and division, and risk creating a two-tier society where people who are already marginalised will see their rights and autonomy most affected.\"\nGenerally, no. The Welsh government wanted to avoid excluding those who have not had, or been able to have, a vaccine by including those with a recent negative test.\nHowever, workers, performers and so on, will not require a pass as there are already rules in place for employers to safeguard workers."

      "tags": "Companies,Plastic,Tomatoes,Plastic pollution,Agriculture,Inflation,Global trade,Climate change,Food,Coronavirus pandemic,Food packaging",
      "text": "People will have to get used to higher food prices, the boss of Kraft Heinz has told the BBC.\nMiguel Patricio said the international food giant, which makes tomato sauce and baked beans, was putting up prices in several countries.\nUnlike in previous years, he said, inflation was \"across the board\".\nThe cost of ingredients such as cereals and oils has pushed global food prices to a 10-year high, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nKraft Heinz has increased prices on more than half its products in the US, its home market, and Mr Patricio admitted that is happening elsewhere too.\n\"We are raising prices, where necessary, around the world,\" he said.\nDuring the pandemic, many countries saw production of raw materials, ranging from crops to vegetable oils, fall. Measures to control the virus, as well as illness, limited output and delivery. \nAs economies have restarted, the supply of these products hasn't been able to keep up with returning demand, leading to higher prices. Higher wages and energy prices have also added to the burden for manufacturers.\nMr Patricio said this broad range of factors was contributing to the rising cost of food. \n\"Specifically in the UK, with the lack of truck drivers. In [the] US logistic costs also increased substantially, and there's a shortage of labour in certain areas of the economy.\"\nMr Patricio said that consumers would need to get used to higher food prices, given that the world's population was rising whilst the amount of land on which to grow food was not.\nIn the longer term \"there's a lot to come in technology to improve the effectiveness of farmers\" that will help, he said.\nNot all cost increases should be passed on to consumers, Mr Patricio said. Firms would have to absorb some of the rise in costs.\n\"I think it's up to us, and to the industry, and to the other companies, to try to minimise these price increases,\" he said.  \nBut big food producers like Kraft Heinz, Nestle and PepsiCo \"will most likely have to pass that cost on to consumers\" according to Kona Haque, head of research at the agricultural commodities firm ED&F Man.\n\"Whether it's corn, sugar, coffee, soybeans, palm oil, you name it, all of these basic food commodities have been rising,\" she said.\n\"Poor harvests in Brazil, which is one of the world's biggest agricultural exporters, drought in Russia, reduced planting in the US and stockpiling in China have combined with more expensive fertiliser, energy and shipping costs to push prices up.\" \nBut she said food producers would all be affected and would therefore all be raising prices in similar ways: \"because it's so widespread that everyone will do it, meaning they probably won't lose customers\".\nThis week PespsiCo warned it was also facing rising costs on everything from transport to raw ingredients, and said that further prices rises were likely at the start of next year.\nHowever, as well as pushing up costs, the pandemic did help boost sales for some Kraft Heinz brands, Mr Patricio said, because staying in meant \"people are cooking far more than they were before\".  \nCustomers in the UK bought more Heinz Baked Beans, while customers in the US bought more Kraft Mac & Cheese. Overall sales rose 1.6% to $13bn in the first half of this year, representing a slight slowdown. The results were described by Erin Lash, at the investment firm Morningstar, as \"still quite impressive relative to the comparable pre-pandemic period in 2019\".\nThe company is also undergoing an extensive restructuring under Mr Patricio, involving selling some old, and buying some new brands, which Ms Lash said was \"narrowing its focus and increasing its spending on innovation and marketing\" which would support future sales.\nMr Patricio said the firm was also spending significant sums on developing new packaging to meet its aims on reducing plastic waste.\nMost of the 650 million bottles of ketchup the firm sells every year are plastic, for example. But Mr Patricio said the firm was \"encouraging\" customers to buy glass bottles even though they are less convenient \"because you have to tap on the bottom\". \nHe added: \"We are working hard, not only on the plastic bottles, but everywhere in our footprint that has plastic.\"\nCampaigners against plastic waste would like to see a reduction in the use of single serving sachets.\nHowever following a shortage of sachets during the pandemic, as consumers bought more takeaways from restaurants, Kraft Heinz has invested in expanding production of them by 30%.\n\"Thanks God we did that, because now we don't have that [shortage] problem anymore\", said Mr Patricio. But he said the company was working on a solution \"to cutting the amount of plastic they use\". \nYou can watch Miguel Patricio's full interview on \"Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst\"  on BBC World News on  Sunday 10 October at 05:30 and 16:30 GMT, Monday 07:30 GMT and 16:30 GMT and Thursday at 07:30 GMT."

      "text": "Journalists Maria Ressa, from the Philippines, and Dmitry Muratov, from Russia, have won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for their \"efforts to safeguard freedom of expression\".\nWhy are the organisation's prizes so prestigious, and who are some of the previous winners?\nFormer US President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, for \"his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples\".\nPresident Obama said he was \"surprised and deeply humbled\" and would use it as a \"call to action\". However, there was criticism of his award, especially as he had only been in office for 12 days before the nomination deadline.\nOther notable winners include former US President Jimmy Carter (2002); child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014); the European Union (2012); the United Nations and its then-general-secretary, Kofi Annan, (shared 2001); and Saint Teresa of Calcutta (1979).\nAlbert Einstein (physics 1921),Marie Curie (physics 1903 and chemistry 1911), and Harold Pinter (literature 2005) have also received Nobel prizes.\nTwo people - author and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1964 and Vietnamese politician Le Duc Tho in 1973 - rejected the prize, and four others were forced to decline by their countries.\nIn 2016, there was uncertainty over whether singer Bob Dylan would accept the literature award before he finally delivered his lecture for the prize in June 2017.\nThe Nobel prizes are a series of annual awards given in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace.\nThey are awarded to people \"who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind\" in the previous 12 months.\nThe quote is from the will of Swedish businessman - and inventor of dynamite - Alfred Nobel. He left most of his fortune in a fund to launch the awards, which were first presented in 1901.\nIn 1968, an economic sciences prize was added by Sweden's central bank, although it does not count as a Nobel prize.\nDifferent organisations award the prize in each category every year. Five of the six are chosen in Sweden, while the Nobel Peace Prize is selected in Norway. \nAcademics, university professors, scientists, previous winners and others all submit nominations. Under the Nobel Foundation's rules, the shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years. \nPrize winners are called laureates, to signify the laurel wreath given to victors of contests in ancient Greece.\nMore than one, but no more than three, people can win each prize.\nThere have been some years when the prize has not been awarded - mostly during the two world wars.\nAnd Nobel Foundation rules state if nobody deserves the prize in a particular category, it is not awarded and its prize money is kept for the following year.\nThe recipient of each prize receives three things:\nThe prizes are presented at ceremonies on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, in Stockholm and Oslo.\nMarie and Pierre Curie used their physics prize money in 1903 for further scientific research, and 2006 physics winner John Mather donated his cash to his foundation.\nIn 1993, British biochemist Richard Roberts spent his medicine winnings on a croquet lawn, while fellow 1993 laureate Phillip Sharp bought a 100-year-old Federal-style house. The 2001 medicine winner, Sir Paul Nurse, bought himself a high-end motorbike.\nMeanwhile, 2006 literature laureate Orhan Pamuk established a museum in Istanbul."

      "text": "For almost 50 years, Sir Paul McCartney has shouldered the blame for breaking up the Beatles.\nThe supposed evidence was a press release for his 1970 solo album, McCartney, where he revealed he was on a \"break\" from rock's biggest band.\nInterviewing himself, Sir Paul said he could not \"foresee a time when Lennon-McCartney becomes an active songwriting partnership again\".\nBut in a new BBC interview, he has said the split was prompted by John Lennon.\n\"I didn't instigate the split. That was our Johnny,\" he told interviewer John Wilson. \"I am not the person who instigated the split. \n\"Oh no, no, no. John walked into a room one day and said I am leaving the Beatles. And he said, 'It's quite thrilling, it's rather like a divorce.' And then we were left to pick up the pieces.\"\nWilson asked whether the band would have continued if Lennon hadn't walked away.\n\"It could have,\" Sir Paul replied. \n\"The point of it really was that John was making a new life with Yoko and he wanted... to lie in bed for a week in Amsterdam for peace. You couldn't argue with that. It was the most difficult period of my life.\"\n\"This was my band, this was my job, this was my life,\" he added. \"I wanted it to continue. I thought we were doing some pretty good stuff - Abbey Road, Let It Be, not bad - and I thought we could continue.\"\nSir Paul said confusion over The Beatles' break-up festered because the band's new manager Allen Klein - who he refused to align with - said he needed time to tie up loose ends with their business. \n\"So for a few months we had to pretend,\" he told Wilson. \"It was weird because we all knew it was the end of the Beatles but we couldn't just walk away.\"\nSir Paul ended up suing the rest of the band in the high court, seeking the dissolution of their contractual relationship in order to keep their music out of Klein's hands.\n\"I had to fight and the only way I could fight was in suing the other Beatles, because they were going with Klein,\" he told Wilson. \n\"And they thanked me for it years later. But I didn't instigate the split.\"\nHe has previously said that archival projects like The Beatles Anthology and Peter Jackson's forthcoming documentary, Get Back, would never have been possible without his legal action.\nSir Paul's full interview will be heard on the new BBC Radio 4 series This Cultural Life, which will be broadcast on 23 October.\nThe following Monday, recordings of the musician reading from his new book, The Lyrics, will also be available on BBC Sounds.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Police say they found a bag of cash containing $22,450 (\u00a316,500) in the car.\nMr Owensby has not been charged over any drug-related offences.\nDuring the incident, Mr Owensby repeatedly refuses requests to leave the car, although officers do say they will help him out.\nMr Owensby asks an officer to call in a \"white shirt\", meaning a superior.\n\"Here's the thing, I'm going to pull you out and then I'll call a white shirt,\" an officer replies.\nAs his frustration increases, he says: \"You can co-operate and get out of the car or I'll drag you out of the car.

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "tags": "NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures, a report by MPs says.\nThe government approach - backed by its scientists - was to try to manage the situation and in effect achieve herd immunity by infection, it said.\nThis led to a delay in introducing the first lockdown, costing thousands of lives, the MPs found.\nBut their report highlighted successes too, including the vaccination rollout.\nIt described the approach to vaccination - from the research and development through to the rollout of the jabs - as \"one of the most effective initiatives in UK history\".\nBut campaigners criticised the report for failing to focus on those who had died, saying references to practical issues, including problems with laptops, was \"laughable\".\nThe 150-page document, Coronavirus: Lessons learned to date, is from the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, and MPs from all parties.\nIt predominantly focused on the response to the pandemic in England. The committees did not look at steps taken individually by Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nThe MPs called the pandemic, which has claimed more than 150,000 lives in the UK and nearly five million worldwide so far, the \"biggest peacetime challenge\" for a century.\nSome early failings, the report suggested, resulted from apparent \"group-think\" among scientists and ministers.\nIt meant the UK was not as open to different approaches on earlier lockdowns, border controls and test and trace as it should have been.\nA woman whose twin sisters died within three days of one another after testing positive for Covid says the report from MPs uses the success of the vaccine programme to deflect from earlier failures.\nZoe Davis' sisters Katy and Emma, who were both nurses, died in April 2020.\nShe says: \"Nobody is saying that the vaccine programme hasn't been phenomenal but the frustrating thing is that's a deflection of what is actually being brought to attention and the overall message is that Covid failures have cost lives.\"\nLindsay Jackson, from Derbyshire, whose mother died with Covid, said the report confirmed her fears she had about care home visits in March 2020.\n\"I knew in my own mind the lockdown was too slow, I knew the social care sector wasn't being looked after, I knew people shouldn't have been released from hospital without tests, and this just confirms that.\"\nShe is calling for the government to move to a public inquiry now to see if anyone is culpable.\nConservative MPs Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark, who chair the committees, said the nature of the pandemic meant it was \"impossible to get everything right\". \n\"The UK has combined some big achievements with some big mistakes. It is vital to learn from both,\" they said.\nCabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay said scientific advice had been followed and the government had made \"difficult judgements\" to protect the NHS.\nHe said the government took responsibility for everything that happened - saying the government would not shy away from any lessons to be learned at the full statutory public inquiry, expected next year.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the report was a \"damning indictment\" and showed the errors and failures of running down the NHS before the pandemic.\nHe called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to apologise to the bereaved and hold the public inquiry as soon as possible. \nWhen Covid hit, the government's approach was to manage its spread through the population rather than try to stop it - or herd immunity by infection as the report called it.\nThe MPs said this was based on dealing with a flu pandemic, and was done on the advice of its scientific advisers on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). \nBut the idea was not challenged enough by ministers in any part of the UK. Although other parts of Europe were guilty of this too, the MPs added.\nToo little was done in the early weeks to stop Covid spreading, the MPs said, despite evidence from China and then Italy that it was a virus that was highly infectious, caused severe illness and had no cure.\n\"The veil of ignorance through which the UK viewed the initial weeks of the pandemic was partly self-inflicted,\" the report said.\nAsked whether herd immunity had been a policy in the early days, Mr Hunt said he did not think there was any desire for the whole population to be infected.\nHowever, he said there was a \"fatalism that it was likely that in the end, that will be the only way that we will stop the progress of the virus\".\nDecisions on lockdowns and social distancing during those early weeks - and the advice that led to them - were described as \"one of the most important public health failures the UK has ever experienced\".\nThe advice from scientists changed on 16 March 2020 - with a lockdown announced a week later.\n\"This slow and gradualist approach was not inadvertent, nor did it reflect bureaucratic delay or disagreement between ministers and their advisers,\" the report said, describing it as a \"deliberate policy\".\n\"It is now clear that this was the wrong policy, and that it led to a higher initial death toll than would have resulted from a more emphatic early policy. In a pandemic spreading rapidly and exponentially, every week counted.\"\nA Liverpool FC and Atletico Madrid football match on 11 March - as a pandemic was declared by the WHO - and the Cheltenham Festival of Racing between 10 and 13 March, may have spread the virus.\nMr Barclay said hindsight was \"an issue\". Had the government known how much the country would be willing to endure, lockdown may have come sooner, the minister added.\nThe MPs also highlighted how ministers in England rejected scientific advice to have a two-week \"circuit-breaker\" in the autumn.\nThey said it was impossible to know whether that would have prevented the second lockdown in November, although they pointed out it had not in Wales.\nThe UK was one of the first countries in the world to develop a test for Covid in January 2020, but failed to translate that into an effective test-and-trace system during the first year of the pandemic, the report said.\nTesting in the community stopped in March 2020 and for weeks during the first peak only those admitted to hospital were tested.\nIt was not until May that the NHS Test and Trace system was launched in England, but the report described its start as \"slow, uncertain and often chaotic\".\nIt said the system was too centralised, only later making use of the expertise in local public health teams run by councils.\nBut it praised the target set by then Health Secretary Matt Hancock to get to 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, saying it played an important part in galvanising the system.\nThe greatest praise though was reserved for the vaccination programme and the way the government supported the development of a number of vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nIt said the whole programme was one of the most effective initiatives in history, and will ultimately help to save millions of lives here and across the world.\nA key step, taken early on following a suggestion from chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, was to set up a task force that combined the talents of scientists, the NHS and the private sector, led by the \"bold leadership\" of venture capitalist Kate Bingham.\nThe development of treatments, such as dexamethasone, for Covid through the UK Recovery Trial was another area where the UK's response was genuinely world-leading, the report said. \nAnd the NHS and government were also credited with the way hospital intensive care capacity was increased to ensure the majority who needed hospital treatment received it.\nThe report's recommendations include comprehensive government plans for future emergencies, a bigger role for the armed forces in emergency response plans, and considering a government and NHS volunteer reserve database.\nThe MPs said the pandemic had also exacerbated existing social, economic and health inequalities which would need addressing.\nThe report highlighted \"unacceptably high\" death rates in ethnic minority groups and among people with learning disabilities and autism.\nFor ethnic minorities, there were a variety of factors, including possible biological reasons and increased exposure because of housing and working conditions. \nFor people with learning disabilities, not enough thought was given to how restrictions would have a detrimental impact on them - particularly in terms of accessing health care more generally. Do not resuscitate orders were also used inappropriately.\nThere was a lack of priority attached to care homes too at the start of the pandemic.\nThe rapid discharge of people from hospital into care homes without adequate testing or isolation was a prime example of this.\nThis, combined with untested staff bringing infection into homes from the community, led to many thousands of deaths which could have been avoided.\nScience minister George Freeman said it was too early for any proper discussion about blame or fault.\nAsked about the higher UK death toll, he said: \"A lot of that is actually to do with the very, very heavy obesity-related cardiometabolic chronic disease cohort that we've been carrying for years - that's a failure of public health in this country over decades.\"\nLobby Akinnola, of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said Mr Freeman's comments were \"grossly offensive\", adding that \"the statutory inquiry cannot come soon enough\".\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "The US has agreed to provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, the country's Taliban rulers say. \nThe statement came at the end of their first direct talks, in Qatar, since US troops left Afghanistan in August.\nAside from aid, the talks focused on containing extremist groups and the evacuation of US citizens. \nUS officials described the discussions as candid and professional, but added that the Taliban would be judged by their actions. \nThe US insisted the meeting did not amount to recognition of the Taliban. \nIn a statement issued on Sunday night, the Taliban said: \"US representatives stated that they will give humanitarian assistance to Afghans and will provide facilities for other humanitarian organisations to deliver aid.\" \nIt added that the Taliban would \"co-operate with charitable groups in delivering the humanitarian assistance to those deserving transparently, and will facilitate the principled movement of foreign nationals\". \nHowever, the US has yet to formally confirm the Taliban's claim on aid. \nSpokesperson Ned Price said that the two sides had discussed the provision \"of robust humanitarian assistance, directly to the Afghan people,\" without providing further details. \n\"The US delegation focused on security and terrorism concerns and safe passage for US citizens, other foreign nationals and our Afghan partners, as well as human rights, including the meaningful participation of women and girls in all aspects of Afghan society\", he said. \nThe talks were held as Afghanistan faces what aid workers fear is a severe humanitarian crisis. \nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned at a donor conference last month in Geneva that the poverty rate was soaring and public services were close to collapse. \nSome 40% of the country's GDP - national output - comes from aid, according to the World Bank. \nThe US froze $10bn (\u00a37.3bn) of the country's central bank assets after the Taliban captured Kabul on 15 August. \nFor the poor in Kabul, the priority is staving off starvation, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen recently reported from the Afghan capital. \nAt the Qatar meeting, the Taliban ruled out co-operation with Washington on tackling the activities of the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (IS-K). \nThe Taliban's spokesperson in Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, told the Associated Press that they were able to tackle the threat independently.\nAn IS-K suicide bomb attack on a mosque in the northern city of Kunduz killed at least 50 people on Friday in the deadliest attack since US troops left the country. \nMore than 100 others were injured in the blast at the Said Abad mosque, used by the minority Shia Muslim community."

      "tags": "Republic of Ireland,Simon Coveney,UK government,European Union,Brexit,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson",
      "text": "Ireland's foreign minister has accused the UK of repeatedly dismissing EU proposals on the Northern Ireland Protocol before they are published.\nThis is happening again this week but it is now \"more serious\", Simon Coveney has warned. \nThe protocol is the special Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, which the UK and EU agreed in 2019.\nUnionists argue it creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nThey say it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the UK.\nThe EU will bring forward proposals on Wednesday for reforming the protocol.\nThe proposals will focus on easing practical problems with the movement of goods from Britain to Northern Ireland, rather than changing oversight arrangements.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has threatened to pull his party out of Stormont over the protocol, said on Monday that this week was important.\n\"Let's see what people have to put on the table,\" he said. \n\"Let's see that intensive negotiation take place and then we'll make our judgements on the outcome against the tests that we have set and determine what action we should take.\"\nMr Coveney told RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland programme that the UK's dismissals were now \"more serious\", given the comprehensive compromise proposals the EU is bringing forward.\n\"Each time the EU comes forward with new ideas, new proposals to try to solve problems, they are dismissed before they are released and that is happening again this week,\" Mr Coveney said.\nHe said dismissals were being seen across the EU as \"the same pattern, over and over again\" by the UK.\nAt the weekend, Mr Coveney warned UK demands on the Northern Ireland Protocol could cause \"a breakdown in relations\" with the EU.\nHe made the comments after the UK reiterated that it wants the European Court of Justice (ECJ) removed from oversight of the deal.\nMr Coveney said this was the creation of a new \"red line\" which the EU cannot move on.\nThe European Commission said the ECJ's role in the protocol was ground that has been covered \"a million times\".\nIts chief spokesperson, Eric Mamer, told a briefing on Monday that the EU's position on this issue remained \"extremely clear\".\nHe said it was looking for solutions to the practical issues that affect the daily lives of people.\nMr Mamer said the commission wanted to be constructive and open, \"but in the framework of the agreement as it has been signed\".\nOn Tuesday, the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost will give a speech in which he is expected to tell diplomats that removing the ECJ's role in dispute settlement is necessary to sustain the protocol.\nHe is due to say: \"Without new arrangements in this area the protocol will never have the support it needs to survive.\n\"The role of the ECJ in Northern Ireland and the consequent inability of the UK government to implement the very sensitive arrangements in the protocol in a reasonable way has created a deep imbalance in the way the protocol operates.\"\nThere are two schools of thought about how this latest negotiation is shaping up.\nThe first is that Lord Frost's hard line on the ECJ is standard pre-negotiation tactics, aimed at grinding out another concession or two.\nAfter all the Brexit process has always delivered a deal, even at times when it seemed improbable.\nThere is another view, hinted at by Simon Coveney, that maybe the UK doesn't want a deal unless it's total victory.\nUnder that scenario the UK would go through the motions before triggering Article 16.\nIt would use this to gut the protocol while calculating that the EU's ability to retaliate is limited or or at least would take a long time to amount to anything.\nWe should find out which view is right by the end of this year.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said on Monday that his party had concerns around the jurisdiction of the ECJ.\n\"We do not believe they are fully independent when it comes to arbitrating on issues related to trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union,\" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \n\"We recognise why the government has that concern, but the government in the end, they are the negotiating party and they have to press these issues.\"\nHowever, the chief executive of Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, said business needed clarity and certainty, not \"spats and ultimatums\".\nResponding to the UK's call to have the ECJ removed from oversight of the deal, Mr Kelly said that many businesses across Northern Ireland relied upon single market access enforced by the court to ensure their goods travelled freely and legally right across the EU.\nFormer Ulster Unionist Party leader and UUP MLA Steve Aiken said there were concerns particularly around governance of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nHe said the implications of issues concerning the ECJ, which he said differentiates VAT and state aid rules and regulations, had not yet been seen.\n\"Those are real concerns for us,\" he told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show.\nSinn F\u00e9in assembly member Declan Kearney said \"we are seeing the goal posts shift once more\" in relation to the UK's negotiation strategy.\n\"This may well be a negotiation tactic. \n\"We are now approaching the point where hopefully all of these issues can be successfully covered off and that we can in fact see the difficulties with the protocol finally eliminated, and that David Frost is simply trying to up the ante and bring some more heat into the talks process that will follow publication of the European Union proposals.\" \nSDLP assembly member Matthew O'Toole said from initial reports it appeared that the EU proposals would go \"further than most people in the UK government and even some in unionism and indeed in business were asking for earlier this year\".\n\"That is encouraging, there then needs to be a period of engagement between the UK and the EU to make those work,\" he told Radio Ulster's the Nolan Show.\n\"It is deeply disappointing, however, that the UK government has chosen to pick a fight already over proposals that have not yet been published and proposals that by all accounts are going to be substantial.\"\nTraditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the \"big issue\" was \"the destruction\" of Northern Ireland's links \"with GB and our supply chain\".\n\"The people in the Irish Republic wouldn't accept it if two thirds of their economy laws were made in London,\" he said. \n\"Northern Ireland shouldn't have to accept the fact that two thirds of the laws governing their economy are made in Brussels. That's the constitutional issue.\""

His wife is a high school teacher.\nThe Justice Department said that in April 2020 he sent a package to an unnamed foreign government containing restricted data and a message suggesting a covert relationship, so that they could buy more data from him. \nHe then allegedly began writing to an individual by encrypted email. While he thought this person represented the foreign government, they were actually an FBI agent, the affidavit said.\nAfter several months, the accused couple allegedly made a deal to share secret information in exchange for around $100,000 (\u00a373,000) in cryptocurrency. \nIn June this year, Jonathan and Diana Toebbe travelled to West Virginia to drop off the data.\nWith Diana acting as a lookout, Jonathan \"placed an SD card concealed within half a peanut butter sandwich\" at a determined location, the affidavit said.\nAfter the agent collected the card, they sent payment and received a decryption key to access the SD card. On it was restricted data \"related to submarine nuclear reactors\".\nMr Toebbe then performed a second so-called dead drop - this time hidden inside a chewing gum packet - in August, with yet more secret data on it. \nFBI agents then arrested the couple on Saturday, during a third dead drop.\nThe couple are set to appear in federal court on 12 October.

      "text": "Liberty Steel has secured a \u00a350m cash injection which it says will safeguard 660 jobs at its plant in Rotherham.\nThe deal is part of a wider restructure of GFG Alliance, Liberty's owner, which was forced to seek funding when its key lender, Greensill Capital, collapsed.\nGFG Alliance said the cash would allow the Rotherham plant to reopen this month after being closed since spring.\nCommunity, the steelworkers' union, said it was \"overdue\" but was \"an important step in the right direction\".\nJeffrey Kabel, GFG's chief transformation officer, said: \"The injection of \u00a350m of shareholder funds into Liberty Steel UK is an important step in our restructuring and transformation. \n\"It will help to create sustainable value, ensure that Liberty has the ability to raise and deploy capital quickly in the UK and enable our businesses to demonstrate their potential and agree long-term debt restructuring.\"\nAt the beginning of the year, Liberty Steel employed 3,000 steelworkers in the UK.\nBut its future was thrown into doubt when Greensill collapsed in early March. GFG has been struggling to raise new financing since then, while the majority of its workers have been on furlough.\nIn April, GFG approached the government for help, but the request was rejected by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng.\nGFG, one of the UK's largest industrial groups, is owned by businessman Sanjeev Gupta.\nA further 2,000 people work at other GFG steel sites in the UK.\nGFG said the cash injection would allow Liberty Steel (LSUK) to restart its electric arc furnace at Rotherham.\n\"Production ramp-up will commence in October 2021 with a plan to reach 50,000 tonnes per month as soon as possible,\" it added.\n\"The restart of operations will enable colleagues to return to work, setting the platform for LSUK's longer-term refinancing and delivery of its plan to expand Rotherham's capacity, creating a two million tonnes per annum green steel plant.\"\nNews of the move was welcomed by industry body UK Steel.\nA spokesperson said it was \"really good news for not only the company, but those many thousands of workers and their families, the communities where those jobs a located and of course the whole of the UK steel sector\". \n\"Our friends at Liberty Steel can now fire up those furnaces, make the steel that this economy needs and most importantly give some certainty to the well-paid and highly-skilled workforce.\"\nBut the spokesperson added: \"The last thing the sector needs now is for government to merely sit on its hands and risk an energy crisis becoming a steel industry crisis.\"\nUK Steel called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene on the industry's behalf \"before it is too late\".\nRoy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, said the deal \"demonstrates that GFG can raise funds for the UK\".\n\"Huge challenges remain,\" Mr Rickhuss said. \"But the workforce is ready to get back to making the best steels money can buy and the \u00a350m injection will enable us to restart steelmaking.\"\nMeanwhile, plans are proceeding to sell off GFG's Speciality Steel business, which employs about 750 staff at plants in South Yorkshire.\nGFG said the cash lifeline would help Speciality Steel to \"establish a stable operating environment and create an attractive asset\".\nFurther afield, GFG said it had also agreed a debt restructuring for Liberty's Australian division with Credit Suisse Asset Management.\nGreensill's heavy exposure to Mr Gupta's business had prompted Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to \u00a310bn worth of funds held as security."

It wants governments to declare a \"climate and ecological emergency\" and take immediate action.\nThe group uses an hourglass inside a circle as its logo, to represent time running out for many species. \nIn the UK, Extinction Rebellion has three main demands:\nReducing CO2 emissions to almost zero in such a short period would be extremely ambitious. \nSevere restrictions on flying would be needed. Diets would have to change, by drastically cutting back on meat and dairy. \nAnd there would have to be a massive increase in renewable energy, along with many other radical changes.\nHowever, the group itself doesn't say exactly what the solutions to tackle climate change should be.\nInstead, it wants the government to create a \"citizens' assembly\", made up of ordinary people. They would decide how to solve the climate crisis, with advice from experts. \nThe group often uses disruptive tactics to highlight its demands. \nPolice made 480 arrests during recent protests in London. \nAcross a two-week period in August and September, activists blocked Oxford Circus and erected a giant table in Covent Garden. More than 130 people locked or glued themselves to roads and buildings. \nThis followed previous campaigns across London, Manchester and Cardiff in 2019 and 2020. \nThere have also been protests in other countries:\nInsulate Britain is a recently-launched group calling for a national programme to ensure homes are insulated to be low energy by 2030.\nHundreds of its members have been arrested in recent weeks after blocking major roads in and around London, including motorways.\nIt is supported by some members of Extinction Rebellion and its allied networks - although the groups are not officially integrated. \nInsulate Britain is a much smaller UK-specific campaigning organisation.\nMany of those directly affected by protests have objected to the tactics used by both Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion.\nBoris Johnson has accused both groups of being \"crusties\" who block the streets and cause disruption.\nGreen Party co-leader Carla Denyer said while there was a place for direct action, Insulate Britain was \"not necessarily always doing it in the most constructive way\".\nExtinction Rebellion has said anyone angered by its protests should \"find out more about the severity of the ecological and climate crisis\".\nYounger people are most likely to agree with its aims, according to a survey of over 3,000 people carried out after the London 2019 protests.\nAmong 18 to 24-year-olds, 41% either \"strongly supported\" or \"somewhat supported\" the disruption of traffic and public transport in London to highlight Extinction Rebellion's aims.\nThat compared with 33% of those aged 50-65 and just 26% of over-65s."

      "text": "Cyber-attacks which see hackers get inside computer networks and lock the owners out until they pay a ransom present \"the most immediate danger\" to UK businesses in cyber-space, the head of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned.\nLindy Cameron said her agency, an arm of GCHQ, and the National Crime Agency had assessed that cyber-criminals based in Russia, and its neighbours, were responsible for the most of the \"devastating\" ransomware attacks against the UK.\nShe said these types of attack posed a threat to everyone from major companies to local councils and schools.\nSpeaking at the Chatham House Cyber 2021 conference, Ms Cameron warned that not enough organisations were prepared for the threat or tested their cyber-defences.\nIncreasingly in recent cases, criminal gangs have also threatened to release some of the data they have access to publicly.\nHackney Borough Council was hit by one attack which led to significant disruption to services and IT systems going down for months. \nIreland's Health Service Executive also suffered a significant attack this year, leading to months of disrupted appointments and services.\nRansomware has risen up the agenda in recent months, particularly the United States where an attack on the company Colonial Pipeline led to fuel shortages on the east coast. \nPresident Biden warned President Vladimir Putin about activity that came from gangs within Russia. \nThere had been some signs that Russian-linked activity dipped over the summer but cyber-security experts believe much of that may be to do with the hackers taking their summer holiday rather than any fundamental shift away from what has been a highly-lucrative business model.\nMs Cameron said that ransomware would continue to be attractive while organisations remained vulnerable and were willing to pay. She said the government had been clear that paying ransoms simply emboldened criminal groups. \nAs well as improving its defences, she also said the UK would aim to deliver a \"sustained, proactive\" campaign to disrupt those harming the UK, including ransomware gangs. \nThis would include a range of techniques including the newly established National Cyber Force which can carry out offensive hacking operations.\nIn a wide-ranging speech, Ms Cameron, who has served just over a year as head of the NCSC, said the pandemic continued to cast a shadow over cyber-security and was likely to do so for years to come. \n\"Malicious actors continue to try and access Covid related information, whether that is data on new variants or vaccine procurement plans,\" she said.\n\"Some groups may also seek to use this information to undermine public trust in government responses to the pandemic. And criminals are now regularly using Covid-themed attacks as a way of scamming the public.\"\nShe also made reference to the recent revelations about the Pegasus spyware sold by the company NSO Group, saying that the NCSC has raised a \"red flag\" about the growing commercial market for sophisticated products which can be used to hack into people's phones and carry out surveillance.  \nLast week a UK court ruling found that NSO spyware had been used to hack into the phones of the ex-wife of Dubai's ruler. \n\"We need to avoid a marketplace for vulnerabilities and exploits developing that makes us all less safe,\" she said.\nShe warned of the dangers of \"authoritarian states like China\" having the ability to influence the standards of new technology in a way that undermines the UK's security. She said the UK needed to be \"clear eyed\" and protect itself \"against Chinese practices that have an adverse effect on our own prosperity and security\"."

There were long queues for barbers and nail salons on Monday. \nThe Lord Gladstone Hotel, an inner city pub, was doing a roaring lunch trade after months of limited trading and takeaway-only options.\n\"We're stoked to be back, we're having the best Monday in months, even before Covid,\" Pat Blake, the pub's licensee, told the BBC.\n\"People are just ready to come back and sit down for a schooie [beer], see their friends, be somewhere there's always music playing,\" he said.\n\"The kitchen is pumping.

      "text": "Pope Francis has launched what some describe as the most ambitious attempt at Catholic reform for 60 years.\nA two-year process to consult every Catholic parish around the world on the future direction of the Church began at the Vatican this weekend.\nSome Catholics hope it will lead to change on issues such as women's ordination, married priests and same-sex relationships. \nOthers fear it will undermine the principles of the Church.\nThey say a focus on reform could also distract from issues facing the Church, such as corruption and dwindling attendance levels.\nPope Francis urged Catholics not to \"remain barricaded in our certainties\" but to \"listen to one another\" as he launched the process at Mass in St Peter's Basilica.\n\"Are we prepared for the adventure of this journey? Or are we fearful of the unknown, preferring to take refuge in the usual excuses: 'It's useless' or 'We've always done it this way'?\" he asked.\nThe consultation process, called \"For a Synodal Church: Communion, Participation and Mission\", will work in three stages:\nThe Pope is expected then to write an apostolic exhortation, giving his views and decisions on the issues discussed.\nDiscussing his hopes for the Synod, Pope Francis warned against the process becoming an intellectual exercise that failed to address the real-world issues faced by Catholics and the \"temptation to complacency\" when it comes to considering change.\nThe initiative has been praised by the progressive US-based National Catholic Reporter newspaper, which said that while the process might not be perfect \"the Church is more likely to address the needs of the people of God with it than without it\".\nHowever, theologian George Weigel wrote, in the conservative US Catholic journal First Things, it was unclear how \"two years of self-referential Catholic chatter\" would address other problems the Church such as those who are \"drifting away from the faith in droves\".    \nAnalysis: Church to address modern challenges\nBy John McManus, Religion and Ethics reporter\nMuch of the reporting of this two-year consultation has focused on some of the issues that often appear to dominate reporting on the Catholic Church: the role of women for example, and whether they will ever be ordained as priests (the Pope says \"no\").\nWhile those topics are often of concern to some Catholics, other areas which traditionally dominate Catholic social teaching, such as alleviating poverty, and increasingly, climate change, will likely play a greater part, as will how the Church is run. In reality, any issue can be raised.\nDon't expect any sudden changes to Church rules though. It's true that some Catholics do want to see a different kind of institution, but for Pope Francis, allowing ordinary worshippers to have their concerns (eventually) raised at the Vatican - even if their bishops disagree with them - is a huge step change for this 2000 year-old religion.

      "text": "People in Wales now need an NHS Covid pass to be able to legally attend big events or nightclubs.\nThey are compulsory for over-18s, and show people have either tested negative on a lateral flow test or are fully vaccinated against Covid.\nWales' rugby game against New Zealand on 30 October will be one of the first mass events to require Covid passes.\nSome nightclub bosses said they felt \"singled out\" by the rules, but other people said they felt reassured.\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the new scheme was \"vulnerable to abuse\" but the \"huge bulk of people\" will follow the new rules.\nAsked if people could falsify their lateral flow tests, Mr Drakeford said: \"It is vulnerable to people who want to abuse the system but that's why the law is there.\"\n\"I am quite sure the huge bulk of people will use the lateral flow test in the correct way,\" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain programme.\nHe also rejected claims the new Covid pass was a financial burden for businesses, adding: \"Nightclubs already have to check people for their age. \n\"I don't think the cost issue is a very significant one here.\"\nIn its autumn and winter plan Mr Drakeford's government has not ruled out extending the scheme if further action is needed to tackle Covid rates.\nHe suggested that could include using passes when going to care homes or visiting hospitals.\n\"If numbers in the community continue to rise... being able to show a Covid pass if you were going into a care home might be an extra defence,\" he said.\nWelsh Education Minister Jeremy Miles told BBC Politics Wales that public services were expected to face \"significant pressure\" this winter, and the pass would cut transmission of the virus.\nThe Senedd voted on the passes last Tuesday - a vote the Welsh government said will not be repeated, despite it passing by just one vote.\nAnyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass.\nThey are compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter:\nThe Welsh government says any venue that can serve alcohol, is open between midnight and 0500, and where music is provided for dancing will need to check for passes.\nThat means it could cover other venues not traditionally considered nightclubs which have a late licence.\nVenues can either apply the pass rules from when they open their doors, or when they open their dancefloor.\nNegative tests will be self-certified but the Welsh government plans to make it illegal to fake a negative test.\nLarge events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends.\nThe NHS Covid Pass is available digitally but you need to register for an NHS login via the website.\nYou need to upload a photo of your ID. That can be a passport, full UK driving licence or full European driving licence. \nThis allows you to produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, computer or laptop.\nYour NHS Covid Pass includes a barcode. The expiry date refers to the barcode and will update automatically. It does not apply to your vaccination status.\nIn Wales, you cannot get the pass via the NHS app, as this is only valid in England.\nWales is not the first nation to introduce such a pass.\nIn France, people have had to prove they are fully vaccinated, have recently tested negative or recently recovered from Covid with a \"health pass\". That must be produced on entering cafes, restaurants or public transport.\nScotland is the only other UK nation to use them after they were introduced on 1 October.\nOne nightclub and bar in Denbighshire has decided to close earlier in the evening rather than dealing with the \"complexity\" of implementing Covid passes.\nMike Murray, manager of Bar 236 in Prestatyn, said the club used to stay open past midnight with live music and DJs, but would need extra staffing to police the system, and it was not worth it financially.  \n\"We always weighed up the situation, following the government guidelines to make it a safe and comfortable environment to drink in.\n\"We've even been keeping masks on and doing table service after the government advice changed because what's wrong with doing it a little longer to keep people comfortable?\"\nHe added he received a lack of guidance from Welsh government as to \"what passes would look like or where we could get one from if people asked\". \n\"We want people to come in and let common sense prevail: If you're unwell, don't come to the bar.\"\nThe decision to introduce Covid passes has very much split opinion, which was evident in the Senedd vote.\nGuto Brychan, chief executive of Cardiff music venue Clwb Ifor Bach, said the timing made things difficult as students had just returned to university and it is \"the busiest time of year\".\nHe said this was made more difficult because many students are from outside Wales and may not understand the law.\nMr Brychan said: \"One of the main concerns as well is that the Covid pass isn't uniform across the whole of the hospitality industry.\n\"It seems to have been specifically designed to target places that supply dancing or culture, but I'd argue the high risk activity here is the consumption of alcohol, not dancing.\n\"There'll be plenty of venues open as late as ourselves that will have as many people in them but won't have the restrictions that we have in place.\"\nLidi Staffurth is one of thousands of people who have been shielding during the pandemic due to a condition which makes them extremely vulnerable to Covid-19.\nShe said Covid passes would help reassure people who might feel uncertain about attending large events, adding she felt she had her \"freedom back\".\nMs Staffurth labelled it a \"brilliant idea\", not least because there are three young people in her family.\n\"If they're in large groups then we'll know they're around people who are double vaccinated, or at least free from Covid,\" she said.\n\"I think it's a fantastic idea and for a society at large it means people are looking after each other. \n\"I think some young people just don't care - they've had it with Covid, and I think we've all had it with Covid - but they live in their own little bubble and they don't really see beyond that bubble a lot.\n\"And that's fair enough, but it means with a Covid pass they're made to consider that.\"\nDavid Chapman, executive director for UK Hospitality in Wales, called for \"tolerance\" from government, licencing authorities and the public as the passes were introduced. \nHe told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast there was some \"trepidation\" in the industry, particularly about alignment with England, as well as staff shortages. \n\"We've got staffing problems as people will know already and more labour intensive moves such as this actually makes it quite difficult for a business to juggle resources well at the moment,\" he said. \nHe also called for the \"easiest possible trading conditions\" over Christmas, saying businesses had been told passes would stop \"stop at a certain point when society and the health service can cope\". \nDr Mair Hopkin, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in Wales, said the risk of Covid will increase as the weather gets worse and people spend more time indoors.\nShe said: \"They've introduced them in France and it seems to have been very acceptable to the French population, and also it seems to have coincided with a more rapid drop in their incidence rates.\n\"If that happens here then that would be a good thing.\"\nEconomy Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not \"expect perfection on day one\" as the system is introduced.  \nHe said: \"We do accept there may be problems in venues getting used to what they need to do.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Steel industry,UK economy,Kwasi Kwarteng",
      "text": "The business secretary has asked the Treasury to support industries hit by soaring energy costs, a source has told the BBC.\nKwasi Kwarteng's formal request follows talks between ministers and industry leaders.\nThe details have not been disclosed, but they are thought to focus on a temporary solution to high prices.\nSectors such as steel manufacturing have called for a price cap amid fears for the survival of some factories.\nThere are a number of reasons for a steep rise in gas prices over the past year - including the reopening of industry after Covid lockdowns.\nA source told the BBC that \"everyone in government understands the importance of this situation\".\n\"We need to solve this quickly,\" they added.\nMr Kwarteng's proposal follows confusion over the weekend, when his claim to be in talks with the chancellor about potential support was disputed by a Treasury source.\nOn Monday, the prime minister's spokesman said Treasury officials were involved in talks with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).\n\"As you would expect, ministers from BEIS are working across government, including with the Treasury, on this important issue, the challenges currently facing industry in light of global gas prices, and that will continue,\" he said.\nDarren Jones, Labour MP and chairman of the Commons BEIS committee, welcomed Mr Kwarteng's request for help and stressed the importance of finding short-term solutions.\nHe said a one-off windfall tax on gas producers was worth considering, because they had \"made significant profits\" during recent price fluctuations.\nBut he also said the UK should be focusing more and renewable energy sources and nuclear.\n\"Any subsidy from government should be on proviso that we bring forward, both from private and public sector, investment to move away from gas powered sources of energy to avoid these problems in the future,\" he added.\nDr Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users' Group which represents manufacturers, welcomed Mr Kwarteng's \"urgency\" and said he hoped for an \"equally swift response\" from the Treasury.\nThere have been bleak warnings about the potential impact of the spiralling energy price.\nOne government source warned of factories closing forever, and thousands of job losses as a result.\nBut despite that, ministers have struggled to maintain a united front over the past day.\nWhen the business secretary told the BBC he was in talks with the chancellor, a Treasury source said he was wrong.\nWith the prime minister on holiday, it was left to his team to insist today that ministers were working across government to find solutions.\nTonight we have some clarity - the business secretary has made formal proposals. A source said an urgent solution was needed. \nIt's now up to the Treasury to decide whether to accept them.\nBBC political correspondent Adam Fleming said earlier that business minister Lee Rowley, rather than Mr Kwarteng, was due to lead Monday's meeting - and would lead another with steel bosses on Tuesday.\nMinisters also met industry leaders on Friday.\nDave Dalton, chief executive of the British Glass trade body called for \"immediate action\" following that meeting.\nHe said some members of his group might have to shut production permanently, although no firm had been forced to do so yet.\nAdrian Curry, managing director of UK-based Encirc, one of the largest container glass plants in Europe, said industry was not asking for a bailout, but the situation for some companies was critical.\n\"We pay more for our energy than competitors in other countries,\" he told the BBC. He said his company would normally spend \u00a340m a year on energy, but was now looking at bills up to \u00a3100m.\nThere are many reasons, both in the UK and around the world. \nThere's been a shortage of gas and energy in many countries as they emerged from lockdown and industry reopened. \nA cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, less gas is being stored than normal. \nOn top of that, the UK has fewer gas storage facilities than some countries - meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. \nThere's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that Russia, a major gas supplier, is restricting output - an accusation it denies - which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises.\nThis has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone.\nRead more here\nTrade group UK Steel told the BBC that Boris Johnson needed to take control before it was too late - although it described as \"really good news\" an announcement that the country's third largest steel maker, Liberty Steel, would restart operations at its plant in Rotherham this month. \nThe Unite union also called on the prime minister to \"get a grip\" to avert job losses if companies had to shut production because they could not cope with the increased cost of energy.\nDowning Street has said Boris Johnson is continuing \"to address the current issues around fuel and supply chains\" while on holiday, after Labour accused the government of having \"put its out of office on\" over the weekend.\nHowever, Conservative MP Mark Harper said the government should resist demands for financial support.\nDomestic energy consumers have a certain amount of protection from rising prices due to a price cap, which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nHowever, the cap was increased on 1 October, meaning about 15 million households face a 12% rise in energy bills.\nIndustry has no such cap, meaning they are open to the risk of an unlimited rise in prices.\nAlready manufacturers and services are warning they will have to pass on their rising costs to consumers. And as energy costs are a big driver of inflation, few consumers and households will escape the consequences of the current crisis.\nAre you a business owner?

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "text": "Householders in the UK will find out in the next few weeks how much their gas bills are likely to increase in the coming year.\nThe energy regulator is due to announce the new energy price cap - the maximum amount that suppliers can charge in Great Britain.\nIt's expected to rise steeply, because global wholesale prices have gone up so much.\nEvery six months, Ofgem, the energy regulator, reviews the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff.\nThis is called the energy price cap. \nAbout 15 million households saw their energy bills increase by 12% when it was last updated in October. \nThe next review is due at the beginning of February, and the new cap will come into effect in April. Industry predictions suggest gas prices could go up by as much as 50%.\nThere is a separate energy market in Northern Ireland, with two gas suppliers, and prices have risen sharply for consumers there too.\nThere's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies over the past year.\nAs a result, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. At the end of December, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about \u00a32,000 next year.\nReasons for the increase include:\nThere are a number of technical and geopolitical issues at play as well, which mean many countries across Europe are grappling with the same problems.\nHowever, the UK is hit relatively hard-hit because it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas. Around 85% of homes have gas central heating, and it also generates a third of the country's electricity. \nStorage capacity in the UK is also lower than in some other European countries.\nSince wholesale gas prices started to spike, more than 20 retail energy suppliers have collapsed in the UK. \nThis is largely because the energy price cap prevented retailers from passing on higher wholesale prices to their customers.\nSeveral smaller companies, with fewer reserves, could not weather this.\nFailed firms include Bulb Energy, with 1.7 million customers. Because of its size, it was put into \"special administration\", and is now run by the government, through Ofgem.\nNearly four million customers have been affected. Many households saw their energy prices rise when their supplier went bust, and they were switched over to a more expensive deal with another supplier.\nThe government faces calls from energy companies, the opposition, and even some of its own MPs, to do more to prevent prices from rising too much.\nSuggestions include:\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise.\nBut at the moment better offers - including fixed deals - are simply not available.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, householders are being encouraged to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says that simple changes to our homes and habits could offset the current price rises.\nMany companies face a considerable rise in their bills. That could mean they have to: \nEnergy-intensive industries are particularly exposed, but the problem affects every company that has to pay energy bills - even if it is just to heat an office or shop."

      "tags": "National Crime Agency,Passports",
      "text": "Ten people in London and Kent have been arrested on suspicion of supplying fraudulent passports to more than 100 high-level organised criminals. \nEarly-morning raids in South London, Kent, Essex and Merseyside followed an international police investigation. \nThe gang is accused of supplying passports to clients including jailed drug dealer Jamie Acourt, a suspect in the murder of Stephen Lawrence.\nThose arrested are suspected of using paid \"lookalikes\" to obtain passports.\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) said the gang used the \"lookalikes\" to apply for legitimate replacement passports, but using a criminal's photo, rather than their own.\nJacque Beer, the NCA's regional head of investigations, said: \"This is one of the most significant NCA investigations of recent times.\n\"We believe that this group's activities has enabled some of the most serious organised criminality in the UK and around the world.\"\nShe said if the suspects were convicted, it would have \"dismantled a criminal service that allowed drug and firearm traffickers, suspected murderers, and fugitives to evade detection and operate internationally under false identities.\"\nMs Beer said the hope is the case will lead to the \"strengthening of safeguards against criminal exploitation of the UK passport issuing system\".\nOfficers smashed down the doors of a flat in south London at 05:00 BST on Monday and arrested a 66-year-old man.  \nHe is suspected of being a broker between criminals looking for fraudulent passports, and those willing to supply them. \nSix men and three women believed to be members of the crime group were also arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice and making false instruments. \nThese raids took place in Sutton, Sydenham, Rotherhithe, Hackney, Battersea and Hayes in Kent. The suspects are aged between 34 and 71.\nThe investigation began several years ago when HM Passport Office discovered criminals were using a \"loophole\" to obtain legitimate passports with fraudulent details.\nAccording to the NCA, the gang are believed to have sourced passports for specific criminal clients who wanted to hide their identity.\nThey would find someone who looked like the client and pay them to apply for a replacement passport. Someone else would be paid to countersign the application. \nBut when the passport form was sent in, the client's photo would be used instead of the image of the \"lookalike\" original passport holder.\nThe NCA alleges the gang found people prepared to, in effect, sell their personal details for passport applications in return for payments of \u00a32,000.\nBecause the passports were not simply forged and therefore appeared legitimate, they were extremely valuable within the criminal underworld.\nFourteen men suspected of receiving the passports or helping to countersign documents were arrested in Kent, Essex and Merseyside. They are aged between 38 and 73. \nThe NCA and HM Passport Office have been tracking individuals using the fraudulent passports for years. \nAs a result, the BBC has been told that more than 100 people said to be senior figures in organised crime have been arrested. \nChris Farrimond, deputy director of operations at the NCA, explained: \"These were serious criminals, who, for one reason or another, could not make use of their normal passport. \n\"Either they were on the run, or they were so involved in criminal business that they wanted to keep their activities under the radar.\"\nThey are believed to include Jamie Acourt, extradited from Spain and jailed for drug offences. \nThe NCA suspect he was a client of the gang, and says he would not have been tracked down had it not been for the fact he was travelling on a passport supplied fraudulently.\nIn 2018, the agency told the BBC that Acourt had been tracked using \"intelligence methods\". \nThe NCA believes passports were also supplied to Richard Burdett, jailed with his brother Daniel for importing 16 guns into the UK.\nBurdett was arrested in July 2019 after being stopped by police in Amsterdam. To confirm his identity he produced a genuine British passport, bearing his photo but fraudulently obtained.\nHe had used it to travel to Ireland to evade police in the UK, his trial was told.\nPassports were also supplied to organised crime organisations in Scotland and Ireland.\nSecurity Minister Damian Hinds said: \"This is a fantastic result and will do significant damage to the serious organised crime groups who want to inflict misery on our shores and around the world.\"\n\"The close working between the NCA and Her Majesty's Passport Office has been at the heart of this hugely successful operation.\"\n\"The government is working to make the UK border one of the most effective and secure in the world, which will also support our ambition of dismantling ruthless organised crime groups.\""

What we are in the business of is ensuring security of supply and that is what I am focused on.\"\nWholesale gas prices have risen 250% since January.\nCEO of British Glass Dave Dalton, who was at Friday's meeting with Mr Kwarteng, said some of the confederation's \"significant\" members were \"teetering on the edge\". \n\"I think some companies are staring down the ability to survive, absolutely - ultimately that obviously cascades on to jobs and impacts on the consumer,\" he told the BBC. \nGareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said he was frustrated by the lack of action to support businesses.\nHe told the BBC that without help in the next week or so, there would be \"significant and permanent damage to the UK steel sector\".\nUnite leader Sharon Graham said the country was \"contemplating factory shutdowns across viable manufacturing and businesses\" and that workers were \"worried sick\".\nBusinesses have been shouting louder and louder for support through this period of soaring energy prices.\nThis morning, the business secretary told the BBC he was listening to their concerns - but would not commit to any extra support.\nThose industries that use a lot of energy for manufacturing say that the time for working out a way forward has long gone. \nThe director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, expressed his frustration, saying pauses in steel production will only increase. \nThe government says the current situation emphasises the need for a revolution in how we generate energy, moving towards home-grown renewables.\nBut that's little comfort for those businesses dependent on energy from fossil fuels now, competing with intense demand in a global market.\nOn the Andrew Marr show, Mr Kwarteng denied asking for \"billions\" from the Treasury to subsidise energy-intensive businesses and said supply itself was \"not an issue\".\nA Treasury source said the business secretary had been \"mistaken\" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\nBridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government \"needs to get a grip\" and called for \"urgent answers on who exactly is running the show\". \n\"The two key government departments responsible for the current cost of living crisis have spent this morning infighting about whether they were in talks with each other. What a farce,\" she said.\nShe also accused the government of having \"put its out of office on\", referring to reports that the prime minister is on holiday in Spain.\n A number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action to support heavy industry.\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on the UK government to \"nurse\" businesses through the crisis, describing it as a \"perfect storm\".\nThe domestic consumer energy price cap, which is reviewed every six months, sets the maximum level a supplier can charge a consumer on a standard tariff in England, Wales and Scotland. \nMr Kwarteng told Marr that protecting consumers was his \"first and foremost objective\" and as such the price cap would stay at its current level until its next update which is due to in April.\nSome suppliers say the cap is just delaying an inevitable increase in consumer prices and should be reviewed more regularly.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem has warned households will see further \"significant rises\" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed.\nAsked by Marr if he was sure the lights would stay on this winter, Mr Kwarteng said \"yes, I am\".\nDue to high gas prices household energy suppliers have been forced to sell gas for less than they can buy it due to the price cap, leading some to fail.\nLast month, nine domestic energy supply companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates.\nPaul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, said while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism \"is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers\".\nHe said it protected customers in the short term but somewhere between \u00a31bn and \u00a33bn in costs would be spread back across business and households as a result of suppliers going bust.\nThe founder of OVO Energy Stephen Fitzpatrick told Marr that it has been \"too easy\" for companies to enter the energy market and that there will be more companies in difficulty.\nHe said the market was a complicated one, and he thought some people had not understood the risks."

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he believes the Northern Ireland Protocol could \"in principle work\" if it was \"fixed\".\nBut he also did not rule out triggering Article 16 if the EU failed to come up with plans to deal with current issues.\nMr Johnson's comments came in an interview with BBC News NI.\nHe also talked about the government's controversial legacy proposals, which seek to end all Troubles-related prosecutions before 1998.\nMr Johnson insisted he did not want to \"deny\" anyone justice but felt it was time for Northern Ireland to \"move on\".\nThe prime minister said he wanted the EU to come to the table with serious proposals to fix the Northern Ireland Protocol. \n\"The fundamental problem for us is that it is very difficult to operate in an environment where the EU system can decide when and how many checks can be carried out across the Irish Sea,\" he said.\n\"Goods are being pointlessly interrupted, and it is crazy to have cancer drugs which you can't move from one part of the UK to another.\"\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is a post-Brexit trade arrangement, which was agreed by the UK and the EU in order to avoid the reintroduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland.\nUnder the terms of the protocol, Northern Ireland must still apply EU single market rules at its ports, in order to avoid the need for checks along the Irish land border as goods enter the EU.\nIn practice, this means some products moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have been subject to new checks, which has angered many unionists who feel this is damaging trade, supply lines and Northern Ireland's position within the UK.\nHowever, the prime minister said it was possible for the protocol to function. \n\"The protocol could in principle work,\" he said.\n\"It has got enough leeway in the language for it to be applied in a common sense way without creating too many checks down the Irish Sea.\"\nBut he warned it will come down to \"fixing it or ditching it\".\nAsked if he planned to trigger Article 16 during next week's Conservative Party conference he said \"that depends on the response from the EU\".\nThe prime minister was also questioned as to why he signed up to a deal which created a border down the Irish Sea.\nHe denied that he was na\u00efve but said he had an \"optimistic view of human nature and thought they (EU) would want to respect the Belfast Good Friday Agreement\".\nHe added the protocol was framed to operate \"free trade east to west just as much as north to south and that was very, very clear but unfortunately that is not the way it is being operated\".\nMr Johnson also defended the government's legacy proposals, which if adopted would see an end to all Troubles-related prosecution prior to 1998.\n\"We are trying to find a way forward and draw a line under one of the most wretched and miserable periods in our recent history,\" he said.\n\"We need to find a way of allowing people to reach an understanding of what happened and allowing families to reach closure while at the same time drawing a line.\"\nHe added \"We don't want to deny anybody justice but what we do want is to heal, bring people together in a process of understanding of what happened but also to say to the people that it time for Northern Ireland to move on\"  "

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "text": "Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, has called on the UK government to \"nurse\" businesses through the energy crisis. \nHe described the situation facing the UK as a \"perfect storm\".\nWholesale gas prices have risen 250% since January and there are warnings some industrial sectors may have to shut down operations. \nUK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has defended the government's handling of the crisis. \nSpeaking to Sky News' Trevor Phillips on Sunday, he would not rule out a price cap for businesses and said his department was talking to industry to see what solutions would work. \nBut he denied reports he asked for \"billions\" from the Treasury to subsidise energy intensive industries.\nIn an interview with BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, Mr Blackford warned that energy prices could go up further. \nOfgem has already warned that householders face \"significant rises\" in energy prices next spring when the price cap, which limits how much energy providers can charge per unit, is due to be changed. \nTwelve domestic energy supply firms have failed in the last 13 months as they paid more for their gas then they were able to charge. Their customers have been moved to alternative providers.\n\"Now we know this is not going to go away quickly and actually if you end up in a situation that more energy providers have to hedge by buying additional supplies, all we are actually doing is forcing energy prices up even more and more,\" Mr Blackford said. \n\"There's a real issue about some larger providers being in quite a delicate situation and the impact that it's going to have. Government can't walk away from its responsibilities.\"\nHe said that if factories closed, it would have wider repercussions on the supply chain and unemployment levels. \nThe Energy Intensive Users Group - which represents firms which use a lot of energy - has said measures were needed \"right now\" to stop shut downs having a wider impact.\nAnd businesses in the ceramics industry have said they may be forced to scale back or stop production due to the rise in gas prices. \n\"Government has to recognise we have a responsibility to nurse businesses through this to provide short term support,\" Mr Blackford said. \n\"If we end up in a situation where steel production stops in the west coast of Scotland, that helps nobody. \n\"We have got to make sure that companies have got the assistance they need in the short term while we get through this. If not we are going to pay the price because we're going to end up with high unemployment, we are going to end up with supply constraints.\"\nEarlier, Mr Kwarteng, asked on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show if he was going to give extra help to energy-intensive industries, like steel, said: \"We're looking to find a solution.\"\nTold that that sounds like a yes, the minister replied: \"No, that doesn't sound like yes at all. We already have existing support and we're looking to see if that's sufficient to get us through this situation.\"\nHe added: \"I've been very clear we're not going to bail out failing energy suppliers.\"\nOn being informed of the Business Secretary's position, Mr Blackford said: \"This is like Thatcher all over again, isn't it?\"\nAsked whether the Scottish government would support those affected by rising energy crisis, he said: \"The Scottish government is already doing what it can and in particular we are making sure that we are trying to react against fuel poverty, we are trying to make sure vulnerable families, children with disabilities and so on are being supported. \n\"We can't fix every problem that emerges from Westminster.\"\nHe added: \"I want to do as much as we can but our budget is constrained and let's remember that we don't have the borrowing powers that Westminster  has. We would fix this - give us the powers to do it and we would make sure we would give businesses the necessary support.\""

      "tags": "Energy customer switching,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry,Bulb",
      "text": "Together Energy is the latest UK supplier to collapse due to rising gas prices. \nTwenty-eight energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August, including Bulb, which is being managed separately because of its size. \nMore than three million customers have seen their energy firm collapse since the summer, though most suppliers are tiny compared to Bulb. \nOfgem said a new supplier will be found for Together Energy's 176,000 domestic customers, whose supply will continue without interruption. \nThe other companies which have already gone out of business are: \nAmpoweruk Ltd, Avro, Bluegreen, CNG Energy Limited, Colorado Energy, Daligas, Enstroga, Entice, Goto, Green, Hub, Igloo Energy, MA Energy Limited, Money Plus, Neon Reef, Omni Energy Limited, Orbit Energy, People's Energy, PFP, Pure Planet, Social Energy Supply, Symbio Energy, Utility Point, Zebra Power Limited and Zog Energy.  \nFirms have struggled because they offered customers cheap fixed deals. That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices.\nIf your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. \nBecause of its size, Bulb has been put into an arrangement called \"special administration\". \nThe company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it means Bulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything. \nThe accounts held by the other failed firms are automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.\nYou can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff.\nOfgem has sent customers to the following suppliers: \nOfgem and Citizens Advice both recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch.\nThere's no need to cancel direct debits.\nIf you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks.\nIf you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business.   \nIt's unlikely. \nUsually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. \nBut at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put.\nThose coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs.\nA tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive.\nInstead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust says simple changes to our homes and energy habits could help offset the current price rises.\nThe price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months.\nIt's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases.\nAbout 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland saw a 12% rise in their energy bills on 1 October, when a higher price cap took effect.\nOfgem has now said it will review how the price cap is calculated to make sure it accurately reflects the risks faced by companies. \nIt will publish its conclusions in February, and a new price cap will be announced before it is implemented in April 2022.\nIn Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, a number of suppliers have also announced price increases in recent months.\nA worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies has meant gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia have risen dramatically. \nSupplies of renewable energy in Great Britain were also reduced by the least windy summer since 1961. \nA fire at a National Grid site in Kent closed a power cable supplying electricity from France. \nRising gas prices also led to a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is widely used in the food and drink industry."

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All children aged 12 to 15 in the UK are to be offered one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab. \nIt follows a recommendation from the UK's four chief medical officers that vaccinating them would help reduce disruption to their schooling this winter and benefit those growing up in the poorest areas.\nThe UK's advisory body, the JCVI, said there was only a marginal benefit to vaccinating adolescents on health grounds alone and stopped short of recommending it - but it did advise vaccinating children over 12 with specific underlying health conditions who are at greater risk.\nThere is general agreement that this was a really tricky call to make.\nStrong opinions have been expressed on all sides, by scientists, doctors, teachers and parents alike.\nThe JCVI focused squarely on the health benefits of vaccination to children themselves - not on the impact to their schooling or other people.\nChildren's risk from Covid isn't zero but the chances of them becoming seriously ill from Covid are incredibly small. Deaths among healthy children are extremely rare - most have life-limiting health conditions.\nThat means there needs to be a clear and obvious advantage to giving them a jab. \nHowever, a very rare side-effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines has made that calculation a lot more complicated. \nPaul Hunter, professor of medicine at University of East Anglia, says there's been intense pressure on the JCVI and he can understand why they have been cautious.\nResearch on millions of people who've had the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) shows there's a tiny risk of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, which is more common in young people - and particularly younger boys - after a second dose. It can cause chest pain and a pounding heart, but symptoms usually clear up in days. \nNo vaccine or drug is ever 100% safe, and data from the US shows the numbers of children affected are very small. \nFor every million Pfizer second doses given to 12-17-year-old-boys, around 60 had the condition (compared with eight in a million among girls). The rates in this age group are higher than in older ones - and it's why only one dose for 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK has been recommended, for now.\nBut being infected with Covid has consequences for teenagers' health too - including their hearts - so how big is that risk?\nA recent US study suggests having Covid-19 could be six times more likely to trigger myocarditis in young men than the vaccine, with a rate of about 450 per million infections. \nHowever, the long-term effects of myocarditis after vaccination and the wider health impacts of Covid in children in the short and long-term are still not known.\nJust because countries have access to the same data doesn't mean they will reach the same standpoint on this finely-balanced question.\nCountries are influenced by a variety of different factors - from vaccination rates in adults to political pressure and fears over another wave of Covid. \nThe US, for example, has vaccinated more than 10 million over-12s and concluded that the benefits of protecting against Covid illness and its complications  \"far outweigh\" the small potential risk of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. \nFrance, Italy, Canada, Spain, Israel and many other countries are all vaccinating this age group for the same reason.\nVaccinating secondary-school-age children wouldn't stop the virus circulating in schools or in society more generally.\n\"Even if 100% of people in the UK were vaccinated - and their pets - the virus would still spread,\" Prof Hunter says.\nBut vaccines for teens are still likely to reduce infections in that age group, and could help keep more children in school over winter, although it's unclear how much it would limit wider community spread.\nThe government's scientific advisers recently said that 40-70% of children in secondary schools may already have been infected by the start of term, meaning many have some in-built protection.\nThen there's the question of whether encouraging more over-18s to have a vaccine would be a more productive aim, given their greater risk, with more than 12% still reluctant to even have one? \nIn the end it comes down to choice, and a fine balance between a very rare side-effect from the vaccine, and a very low risk to children themselves from Covid."

      "tags": "Manchester,Bury",
      "text": "The family of a man killed in the Manchester Arena attack say he was \"badly let down\" by some members of the emergency services.\nJohn Atkinson, 28, was one of 22 people who died in the bombing on 22 May 2017.\nA public inquiry has previously heard he might have survived had he been given treatment more quickly.\nMr Atkinson's family said mistakes had been made and \"precious time was allowed to ebb away while John needed urgent hospital treatment\".\n\"This should never have been allowed to happen. John had so much to give,\" they added.\nThe inquiry heard healthcare worker Mr Atkinson lost a significant amount of blood as he laid in agony on the foyer floor for 47 minutes before being carried downstairs.\nAbout 20 minutes later, he went into cardiac arrest and was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary but he was pronounced dead a short time later. \nLast week, consultant paramedic Dan Smith, the operational commander for North West Ambulance Service (NWAS), told the inquiry he was \"truly sorry\" if any decision he made impacted on his survivability.\nIn a statement read outside the court on Monday, Mr Atkinson's family said they could not accept this apology. \n\"Actions speak louder than words, and we wait to see what actions are taken to ensure this never happens again,\" they added in a statement read on their behalf by their lawyer Richard Scorer, from Slater and Gordon.\nThe family said Mr Atkinson \"was kind, intelligent and would light up any room he walked into\".\n\"He was the best uncle to his nephews, most caring of sons and brothers, he worked with young adults with autism and he looked forward to being a foster father,\" they added.\nThe inquiry earlier heard how Mr Atkinson had pleaded with NWAS senior paramedic Phillip Keogh not to let him die.\nMr Keogh treated him about an hour after the explosion but it was another 30 minutes before he was moved to an ambulance. \nHe agreed Mr Atkinson had been left waiting too long to be taken to hospital, reducing his chances of survival. \nThe delay was \"inadequate\", he told the inquiry. \nMr Atkinson, from Bury, died shortly after arriving at the Manchester Royal Infirmary one hour and 35 minutes after the bomb was detonated in the arena foyer.  \nHe was brought down from the foyer on a metal barrier and put on the floor of Manchester Victoria railway station concourse, the inquiry heard. \nMr Keogh said it was \"obvious he had lost a lot of blood\" and he had several makeshift tourniquets on his legs.\nHe said he was worried about Mr Atkinson developing hypothermia as he had been left in the doorway and was not covered in blankets. \nThe inquiry heard Mr Atkinson had pleaded with the paramedic \"don't let me die\". \nMr Keogh said he had tried to comfort him by telling him he would not let him die, but said he \"already had grave concerns for [his] outcome\". \n\"I thought then that his chances of survival were absolutely slim but I wasn't going to tell him the truth because that's just not what you do,\" he said. \nThe inquiry was told Mr Keogh lost most of his equipment just before he treated Mr Atkinson.  \nMr Keogh accepted that Mr Atkinson should have been given a blood clotting agent earlier, which was in his lost equipment bag, however he told the court he did not believe it would have saved his life.\nMr Atkinson went into cardiac arrest as he was being placed on an ambulance stretcher, the inquiry heard. \nMr Keogh described the difficulty of carrying out chest compressions as he was wheeled to an ambulance.\nThe paramedic, who had previously served in Afghanistan as a reservist army paramedic, told the court that he went directly to Manchester Arena despite being told he should go to a rendezvous point because there may have been an active shooter. \nHe said: \"I was aware that people were injured at the arena and if I wasn't going to go, then who was going to go?\"\nThe inquiry continues. \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Starting salaries continued to rise sharply at Scottish firms last month as the supply of job candidates in some sectors fell away, a survey has found. \nThe latest RBS Report on Jobs said recruiters noted candidate shortages for both permanent and temporary posts.\nThe lack of supply was attributed by some respondents to \"a reluctance among candidates to switch roles due to Covid-19 related uncertainty\".\nBrexit and off-payroll working tax rules were also cited for the shortage.\nFor permanent positions, the rate of decline in supply was the fastest since March 2019, while firms signalled the steepest downturn in temp staff supply in the survey's history.\nThe shortage came as hiring activity at Scottish businesses surged again last month, in line with easing Covid-19 restrictions and rising economic activity. \nAn upturn in permanent placements was slower than in May but was still rapid overall, while temp billings growth also remained historically elevated. \nPanellists in the survey suggested the shortage of candidates for permanent roles had \"placed upwards pressure\" on pay, with the rate of increase among the steepest on record.\nRecruiters across Scotland also recorded a further increase in average hourly wages for short-term staff during June. \nTemp wages have now risen in all but one of the past nine months.\nDemand for permanent staff across Scotland rose sharply again during June, with the fastest rise since data collection began in January 2003. \nAcross the monitored sectors, IT and computing registered the quickest increase in vacancies, followed by engineering and construction.\nRecruiters across Scotland also registered a further rise in the number of temporary vacancies during June. Blue collar posts saw the strongest rise in the number of temp vacancies, followed by IT and computing.\nRBS chief economist Sebastian Burnside said the June data pointed to a \"sustained rebound\" of the Scottish jobs market.\nEarlier this week, a Scottish Chambers of Commerce survey suggested Scottish businesses were seeing \"shoots of recovery\" for the first time in over a year as Covid-19 restrictions began to lift.\nIts latest quarterly economic indicator indicated more positive growth across all sectors, with firms reporting substantial rises in confidence and domestic sales.\nHowever, while companies were optimistic about sales revenue in the third quarter of this year, they are more cautious around investment and staff levels.\nThey also expressed greater concern over inflation, as more consumers spend savings accumulated over the last 16 months.\nSCC president Tim Allan said: \"The success of the vaccine rollout has enabled the easing of restrictions and the gradual reopening of the economy, unleashing pent-up demand in the economy. \n\"This has allowed some sectors to rebound more quickly than others.\n\"However, the route to economic recovery will be a marathon, not a sprint.\" "
