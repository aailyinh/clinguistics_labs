      "text": "The BBC reporter in Ethiopia's conflict-hit region of Tigray has been detained by the military. \nWitnesses say Girmay Gebru, who works for BBC Tigrinya, was taken along with four other people from a caf\u00e9 in the regional capital, Mekelle. \nMr Girmay is reported to have been taken to a military camp in Mekelle.\nThe BBC is yet to establish the reason for his detention, but has expressed its concern to the Ethiopian authorities. \nA local journalist, Tamirat Yemane, and two translators - Alula Akalu and Fitsum Berhane, who were working for the Financial Times and the AFP news agency, respectively - have also been detained in recent days.\nEthiopia's government has been fighting rebel forces in Tigray since November. After months of an effective media blackout since the start of the conflict in Tigray, the government granted access to some international media organisations last week. \nBoth AFP and the Financial Times had received permission to cover the conflict.\nEyewitnesses told the BBC the operation to detain Mr Girmay was carried out by soldiers in military uniform. \nA spokesperson for the BBC said: \"We have expressed our concern to the Ethiopian authorities and are awaiting their response.\"\nFighting continues in Tigray despite the government declaring victory over the Tigray People's Liberation Front. \nHundreds have been killed and tens of thousands displaced. \nThere is international concern over growing reports of atrocities committed by all sides and the worsening humanitarian crisis, correspondents say.\nAn official of Ethiopia's ruling party recently warned that measures would be taken against people they said were \"misleading international media\"."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "text": "A mother and her daughter died when 11 members of the same family caught Covid-19 after meeting on Christmas Day.\nKashmir Bains, 64, and Paramjeet, 43, of Wolverhampton, fell seriously ill after testing positive for the virus. \nThe daughter died on 5 January, the day after she was taken to hospital, and her mother died four weeks later.\n\"It's been devastating for us as a family,\" said Indy Bains, their son and brother.\nMr Bains said the family considered not meeting at Christmas but decided to because his sister, who has learning disabilities, had been suffering in isolation with her mental health.\nThey gathered on Christmas Day, adhered to the government's three household rule and \"played safe\", only meeting for a few hours. Mr Bains and his family, and his younger sister and her family, met up with his mother, father and older sister.\nDays after Christmas, all 11 tested positive for coronavirus.\nMr Bains said: \"We didn't meet anyone else beforehand, no-one had any symptoms, we still don't know who brought the virus into the family, into the house, but it's happened and it's something we'll have to live with for the rest of our lives.\"\nWhile most had mild symptoms, Mrs Bains and her daughter fell seriously ill.\n\"When the ambulances took them away, we just thought, 'Well they're in the right place, they'll get treatment,' we never thought once that they wouldn't return home,\" Mr Bains said.\nBoth mother and daughter spent time in intensive care at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton.\n\"Because of her [Paramjeet's] learning disability she didn't really understand what was happening to her, and I guess she thought that the mask was just obstructing the air flow rather than helping her and she kept pulling it off.\n\"We spent the last few hours pleading, begging her to keep it on, so that she could get the oxygen that she required... but she just couldn't do it, and kept pulling it off, it was heartbreaking for us to see.\"\nMr Bains has set up a JustGiving page in memory of his sister and mother to raise funds for The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust Charity. It has already raised more than \u00a310,000.\nHe said the treatment his family received by hospital staff was \"humbling\".\n\"I think they [hospital staff] deserve all the respect and gratitude we can give them.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "text": "Bank of Ireland has announced it will close 15 branches in Northern Ireland, which is more than half of its 28 branches currently operating in NI.\nIt is part of a wider cost-cutting exercise that includes the closure of 88 banks in the Republic of Ireland, where 169 banks will remain open.\nThe Dublin-based bank operates across the Republic and the UK. It is one of NI's \"big four\" banks.\nThe bank's UK head office will also relocate from London to Belfast.\nThe bank has been reviewing its Northern Ireland operations and there had been speculation that it could withdraw from the market.\nThat has not happened, but Chief Executive Francesca McDonagh said the Northern Ireland business will undergo \"a material restructure\".\nThe branch closures will affect the roles of about 120 staff in Northern Ireland but will not result in compulsory redundancies, according to Ian McLaughlin, Chief Executive of Bank of Ireland UK.\nThe branches earmarked for closure are:\nThe bank would work to identify staff who could be redeployed to other roles within the company, as an alternative to redundancy, said Mr McLaughlin.\nBranch closures will not start for 12 weeks and customers will be contacted individually about the changes, he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \nAside from closing 15 branches, the restructuring of its Northern Ireland business will include simplifying its range of products with a greater focus on car finance and mortgages.\nThe bank will also continue with its strategy of withdrawing from less profitable lending across the UK.\nIt said this would mean its UK loan book shrinking by about 10% during 2021.\nThe bank's UK division made a loss of \u00a315m in 2020, compared to a profit of \u00a3152m in 2019.\nThe loss was due to impairment charges - money which must be set aside to cover loans which may not be repaid in full.\nAll banks have seen increased impairment charges due to the economic impact of the pandemic.\nThe bank as a whole showed an annual loss of \u20ac760m (\u00a3657m), again due to impairment charges.\n\"We've announced some rather eye-watering numbers this morning, like most banks,\" Mr McLaughlin told Good Morning Ulster.\n\"It's been a really tough time and anyone who tells you differently isn't really paying attention, but we've got a really solid business here,\" he insisted. \nMr McLaughlin added that the relocation of the bank's UK office to Belfast was \"really good news and a sign of our commitment to Northern Ireland\".\nHe said the branch closures were in response to changes in customer behaviour over the last four years.\nHe argued that as the popularity of digital services like online shopping had increased, banks could not be \"insulated\" from the switch to digital.\n\"Our customers are using our branches less and less and we've reached a bit of a tipping point,\" Mr McLaughlin said. \n\"Our cash usage and customer visits in the closing branches is down 70% since 2017 and commensurately our digital banking up 50% over the same period so we need to adapt and we need to change.\"\nRetail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the number of closures \"seems a step too far\".\nAcknowledging \"the significant increase in online banking\", Mr Roberts said Monday's news will have a \"negative impact\" on high streets across Northern Ireland when the lockdown ends.\n\"I have also particular concerns of the impact on rural communities, with further reduced ATM provision and the ability to access cash,\" he added.\nThe Consumer Council has said the closures risk isolating consumers by removing access to essential services.\nFinancial Services Director Scott Kennerley said many consumers and small businesses still rely on face-to-face banking.\n\"We know that some consumers in Northern Ireland still prefer to use cash so the decision by Bank of Ireland to close half of its branch network will have a negative impact on consumers and their access to cash services,\" he said.\n\"We will continue to engage with Bank of Ireland to understand how it is supporting consumers affected by this decision.\"\nBank of Ireland had already closed several branches over the last decade. \nIn 2011, it had 44 branches in Northern Ireland. \nIn August last year, the bank said it was aiming to cut 1,400 jobs from its UK and Ireland operations. \nLast week, Ulster Bank confirmed it would close its Republic of Ireland business over the next few years."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nThe search for an individual infected with the Covid variant first found in Brazil has been narrowed down to 379 households in south-east England. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the unidentified case had been traced back to a batch of home testing kits - and each of the relevant households was being contacted. It is one of six cases of the \"concerning\" variant found in the UK last month. The first study of the variant suggests it is more contagious than other variants, and may evade immunity provided by past Covid infections. \"We're doing all we can to stop the spread of this new variant in the UK, to analyse its effects, and to develop an updated vaccine,\" Mr Hancock said. \nAll secondary school pupils in Scotland will return to classrooms part-time from 15 March, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. It had previously been announced that those in S1 to S3 would not return to school until April, but Ms Sturgeon said all secondary pupils will now get some in-school time before the Easter holidays. Pupils in S4 to S6 who are studying for national qualifications are being prioritised in the return, with a \"clear expectation\" that all pupils will return full-time after Easter. It has also been confirmed that children in primary four to seven will return full-time from 15 March. You can read more about the reopening of Scottish schools, including social distancing and compulsory face coverings, here.\nNorthern Ireland's plan for easing the coronavirus lockdown is \"cautious and hopeful\", Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said. Unlike plans announced in England, NI's blueprint does not include a timetable. Ms O'Neill said the executive's plan, published on Tuesday, would be an \"underpinning insurance policy\" to help protect the health service. \"We must do everything we can to try to make this one the last lockdown,\" she added. Here is the executive's five-step plan.\nBusiness support including furlough and the VAT cut for hospitality firms will continue \"while lockdown persists\", the business secretary has said. With Covid restrictions  in England set to end by June at the earliest, Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC it was important not to \"crush\" any potential recovery. The \u00a320-a-week top-up to universal credit will also be extended for six months to help struggling households, a government source told the BBC. Official figures show the UK economy contracted by 9.9% last year and unemployment rose to 5.1% in the three months to December. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will set out his plans for the economy in the Budget on Wednesday..\nTwitter is to ban users who repeatedly tweet harmful misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. Under the scheme, users will face a lock being placed on their account - with the length of the ban determined by how many times they have posted misleading information. If  a user accrues \"five strikes\", the account will face a permanent ban. The move brings the social network in line with several of its rivals: Facebook and Instagram announced their own pledge to close the accounts of repeat offenders a month ago and YouTube already operates a three-strike system which was revised in October.

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Brazil coronavirus variant now found in the UK appears more contagious and may evade immunity provided by past infection, scientists say.\nExperiences from Manaus - the Amazonian city hit hard by the P.1 variant - suggest it could be up to twice as transmissible as earlier Covid there, the first detailed study suggests.\nThe preliminary work puts the chance of reinfection at between 25% and 60%.\nBut experts say this should not be used to predict what may happen in the UK.  \nIndeed, one of the lead researchers said it was unlikely P.1 would quickly take off in Britain when only six cases had been identified and these were being closely monitored. \nInfectious diseases expert Prof Ester Sabino, from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, said: \"You need many introductions [of a virus] to start an epidemic. Six is very few. I would say if you take care and do contact tracing, this is going to decrease.\"\nProfessor Sharon Peacock, who is director of the UK's centre leading on genetic testing of coronavirus, said: \"We are taking appropriate action. These are very interesting and important findings for Brazil, but how they relate to the UK is yet to be determined.\"\nUpdating MPs on the six cases of the Brazil variant seen in the UK, Health Secretary Hancock said: \"We have no information to suggest the variant has spread further.\"\nOne of the six people affected has not yet been identified, but the search has narrowed from the whole country down to 379 households in the south-east of England.\nMr Hancock said: \"We're contacting each one.\"\nThe researchers have been tracking coronavirus in Brazil for nearly a year now. Manaus, like many other regions around the world, encountered a large first wave in the spring of 2020. \nLots of people were infected with the original version of the virus at that time, with blood test results suggesting as many as three-quarters of the population getting some degree of protection or immunity from this exposure. \nDespite this, people in Manaus were hit badly by another wave of coronavirus in the winter. \nThe research team from Brazil and Imperial College London have been studying the genetic makeup of coronavirus in some of those who were infected between November and December, as well as modelling the pandemic outcomes. \nThey say the P.1 variant probably emerged in early November, dominated and spread quickly, and caused many reinfections. \nThe data is preliminary, but fits with what experts have suspected - that some of these new variants of coronavirus the world is seeing are more infectious and can evade some of the immunity people may have already built against Covid. \nThis raises questions about how well current vaccines, which were designed around earlier versions of the virus, might work and how countries can ease restrictions without case levels rising too high.  \nWork is already under way to redesign or tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new \"variants of concern\", although existing ones should still provide some protection, particularly against severe disease. \nUpdated vaccines could be ready within months, meaning the UK would have millions of doses ready to give people a booster shot before next winter to make sure the population is protected. \nThe priority, along with mass vaccination, is to keep cases low to reduce the chance of new and emerging variants from spreading. \nMr Hancock said: \"Our current vaccines have not yet been studied against this variant and we're working to understand what impact it might have, but we do know that this variant has caused significant challenges in Brazil, so we're doing all we can to stop the spread of this new variant in the UK, to analyse its effects and to develop an updated vaccine that works on all these variants of concern and protect the progress that we've made as a nation.\""

      "tags": "Tax,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021,Coronavirus pandemic,Income tax",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak will set out the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday afternoon, and rumours are rife about what giveaways and cuts lie in wait.\nHowever, he has also announced a number of his plans ahead of the speech. Here is what we know already:\nAs the pandemic has upended many people's working lives, the furlough scheme will be extended until the end of September.\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, or furlough scheme, applies across the UK. It covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they can't work, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month. \nAs Covid restrictions start to lift, employers will have to help cover part of the cost of their furloughed workers' salaries. They already have to pay pension and National Insurance contributions.\nEmployees will continue to receive 80% of their salary for hours not worked until the scheme ends.\nMore support will also be announced for self-employed workers on Wednesday, with more than 600,000 people, many of them newly self-employed last year, now eligible for cash grants.\nPubs and other hospitality venues have been battered by the pandemic, so the chancellor has promised a \u00a3150m pot to help communities take over local \"boozers\" at threat of closure. \nUnder the fund, which will open in the summer, community groups will be able to bid for up to \u00a3250,000 of matched-funding to help them to buy local pubs to run as community-owned businesses. \nIn \"exceptional cases\" up to \u00a31m will be available to community groups to buy their  local sports club. \nMr Sunak said it would help keep such venues at \"the heart and soul of our local towns and villages\". \nTens of thousands of small businesses will be offered free MBA-style management training to help them boost productivity growth, the Chancellor has said. \nUnder the so called \"Help to Grow\" scheme, the government will plough \u00a3520m into free online courses from top business schools. \nIt will also fund 50% discounts on new productivity-enhancing software.\nMr Sunak will announce a \u00a3300m recovery package for sport, another sector battered by social distancing restrictions. \nThe self professed cricket fan says his beloved sport will get a \"significant chunk\" of this cash, after last season was played behind closed doors. Other sports such as tennis and horse racing will also benefit.\nHe has also promised \u00a325m of new funding to support grassroots football - enough to build around 700 new pitches across the UK, as well as cash to kick-start a 2030 UK and Ireland World Cup bid.\nThe arts sector has struggled since last March, as gig venues, museums and cinemas have been forced to close. Many who work in the sector are freelancers who have fallen through the cracks of support for the self-employed. \nIn the Budget the chancellor is expected to put an extra \u00a3300m into the \u00a31.57bn Culture Recovery Fund, with England's museums and cultural bodies also receiving \u00a390m to keep going until they can open their doors on 17 May at the earliest.\nThere will also be \u00a318.8m for community cultural projects, and \u00a377m for similar initiatives in the devolved nations. \nThe chancellor is to unveil details of a \u00a35bn grant scheme to help struggling High Street shops and hospitality firms in England reopen after lockdown.\nThe chancellor said the grants would be worth as much as \u00a318,000 per firm, but some business groups say the money is not enough. \nNearly 700,000 shops, restaurants, hotels, hair salons, gyms and other businesses in England, will be eligible for the so-called \"restart grants\", to be distributed directly to firms by local authorities from April. It will replace the current monthly grant system.\nThe UK's Covid vaccination rollout will receive an extra \u00a31.65bn in the Budget to help it reach its target of offering a first dose to every adult by 31 July.\nOver 20 million people in the UK have had a first dose and NHS England is now asking 60 to 63-year-olds to book jabs.\nRishi Sunak said it was \"essential we maintain this momentum\".\nThe Budget will also include a mortgage guarantee scheme to help people with small deposits get on the property ladder.\nThe government will offer incentives to lenders, bringing back 95% mortgages which have \"virtually disappeared\" during the pandemic, the Treasury says.\nThe new scheme is not restricted to first-time buyers or new-build homes, but there will be a \u00a3600,000 limit.\nIt is based on the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, which closed to new loans at the end of 2016. \nThe Treasury said the scheme \"reinvigorated the market for high loan-to-value lending after the 2008 financial crisis\".\nBut housing charity Shelter said that scheme increased house prices by 1.4%.\nThe Chancellor will announced a \"fast-track\" visa scheme to help start-up and rapidly growing tech firms source talent from overseas. \nApplicants will no longer need to obtain a \"third-party endorsement\" or be backed by a sponsor organisation, simplifying the current rules and making it easier for researchers, engineers and scientists to come to the UK.\nMr Sunak will plough an extra \u00a3126m into the traineeship scheme, which sees the government pay employers who give young people work placements.  \nCurrently the government pays firms \u00a32,000 per trainee, but this will rise to \u00a33,000. He'll also create a new \"flexi-job\" apprenticeship in England that will enable apprentices to work with a number of different employers in one sector. "

      "tags": "Yemen,UK aid,Yemen crisis",
      "text": "Britain has drastically cut its aid to Yemen, which has been devastated by conflict for six years, saying the pandemic created \"a difficult financial context for us all\".\nThe UK government said it would provide \"at least\" \u00a387m ($120m) this year, down from \u00a3164m pledged last year.\nAid officials have condemned the cut. The UN chief, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said reducing aid was a \"death sentence\".\nThe situation in Yemen has been called the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\nThe conflict began in late 2014, when rebels seized control of much of the west of the country and a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched a military operation to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's rule.\nAn estimated 20 million people - two-thirds of the Yemeni population - depend on humanitarian assistance. Some two million children are acutely malnourished.\nIn addition to conflict, Yemen has seen a collapse of its health system, leaving it incapable of coping with the coronavirus pandemic.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab told parliament that the UK remains \"as we have over the last five years, between the third and the fifth highest donor into Yemen\".\n It's true that the UK has consistently ranked in the top five sources of aid funding to Yemen, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which tracks humanitarian spending between countries. \nThe UN database recorded more than $200m from the UK to the war torn country last year, the third highest amount behind Saudi Arabia ($459m) and the United States ($697m).\nAid from all nations to Yemen has been falling in recent years though. It decreased from more than $5bn in 2018  to about $2bn in 2020, according to the UN.\nThe cut in the UK's contribution was announced on Monday at a virtual donors' conference by Minister of State for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly.\nHe said \"recent global challenges\" had \"meant a difficult financial context for us all\". Funding has fallen off in recent years, just as the pandemic has made needs more acute. \nSpeaking at the event, UN officials warned that if the UN failed to meet its $3.85bn target for 2021, millions of Yemenis could face starvation. It is unclear how much has been raised so far.\nDavid Beasley, Executive Director of UN's World Food Programme, told the conference: \"We've got famine knocking on the door.\"\nMr Gurerres said that generous donations had averted a famine in 2018, but that \"today, reducing aid is a death sentence\". \nThe US pledged an extra $191m at the event - bringing its total aid for Yemen to $350m this year.\nAn earlier version of the story gave a higher figure (\u00a3214m) for the total amount donated by the UK in 2020, which was the pledge (\u00a3164m) made at the aid conference last year plus additional spending"

      "tags": "Scottish government,Brazil,Aberdeen,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "An enhanced contact tracing effort is under way after the Brazilian variant of Covid-19 was detected in Scotland.\nThree Scottish residents tested positive for the new strain after flying into Aberdeen from Brazil, via Paris and London.\nNational clinical director Professor Jason Leitch said they were oil workers who were returning to their families.\nOther passengers who were on the same British Airways flight from London on 29 January are now being contacted.\nExperts believe this variant (P1) - first detected in northern Brazil in January - could be more contagious.\nHowever Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said there was \"currently no reason to believe\" the variant was circulating in the community in Scotland.\nA total of 20 passengers who were on flight BA1312 have already been contacted, and Ms Freeman said work was under way to get in touch with others.\nProf Leitch told BBC Scotland's The Nine that situation in Aberdeen had been \"well-handled\" by the individuals, their families and employer. \nAsked if he was concerned the north-east was a gateway to new variants via the oil industry, he said: \"It's certainly a part of the country we need to be concerned about\". \nThree other cases have also been detected in England, but they are not linked to the Scottish cases.\nOfficials are still trying to track down one of those who tested positive for the new variant in England.\nJillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said the three Scottish travellers had arrived in Aberdeen in early February, before new rules on hotel quarantine came into force.\nShe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme they had isolated together for 10 days after arrival in accommodation provided by their employer.\nThey tested positive while in isolation, having developed symptoms after arriving there.\nMs Evans said that health protection specialists were now following up \"contacts of their contacts\" in an effort to ensure that any further cases were found quickly.\nAnyone traced will be offered a Covid-19 test.\n\"That's not standard procedure, that's going one stage further,\" she said.\n\"But of course they have been quarantined for 10 days in managed isolation for that period of time, so you would think that they wouldn't have many contacts to follow up.\n\"Nonetheless, that's an added precaution that's been taken by health protection specialists.\"\nProf Leitch, said it was the first time the Brazilian variant had been detected in Scotland, but told BBC Scotland there was \"no evidence\" of community spread.\nHe said the three travellers had tested negative before leaving Brazil.\n\"The measures that were in place at the time of this were really quite rigorous,\" he said.\n\"These individuals self-isolated. They were from a high risk country, so they followed the instructions and there is no suggestion of any blame or concern about their behaviour. I think that's very important.\"\nProf Leitch added that \"enhanced\" contact tracing was necessary in this case because of concerns about the Brazil strain's resistance to immunity.\n\"The reason why we're worried scientifically is we're not absolutely certain that this version is amenable to the natural immunity some people already have and the artificial immunity we are creating with vaccination,\" he said.\n\"Everything we know says it's still very effective, but we just can't be sure yet because it hasn't been around long enough and the trials haven't completed.\"\nBoth the Scottish government and Public Health England said the variant had been designated \"of concern\" as it shared some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa - known as B.1.351.\nOne of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies.\nChief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said it was important to be \"vigilant\" for changes to the virus, with the vaccine programme placing greater pressure on it.\nHe said: \"We must continue to suppress transmission to the lowest possible level - the more virus there is around, the more likely these mutations are to appear.\""

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All secondary school pupils in Scotland will return to classrooms part-time from 15 March, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nIt had previously been announced that those in S1 to S3 would not return to school until April.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said all secondary pupils will now get some in-school time before the Easter holidays.\nPupils in S4 to S6 who are studying for national qualifications are being prioritised for face-to-face learning.\nIt has also been confirmed that children in primary four to seven will return full-time from 15 March.\nMs Sturgeon also said the Scottish government would be considering if it was possible to speed up its plans to exit lockdown. \nThe first minister said there was a \"clear expectation\" that all secondary school pupils will return full-time after the Easter holidays.\nShe said the safety of staff and pupils was a \"key priority\", and that two-metre social distancing would continue in secondary schools until Easter.\nFace coverings will need to be worn at all times, and schools are working to improve ventilation. Lateral flow tests will continue to be offered twice a week for all school staff as well as pupils in S4 to S6.\nSome senior phase pupils have already returned to school on a limited basis to complete work for their qualifications, while P1 to P3 pupils have returned full-time.\nMs Sturgeon thanked all school leadership teams and staff, as well as parents, for all their efforts over the last few months.\nShe said: \"My thanks to children and young people - I know how hard it must be to be separated from friends and teachers but you have all responded magnificently to all the difficulties of the last year and I hope you're looking forward to getting back to school later this month.\"\nShe added that local authorities would have \"flexibility\" to implement the phased return of pupils.\nWhen presented with three options on schools, the Scottish government has opted for the one which covers the broadest ground.\nIt could have decided to send all pupils back at the same time in the middle of March, but this would have meant abandoning social distancing in secondary schools earlier than they would like.\nIt could have kept S1 to S3 out of class until the middle of April as originally planned, but this would have added to growing claims these youngest secondary pupils were being left behind.\nInstead, it has decided to allow all pupils at least some time in class. So, for the first time, plans made last summer for so-called blended learning, which were never used, will be dusted off and put into practice in schools across the country - if only for a few weeks.\nIt's a more complicated option, but it's one the government thinks balances the wants and needs of young people and their families and the dangers and problems posed by the virus.\nThe latest figures showed that a total of 542 new positive cases of Covid-19 had been reported, 4.4% of those tested.\nMs Sturgeon said the data this week was \"much more encouraging\" than it was last week, when the decline in case numbers had appeared to slow down.\nShe said the average daily cases were now at their lowest level since October, average test positivity had fallen below 5% and hospital admissions were falling.\nThe first minister said she hoped to confirm changes to level four restrictions next week.\n\"Between now and then... we will be considering if it might be possible to accelerate the exit from lockdown in any way,\" she said.\nRuth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives at Holyrood, said pupils \"deserve better than guesswork based on the SNP's drip feeding of partial information\".\nShe welcomed the accelerated return of pupils, but said that observing Covid rules with full school buildings would pose \"logistical questions\".\nShe asked the first minister what solutions would be provided for campuses that did not have the space or staff to allow for two-metre social distancing.\nMs Sturgeon said the Scottish government was continuing to work with schools to ensure there was \"good provision of remote learning\", adding the funding available for local authorities would cover a range of improvements on top of ventilation.\nNew Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said more than 1,500 children were on waiting lists for mental health support, and asked when the government would set out a national recovery plan for pupils.\nMs Sturgeon said transforming and redesigning child and adolescent mental health services had already begun before the pandemic, but that now had to be intensified.\nAlison Johnstone, from the Scottish Greens, called for clarification on when additional support needs staff would be vaccinated, but Ms Sturgeon said deviating from the government's age-based approach would make decisions \"political\".\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the \"last-minute change\" on schools had been made without issuing any fresh guidance, and said this had \"dumped the problem on teachers to fix\".\nMeanwhile Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, said an \"over hasty\" return to full time schooling could risk a reversal of the progress made.\nGeneral secretary Larry Flanagan said the plan to return younger secondary pupils to blended learning did not recognise workload pressures this would create for \"already exhausted\" staff.\nHe added: \"The announcement of a planned full return after Easter would suggest that physical distancing requirements currently in place for senior phase students may be removed despite the scientific evidence of the need for this mitigation.\n\"This will place those young people, and their teachers, at significant additional risk.\""

      "text": "A university has been ordered to pay a student \u00a35,000 in compensation for lost teaching time during England's first lockdown, a complaints watchdog says.\nThe Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) has released a number of complaints students have made about the impact of Covid on their studies.\nThey include concerns over disrupted learning, accommodation and missed practical elements of courses.\nThe cases show the \"complex situations\" the pandemic brings, the OIA says.\nThe OIA is an independent body that reviews student complaints about universities and other higher education providers in England and Wales under the Higher Education Act 2004.\nIts complaints scheme is offered free to students. \nIn 2020, the OIA received 2,604 complaints, 500 of which related to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\nAmong the complainants was an international medical student who had been studying at an undisclosed university and paying course fees of \u00a338,000.\nThe student was awarded \u00a35,000 after the university stopped all clinical placements as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, meaning the individual had lost out on practical experience.\nThe OIA said it was awarded due to the \"severe disappointment and inconvenience\" the student had experienced because the final year of studies had been \"less valuable\" than expected.\nA healthcare student has also been awarded \u00a31,500 for the \"inconvenience and significant disappointment\" they faced due to the cancellation of a lab-based research project as part of their Master's degree course.\nThe student had been moved to remote learning by the university in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.\nThe student said this meant missing out on the practical techniques that employers looked for, disadvantaging them when applying for jobs.\nThe OIA concluded that while the institution had taken a \"number of steps\" to ensure students were not disadvantaged academically, it could not deliver the promised lab work.\nAnother student was given \u00a3200 after missing out on 14 hours of learning time because of industrial action that took place over November and December 2019, along with disruption caused by coronavirus.\nAnd another case saw the lifting of an international student's accommodation penalty, imposed after they were found to be breaching social-distancing rules when a friend visited their room.\nThe student, who has a mental health condition, was excluded from the accommodation despite giving reasons for the friend's visit.\nThe OIA said it considered the penalty \"harsh\" and that the university had agreed to reduce the penalty to a formal warning.\nBut not all complaints were upheld by the adjudicator.\nOne student was not given a refund by the watchdog after paying university accommodation fees in three instalments before the first lockdown was enforced. \nThe student had asked to be refunded fees paid in March 2020 after the institution got in touch to say they should consider returning home.\nThe university had decided not to ask any students to pay the third instalment when it became due in April, but refused to refund the amount the student had paid for the six-week period before that.\nThe OIA ruled that the university had adopted a \"fair approach\" in a \"very challenging\" situation by giving the option for students to stay at the accommodation during the lockdown.\nTwo other students did not have their complaints over issues around teaching arrangements and exam-marking criteria upheld.\nIndependent adjudicator Felicity Mitchell said: \"The case summaries reflect the hugely challenging and complex situations that students and providers have faced as a result of the pandemic.\n\"Where possible we try to reach a settlement, and we are pleased that in many cases providers and students have been very open to this.\n\"The summaries illustrate our approach to deciding what is fair and reasonable in these kinds of situations. We hope they will be helpful to providers and students.\" \nThe group Universities UK says students should \"speak to their universities in the first instance\" if they have a complaint.\nA spokeswoman added: \"Universities are developing plans to support students to have the fullest possible experience when they return to campuses. \"\nIn February, England's Universities Minister Michelle Donelan announced an extra \u00a350m for student hardship funds, on top of \u00a320m agreed in December, in recognition of the disruption students have faced during the pandemic.\nHer announcement came as the vice-chancellors of seven universities called for the interest on student loans in England to be scrapped for 15 months."

      "text": "An ex-Cardiff City player hit his head and died after falling down stairs at a pub in a pretend fight with friends, an inquest heard.\nMidfielder Peter Whittingham, 35, who played for the club from 2007 to 2017, suffered a traumatic head injury at the Park Hotel, Barry, on 7 March 2020.\nHe did not regain consciousness and died in hospital 11 days later.\nCoroner Graeme Hughes recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest at Pontypridd Coroner's Court.\nThe hearing was told how Mr Whittingham had been drinking for hours while watching Wales v England in the Six Nations.\nHe was out with his brother-in-law and a friend when the incident happened just after 21:30 GMT.\nMr Whittingham's wife Amanda said he had not eaten since breakfast as he had been in a \"rush\" to watch the game when he left home at 15:00 GMT.\nCCTV footage showed him in a pub corridor engaging in \"horseplay\" before appearing to lose balance and walking through a fire door off camera, where he fell down eight steps and hit his head.\nRobert Williams, Mr Whittingham's brother-in-law, told Pontypridd Coroner's Court they had been drinking lager, bitter and tequila through the afternoon and evening along with friend Ryan Taylor, and the evening was a \"blackout\" in his memory.\nHe described finding the footballer lying at the bottom of the stairs with his face to the side, but when he tried to lift him, Mr Whittingham's body was limp.\nMr Taylor said he remembered people wanting to take pictures with Mr Whittingham in the corridor but also had no memory of play fighting or the fall.\n\"I walked over to him to offer my hand, thinking he would just take it and I would help him back up to his feet. When I looked more closely at Peter, I could see he wasn't moving and something was wrong,\" he told the court.\nMr Taylor said Mr Whittingham's eyes were \"wide open and were almost completely white\" having rolled to the back of his head.\nHe was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff but his condition deteriorated and he died on 18 March.\nCoroner Graeme Hughes, who recorded a conclusion of accidental death, said Mr Whittingham had \"consumed a quantity of alcohol that has likely impacted on his demeanour and steadiness\" before he fell.\nHe said: \"During a period of horseplay with a friend and a relative he appeared to have lost his balance, travelled through or caused to open the fire door, fallen, and as he did so his head has come into contact with the steps.\n\"This has led to a traumatic head injury.\"\nAfter leaving Cardiff in 2017, Mr Whittingham, originally from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, ended his career with Blackburn Rovers in 2018 before moving back to south Wales.\nHe was living in Dinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan, with Amanda and his young son when he died.\nMrs Whittingham gave birth to their second son two months after his death."

      "tags": "Nigeria",
      "text": "Girls among the nearly 300 who were kidnapped from a school in north-western Nigeria have been describing their ordeal following their release.\n\"Most of us got injured,\" one of the schoolgirls told the BBC, adding that gunmen threatened to shoot them.\nThe girls were abducted by unidentified assailants from their boarding school in Jangebe, Zamfara state, on Friday and taken to a forest, police said.\nThe state's governor said on Tuesday that the 279 girls had been freed.\nSuch kidnappings are carried out for ransom and are common in the north of the country.\nOn Tuesday, dozens of the girls were seen gathered at a government building in Zamfara after they were taken there in a fleet of mini-buses.\nSpeaking to the BBC, one of the schoolgirls said that some of those kidnapped had found it difficult to continue walking when instructed to do so by the gunmen because of their injuries.\n\"They said they [would] shoot anybody who did not continue to walk,\" she said. \"We walked across a river and they hid us and let us sleep under shrubs in a forest.\"\nAnother of the girls, aged 15, said that some of her classmates found it difficult \"walking in the stones and thorns\" and had to be carried. \n\"They started hitting us with guns so that we [would] move,\" she told Reuters news agency, adding: \"While they were beating them with guns, some of them were crying and moving at the same time.\"\nSome of the fathers who had arrived to see their daughters for the first time since their abduction told reporters they were \"very happy\" at the news of their release. \nThe group's release was secured through negotiations between government officials and the abductors, authorities in Zamfara state told the BBC.\nLocal authorities said that an earlier figure provided by police of 317 for the number of girls kidnapped was not accurate. \nOne official told Reuters that the discrepancy was because of the fact that some girls had fled shortly after being abducted.\nNigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said he felt \"overwhelming joy\" at the news of the girls' release. \"[I am] pleased that their ordeal has come to a happy end without any incident,\" he said.\nThe governor of Zamfara state, Bello Matawalle, tweeted that it \"gladdens my heart to announce the release of the abducted students\". \n\"This follows the scaling of several hurdles laid against our efforts,\" he added. \"I enjoin all well-meaning Nigerians to rejoice with us as our daughters are now safe.\"\nMr Matawalle has denied paying for the girls to be released, but last week President Buhari admitted state governments had paid kidnappers \"with money and vehicles\" in the past and urged them to review the policy.\nBy Ishaq Khalid, BBC News, Abuja\nIt is believed that schools have started to be targeted as such abductions attract a lot of attention - putting more pressure on the authorities to negotiate with the armed criminal group responsible. \nThe authorities rarely admit to paying ransoms - but some observers say it is unlikely that the gunmen would release their victims without some sort of exchange, either of money or the release of their members who are in jail.\nBesides, kidnapping for ransom is a widespread criminal enterprise across the country - people are seized by gunmen on almost a daily basis - with both the rich and the poor falling victims. Security personnel have been held too. People often speak of how they have managed to secure someone's release by raising funds from friends and relatives - or even selling their assets. \nBut ransom payments are controversial. It may save someone's life, yet some observers say paying ransom only fuels the problem. President Buhari agrees, saying today ''ransom payments will continue to prosper kidnapping''. \nHe has repeatedly said his government will not negotiate with the armed criminal gangs. But many believe the failure of his administration and those at the state level to provide security is to blame. There are growing calls for the authorities to provide security for thousands of schools across the country - many of which are unfenced and do not have adequate security guards.\nThe 2014 kidnap of 276 schoolgirls in the north-eastern town of Chibok by Islamist militants Boko Haram brought global attention to the scourge of raids on schools in Nigeria, but a surge in recent attacks is suspected to be the work of criminal gangs.\nThe raid in Zamfara state was the region's second kidnapping in recent weeks. Some 27 students were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kagara in the north-central state of Niger last month before they were released on 17 February.\nNo group has said they were behind the Zamfara kidnappings.\nArmed groups operating in the state often kidnap for ransom but when gunmen took more than 300 boys from Kankara in neighbouring Katsina state in December last year, some reports said Boko Haram, which operates hundreds of miles away in the north-east, was behind the attack. \nThe reports were later disputed and the boys released after negotiations.

      "text": "Chancellors typically view Budgets as political theatre - a moment to set the tone as they show off their wisdom, generosity and vision for the future.  \nBut when Rishi Sunak lays out the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday it will not be him taking centre stage, but the ongoing crisis engulfing the nation's health and finances. \nThe government has borrowed a record \u00a3270bn so far fighting the pandemic and has to come up with a way of paying it back. But it also needs to continue supporting the millions still out of work or on furlough due to lockdown.\nAhead of the speech, Mr Sunak has promised more money for the vaccination rollout;  a \u00a35bn scheme to help High Street businesses reopen; and a mortgage guarantee scheme to help first-time buyers.\nBut he's warned of tough economic times ahead and there are reports that he plans to raise some taxes.\nHere are five things to look out for in Wednesday's speech:\nThe chancellor has already said he \"is preparing a Budget that provides support for people\" as unemployment hovers at a five-year high and four million workers are on furlough. \nOn Wednesday, he is set to announce the furlough support scheme will be extended until the end of September, with employers asked to contribute to workers' salaries from July.\nFrom then, employers will be expected to contribute 10%, increasing to 20% in August and September, as the economy reopens.\nEmployees will continue to receive 80% of their salary for hours not worked until the scheme ends.\nHe is also tipped to extend a \u00a320-per-week uplift to Universal Credit for six months, after intense pressure from MPs and charities to do more to help the poor get through the pandemic. \nSome want him to go further and make the uplift permanent - but the chancellor may resist as he struggles to get government borrowing under control.\nMr Sunak may have promised grants of up to \u00a318,000 to get businesses going again, but the bigger question is what he will do about business rates.\nMPs across the board say the tax, which is calculated using the value of a company's premises, is unfair and outdated. The boss of Next, Lord Simon Wolfson, recently told the BBC that a huge number of shops will have to close unnecessarily.high streets could if rates aren't reformed. \nThe chancellor is likely to leave the thorny question of what to do about rates - including levying a so called \"Amazon tax\" on online retailers - until the autumn. \nHowever, reports suggest he will extend the business rates holiday - brought in last year to support shops - beyond its current end date of 31 March and into the summer.\nDespite the anticipated generosity, the chancellor has said he will use the Budget to \"level\" with the public about the challenges facing the economy and the need to repay the vast sums of public money spent during the crisis. \nAccording to reports, Mr Sunak is likely to announce some tax increases - although whatever he does will have to fit around with the Conservative party manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. \nSome think he will instead raise corporation tax from its current level of 19% to 23%, which is still below the G7 average. The rise would be staggered over the course of the parliament, reportedly bringing in \u00a312bn.\nThere are also rumours he will freeze the personal income tax allowance, which usually rises in line with inflation, pushing many taxpayers into higher bands and netting HMRC about \u00a36bn.\nTory backbenchers are strongly opposed to tax rises, while the Labour leader Keir Starmer has warned they risk \"choking off\" a rapid economic recovery.\nBut ex-Conservative leader Lord Hague has said \"personal and business\" taxes must rise to help government finances.\nThe chancellor is likely to set out his vision for a post-Covid (and post-Brexit) economy, which could mean more money for \"levelling up\" different parts of the UK.\nAccording to the Financial Times, he is preparing to announce the locations of freeports - special economic zones with low taxes that would help stimulate regional growth.\nHe's also expected to announce more funding to help the UK meet its decarbonisation goals. \nThere are likely to be measures to promote more environmentally friendly homes and renewable energy - but he is not expected to raise fuel duty. \nThe stamp duty holiday introduced last year not only propped up the housing market at the start of the crisis, but also drove up the average value of a home by 8.5% in 2020.\nThat tax break is up at the end of March, and many buyers have found themselves facing big bills if they don't complete their transactions on time. However, Mr Sunak will extend stamp duty holiday to prevent this cliff edge, reports suggest. \nThe government mortgage guarantee scheme will offer 95% mortgages for houses worth up to \u00a3600,000. \nIt is based on the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, which closed to new loans at the end of 2016. \nThis is a policy that the Treasury says \"reinvigorated the market for high loan-to-value lending after the 2008 financial crisis\".\nBut housing charity Shelter said that scheme increased house prices by 1.4%, making housing less affordable for many.

      "tags": "Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All secondary school pupils in Scotland will return to classrooms part-time from 15 March, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nIt had previously been announced that those in S1 to S3 would not return to school until April.\nBut Ms Sturgeon said all secondary pupils will now get some in-school time before the Easter holidays.\nPupils in S4 to S6 who are studying for national qualifications are being prioritised for face-to-face learning.\nIt has also been confirmed that children in primary four to seven will return full-time from 15 March.\nMs Sturgeon also said the Scottish government would be considering if it was possible to speed up its plans to exit lockdown. \nThe first minister said there was a \"clear expectation\" that all secondary school pupils will return full-time after the Easter holidays.\nShe said the safety of staff and pupils was a \"key priority\", and that two-metre social distancing would continue in secondary schools until Easter.\nFace coverings will need to be worn at all times, and schools are working to improve ventilation. Lateral flow tests will continue to be offered twice a week for all school staff as well as pupils in S4 to S6.\nSome senior phase pupils have already returned to school on a limited basis to complete work for their qualifications, while P1 to P3 pupils have returned full-time.\nMs Sturgeon thanked all school leadership teams and staff, as well as parents, for all their efforts over the last few months.\nShe said: \"My thanks to children and young people - I know how hard it must be to be separated from friends and teachers but you have all responded magnificently to all the difficulties of the last year and I hope you're looking forward to getting back to school later this month.\"\nShe added that local authorities would have \"flexibility\" to implement the phased return of pupils.\nWhen presented with three options on schools, the Scottish government has opted for the one which covers the broadest ground.\nIt could have decided to send all pupils back at the same time in the middle of March, but this would have meant abandoning social distancing in secondary schools earlier than they would like.\nIt could have kept S1 to S3 out of class until the middle of April as originally planned, but this would have added to growing claims these youngest secondary pupils were being left behind.\nInstead, it has decided to allow all pupils at least some time in class. So, for the first time, plans made last summer for so-called blended learning, which were never used, will be dusted off and put into practice in schools across the country - if only for a few weeks.\nIt's a more complicated option, but it's one the government thinks balances the wants and needs of young people and their families and the dangers and problems posed by the virus.\nThe latest figures showed that a total of 542 new positive cases of Covid-19 had been reported, 4.4% of those tested.\nMs Sturgeon said the data this week was \"much more encouraging\" than it was last week, when the decline in case numbers had appeared to slow down.\nShe said the average daily cases were now at their lowest level since October, average test positivity had fallen below 5% and hospital admissions were falling.\nThe first minister said she hoped to confirm changes to level four restrictions next week.\n\"Between now and then... we will be considering if it might be possible to accelerate the exit from lockdown in any way,\" she said.\nRuth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives at Holyrood, said pupils \"deserve better than guesswork based on the SNP's drip feeding of partial information\".\nShe welcomed the accelerated return of pupils, but said that observing Covid rules with full school buildings would pose \"logistical questions\".\nShe asked the first minister what solutions would be provided for campuses that did not have the space or staff to allow for two-metre social distancing.\nMs Sturgeon said the Scottish government was continuing to work with schools to ensure there was \"good provision of remote learning\", adding the funding available for local authorities would cover a range of improvements on top of ventilation.\nNew Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said more than 1,500 children were on waiting lists for mental health support, and asked when the government would set out a national recovery plan for pupils.\nMs Sturgeon said transforming and redesigning child and adolescent mental health services had already begun before the pandemic, but that now had to be intensified.\nAlison Johnstone, from the Scottish Greens, called for clarification on when additional support needs staff would be vaccinated, but Ms Sturgeon said deviating from the government's age-based approach would make decisions \"political\".\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the \"last-minute change\" on schools had been made without issuing any fresh guidance, and said this had \"dumped the problem on teachers to fix\".\nMeanwhile Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, said an \"over hasty\" return to full time schooling could risk a reversal of the progress made.\nGeneral secretary Larry Flanagan said the plan to return younger secondary pupils to blended learning did not recognise workload pressures this would create for \"already exhausted\" staff.\nHe added: \"The announcement of a planned full return after Easter would suggest that physical distancing requirements currently in place for senior phase students may be removed despite the scientific evidence of the need for this mitigation.\n\"This will place those young people, and their teachers, at significant additional risk.\""

      "text": "The hunt is on for meteorite fragments that are likely to have fallen to Earth over England on Sunday night.\nMany people across Northern Europe saw a fireball in the sky shortly before 22:00 GMT, and the streak of light was also caught on special cameras.\nScientists think some pieces will have survived the intense heat of atmospheric entry and hit the ground.\nA computer model that analysed the camera data suggests the probable site of impact is just north of Cheltenham.\n\"We can track the fireball really well, but the 'black magic' starts when it goes dark - when the light goes out and it still has another 10-20km to reach the ground,\" explained Dr Ashley King from the UK Fireball Alliance (UKFAll) and London's Natural History Museum (NHM). \n\"Strong winds can blow the object off course of where you think it's going to land, and that's what we're working on now. But, yes, somewhere north of Cheltenham, out towards Stow-on-the-Wold,\" he told BBC News.\nThe fireball produced a sonic boom as it hurtled across the southern England sky. Eyewitness accounts describe the object breaking up into several defined streaks just before going dark. \nAny fragments that made it to the ground will be small, smaller than an orange, say, and are likely to be dark and shiny.\nAnyone who finds what they think might be a meteorite is asked to photograph it in situ, noting the GPS co-ordinates from a phone, if that's possible.  \nThe object should then be bagged without direct handling. And the absolute no-no: do not put a magnet near the object. This could destroy important information needed to study the rock. \n\"We've learned over the years that most meteorites carry a kind of intrinsic magnetic record within them from when they were in space,\" said Dr King.\n\"We can actually study that and learn about where these things came from and how they formed. But if you put a magnet on the object, it's a little bit like wiping your credit card with a magnet. We lose all of that information.\"\nSome of the trajectory work from the camera data has already suggested the object originated in the outer asteroid belt, which is between Mars and Jupiter.\n\"Most of the asteroids further away from the Sun tend to be these carbonaceous type that have got water and volatile materials in them but until we actually get our hands on some fragments, we can't say for certain,\" Dr King told BBC News.\nScientists from the UKFAll and meteorite experts from the universities of Glasgow and Manchester and the NHM are interested to hear from anyone who thinks they may have found something of interest.\nEven if you just have a photo or video of the event, the researchers request you upload and share it.\nBetween 10 and 20 meteorites are estimated to fall to the ground in the UK each year, but it's rare that any fragments are actually picked up.\nThe last recovered fall was in 1991 - the so called Glatton Meteorite, because it fell in the village of Glatton near Peterborough. \nMr Arthur Pettifor was tending his onions in his garden when a 10cm rock fell into his hedge."

      "tags": "Companies,Travellers",
      "text": "Pontins has agreed to change its working practices after disclosure it had a list of Irish surnames it used to screen out bookings for its holiday parks from Gypsies and Travellers.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) investigated after being contacted by a whistleblower. \nA spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said such discrimination was \"completely unacceptable\".\nPontins said it had agreed with EHRC change in its working practices.\nNews of the investigation was first reported by the i news website. \nThe EHRC said Pontins had an \"undesirable guests\" list on its intranet of mainly common Irish names to identify people it did not want at its parks. \nAccording to the i, there were 40 names on the list, including Boyle, Keefe, Gallagher, O'Donnell, McGuiness, Murphy, and O'Reilly.\nIt said staff monitored calls and refused or cancelled bookings made by certain people with an Irish accent or surname, and Pontins' commercial vehicle policy excluded Gypsies and Travellers from its holiday parks.\nBy declining to provide its services to guests of a certain race or ethnic group, Pontins was \"directly discriminating on the basis of race\" and breached the 2010 Equality Act, the EHRC said.\nPontins, which is owned by Britannia Jinky Jersey, has six holiday parks across England and Wales.\nThe EHRC declined to say how long Pontins had the policy in place, but according to the i, the list was used for at least six years.\nAlastair Pringle, executive director at EHRC, said: \"It is hard not to draw comparisons with an 'undesirable guests' list and the signs displayed in hotel windows fifty years ago, explicitly barring Irish people and Black people.\n\"Banning people from services based on their race is discrimination and is unlawful. To say that such policies are outdated is an understatement.\"\n\"It is right to challenge such practices and any business that believes this is acceptable should think again before they find themselves facing legal action.\"\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it is: \"Completely unacceptable to discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity. It is right EHRC and Pontins have investigated this.\" \nThe Traveller Movement, a charity that promotes inclusion for Gypsies, Roma and Travellers, said the Pontins policy was \"truly shocking\" but that it was \"not surprised\".\n\"We frequently hear of Gypsies and Travellers being turned away from holiday parks because of their ethnicity,\" said its chief executive Yvonne MacNamara.\n\"This happens across the country on a regular basis; it is unlawful and completely unacceptable.\"\nThe charity hopes the agreement between the Pontins owner and EHRC leads to better practices, \"and we also hope other holiday providers will think twice about enacting similar policies,\" Ms MacNamara added.\nSarah Mann, director at charity Friends, Families and Travellers, said it was \"shameful\" for Pontins to have acted in this way.\n\"Our thanks go to the Pontin's whistle-blower for doing the right thing and to the Equality and Human Rights Commission for using their powers.\n\"We all have a choice when we see discrimination - to stand by or to challenge it. Nobody should be treated differently because of their ethnicity.\"\nResearch by the charity suggested that nearly half of adults in the UK express negative attitudes toward Gypsies, Roma and Traveller people with hate crime being the most common issue reported to the police.\nThe Pontins owner said it would \"enhance staff training and procedures\" at the firm, and would take measures \"to promote equality throughout its business\".\nAs part of the agreement, Pontins must investigate the \"undesirable guests\" list, take appropriate action and ensure lessons are learned.\nIt must commission a review into its booking and commercial vehicle policy and consider any recommendations, and provide equality and diversity training for staff each year.\nThe EHRC started a probe in February 2020 after complaints from the whistleblower and Travellers. Its Pontins agreement is binding from 22 February 2021.\nIn 2017 EHRC said that Gypsies and Travellers were \"one of the most deprived groups in the Britain\" in terms of health and education.\nIt said in some areas of the UK \"local authorities have pioneered ways of meeting the needs of these nomadic groups to preserve their traditional lifestyle, while accessing health and education services and maintaining good relations with other communities.\"\nHowever, in other areas of the UK \"Gypsies and Travellers continue to be the focus of social tension with accommodation issues at the core. People living near unauthorised sites often object to developments without planning permission or where the environment is being damaged.\""

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh",
      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh has been transferred to St Bartholomew's Hospital for continued treatment, after 13 nights at another London hospital.\nPrince Philip, 99, is being treated for an infection and doctors will also carry out testing and observation for a pre-existing heart condition, Buckingham Palace said. \nThe duke is responding to treatment and \"remains comfortable\", it added.\nHe is expected to remain in hospital until at least the end of the week.\nPrince Philip, who turns 100 in June, was taken to King Edward VII's hospital in London on 16 February as a precaution, after feeling unwell. A palace source at the time said the duke had walked into the hospital unaided. \nOn Monday morning, someone was screened from journalists' cameras by umbrellas as they got into an ambulance outside the hospital in Marylebone.\nPrince Philip was transferred about three miles (5km) to St Bartholomew's Hospital, also known as Barts, Uniformed officers from the City of London police were positioned at the hospital entrance.\nBarts is a centre of excellence for cardiac care, its NHS site says.\nThe exact reason for Prince Philip's initial admission has not been disclosed, but his stay is not related to coronavirus. \nBoth the duke and the Queen, 94, received Covid-19 vaccinations last month. \nAside from the fact that the duke is 99 years old there are two, further, causes for concern.\nThe first is that he is still not home; this is his longest recorded stay in hospital. A reasonable expectation was that he would be heading back to Windsor by now.  \nInstead he has gone into St Bartholomew's Hospital for further treatment. The infection that sent him to King Edward VII's hospital is still being treated.\nThe second is the worry over his heart. The duke had a stent fitted following a blocked coronary artery in 2011. As far as we understand it has not played up since then. Now there are concerns - so there will be tests and observation in a hospital renowned for cardiovascular treatment.\nBecause he has retired from public life we hear little about the duke other than his rather infrequent visits to hospital.  When he was last seen in public, in July last year, he looked in good shape. But this extended stay in hospital will be a cause for heightened concern.\nThe Prince of Wales visited his father for about 30 minutes, the weekend after he was admitted.\nTwo days later the Duke of Cambridge said his grandfather was \"OK\" and that doctors were \"keeping an eye\" on him.\nThe following day, on 23 February, Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip was being treated for an infection and was not expected to leave hospital for several days. The Earl of Wessex added his father was feeling \"a lot better\" and appreciated the \"lovely messages\" from the public.\nBBC health correspondent Hugh Pym said the nature of the duke's pre-existing heart condition had not been made public, and speculated that it might be related to the stent operation in 2011 or that the infection had somehow exacerbated an existing heart condition, such as heart rhythm issues.\n\"Certainly he will be monitored extensively, with some of the best specialists in the country at Barts Heart Centre.\n\"But I think, probably, it's more than just monitoring. I think he has gone to this specialist centre because of the possibility - no more than that - that the doctors feel there may be a need for an intervention or procedure to be carried out.\"\nMembers of the Royal Family, including the Queen, have continued with their official duties during the duke's hospital stay.\nThe Queen has unveiled, virtually, a statue of herself for the first time, speaking to officials in Australia from Windsor Castle.\nIn a video of the call, made on Wednesday but released on Monday evening, the monarch joked that visitors to Government House in Adelaide might be alarmed to think she had paid them a surprise visit.\nHer other engagements over the past two weeks have included hosting a video call with health officials leading the UK's Covid vaccine rollout, and knighting a royal aide during a private socially-distanced ceremony at Windsor.\nPrince Philip retired from royal duties in 2017 in a move supported by the Queen.\nKnown for off-the-cuff remarks at public events, Prince Philip joked at the time that he was the \"world's most experienced plaque unveiler\".\nIn his time as a working royal, he has attended over 22,000 solo engagements and given more than 5,000 speeches.\nThe duke has received treatment for various health conditions over the years, including a blocked coronary artery in 2011, a bladder infection in 2012 and exploratory surgery on his abdomen in June 2013."

Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "text": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock has denied that delays in imposing quarantine hotel measures on travellers to the UK put lives at risk.\nIt comes as officials seek a person in England who has been infected with a concerning variant of the virus which causes Covid-19 first found in Brazil. \nThey are one of six cases of the P1 variant found in the UK in February.\nMr Hancock said there was \"no evidence\" the infected person had not followed home quarantine rules.\nAsked by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg if the delay to hotel quarantine measures could have put lives at risk, the health secretary said \"no\".\nMr Hancock said home quarantine measures and travel restrictions on Brazil had already been in place before the hotel policy was implemented.\nHe told a Downing Street press conference there had not been \"any further knock-on transmissions in the data\" and he hoped the evidence that the five known cases had followed the rules was \"very reassuring to people\".\nHe added the government intended to go ahead as planned with the reopening of schools in England on 8 March.\nThe person infected with the variant who has not been traced is understood to have used a home testing kit, but did not complete their registration form properly.\nIt has prompted an appeal for anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February to come forward immediately by calling 119. \nAs the person has not been identified officials do not know if they have recently travelled abroad or if they have been self-isolating, as they will not have received their test result.\nPublic Health England's Dr Susan Hopkins said they were tracking the Brazilian variant \"very closely\" and said it was \"extremely rare\" for someone not to provide their full contact details.\nShe added PHE was doing \"everything they can to track down the individual\".\nOn Monday, a further 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported, with 5,455 new cases identified across the UK.\nWhile figures are often lower at the start of the week due to reporting lags, cases are down by 49% compared with last Monday.\nMore than 20.2 million people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to the latest government figures.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the search for the infected individual demonstrated the \"slowness of the government to close off even the major routes\" and said he still thought \"we have not secured our borders in the way that we should have done\". \nDuring a visit to a school in Stoke-on-Trent, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had one of the \"toughest border regimes anywhere in the world\" and said the government had moved \"as fast as we could\" with introducing hotel quarantine measures.\nIt is tempting to think that, if officials can identify the one missing case, the UK will be able to stamp out the Brazil variant. \nBut it's unlikely this will be possible. There will no doubt be more cases either of this variant or others circulating with the E484 mutation that allows the virus to escape some of the effect of the vaccines. \nThat's because not all positive cases can be checked for variants. The UK carries out nearly half of the genomic sequencing in the world and can check around 25,000 positive tests a week for variants. \nThat means about a quarter of positive cases were checked last week, but a month ago - with infection rates higher - it was under one in 10. \nWhat is more, not everyone who is positive comes forward for a test in the first place. We are seeing just the tip of the iceberg.\nSo what is the strategy? Keep cases low, and where possible try to limit the spread of these variants. \nAnd in the future, update the vaccines to work better against the variants - if that is needed.   \nThe hotel quarantine rule came into force on 15 February. It means that travellers coming to England from 33 countries - including Brazil - must pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while in Scotland the rule applies to international travellers from all countries.\nBefore that date, travellers arriving into the UK still needed to self-isolate in their homes for 10 days.\nAll travellers to the UK also need to present a negative Covid test result, taken a maximum of 72 hours before their departure. \nHealth officials believe the missing person may have used a home testing kit.\nEvery home testing kit has a unique barcode on it. \nPeople must register this barcode online to link the test to a person's contact details.\nWithout doing this, the test will effectively be anonymous.\nSo, what is likely an error in that registration process meant the positive result has been picked up but there is no one to send it to.\nTests done in person at drive-thru or walk-in centres are less likely to see this occur, as much of the information is filled in before the person arrives and there are staff on hand to make sure it is done correctly.\nIn any given week, around 1.5% of cases passed on to contact tracers do not have the person's contact details.  \nThe unidentified England case of the Brazil variant is not currently linked to five other UK cases.\nTwo of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire. They tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force. Everyone in five postcode areas of South Gloucestershire is now being invited to take a Covid test, even if they do not have symptoms.  \nTwo other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant.\nThe other three cases are Scottish residents who flew to Aberdeen from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said.\nHolyrood said the three people tested positive while self-isolating. Other passengers who were on the same flight to Aberdeen are now being contacted and there is no reason to believe the variant is in circulation in Scotland, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said.  "

      "text": "The future of a north Wales mansion, dubbed the Welsh Versailles, is at risk if more is not done to preserve it, campaigners have warned.\nKinmel Hall, near Abergele, Conwy, was built in the 1870s, and is believed to be Wales' largest country home.\nThe Friends of Kinmel Hall said enforcement was needed to stop the now-empty building becoming derelict.\nConwy council said owner, Acer Properties Ltd BVI's, has pledged to spend money on the repairs.\nThe council said the pledge made by Acer Properties, which has owned the Grade I listed hall for the past 10 years, means it did not think enforcement action was needed at this time.\nThe French chateau-style building has not been occupied since the turn of the century.\nTim Vince, of The Friends of Kinmel Hall, said: \"Any building that is left effectively unoccupied for 20 years without any life within, without any heating, will deteriorate.\n\"There has been vandalism. Some of the lead has been taken from the roof, some of the treasures have been taken from within. It's a very sad story.\" \nKinmel Hall was built by the Hughes family, whose wealth was generated from copper mining on Anglesey.\nThey only occupied the house, which also boasted a stunning garden designed by the same designer who laid out London's Regent's Park, for a couple of generations.\nThe building was then leased out and used for a variety of different purposes through much of the 20th Century and was home to Clarendon Girls' School for about 30 years.\nThat ended when a fire swept through much of Kinmel Hall in 1975.\nMr Vince's father Eddie stepped in, spending \u00a32m of his own money in the 1980s helping to restore the site with the help of public money.\n\"He made a great commitment to the hall and there were many volunteers from the local area who helped with the restoration,\" said Mr Vince.\n\"It also received about \u00a3500,000 from the Historic Buildings Council of Wales, which became CADW, so there's quite a stake from Wales into this wonderful building.\"\nHaving risen from the ashes, The Friends of Kinmel Hall argue a detailed plan of action is now needed if it is not going to fall into a permanent state of decline and disrepair.\nThe group estimates about \u00a31m needs to be spent just to make the building secure and it may take \u00a330m to restore it to the point where it can have a use that helps meet the ongoing maintenance costs.\nThe Friends of Kinmel Hall said some public money would probably be needed as part of a partnership approach involving the current owners, the council, support groups and national government to safeguard its future.\nIt has not been possible to contact Acer Properties, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands, but the council has the role of enforcing rules aimed at protecting listed buildings.\nIt said: \"We are in regular discussions with the owners and they are in the process of making arrangements to carry out repairs.\n\"At the moment, the owners are taking positive steps and are in the process of making arrangements to carry out repairs to the property and although the matter is under review we do not consider that enforcement action is necessary at this present time. \"\nThe condition of Kinmel Hall has attracted the attention of a range of conservation experts who also believe action is needed to save the site.\nAmong them is Peter Hare who has worked on a number of conservation and restoration projects, including Windsor Castle following the fire there in 1994.\n\"It's now listed as one of the 10 most at-risk Victorian buildings in the the UK,\" he said.\n\"The price of fixing it is constantly going up. The longer it's left, the more the fabric is being destroyed and the less we've really got left of it. And it's awful.\""

      "text": "Business support including furlough and the VAT cut for hospitality firms will continue \"while lockdown persists\", the business secretary has said.\nWith Covid-19 restrictions set to end by June at the earliest, Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC it was important not to \"crush\" any potential recovery.\nAhead of Wednesday's Budget, Rishi Sunak said he would protect jobs using the \"full firepower\" at his disposal.\nBut he also promised honesty about his plans to \"fix\" the public finances.\nHe faces a potential row with some Conservative MPs if he imposes tax increases, amid warnings they could stifle economic growth. And Labour is urging him to abandon planned council tax rises in England.\nIn his Budget statement, which is due to get under way at around 12.30 GMT on Wednesday, the chancellor will commit the government to doing \"whatever it takes to support the British people and businesses through this moment of crisis\".\nHe is set to extend the \u00a320-a-week top up to universal credit for six months to help struggling households, a government source told the BBC.\nOther support is expected to include:\nHe is also expected to set out his plans to tackle the huge hole in the government's balance sheet - caused by the high levels of borrowing and debt built up during the pandemic, and the hit to tax revenues from the closure of many sectors of the economy. \n\"Once we are on the way to recovery, we will need to begin fixing the public finances - and I want to be honest about our plans to do that,\" he is expected to say.\nThe Budget won't just be about carrying on the emergency support, with a hefty dollop of Brand Sunak, with a TV press conference and sofa chat on Wednesday evening, on top of the traditional red box doorstep and green bench moments.\nIt will also be about how he hopes to return the Tories to their more traditional trademark - being careful with the country's cash.\nThere won't be a return to the kind of political argument over the deficit and the debate that David Cameron and George Osborne dominated in the early part of the last decade.\nAs one Treasury minister said: \"Austerity? You just can't do it now.\"\nRead Laura's full blog\nThe Budget comes at a very difficult time for businesses and government finances.\nOfficial figures show the UK economy contracted by 9.9% last year and unemployment rose to 5.1% in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015.\nWith its takings down and its spending up, the government is expected to borrow \u00a3394bn during the current financial year - the highest figure seen in peacetime.\nThe furlough scheme, currently paying up to 80% of six million people's salaries, is scheduled to stop at the end of April.\nBut the prime minister's \"roadmap\" for easing Covid-19 restrictions says the final legal limits on social contact and business activity will end no earlier than 21 June.\nAsked on BBC Breakfast if the job support scheme would continue, Mr Kwarteng said the chancellor had \"already indicated that we will be extending furlough\".\nAnd he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think it's a fairly good assumption that, while lockdown persists, there will be additional support.\"\nMr Kwarteng said there would \"perhaps be an extension\" of the reduced - 5% - rate of VAT for the hospitality sector, also due to end in 31 March.\nIf vaccines continued to be rolled out \"efficiently\" and the roadmap was followed, there was \"every chance that the economy can bounce back\", he argued.\n\"We can see strong growth at the end of 2021, and that will be the best way to deal with the growing deficit or to try and reduce it,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nMr Sunak is reportedly planning to increase corporation tax to as much as 25%, from the current 19%, to reduce pressure on public finances.\nSome Conservative MPs, including former Brexit Secretary David Davis, say this would impede recovery and are warning they will resist this or any similar moves. \nBut former Conservative leader Lord Hague wrote in the Daily Telegraph that, after 12 months of heavy public borrowing to pay for furlough and other schemes, \"at least some business and personal taxes\" would have to rise.\nFor Labour, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said now was \"not the time\" for tax rises, but has signalled the opposition could support an increase in corporation tax in the future.\nShe has said the planned council tax rise of up to 5% in England in April should not go ahead at a time \"when people are losing jobs\"."

      "tags": "BBC Three,Television",
      "text": "BBC Three will return as a fully-fledged TV channel in January 2022, six years after it moved online.\nThe channel has since been responsible for major hits including Fleabag, Normal People and Killing Eve - prompting calls for its resurrection.\nLast year, BBC research concluded there was a \"strong case\" for it to come back as a regular TV channel, focusing on younger audiences.\nMP Julian Knight said the move showed the BBC had \"failed\" those viewers.\n\"I question whether putting the clock back five years is the right way to win over 18-35s,\" said Mr Knight, who chairs the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS).\n\"The BBC needs to back success and make sure its programmes reach as many young people as possible wherever they live in the UK,\" said the BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore.  \n\"So regardless of the debates about the past, we want to give BBC Three its own broadcast channel again.\"\nAs announced in the BBC's Annual Plan last year, the channel's budget will also be doubled over the next two years - a decision that was also criticised by Mr Knight, who accused the BBC of putting extra investment into programmes while \"those over 75 are being chased to pay up for their TV licences\".\nThe BBC ended the provision of free TV licences for most over-75s last year, after the government decided to stop paying for the benefit.\nWhen it returns, BBC Three will be targeted at audiences aged 16-34, broadcasting from 19:00 to 04:00 each day.\nAs a result, CBBC's broadcast hours will revert to closing at 19:00 - as was the case before 2016. It currently runs until 21:00.\nThe move will still need approval from media regulator Ofcom before it can go ahead.\nSeven years ago the BBC announced that BBC Three would become digital only. The main reason given was the need to save money. The public narrative was: Young audiences congregate online rather than watch linear TV, so there's no point providing a linear service.\nSince then, three things have happened. The flight of young audiences to digital platforms, and away from scheduled TV, has accelerated. BBC Three has produced a big range of huge, global hits. And the pressure on the BBC, not least from Ofcom, to prove that it still appeals to young people has grown sharply.\nThis last point is critical. The BBC commissioned research showing that there is still a market of young people - albeit smaller than years ago - on linear platforms. Given the success of the shows commissioned by BBC Three, the feeling at the top of the organisation was that putting them back on a linear platform would create upside in terms of audience numbers, for relatively low cost.\nDespite the need for more savings today, that cost can be justified because when the BBC negotiates with the government over the future of the licence fee, it needs the strongest possible argument on its relevance and universal appeal.\nBBC Three was originally taken off air in March 2016. The corporation said the move would save \u00a330m a year, helping it to reduce its spending after cuts imposed by the government in 2010.\nMuch of the budget was reallocated to fund drama on BBC One, while BBC Three was expected to target younger audiences online.\nBut the plans caused controversy, prompting the Save BBC Three campaign which saw more than 300,000 people sign a petition to keep it on air.\nJournalist and founder of the campaign Jono Read said the channel's return was \"great news\".\n\"It became clear that the decision to to take it off air was a counter-productive move that bosses had taken to sacrifice the station under the guise of budget cuts, and one that was deeply unpopular with its audience.\n\"Nonetheless the online move has shown real potential for BBC Three and I think it will thrive when it is once again given the chance to combine traditional and new media when it returns to TV in 2022\", he says. \nMany of BBC Three's commissions have ended up on linear TV, with shows like Killing Eve and Fleabag attracting huge audiences on BBC One.\nNormal People, about the tangled love lives of two Irish teenagers, also became the breakout hit of the first lockdown. It was requested on the BBC iPlayer 62.7 million times last year, more than any other programme.\nOther hit shows on the channel include Man Like Mobeen, This Country, Ru Paul's Drag Race UK and the Jesy Nelson documentary Odd One Out.\nIn its online incarnation, BBC Three has won a raft of awards, including RTS Channel of the Year in 2017 and Digital Channel of the Year 2019 at the Edinburgh TV Festival. It is currently Broadcast Digital Channel of the Year.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "The furlough scheme will be extended until the end of September by the chancellor in the Budget later.\nRishi Sunak said the scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - would help millions through \"the challenging months ahead\".\nSome 600,000 more self-employed people will also be eligible for government help as access to grants is widened. \nBut Labour said the support schemes should have been extended \"months ago\".\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has protected more than 11 million jobs since its inception last March and had been due to close at the end of April.\nIt has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as tens of thousands of businesses remain shut. \nEmployers will be expected to pay 10% towards the hours their staff do not work in July, increasing to 20% in August and September, as the economy reopens. \nGovernment support for self-employed people has also been extended until September.\nA fourth grant under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) scheme will run from February until April, covering up to 80% of three months' trading profits up to \u00a37,500.\nThere will be a fifth grant from May to September.\nPeople whose turnover has fallen by 30% or more will get the 80% grant, but self-employed people whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will get a 30% grant.\nThe government is widening access to grants, meaning some 600,000 more self-employed people will be eligible.\nPeople who filed their tax returns for 2019-20 by midnight on Tuesday are now eligible.\nSpeaking ahead of the Budget, the chancellor said: \"Our Covid support schemes have been a lifeline to millions, protecting jobs and incomes across the UK.\n\"There's now light at the end of the tunnel with a roadmap for reopening, so it's only right that we continue to help business and individuals through the challenging months ahead - and beyond.\" However, he is expected to warn in his Budget that there are tough economic times ahead.\nAre you currently on furlough?  Share your experiences.\nIt is incredible to think that last year's Budget did not even contain the word \"furlough\". Official confirmation of a pandemic came hours after its publication, swiftly rendering most of its numbers obsolete.\nBut so far in this crisis, unemployment has gone up only modestly. Furlough and the separate support scheme for the self-employed have prevented mass unemployment.\nThese extensions now aim to prevent a rapid rise in joblessness at the end of the schemes. The BBC understands that unemployment forecasts will be revised down on Wednesday as the chancellor promises to deploy his \"full fiscal firepower\" to \"protect livelihoods\" - the theme of the Budget red book.\nAt more than \u00a310bn, this intervention is almost worthy of a Budget in and of itself.\nBut the full document will reveal whether the chancellor's borrowing spree is limited to the \"rescue phase\" of this crisis, or if his confidence in a jobs bounce-back means the economy does not need further stimulus and could even sustain some business-focused tax rises.\nAfter the jabs, the jobs are the great hope.\nEconomic think tank the Resolution Foundation's chief executive, Torsten Bell, said the phased tapering-off of the furlough scheme would avoid a \"risky cliff-edge\" for employers, but warned that the \"peak of unemployment is ahead rather than behind us\".\nHowever, Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the changes to support schemes \"could have been made months ago\" - accusing Mr Sunak of focusing on \"getting his moment in the sun rather than protecting jobs and livelihoods\".\nThe SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has said furlough must be in place  \"as long as businesses and devolved governments need it\".\nHe said he was \"concerned companies are going to have to step in and pay greater contributions\".  \nAnd Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said that while the extra months of furlough support offer \"some stability in the rocky months ahead\", the scheme should be extended until 2022.\nBut Chris Wootton, chief financial officer at Sports Direct, said that although the furlough extension was helpful, other assistance was needed for businesses such as his, chiefly through business rates, payment of which has been suspended for almost a year.\nHe told the BBC: \"What we really want is structural reform. This is just kicking the can down the road.\n\"We don't know what the systemic changes to consumer behaviour are going to be. We said even before Covid happened that a number of House of Fraser stores where we're working very closely with landlords, paying zero rent, they are still losing money because the business rates are far from fair.\""

      "text": "A single shot of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca or the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab reduces the chance of needing hospital treatment by more than 80%, an analysis in England shows.\nThe Public Health England data showed the effect kicked in three to four weeks after vaccination.\nIt was based on people aged over 80 who were the first to receive the jab.\nGovernment scientists hailed the result, but stressed that two doses were needed for the best protection.\nIt comes after similar findings were published by Scottish health authorities last week, which they hailed as \"spectacular\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street briefing on Monday the latest vaccine results were \"very strong\".\nHe added: \"They may also help to explain why the number of Covid admissions to intensive care units among people over 80 in the UK have dropped to single figures in the last couple of weeks.\"\nAlso speaking at the news conference, England's deputy chief medical officer - Prof Jonathan Van-Tam - said the data offered a glimpse of how the vaccine programme \"is going to hopefully take us into a very different world in the next few months\".\nBut he said it was \"absolutely critical\" that second doses \"are still part of the course of immunisation against Covid-19 and no less important\".\nProf Van-Tam stressed there was a \"significant likelihood\" that a second dose of a vaccine would \"mature your immune response, possibly make it broader and almost certainly make it longer than it would otherwise be in relation to a first dose only.\"\nMore than 20 million people in the UK have had their first dose of a vaccine - over a third of the adult population.\nMeanwhile, another 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus have been reported in the UK, and a further 5,455 new cases, according to the latest figures.\nThe PHE data, which has not been peer reviewed, also suggested the Pfizer vaccine, which started being rolled out a month before the AstraZeneca vaccine, leads to an 83% reduction in deaths from Covid. This was based on people over the age of 80 who had died.\nThe data also showed vaccination cuts the risk of people over 70 developing any Covid symptoms by around 60%, three weeks after an initial dose.\nProf Van-Tam said the decision to give the AstraZeneca vaccine to older people was \"clearly vindicated\".\nSome European nations have refused to give it to the over 65s because data from the trials was mainly on its effect among younger adults.\nProf Van-Tam said the judgement made by the UK authorities was that it was simply \"not plausible\" the vaccine would only work on younger adults.  \nHe said other countries would doubtless be \"very interested\" in the data coming out of the UK. \nDr Mary Ramsay, Public Health England's head of immunisation, said there was growing evidence that the vaccines were working to reduce infections and save lives.\n\"While there remains much more data to follow, this is encouraging and we are increasingly confident that vaccines are making a real difference,\" she said.\nHowever, more evidence is needed to know how well the vaccines protect against the Brazil variant that has recently been identified in the UK.\nThis variant has a mutation - E484 - that could reduce some of the effectiveness of the vaccines.\nIt was announced on Sunday that six new variant cases - three in England and three in Scotland - had been found through testing.\nHealth officials have been able to contact all but one of these people. The whereabouts of the remaining individual is unknown as they did not complete their test registration card. \nIt has prompted an appeal for anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February to come forward immediately by calling 119.\nThe health secretary has denied that delays in imposing quarantine hotel measures on travellers to the UK put lives at risk, as officials continue to seek the individual.\nMr Hancock said there was \"no evidence\" the infected person had not followed home quarantine rules.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK has \"one of the toughest border regimes anywhere in the world for stopping people coming in to this country who may have variants of concern\"."

      "text": "Stormont ministers have met to discuss Northern Ireland's recovery plan from lockdown but it is now unlikely to be published until Tuesday.\nMinisters had initially hoped to publish the plan on Monday but work to finalise details is ongoing.\nIt is understood the blueprint will focus on nine areas across social and business settings.\nEach section will have five steps out of lockdown, guided by data.\nThat includes the infection rate of the virus, known as the R number, hospitalisations, vaccine rollout and progress in testing and tracing positive cases.\nThe delay comes as two more coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health.\nA further 138 cases of the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours.\nThe department's daily dashboard shows there are 302 Covid-19 inpatients across Northern Ireland's hospitals.\nThirty-four patients remain in intensive care and 29 coronavirus patients are on ventilators.\nExecutive ministers are due to meet on Tuesday morning with hopes of signing off the pathway-to-recovery document.\nThey will also discuss last week's decision by Agriculture Minister Gordon Lyons to halt work on post-Brexit border control posts, amid a row over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe issue was raised during Monday's executive meeting with some ministers expressing concern that Mr Lyons had taken the decision without consulting other parties.\nSpeaking later in the assembly, Mr Lyons defended his actions as \"entirely sensible and appropriate\".\nThe border control posts are based at ports and are used to check food products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nMr Lyons, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician, said he was responding to \"practical difficulties\" but the move sparked a sharp reaction from Sinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.\nOn Monday afternoon, DUP MP Sammy Wilson defended Mr Lyons' decision on border control posts and told BBC's Talkback programme the DUP would \"fight the protocol with every means we have\".\nIt is believed the Covid-19 lockdown exit plan includes nine \"pathways\" to take account of various parts of the Northern Ireland economy.\nThe plan is not expected to include indicative dates but will set out criteria that must be met before restrictions can be eased.\nNorthern Ireland's lockdown has been extended until 1 April, with a review due on 18 March.\nIn England and Scotland, lockdown exit plans that include target dates for easing restrictions have been published but the respective governments have said the lifting of the rules will only happen if certain conditions are met.\nIn Northern Ireland, children in pre-schools and pupils in primaries one to three will be the first return to class next Monday 8 March.\nThey will be followed by pupils in years 12 to 14 on 22 March.\nPupils in other years do not yet know when they will return to school.\nMeanwhile, some restrictions around visiting care homes and hospitals in Northern Ireland are being eased.\nThe new rules allowing at least one face-to-face visit per week by one person. Daily one-hour visits will be permitted in hospices and women attending maternity services will be able to have someone with them. \nCare homes that do not have an outbreak will also be allowed to facilitate a variety of visiting arrangements, including indoors where possible.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, lockdown restrictions have been extended until 5 April but some pupils are already returning to school.\nOn Monday, the Republic recorded one more coronavirus-linked death which happened in January.\nIt brings the country's death toll to 4,319. A further 687 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed. "

      "text": "The search for an individual infected with the Covid variant first found in Brazil has narrowed to 379 households in south-east England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. \nHe said the batch of home testing kits in question had been identified and each household was being contacted. \nIt is one of six cases of the P.1 variant found in the UK in February.\nMr Hancock told MPs the UK's current vaccines had not yet been tested against this variant. \nBut work is already under way to tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new \"variants of concern\". \nUpdated vaccines could be ready within months, enabling people to get a booster shot in the autumn. \nPreliminary data from Manaus - the Amazonian city hit hard by the P.1 variant - suggest it is more contagious and may evade immunity provided by past Covid infection.\nThis raises questions about how well current vaccines, which were designed around earlier versions of the virus, might work. \nMr Hancock said the variant had caused \"significant challenges\" in Brazil.\nHe added: \"We're doing all we can to stop the spread of this new variant in the UK, to analyse its effects, and to develop an updated vaccine that works on all these variants of concern and protect the progress that we've made as a nation.\"\nThe search comes as the UK recorded 6,391 new coronavirus cases, down 33% on last Tuesday. \nThe number of daily deaths reported has also fallen to 343 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, down 60% on last week. \nMeanwhile, Mr Hancock said the government was \"on track\" to meet its target of offering a vaccine to everyone in the top nine priority groups, including all over-50s and those with underlying health conditions, by 15 April and all adults by the end of July. \n\"Although the day-to-day figures of supply are lumpy, we have some bumper weeks ahead later this month,\" he added. \nIt almost went unnoticed with all the focus on the Brazil variant, but during his statement to the House of Commons Mr Hancock made an uncharacteristically confident prediction about vaccine supply.\nHe said there are some \"bumper\" weeks to come. It contrasts with the policy to date, which has been to not talk about supply or, when pushed, to keep referring to it as lumpy.\nSo why the change of tack? It is mainly related to production at AstraZeneca's two UK plants which are now both fully up-to-speed.\nIt could mean around four million doses a week could be given in the second half March - compared to between two and three million in recent weeks. Soon after that supplies of a third vaccine, Moderna, may start arriving in the country.\nMinisters often refer to the programme as a race - the vaccine against the virus. Well, if that's the case, the vaccination programme could soon be at full throttle.\nThe person infected with the variant who has not been traced used a home testing kit but did not complete their contact details, Mr Hancock said. \n\"Incidents like this are rare and only occur in around 0.1% of tests,\" he added. \nNews of the mystery case prompted an appeal for anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February to come forward immediately by calling 119. \nThe case is not linked to five other cases of the Brazil variant in the UK and Mr Hancock said all these individuals quarantined at home as they were legally required to. \nTwo of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire. They tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force for arrivals high-risk countries. \nEveryone in five postcode areas of South Gloucestershire is now being invited to take a Covid test, even if they do not have symptoms.  \nMr Hancock said testing and sequencing in South Gloucestershire was being stepped up \"as a precaution\" and there was \"no information to suggest the variant has spread further\". \nTwo other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant.\nPHE has said officials are tracking down passengers who were on the same flight - from Sao Paulo to Heathrow, via Zurich - as the two South Gloucestershire cases.\nA BBC reporter, Juliana Gragnani, was on another flight arriving at Heathrow from Brazil around the same time on 10 February. \nShe said on Tuesday she had been has been sent a Covid test kit, along with other passengers on her flight.\n\"After quarantining for more than two weeks, just to make sure, this afternoon I got a call from Test and Trace,\" she said. \"They're sending me a Covid kit and said this is being done with all passengers in my flight - AF1580. \n\"They also asked if I had taken a test after arriving in England.\"\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said tougher border controls should have been in place sooner. \nHe asked: \"How on earth can a test be processed that doesn't collect the contact details and what mechanisms will be put in place to fix this in the future?\" \nThe other three cases are Scottish residents who flew to Aberdeen from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said. \nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman said there was no reason to believe the variant is in circulation in Scotland. \nHowever, she urged all those who were on board the BA1312 flight from Heathrow to Aberdeen on 29 January to contact the NHS National Contact Tracing Centre, because the correct details were not available for all passengers.

      "text": "The spread of highly contagious coronavirus variants is threatening to fuel a \"potential fourth surge of cases\" in the US, a top health official has warned.\nThe head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said she was concerned by recent Covid-19 data.\nDr Rochelle Walensky said about 70,000 new cases a day had been recorded last week - \"a very high number\".\nThere were nearly 2,000 deaths a day in the same period, she added.\n\"Please hear me clearly: at this level of cases, with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained,\" Dr Walensky said. \"These variants are a very real threat to our people and our progress.\"\nThere are many different versions, or variants, of Covid-19 circulating, but health experts are particularly concerned about a few which appear to be more contagious, including those first detected in the UK, South Africa and Brazil.\nThe CDC has predicted the highly contagious B.1.1.7 variant first found in the UK will become the dominant strain in the US this month.\nGiven this, Dr Walensky said she was \"really worried\" about reports of US states \"rolling back the exact public health measures we have recommended to protect people from Covid-19\".\n\"We have the ability to stop a potential fourth surge of cases in this country. Please stay strong in your conviction,\" she said.\nIn total, the US has recorded more than 28 million infections and 500,000 deaths related to Covid-19, according to World Health Organization (WHO) data.\nDaily infections and deaths fell steeply after a peak in January, when vaccinations against the disease started to be ramped up. \nBut the CDC says, until more people are vaccinated, variants could drive a spike in cases, threatening health systems already under strain.\nMore than 2,463 infections involving variants of concern have been reported, according to CDC data. Most of those cases - at least 2,400 - are of the UK variant.\nThe true number of people infected by variants in the US is thought to be higher.\nThere is no evidence that any of the variants causes much more serious illness for most people who become infected.\nScientists believe current vaccines do offer protection against variants as well.\nAs of Monday, the US had administered more than 76 million doses of vaccine, CDC data showed.\nOverall, the US has given the most doses of any country in the world. But when breaking the figures down by population, looking at doses administered per 100 people, the US ranked fourth behind the UK, the UAE and Israel, according to Our World in Data.\nAmong the vaccinated in the US are former President Donald Trump and former First Lady Melania Trump, according to reports. They were both vaccinated at the White House in January, an adviser told the New York Times and other US media outlets.\nIt was not clear which vaccine they had received, but only jabs made by Pfizer and Moderna had been approved by regulators in January.\nA third, single-shot vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson was approved for use in the US on Saturday.\nJeff Zients, co-ordinator of the White House coronavirus response team, said the vaccine would start to be delivered \"as early as tomorrow\".\nAbout 3.9 million doses of the vaccine will be distributed across the country in the coming days, he said."

      "text": "A 21-day \"circuit-breaker\" lockdown has been announced to limit the spread of Covid-19 on the Isle of Man, the chief minister has said.\nThe island has seen a rise in cases in recent days, with some stemming from an infected ferry crew member.\nHoward Quayle said an increase in other - unexplained - cases indicated there was transmission \"that we cannot see and do not understand\".\nThe new restrictions came into force at midnight.\nUnder the new measures, people are required to stay at home unless for exercise or essential travel, avoid mixing with other households and socially distance when outside.\nSchools are shut to most pupils and non-essential businesses are required to close.\nAnd all hospitality and leisure venues have also shut their doors to customers although takeaway and delivery services are still allowed.\nEdward Cox, who owns the Front Porch bar in Douglas, said the lockdown was the right decision but it was \"absolutely gutting\".\nHe added that he felt the government was not \"prepared enough\" for another outbreak and the island \"should never have got to this position\".\nThe \u00a31,500 in government support offered would \"not touch the sides\" and he would be forced to throw out large quantities of fresh food, he added. \nUnlike the January lockdown, construction work is allowed to continue provided it is outdoors or in a vacant property.\nFinancial support measures, which were put in place during the island's previous two lockdown periods, have been reactivated. \nIn recent days, the island has seen a small number of confirmed Covid-19 cases where the source is not known, one of them in a school.\nBill Shimmins MHK said the government's response to the current cluster of cases was \"akin to a slow-motion train crash\".\nHe added that, had measures been imposed earlier, it would have avoided \"this incredibly damaging lockdown\".\nMore than 40 Covid-19 cases have been linked to the cluster involving the ferry crew member, who tested positive for the virus on 18 February.\nOfficials believed it was largely under control, but five unexplained cases have been identified since Friday.\nMr Quayle said there was insufficient data to support measures being taken earlier and the response had to be \"proportionate\".\nThere are currently 52 active cases of Covid-19 on the Isle of Man.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland will be eased slightly when First Minister Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs about the state of the pandemic but the overall \"stay at home\" order is expected to remain in place for some weeks to come.\nMs Sturgeon has previously said that on 26 April - when non-essential shops, hairdressers and gyms can open again - the levels system will become operational once more.\nBut the new rules, outlined in the Scottish government's latest strategic framework, will make it harder than it was before for areas to drop down to lower tiers.\nIf an area is to see restrictions lifted, the number of positive cases will need to be far lower than when the system operated last year.\nUnder the new system, local authorities which have a case rate of more than 150 cases per 100,000 are likely to end up in level four - when only essential shops can open and hospitality must close.\nThe previous threshold for level four was 300 cases per 100,000.\nCases will also need to drop to below 50 per 100,000 in a local authority before it will be considered for level two, much lower than the previous rate of 150 per 100,000. That is the level where non-essential journeys outside the authority boundary are allowed and pubs can serve alcohol.\nThe government says the changes have been informed by World Health Organization (WHO) guidance, which indicates that some thresholds should be tightened.\nThe document says this \"will have the effect of keeping some areas in higher levels than they would previously have been for the same level of incidence, which we see as a necessary response to increased transmission of the new variant\".\nThere will also be some changes to the positivity rate thresholds from the levels which were originally set out in October, but the threshold for level two remains 5%.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of all tests that come back positive and is a key measure in judging the level of community transmission within a country or local area.\nThe rate is calculated by adding up all the cases over the previous seven days and then dividing by the population of the local authority. This number is then multiplied by 100,000.\nThe Scottish government has decided to align its tiers with the WHO's \"situational levels\", which range from level nought - with no known cases in the past 28 days - up to level four, which is defined as an \"uncontrolled epidemic\".\nThe strategic framework document says that the weekly case rates and percentage of positive tests will remain \"core indicators\" when deciding which level a local authority is placed in.\nThe number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nThe most recent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart uses figures from a few days ago.\nThe chart has been colour-coded to reflect the new case rate thresholds outlined in the strategic framework.\nCurrently there are no local authorities who would fall into the level four threshold, although Clackmannanshire is close. There are 15 in level three, 11 in level two and five in level one. Orkney currently has no cases.\nThe strategic framework document, published on 23 February, says there is a need for a \"more stringent approach to the levels\" when the system returns.\nThe more cautious approach is necessary to protect against further variants of Covid-19, the Scottish government argues.\n\"Our experience over the last few months and the changed landscape brought about by the new, more transmissible variant, in particular has shown that we cannot assume that the protective measures applied within the original levels approach will have the same effectiveness as when first implemented,\" the document says.\n\"However, it is also likely that the roll-out of the vaccine programme will reduce the transmissibility of the virus for any given level of restriction.\n\"To address this issue, we have decided to adjust our levels approach primarily by rebasing the indicators that we use to guide decisions on the allocation of levels on those recommended by the WHO in their most up-to-date interim guidance.\"\nThe WHO's latest guidance was published in November 2020, before Covid vaccines were approved.\nThe Scottish government's document also says that the \"content of restrictions\" within each level will also be kept under review.\nThis means that changes could be made to the existing rules in the levels system around travel, retail and hospitality.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"As our Strategic Framework sets out, the more transmissible variant of the virus, which is now the dominant strain in Scotland, has made it more challenging to effectively suppress the virus and demanded changes to the protection levels system to make sure it's as effective as possible.\n\"Data has shown that the previous levels of restrictions suppress the new variant at a slower rate than the old variants. Consequently, we have had to adapt our approach, firstly by strengthening level four and secondly by reconsidering the stringency of the levels system more generally.\""

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Alex Salmond has accused Nicola Sturgeon of breaking the ministerial code and misleading parliament. \nHe believes senior people around Scotland's first minister were part of a malicious attempt to have him removed from public life and ultimately jailed.\nMs Sturgeon has dismissed the claims and said he has no evidence. \nThe crisis could have significant implications for Scottish politics. \n\"He's trying to bring the house down.\" That was the conclusion of one of Ms Sturgeon's close allies shortly after it emerged Mr Salmond was publicly accusing her of misleading the Scottish Parliament and breaking the ministerial code.\nFor months, some around Scotland's first minister hoped Mr Salmond would hold back from directly criticising Ms Sturgeon in a way which could threaten her job. \nThey believed directly attacking Ms Sturgeon would alienate supporters of Scottish independence - something Mr Salmond would want to avoid. \nThat calculation changed with Mr Salmond's submission to an inquiry into whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. \nThe picture above was taken days before the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, when Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon were the dream team of the pro-indy movement.\nFor a decade, as leader and deputy leader, the pair had dominated nationalist politics.\nWhen Mr Salmond stood down, there was no question of who would take over: Ms Sturgeon was the natural successor.\nThat relationship collapsed completely as a result of sexual allegations later made against Mr Salmond.\nWhen the complaints emerged, Mr Salmond successfully took Ms Sturgeon's Scottish government to court over its process for investigating him. That process, it was found, was unlawful and \"tainted by apparent bias\".\nMr Salmond's victory cost the taxpayer at least \u00a3500,000.\nThe former first minister then stood trial accused of sexual assault - and was cleared of all charges. \nNow it is Ms Sturgeon and her government facing questions over the handling of complaints against Mr Salmond. \nThe former first minister of Scotland has made extraordinary allegations against the Scottish government and SNP - two institutions he used to lead. \nHe has claimed the process set up by the Scottish government, under which he was investigated, was unfair. \nMr Salmond alleges there was a malicious and concerted effort among a range of individuals to damage his reputation - and even to have him sent to jail. \nHe names people he believes helped to damage his reputation - including Ms Sturgeon's husband, the SNP chief executive Peter Murrell and her Scottish government chief of staff, Liz Lloyd.\nAnd he has made serious allegations against the first minister too, arguing she has not told the truth about meetings with him, that she misled parliament and that she broke the code which governs the behaviour of ministers. \nA lot of the controversy surrounds what Ms Sturgeon knew and when - and accounts she gave publicly.\nMs Sturgeon originally said she first found out about a complaint against Mr Salmond, being investigated by her Scottish government, on 2 April 2018.\nThat meeting took place in her home and was not recorded. \nBut it has since been claimed Ms Sturgeon was told a few days earlier at the Scottish Parliament by Mr Salmond's former chief of staff.\nThat's raised questions over what Ms Sturgeon knew, why she met Mr Salmond privately and why it wasn't recorded as official government business. \nIt is not simply a question of a few days difference - it is a question of whether the second meeting should have been reported and treated as Scottish government businesses if Ms Sturgeon had indeed known what it was about in advance. \nMy colleague Phil Sim has written about the ins and outs of meetings here. \nMr Salmond has also made claims that Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code by not conceding earlier that the Scottish government's process for investigating him was flawed. \nHe alleges it was clear the Scottish government would lose a judicial review months before it was conceded it court - something which cost the taxpayer money. \nThere are two inquiries into the Scottish government's alleged mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond.\nOne is by James Hamilton, the first minister's independent adviser on the ministerial code, into whether she has breached it.\nThe second is a cross-party Holyrood inquiry into how her government handled complaints about Mr Salmond.\nThis has been beset by legal difficulties - with significant delays to Mr Salmond's evidence being published. After senior MSPs decided it should be made public, the Crown Office, Scotland's public prosecution service, raised concerns which led to further changes. \nMr Salmond has accused Ms Sturgeon of holding positions which are \"simply untrue\", \"manifestly untrue\" and \"untenable\".\n\"Parliament has been repeatedly misled,\" Mr Salmond contends.\nThere are many in the SNP - including a small but loyal group of elected politicians - who believe there was a conspiracy against him which could lead to several key officials in the Scottish government and SNP standing down.\nSome include Ms Sturgeon in that group.  \nMs Sturgeon says this is all nonsense and denies breaking the ministerial code.\nHer spokesman has accused Mr Salmond of trying to deflect from complaints made by women about his behaviour - and accused her former mentor of \"spinning false conspiracy theories\".\nMs Sturgeon said this week: \"He appears to be suggesting some kind of conspiracy or concerted campaign against him, without a shred of evidence.\n\"If he can't substantiate it, it's time for him to stop making these claims.\"\nNicola Sturgeon's political opponents have struggled to land any political blows in recent months.\nPolls suggest support for the SNP is as high as ever - and that backing for Scottish independence has been rising.\nAlthough there have been criticisms of the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, polling suggests Scots are happy Ms Sturgeon is making the decisions - and not Boris Johnson.\nTo many in Scottish politics, it appears the biggest threat to Ms Sturgeon's position now comes from her predecessor.\nMr Salmond's claims that his one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 failed to tell the Scottish Parliament the truth - and that she broke the ministerial code - are serious.\nIn normal times such a breach of the code would lead to a resignation.\nThe code is clear: \"Ministers who knowingly mislead the parliament will be expected to offer their resignation.\"\nMs Sturgeon's political opponents have insisted that if she is found to have breached the code, she will have to stand down.\nPrivately, although they're confident it won't come to that, some around the first minister have admitted she would not be able to survive such a finding from her adviser on the code.\nMany senior figures in Scotland in the devolution era have resigned for less.\nThere is also nervousness in the SNP about the impact of these allegations hitting the headlines just weeks ahead of the Scottish Parliament elections. \nAlthough most would argue that the public just isn't paying attention, some acknowledge a number of party activists side with Mr Salmond - as do a section of SNP voters. \nIf the SNP are going to win a majority, they will need to mobilise their support ahead of 5 May. \nSome are worried this situation - combined with increasingly public splits on other issues - might turn some voters off, and lead to some activists staying at home.\nFor months, well connected opposition figures have talked about this inquiry being a moment of real danger for Ms Sturgeon's leadership. \nThey believe it raises questions about whether her government can be trusted. \nBut while many in Scottish politics discuss Ms Sturgeon's future - very few people are confidently predicting her demise.\nThe main reason is the pandemic. \nMs Sturgeon has high approval ratings for her response to the coronavirus pandemic.\nScots seem to approve of the way she is trying to deal with the health emergency - and some believe voters would forgive a breach of the rules in the midst of a crisis.\nIt's a view I've heard from Ms Sturgeon's critics as much as her allies; that these are not normal times and the normal rules of politics don't apply.\nMr Salmond's supporters are reluctant to speak on the record.\nI'm told that some elected parliamentarians are afraid of the backlash they would get if they did.\nBut one source said: \"I think in normal times she would be a goner. But I don't think she is a goner because people are rightly focused on the pandemic and her handling of the pandemic has been great.\"\nThe second is independence. \nMs Sturgeon has led the SNP and the independence movement to a point where successive polls have suggested support for leaving the UK is now a majority view. \nIf the SNP win big in May, they will use it to demand another referendum, which many think they could win.  \nThere have been criticisms from some in the SNP about a lack of strategy to force another referendum, but most accept the first minister is a key asset for the independence movement. Many think she is one of the main reasons for increasing support for leaving the UK. \nIf the SNP lost its leader that could have an impact on support for independence.\nWhile a number of names have been discussed, there is no certain successor - definitely not with the same UK and international profile.\nMr Salmond's evidence to the Holyrood inquiry will be a remarkable moment in the history of the SNP; the leader who took the party to the brink of independence accusing the leader who could deliver it of misleading parliament.\nEven if Ms Sturgeon survives, Mr Salmond's allies believe others may be \"toast\"; including senior civil servants and advisers.\nBut senior allies of Ms Sturgeon still appear confident she will lead them into the next Scottish election and beyond.\nOne concluded: \"Is she going to get through this? Yes she is.\""

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A coronavirus \"variant of concern\" first detected in Brazil has now been found in the UK.\nThree cases have been detected in England and separately three in Scotland.\nIn England, officials are still trying to track down one of those who tested positive for the new variant.\nThe three Scottish residents had flown to north-east Scotland from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said.\nExperts believe this variant (P1) - first detected in travellers to Japan from Manaus in northern Brazil in January - could be more contagious. \nThere are also concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it - but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be \"rapidly adapted\".\nDr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England (PHE), said the UK was more advanced than many other countries in identifying the variants and mutations and therefore able to act quickly.\nIn England, the first two cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force.\nTwo other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant, so they are not included in the overall UK total of six.\nPHE said officials are now tracking down passengers who were on the same flight from Sao Paulo to Heathrow, via Zurich.\nThe third case identified in England is not linked to the other two cases and the whereabouts of that person are still not known.\nPHE said the person did not complete their test registration card so follow-up details are unavailable.\nOfficials are asking anyone who took a test on 12 or 13 February and who has not received a result or has an uncompleted test registration card to come forward immediately by calling 119.\nMeanwhile, testing is being ramped up in South Gloucestershire - on the outskirts of Bristol - with people living in five postcode areas invited to get tested even if they do not have symptoms. The postcodes fall within Bradley Stoke, Patchway and Little Stoke.\nRegarding the cases in Scotland, the government said the three people had tested positive while self-isolating.\nOther passengers who were on the same flight from London to Aberdeen are now being contacted. \nThe Brazil variant is something officials are worried about because it shares similar mutations to the South Africa variant of concern. \nBoth have undergone genetic changes that could make them more contagious and perhaps less easy to stop with our current vaccines. \nThe coronavirus jabs being given to people now were designed around earlier versions of the pandemic virus, not these new variants. \nScientists believe they should still protect, although perhaps not quite as well.\nWork is already under way to redesign or tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new \"variants of concern\". \nThese updated vaccines could be ready within months, meaning the UK would have millions of doses ready to give people a booster shot before next winter to make sure the population is protected. \nThere will be more cases out there of new variants that have not yet been identified. \nWhile it may not be possible to eliminate them, the determination is there to slow the spread of coronavirus, including new variants. Sticking to the social distancing rules will help.\nBoth PHE and the Scottish government said the variant had been designated \"of concern\" as it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa (known as B.1.351). \nOne of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies. It is also possible that this variant may respond less well to current vaccines, but more work is needed to understand this.\nIn January, a coronavirus variant from Brazil was found in the UK - but it was not this variant of concern.\nPHE said the \"risk to the wider community is considered low\" but as a precaution extra community testing is be rolled out in some postcodes north of Bristol.\nIt urged people to keep following the coronavirus measures. \nMeanwhile, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the news of the variant was \"deeply concerning\".\n\"It is now vital that we do everything we can to contain it,\" he said.\n\"But this is further proof that the delay in introducing a hotel quarantine was reckless and the continuing refusal to put in place a comprehensive system leaves us exposed to mutations coming from overseas.\"\nThe hotel quarantine rule came into force on 15 February. It means that travellers coming to England from 33 countries - including Brazil - must pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while in Scotland the rule applies to travellers from all countries.\nBefore that date, travellers arriving in the UK still needed to self-isolate in their homes for 10 days.\nAll travellers to the UK also need to present a negative Covid test taken a maximum of 72 hours before their departure. \nHome Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said on Twitter it was \"notable\" that the pre-flight tests first brought in by the government in January did not catch six cases.\nIt comes as the UK announced another 6,035 cases of coronavirus and reported that a further 144 people had died within 28 days of a positive test.\nBut a milestone in the vaccination programme was reached, with more than 20 million people having received their first dose of the vaccine."

      "text": "Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been cleared of breaking rules during an investigation into her predecessor, Alex Salmond, but she's been criticised in a separate report by MSPs.\nAn independent report found that Ms Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code during the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond. \nHowever, a separate inquiry by MSPs has described the government's actions as \"deeply flawed\", and questioned some of Ms Sturgeon's evidence. \nThe pair dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade. They led the campaign for Scotland to become independent from the UK. \nAlex Salmond was Scotland's first minister and Scottish National Party leader before Ms Sturgeon, who had been his deputy. She took over after the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scotland back remaining in the UK by 55% to 45%. \nThe row began when allegations of sexual harassment - strongly denied - were made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants in 2018.\nThe complaints were made after Ms Sturgeon asked for new government policies on sexual harassment to be put in place in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Mr Salmond believed the policy was aimed at him.  \nThe Scottish government eventually admitted it had acted unlawfully. It had to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000.\nMr Salmond has accused officials close to Ms Sturgeon - including her husband Peter Murrell, the SNP's chief executive - of plotting against him. They all deny these claims.\nThen, in January 2019, Mr Salmond was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, including attempted rape.\nMr Salmond was cleared of all 13 charges - which were alleged to have happened while he was first minister - after a trial last March. \nThe nine women who made the allegations included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. \nIn court, Mr Salmond said the claims made about his alleged conduct were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\", or \"exaggerations\".\nAfter being acquitted, he said there was \"certain information\" he had been unable to talk about during the trial, but which would \"see the light of day\" in the future. \nHe has since claimed there was a \"deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort\" from some in the Scottish government and leading SNP figures to damage him and even have him sent to prison.\nMs Sturgeon has accused him of peddling false conspiracy theories and suggested her predecessor is angry because she \"did not collude with him\" to make the sexual harassment allegations \"go away\". \nFollowing the trial, two separate inquiries began. One was by a committee of MSPs and the other by James Hamilton, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions.\nMr Hamilton's inquiry looked at whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. It examined whether she had interfered with the civil service investigation into the allegations against Mr Salmond, or misled parliament about what she knew and when.\nThis report cleared Ms Sturgeon of breaching the ministerial code, but said it was up to parliament to decide whether she had misled them.\nSeparately, the committee of MSPs examined the Scottish government's handling of the initial complaints against Mr Salmond. \nIts report said the Scottish government's actions had been \"seriously flawed\". \nMSPs on the committee voted by five to four that Ms Sturgeon misled their inquiry during her marathon evidence session earlier this month. \nThe committee also said the female civil servants who had made the complaints against Mr Salmond had been badly let down by the government.\nThe row has divided the SNP ahead of the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May, with some prominent MPs and many grassroots activists openly backing Mr Salmond. \nSome opinion polls have suggested that the fallout could threaten the SNP's hopes of winning an overall majority in the election - although it remains on course to once again finish as the largest party.\nPanorama on Salmond v Sturgeon is available on BBC iplayer."

      "text": "A painting by former British prime minister Sir Winston Churchill, which was owned by Angelina Jolie, has sold for \u00a37m at auction in London.\nThe sale price was almost four times the top pre-sale estimate and beat the previous record for a Churchill painting, which was just under \u00a31.8m.\nThe Tower Of The Koutoubia Mosque, painted in Marrakesh during World War Two, was sold to an anonymous buyer.\nA Christie's spokesperson called it \"Churchill's most important work\".\n\"Aside from its distinguished provenance, it is the only landscape he made during the war,\" the spokesperson added.\nChurchill, a keen artist, took inspiration from the Moroccan city and painted The Tower Of The Koutoubia Mosque oil work following the Casablanca Conference in 1943.\nHe went on to give the finished piece to fellow wartime leader, US president Franklin Roosevelt.\nThe work eventually found its way into the hands of actress Angelina Jolie when it went on sale in New Orleans in 2011. \nFrenzied bidding at Monday's sale, much of it over the phone, led to the auction gavel coming came down at the record \u00a37m sale price, smashing the pre-sale expectations of \u00a31.5 to \u00a32.5m.\nChristie's said the sale figure with commission was more than \u00a38.2m.\nTwo more of Churchill's paintings also went under the hammer, with the three works together fetching \u00a39.43m.\nBefore entering politics Churchill was a career army officer and started to paint relatively late, at the age of 40.\nHe found a passion for the translucent light of Marrakesh in the 1930s when most of Morocco was a French protectorate.\nChurchill created his painting from the balcony of the city's Villa Taylor, beloved by the European jet set of the 1970s, after the historic conference in Casablanca, where the allies declared they would accept nothing less than Germany's \"unconditional surrender\" in the war.\nThe painting depicts the minaret of the mosque behind the ramparts of the old city, with mountains behind and tiny colourful figures in front.\nAfter the US delegation left the conference, Churchill stayed on an extra day to paint his work. He then sent it to Roosevelt for his birthday.\n\"This is Churchill's diplomacy at its most personal and intense,\" said Nick Orchard, Christie's head of modern British and Irish art.\n\"It is not an ordinary gift between leaders. This is soft power, and it is what the special relationship is all about.\"\nA second Churchill landscape, Scene in Marrakesh, painted on his first visit to Morocco in 1935, previously sold for \u00a31.5m.\nJolie's former partner Brad Pitt is known to be an avid art collector and, during their marriage, the couple bought some notable works, including some by Banksy and Neo Rauch.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

A mistaken switch or a failure by the old supplier to provide a final bill within six weeks also qualify for compensation."

      "text": "Nearly a year after Sir Keir Starmer became Labour leader, he is being accused of not listening to grassroots activists and not being strident enough in opposition.\nThe focus of the discontent is his reluctance to call for an increase in corporation tax amidst the coronavirus pandemic.\nThose on the party's left are now publicly critical, but some current shadow ministers are privately worrying whether the party's positioning on the issue is right.\nIan Lavery and Jon Trickett were shadow ministers under Jeremy Corbyn. They share Sir Keir's call for any council tax increases to be scrapped.\nBut in a document to be published on Tuesday morning, they argue that corporation tax hits the profits of big businesses, rather than hard-pressed families.\nAnd in a pre-Budget speech on Monday, another former shadow cabinet member, Richard Burgon, declared that unless Labour is bolder, it could be outflanked on business taxes by the Conservatives.\nNow one thing that unites all three former shadow ministers was their dismissal from the frontbench when Sir Keir assumed the leadership.\nThe left of the party have been increasingly critical of Sir Keir - especially over the suspension of former leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nBut they are now becoming more vocal on policy and positioning rather than personalities.\nThere are now concerns that as the country emerges from the pandemic, some of the radical policies on which Sir Keir was elected by his membership - including increasing taxes on the better off - will be diluted.\nSome of those who know the Labour leader well suggest that these concerns are misplaced.\nThe shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has signalled that Labour is open to increasing taxes on business in future. \nMore immediately, the relatively new Labour leadership want to prove their pro-business credentials and to give a clear, unmuddied message that securing the recovery is the party's priority.\nMr Lavery and Mr Trickett say they have consulted more than 1,000 activists and are giving the grassroots a voice. \nSupport for wealth taxes runs strong amongst Labour supporters, they say, and the leadership needs to hear those views rather than make policy behind closed doors.\nBut supporters of Sir Keir are sceptical that a sample of opinion selected by his critics is representative of the views of the wider membership.\nOn Tuesday, Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted that Labour MPs had supported Sir Keir's stance at a meeting of the parliamentary party.\nAt Wednesday's budget, Sir Keir will set out his dividing lines with Rishi Sunak, when he responds to the chancellor in the House of Commons.\nBut he will know his own party is not completely united behind his approach."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Alex Salmond inquiry,Alex Salmond case,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "For 10 years Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon showed how to be a successful political duo. They campaigned hard, won elections and brought to the fore a shared dream of Scottish independence. That irresistible combo is gone, having given way to personal silences and a public war of words. As MSPs continue investigating the Scottish government's mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond, we look at their story.\nAs the clock ticked past midday, I waited in the first minister's walnut panelled office for Nicola Sturgeon to give her first interview on the scandal.\nIt was Friday 24 August 2018 - the day the Daily Record splashed on allegations of sexual misconduct made against her predecessor, Alex Salmond.\nThe first minister was said to be so upset that her advisers worried she might cry on camera.\nWhen it came to it, Nicola Sturgeon kept her composure but there was clear emotion in the interview that followed. Her voice wavered slightly when she told me how \"incredibly difficult\" the situation was.\nAt about the time she was speaking to me, Alex Salmond was telling journalists gathered around a Linlithgow pub table that while he was \"no saint\" he had not harassed anyone.\nThe Scottish government had investigated complaints about him from two civil servants, under a new procedure signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. That was not news to the first minister because Alex Salmond had told her privately about the investigation several months before.\nWhat then could have brought Scotland's leader close to tears?\nThis was, of course, a watershed moment when a private burden finally had to be shouldered in public. And, according to one source close to Nicola Sturgeon what was also significant was confirmation from the civil service that it had sufficient confidence in its investigation to refer the complaints to the police. That is said to have shattered the first minister's confidence in the denials Alex Salmond had given her.\nHaving controversially met or spoken to him five times during the investigation - in which she insists she played no part - she broke off contact with him in July.\nNicola Sturgeon's long standing alliance with her predecessor was in the process of breaking down and the day of the Daily Record scoop was probably when it became irretrievable. Alex Salmond was effectively at war with the government he once led and therefore with the woman who replaced him - his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Nicola Sturgeon.\nThere was a lot to cry about. \nThe Salmond/Sturgeon association spans three decades - she had backed him for the party leadership in 1990 and he encouraged her to stand for Westminster two years later, when she was just 21.\n\"He believed in me long before I believed in myself,\" she once said.\nAlex Salmond was a mentor, ally and friend. You could trace his influence in her early speaking style and in the way she sometimes scoffed at rivals during debate.\nHe appointed her to the SNP front bench when they were both elected to Holyrood in 1999. However, a little over a year into the new parliament Alex Salmond gave up the leadership, passing the reins to John Swinney. When he resigned in 2004 Nicola Sturgeon made her move for the top party job.\nThe then 34-year-old entered the contest, but when it looked like she would lose to rival Roseanna Cunningham Alex Salmond came to the rescue. His decision to make a leadership comeback saved her from defeat. Instead, she became a winner, running as his deputy on what they styled as a joint ticket.\nThis was the beginning of the powerful political partnership that has dominated Scottish politics and made a big impact on the UK political scene in the early part of this century. They led the SNP into government for the first time in 2007, to an overall majority at Holyrood in 2011 and within touching distance of independence in 2014.\nThey worked well together. Not least because Alex Salmond tended to let Nicola Sturgeon and other trusted ministers do their jobs without interference. As his deputy, her skills and personality seemed to complement his. Where he revelled in the spotlight, she was more naturally reserved. While he enjoyed painting the big picture, she was content to fill in the detail.\nThey offered each other advice and challenge in private, and presented a united front in public - a discipline upon which the SNP's success was built.\nThat's not to say there were no disagreements. When the NHS faced a budget squeeze after the financial crash, Nicola Sturgeon took a stand. According to one Alex Salmond ally, she \"pushed very hard\" to protect cash spending and won the first minister's support. Had she failed, another source said, she was prepared to resign.\nNicola Sturgeon's confidence grew further during the independence campaign. From 2012, she took charge of referendum preparations as the Scottish government's so called \"Yes\" minister. It was during this period that she started coming into her own, establishing an approach that was distinct from his.\nContrast, for example, the responses they gave to protests by independence supporters against the BBC. Alex Salmond defended those involved, arguing they must be allowed to express a view. Nicola Sturgeon advised that they spend their time campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote rather than against the BBC.\nWhere he could be strident, she was more pragmatic is how one source close to Alex Salmond put it.\nWhile their relationship remained strong throughout the referendum there were points of tension.\nNicola Sturgeon was frustrated not to be involved in Alex Salmond's preparation for his first debate with the pro-Union leader Alistair Darling. The head-to-head, hosted by STV, saw Alex Salmond struggle with currency questions.\nWhen he set off for China in November 2013 without leaving detailed comments on the latest draft of the independence White Paper, her team questioned his commitment. The first minister's feedback would eventually filter through from the People's Republic.\nNone of this caused a serious rift between them - that would come later, once Alex Salmond had left office.\nOn 18 September 2014 the independence vote was lost by 55% to 45% and within two months of that date Alex Salmond was gone as party leader and first minister.\nAs Nicola Sturgeon prepared to take over, she acknowledged Alex Salmond had left \"big boots to fill\".\nHowever, she also asserted her political independence. \"I will wear my own shoes\" she said \"and they will have higher heels\".\nShe promised a more female friendly-leadership that would give priority to key issues of gender equality and seek to advance the interests of women. That's a pledge that may have weighed heavily as she thought of her response to the #MeToo movement a few years later.\nThe key point about this transfer of power is that it fundamentally changed this political couple's relationship. She was no longer the understudy, she was now the principal performer.\nThe new first minister travelled the country, addressing large audiences in what became known as her \"rock star tour\" and under her leadership the SNP won spectacularly at the 2015 Westminster election. \nBy contrast, Alex Salmond's political power was on the wane. He could have pursued a career in business, academia or on the lecture circuit but he could not resist the pull of politics.\nAs part of the 2015 landslide, he returned to Westminster, as MP for Gordon, in search of a new role. The party appointed him international affairs spokesman with a certain licence to stir things up. Friends said it was difficult for him to adjust. According to one MP, he did not take kindly to no longer driving the bus.\nWhen Alex Salmond publicly suggested a referendum might not be the only route to independence, the new driver asserted her authority. Nicola Sturgeon made clear that winning a referendum was now the established way to leave the UK.\nWithin a few months of replacing him, Nicola Sturgeon dropped Alex Salmond's policy of a blanket 3p cut to corporation tax in the event of independence. He was not consulted. He was, however, brought into the loop for some decisions, such as the ill-fated call for indyref2 in early 2017.\nThey were still in touch but nothing like as much as when they were partners in power. With one at Westminster and the other at Holyrood, they saw each other less and were gradually drifting apart.\nThe relationship deteriorated more seriously after the 2017 general election which saw Alex Salmond defeated for the first time in 30 years of parliamentary service.\nWhen Nicola Sturgeon phoned to offer her commiserations, she found Alex Salmond unavailable. It was, apparently, two or three weeks before they spoke.\nAlex Salmond was dealing with the death of his father around that time as well as the loss of his parliamentary seat. But there was something else.\nA friend of his said he was \"not very impressed\" with the SNP's election campaign, considering it insubstantial and lacking in energy and purpose. The party lost 21 of its 56 seats in this first election after the Brexit referendum and the Scottish Conservatives won 13 - enough to sustain Theresa May in office with help from the DUP.\nIf that was one source of tension in Alex Salmond's relationship with his successor, others soon emerged as he began a new career outside politics. Appearing in his own show at the Edinburgh Fringe, Alex Salmond was accused of sexism when he explained the absence of any high profile female guests with the double entendre that he \"couldn't make them come\".\nNicola Sturgeon said he was \"not sexist\" just as she had done two years earlier when Alex Salmond told Conservative minister, Anna Soubry in the Commons to \"behave yourself woman\". The first minister's defence of her predecessor was more qualified this time. She said he was not always as funny as he thought and that perhaps his joke belonged in the era of Benny Hill.\nIt was apparent to some in the SNP that she was wearying of him. As one MP put it, he was \"seen as a nuisance\" by the leadership during 2017.\nThe lowest point came in November of that year, when it was announced that Alex Salmond was to host his own show on the Kremlin-backed TV station, RT. Nicola Sturgeon has since spoken of her \"incredulity\" at this decision. It would increase the distance between them. As one Nicola Sturgeon ally put it - \"the first minister cannot take advice from a presenter on Russian state TV\".\nThe week before Alex Salmond's TV show was announced, SNP MSP Mark McDonald was forced to resign as a Holyrood minister over inappropriate behaviour. \nThe Scottish government's wider response to the #MeToo movement, following this departure, would set these political titans on a collision course. There was speculation that if Mr McDonald stood down, Alex Salmond might want to fight the Aberdeen Donside by-election.\nAccording to friends of Alex Salmond that was wrong - he had no interest in making another Holyrood comeback and Nicola Sturgeon's team did not take it seriously either. Even if they found him annoying, they did not appear to regard him as a political threat. They would not however have been unaware that Alex Salmond had helped nurture new talent at Westminster, including the QC turned MP, Joanna Cherry, whom some see as a future leader.\nWhat appeared to be of concern to team Sturgeon in November 2017 was an enquiry from Sky News about allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Alex Salmond at Edinburgh Airport. He denied wrongdoing and nothing was broadcast at the time, but according to a later account from Nicola Sturgeon, it raised suspicions about her predecessor's conduct.\nOn the first minister's instruction, the Scottish government was revising its procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying and harassment against ministers, following Mr McDonald's resignation. Nicola Sturgeon specifically told the civil service that the new policy could apply to former ministers and she put that in writing after the Sky News enquiry.\nThis note was sent after her private secretary met a potential complainer against Alex Salmond from within the civil service. The Scottish government insists the first minister did not know about that.\nSupporters of Alex Salmond suspected the new policy was designed with him in mind, however, the Scottish government rejects that claim. What is clear is that Nicola Sturgeon chose an approach that would not exempt her predecessor.\nHad she decided otherwise, there might never have been a scandal. Alternatively, one might have blown up in the media anyway and she might have faced criticism for protecting an old friend.\nComplaints of sexual harassment against Alex Salmond from two female civil servants were lodged and a seven month investigation by the Scottish government followed. Those findings were shelved when the 66-year-old successfully challenged the complaints handling process in court. It decided the investigation was \"tainted by apparent bias\" and he was awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in legal costs.\nBut the former first minister faced a much bigger legal battle ahead.\nIn January 2019, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was arrested and charged with a string of sexual offences against women he had worked with at the Scottish government or the SNP, during his term as first minister.\nWhen he looked at the names on the charge sheet - according to a Salmond ally - \"that was when it hit him\" that this could be a conspiracy.\nOne of those who testified against him in court has since told the BBC that it is \"utterly absurd\" to suggest nine women would perjure themselves as part of a political plot. Their evidence did not persuade a jury to convict and on 23 March last year - hours before the UK went into coronavirus lockdown - he was acquitted of the 13 sexual assault charges he faced.\nAlex Salmond is now trying to expose what he believes was a conspiracy, accusing Nicola Sturgeon of multiple rule breaches including misleading the Scottish Parliament. She denies his claims.\nTheir toxic feud has destroyed their relationship and caused deep divisions within the SNP. It also threatens damage to the first minister's reputation and to the independence dream she still shares with Alex Salmond. While she seems confident of weathering the storm, her credibility has hardly been enhanced by the revisions she's made to her story along the way. \nFor example, having told Holyrood she learned about the investigation into Alex Salmond directly from him, she now acknowledges that \"allegations of a sexual nature\" were mentioned at a meeting she had days earlier and claims to have forgotten. \nExactly what did she know and when, what meetings were held and why, where does party business end and government business begin? These are the questions being picked over by a committee of MSPs at Holyrood.\nThe inescapable point is that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon cannot both be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as they are obliged to do under oath before the committee.\nWhat started three years ago with complaints about the former first minister's behaviour has led to intense scrutiny of Nicola Sturgeon's conduct in handling those complaints. If Alex Salmond can prove his allegations, a clamour for her resignation will follow - ironically at a time when her party and its goal of independence are polling strongly.\nIf his claims are not proven, he is unlikely to give up the fight. Some of his supporters have called for him to be readmitted to the SNP. Others hope that he will stand in this May's Holyrood election for one of the newly formed independence parties.\nWhile those who know him well think that unlikely, they note he has not publicly ruled it out. As one MP put it \"you just never know what Alex is going to do next\"."

You just can't do it now.\"\nRead Laura's full blog\nThe Budget comes at a very difficult time for businesses and government finances.\nOfficial figures show the UK economy contracted by 9.9% last year and unemployment rose to 5.1% in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015.\nWith its takings down and its spending up, the government is expected to borrow \u00a3394bn during the current financial year - the highest figure seen in peacetime.\nThe furlough scheme, currently paying up to 80% of six million people's salaries, is scheduled to stop at the end of April.\nBut the prime minister's \"roadmap\" for easing Covid-19 restrictions says the final legal limits on social contact and business activity will end no earlier than 21 June.\nAsked on BBC Breakfast if the job support scheme would continue, Mr Kwarteng said the chancellor had \"already indicated that we will be extending furlough\".\nAnd he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think it's a fairly good assumption that, while lockdown persists, there will be additional support.\"\nMr Kwarteng said there would \"perhaps be an extension\" of the reduced - 5% - rate of VAT for the hospitality sector, also due to end in 31 March.\nIf vaccines continued to be rolled out \"efficiently\" and the roadmap was followed, there was \"every chance that the economy can bounce back\", he argued.\n\"We can see strong growth at the end of 2021, and that will be the best way to deal with the growing deficit or to try and reduce it,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nMr Sunak is reportedly planning to increase corporation tax to as much as 25%, from the current 19%, to reduce pressure on public finances.\nSome Conservative MPs, including former Brexit Secretary David Davis, say this would impede recovery and are warning they will resist this or any similar moves. \nBut former Conservative leader Lord Hague wrote in the Daily Telegraph that, after 12 months of heavy public borrowing to pay for furlough and other schemes, \"at least some business and personal taxes\" would have to rise.\nFor Labour, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said now was \"not the time\" for tax rises, but has signalled the opposition could support an increase in corporation tax in the future.\nShe has said the planned council tax rise of up to 5% in England in April should not go ahead at a time \"when people are losing jobs\"."

      "text": "A university has been ordered to pay a student \u00a35,000 in compensation for lost teaching time during England's first lockdown, a complaints watchdog says.\nThe Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) has released a number of complaints students have made about the impact of Covid on their studies.\nThey include concerns over disrupted learning, accommodation and missed practical elements of courses.\nThe cases show the \"complex situations\" the pandemic brings, the OIA says.\nThe OIA is an independent body that reviews student complaints about universities and other higher education providers in England and Wales under the Higher Education Act 2004.\nIts complaints scheme is offered free to students. \nIn 2020, the OIA received 2,604 complaints, 500 of which related to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\nAmong the complainants was an international medical student who had been studying at an undisclosed university and paying course fees of \u00a338,000.\nThe student was awarded \u00a35,000 after the university stopped all clinical placements as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, meaning the individual had lost out on practical experience.\nThe OIA said it was awarded due to the \"severe disappointment and inconvenience\" the student had experienced because the final year of studies had been \"less valuable\" than expected.\nA healthcare student has also been awarded \u00a31,500 for the \"inconvenience and significant disappointment\" they faced due to the cancellation of a lab-based research project as part of their Master's degree course.\nThe student had been moved to remote learning by the university in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.\nThe student said this meant missing out on the practical techniques that employers looked for, disadvantaging them when applying for jobs.\nThe OIA concluded that while the institution had taken a \"number of steps\" to ensure students were not disadvantaged academically, it could not deliver the promised lab work.\nAnother student was given \u00a3200 after missing out on 14 hours of learning time because of industrial action that took place over November and December 2019, along with disruption caused by coronavirus.\nAnd another case saw the lifting of an international student's accommodation penalty, imposed after they were found to be breaching social-distancing rules when a friend visited their room.\nThe student, who has a mental health condition, was excluded from the accommodation despite giving reasons for the friend's visit.\nThe OIA said it considered the penalty \"harsh\" and that the university had agreed to reduce the penalty to a formal warning.\nBut not all complaints were upheld by the adjudicator.\nOne student was not given a refund by the watchdog after paying university accommodation fees in three instalments before the first lockdown was enforced. \nThe student had asked to be refunded fees paid in March 2020 after the institution got in touch to say they should consider returning home.\nThe university had decided not to ask any students to pay the third instalment when it became due in April, but refused to refund the amount the student had paid for the six-week period before that.\nThe OIA ruled that the university had adopted a \"fair approach\" in a \"very challenging\" situation by giving the option for students to stay at the accommodation during the lockdown.\nTwo other students did not have their complaints over issues around teaching arrangements and exam-marking criteria upheld.\nIndependent adjudicator Felicity Mitchell said: \"The case summaries reflect the hugely challenging and complex situations that students and providers have faced as a result of the pandemic.\n\"Where possible we try to reach a settlement, and we are pleased that in many cases providers and students have been very open to this.\n\"The summaries illustrate our approach to deciding what is fair and reasonable in these kinds of situations. We hope they will be helpful to providers and students.\" \nThe group Universities UK says students should \"speak to their universities in the first instance\" if they have a complaint.\nA spokeswoman added: \"Universities are developing plans to support students to have the fullest possible experience when they return to campuses. \"\nIn February, England's Universities Minister Michelle Donelan announced an extra \u00a350m for student hardship funds, on top of \u00a320m agreed in December, in recognition of the disruption students have faced during the pandemic.\nHer announcement came as the vice-chancellors of seven universities called for the interest on student loans in England to be scrapped for 15 months."

      "tags": "Jamaica,Bob Marley,Music",
      "text": "One of reggae's most important voices, Bunny Wailer, has died at the age of 73.\nThe musician, from Kingston, Jamaica, was a founding member of The Wailers alongside his childhood friend, Bob Marley.\nTogether, they achieved international fame with reggae classics like Simmer Down and Stir It Up, before Wailer left to go solo in 1974.\nHe went on to win three Grammys and was given Jamaica's Order Of Merit in 2017.\nHis death was confirmed by manager Maxine Stowe, and Jamaica's Culture Minister, Olivia Grange.\nThe cause of death is unknown, but he had been in hospital since having a stroke in July 2020.\nTributes have already poured in for the musician, with fans and fellow musicians describing him as a legend.\n\"This is one of the lowest moment in the history of our culture,\" wrote dancehall artist Shaggy on Facebook. \"You have made us proud king. Rest well.\"\n\"Oh man, god bless Bunny Wailer,\" wrote Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist, Flea.  \"What a true rocker and noble man. I love him.\"\nAndrew Holness, Jamaica's prime minister, also paid tribute, calling his death \"a great loss for Jamaica and for reggae\".\nThe star, whose real name was Neville O'Riley Livingston, had been the last surviving member of The Wailers, following Bob Marley's death from cancer in 1981, and Peter Tosh's murder during a robbery in 1987.\nBorn on 20 April 10, 1947, Livingston spent his earliest years in the village of Nine Miles, where he was raised by his father, Thaddeus, who ran a grocery store.\nThat was where he first met Marley, and the toddlers soon became firm friends, making their first music together at Stepney Primary and Junior High School. \nFollowing the death of Marley's father in 1955, his mother, Cedella, moved in with Livingston's father. The boys were essentially raised as step-brothers, especially after Cedella and Thaddeus had a daughter together, Pearl.\nAfter moving to Trenchtown in Kingston, they met Peter Tosh and formed a vocal group called The Wailing Wailers - because, Marley said: \"We started out crying.\"\nThe area was poor and afflicted by violence. Livingston later remembered building his first guitar from \"a bamboo staff, the fine wires from an electric cable and a large sardine can\".\nBut singer Joe Higgs, aka \"the Godfather of Reggae\", lived nearby and took the boys under his wing. Under his tutelage, they refined their sound, adding vocalist Junior Braithwaite and backing singers Beverly Kelso and Cherry Green before shortening their name to The Wailers. \nIn December 1963, the band entered Coxsone Dodd's infamous Studio One to record Simmer Down, a song Marley had written calling for peace in the ghettos of Kingston.\nFaster and harder than the music The Wailers later became known for, the song was an immediate hit, reaching number one in Jamaica. They followed it up with the original version of Duppy Conqueror, before releasing their debut album The Wailing Wailers, in 1965.\nSoon after, the band went on hiatus as Marley got married and moved to the USA, and Livingston served a year in jail for marijuana possession. But they still managed to release 28 singles between 1966 and 1970, before releasing their second album, Soul Rebels.\nTheir international breakthrough came three years later with Catch A Fire - the first record they made for Chris Blackwell's Island Records. \nThe collaboration came about almost by accident. The Wailers had been touring the UK with Johnny Nash - who'd had a hit with a cover of Stir It Up - but found themselves unable to pay for their trip home.\nBlackwell offered to sign the band to Island, paying them an advance to cover their air fares and cost of recording an album in Jamaica.\nMuch to the band's displeasure, some of the songs were overdubbed to make them more palatable to an international audience. \n\"I felt the way to break the Wailers was as a black rock act; I wanted some rock elements in there,\" Blackwell later told Rolling Stone. \"Bunny and Peter didn't want to leave Jamaica, so Bob came to England when we did the overdubs.\"\nThe album was not a major seller and failed to chart in both the US and UK - but it has become widely recognised as a classic. Rolling Stone magazine recently placed it at number 140 in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, writing \"the Wailers' ghetto rage comes across uncut\" in  songs like Concrete Jungle and Slave Driver.\nCommercial success followed with 1973's Burnin', which featured classic cuts like I Shot The Sheriff, Small Axe and Get Up, Stand Up.\nHowever, it was to be the Wailers last album to feature the original Wailers line-up.\nTensions already present were exacerbated by Island marketing their albums under the name Bob Marley and The Wailers, and a touring schedule that kept Livingston away from his family. \nHe eventually left in 1973, saying the touring lifestyle clashed with his Rastafarian beliefs - citing the pressure to eat processed foods and play \"freak clubs\". He later said fame was the enemy of creativity. \n\"Music is based on inspiration and if you're in an environment where you are up and down, here and there, that's how your music is going to sound,\" Livingston told The Los Angeles Times in 1986. \n\"People get taken away in getting themselves to be a star and that is a different thing from getting yourself to be a good writer, musician, producer and arranger.\"\nFree from the band, he began to work on his solo album Blackheart Man, which included classic songs like Dreamland and Fighting Against Conviction, which was inspired by his stint in prison.\nHe went on to release several acclaimed albums, including 1981's Rock 'n' Groove and 1980s's Bunny Wailer Sings The Wailers, which saw him revisit some of the band's classic material.\nIn the 1990s, he won the Grammy award for best reggae album three times - with each of those records extending and preserving the legacy of Marley and the Wailers:  1991's Time Will Tell: A Tribute to Bob Marley, 1995's Crucial! Roots Classics, and the 1997's all-star Hall of Fame: A Tribute to Bob Marley's 50th Anniversary.\n\"I'm satisfied with knowing that I'm serving the purpose of getting reggae music to be where it's at,\" he told the Washington Post in 2006. \"I'm proud to be part of that.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nOn Wednesday, Rishi Sunak will outline the government's tax and spending plans in the Budget. As usual, there has been a stream of announcements before the big day - including a new \"Help to Buy\" scheme, and \u00a35bn to help the High Street recover. The latest is that Mr Sunak will announce an extra \u00a3400m to help the arts and culture sector recover from the Covid crisis. Mr Sunak is expected to put an extra \u00a3300m into the \u00a31.57bn Culture Recovery Fund in England. National museums and cultural bodies will receive \u00a390m to help them until they can open on 17 May at the earliest, with \u00a318.8m provided for community cultural projects. An additional \u00a377m will be given to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. You can read our budget preview here, and our business editor Simon Jack's analysis here. Meanwhile, the chart below shows how state borrowing has increased during the Covid crisis.\nThe French government says older people with pre-existing conditions can now get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \"People affected by co-morbidities can be vaccinated with AstraZeneca, including those aged between 65 and 74,\" the health minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said. Last month France approved use of the vaccine for under-65s only - citing lack of data for older people. Since then studies have shown the jab is highly effective among the elderly. The Oxford jab is used across the UK, but several EU countries are limiting it to under-65s - including Germany. You can watch more on vaccine approvals below.\nA university has been ordered to pay a student \u00a35,000 in compensation for lost teaching time during England's first lockdown. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) has released a number of complaints made by students about the impact of Covid. They include concerns over disrupted learning, accommodation, and missed practical elements of courses.\nThe spread of highly contagious coronavirus variants is threatening to fuel a \"potential fourth surge of cases\" in the US, a top health official has warned. The head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr Rochelle Walensky, said about 70,000 new cases a day had been recorded last week. Watch our video on some of the US Covid victims below.\nParts of the UK reliant on tourism have been most affected by the Covid-19 jobs crisis, analysis suggests. In some areas, around three out of five people who began claiming Universal Credit at the outset of the pandemic were still doing so six months later.

      "tags": "Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Welsh ministers have confirmed plans to spend an extra \u00a31.1bn in the next financial year.\nThe final budget for 2021-22 includes an extra \u00a3224m for housing, schools and other infrastructure, and \u00a3630m for the NHS and councils.\nMeanwhile \u00a3200m will be set aside to support businesses.\nWelsh Conservatives say business rate relief should continue, but ministers want to see what the chancellor will announce for England first.\nThe Welsh Government said it is waiting to hear what Rishi Sunak says about business rates in his UK government budget speech on Wednesday, and what that means for Wales.\nIt comes as the cash Welsh ministers expect to receive for Covid-19 spending from the UK government is expected to be less than a sixth of the \u00a35bn it has had for 2020-21.\nPlaid Cymru said \u00a3200m was a \"drop in the ocean\" for businesses.\nThe Welsh Government has finalised its spending plans for 2021-22, which they began to spell out in draft form last December and is worth more than \u00a317bn.\nIn the first financial year of the pandemic, Wales was given an extra \u00a35bn to spend on Covid by the UK government.\nUnder current plans, this is expected to fall to \u00a3766m. Ministers only announced plans for how they would spend 10% of that in December.\nSince then, another \u00a3650m has been announced by the Treasury for the Welsh Government as a result of additional Covid spending in England.\nThe final budget confirms some of the extra items that the Welsh Government is spending money on, with the pots of money it had left over from last year.\nMoney for the pandemic is additional to the \u00a317bn the Welsh Government spends on other policies. It has control in Wales of the NHS, education, environmental spending and transport.\nThe Welsh Government says it is setting aside \u00a3200m extra for businesses in its reserves.\nIt is not decided how that will be spent, and it is not yet clear if an existing business rate relief scheme will continue into the next financial year.\nAll retail, leisure and hospitality businesses with a rateable value of \u00a3500,000 or below are receiving 100% non-domestic rates relief until the end of March.\nA similar scheme is operational in England and reports suggest it will continue - Welsh ministers say they are waiting to see how much extra money there is from the Treasury on Wednesday.\nRebecca Evans told BBC Wales the scheme has cost around \u00a3360m in the current financial year.\n\"We would love the chancellor to say that he is intending to continue with the rate relief system,\" she said.\nBut she said the \"sheer\" amount of funding to continue to offer it in Wales means it would need extra money from the UK government.\nMost firms closed by lockdown are still awaiting a date on when they can reopen.\nMark Newbold, who owns two pubs near Bridgend, called for more clarity on support for the hospitality sector.\n\"I know they've put away \u00a3200m but that's not enough to support the whole industry,\" he said. \"There are so many businesses that have lost so much money especially last year with the great summer we had.\"\nThe Welsh Government says it is allocating another \u00a3224.5m on capital funding - cash spent on infrastructure.\nThat includes \u00a3147m on housing programmes and \u00a330m for new schools.\nAn extra \u00a38m will be given to councils and Natural Resources Wales to repair damage caused by flooding in December and January, and on wider flooding protection work.\nAnother \u00a320m will be earmarked for walking and cycling routes, which the Welsh Government said would increase total investment in active travel for the year to \u00a375m.\nAt a press conference on Monday, First Minister Mark Drakeford announced \u00a3682m in new spending, with some of the money being used to support the vaccination programme.\nA total of \u00a3630m will go on the NHS and councils, including \u00a3206m for a local government hardship fund to support social care and ensure schools can adapt.\nNHS services will get \u00a3380m, and contact tracing will receive \u00a350m.\nAnother \u00a310.5m will go to supporting vulnerable people, while \u00a318.6m will be spent on public transport.\nWelsh Conservative finance spokesman Mark Isherwood said: \"The pandemic has devastated the Welsh economy and people and businesses are crying out for more support from Labour ministers so we can support families and save Welsh jobs, but those cries have been sadly ignored.\n\"After over two decades in power and numerous budgets, successive Labour Governments in Cardiff Bay have failed to deliver for hardworking people, and sadly there's little reason to believe that this budget will be any different - it will only take us back to the same old normal under Labour.\"\nPlaid Cymru economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said there were \"large gaps\" in the budget.\n\"By refusing to extend the eligibility criteria for free school meals and to freeze council tax, Labour is failing to protect the most vulnerable from the impact of the pandemic.\"\nShe added: \"\u00a3200m is but a drop in the ocean for businesses who are, like the hospitality sector, on their knees and kept awake at night fearing closure and redundancies.\"\nMost of the cash the Welsh Government spends comes directly from the Treasury in London, but about 17% is raised through devolved taxes.\nThey include part of income tax, land transaction tax - the Welsh version of stamp duty - and landfill tax.\nAmong the announcements in December was a tax hike on second homes, to raise \u00a313m for social housing.\nAlthough this is called the final budget for the coming financial year, the reality is that it's likely to see many more amendments in the months to come.\nThe pandemic remains unpredictable, as does the state of the economy, so some of the most recent spending commitments are for a six-month period.\nThe chancellor's budget on Wednesday will change things too. If the reports of an extension to the business rate holiday in England are correct, Welsh Government may well follow suit here - new spending decisions for England mean more money on the way to Wales.\nAnd there's a Senedd election looming in May, so there may be a few late Easter bunnies being pulled out of hats.\nWhat's more, a change of government - or a new coalition agreement - would mean changed spending priorities."

      "tags": "Apprenticeships,Unemployment,Job Retention Scheme,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "Events planner Chantelle Spindle has seen her career take some unexpected turns during the coronavirus pandemic.\nAfter being furloughed, then made redundant by one company, she landed another job less than a week later with entertainment and event staffing agency RubyLemon.\nBut since the start of February, she has been put on furlough again.\n\"It is worrying,\" says Chantelle, 26, from Essex. \"But the company are confident about how they're growing right now and building the brand.\"\nChantelle's latest furlough has come as pressure mounts on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the wage subsidy programme when he delivers his Budget on 3 March.\n\u00a350bn so far\nThe furlough scheme has slowed down the number of redundancies, but at present, it is due to finish at the end of April.\nBoris Johnson was this week criticised for not confirming whether it would continue as he unveiled his roadmap out of lockdown - something Labour said left people in limbo. \nBut the prime minister did say \"we will not pull the rug out\". \nFurlough has cost the Treasury almost \u00a350bn so far and Chancellor Rishi Sunak is understandably reluctant to give an open-ended commitment to financing it indefinitely.\nBut the price of not extending it would be a further big rise in unemployment, which has already reached a rate of 5.1%.\nLast week, RubyLemon took a new team photo for the company's relaunched website. \"I was included in it, so that makes me think I'm going back,\" says Chantelle.\nShe works on the entertainment side, with responsibility for hiring musicians and dancers for events, and was working three days a week when her latest furlough began.\nShe says the scheme has been a lifeline. But while she hopes to be back full-time with the company once the pandemic is under control, she worries about the performers.\nMost of the 1,500 artists who work for RubyLemon across the UK are freelancers, who can't be furloughed and will continue to struggle as they wait for business to restart in June.\n\"I think once things are eased and go back to normal, everyone will want to party again,\" Chantelle tells the BBC. \n\"It just depends on whether these musicians or entertainers are in the same industry.\"\nIndustry and unions alike are prevailing on Mr Sunak to maintain furlough until at least the end of July, with the CBI, the TUC union and the British Chambers of Commerce all arguing for an extension.\nAlthough the number of people still on furlough has fallen considerably from the peak of nearly nine million, those still on the scheme are hoping that it will see them through until the pandemic eases and the economy reopens.\nBut many began on furlough only to be made redundant - and large numbers of them are still looking for work.\nAlison, from West Yorkshire, was furloughed by the hotel group she worked for between March and October. Then it let her go. \nThe 33-year-old, who was due to give birth to her first child in December, was not entitled to any redundancy money. Her employer also resisted paying her statutory maternity leave at first but relented after conciliation service Acas told her she was entitled to it. \nThe money only just keeps the household going when combined with her husband's income  and it will run out in April, so she needs to find a new job by then. \n\"I started looking for jobs in January, a month after having my baby. You wouldn't normally do that but I know some people have had it worse,\" Alison tells the BBC.\nShe adds: \"I would love to find part-time work and spend more time with my son but I will need to work full time to support the household.\" \nLockdown brought the hospitality industry to a standstill, and while restrictions on hotels should start to lift in May, things won't be back to normal for some time. \nAlison is open to roles outside her sector but feels pessimistic given the state of the job market: \"If I don't find anything our finances will be put under a lot of stress.\"\nShe wants Mr Sunak to do more support hospitality; she'd also like to see more generous maternity leave and redundancy rules to protect women. \nAs well as supporting existing jobs, Mr Sunak is being urged in this year's Budget to do more for those still trying to enter the job market, particularly young people. \nThere are calls to overhaul the Kickstart programme, which which provides subsidised work placements for young people who have been out of work for at least six months. \nSince launch in September, fewer than 2,000 work placements having been started due to Covid restrictions, despite 120,000 roles having been created.\nMr Sunak has also been urged to offer more support for apprenticeships after uptake fell sharply last year.\nOliver Holt, from Blackpool, says he wants to be an apprentice mechanic as working for a garage \"would be a dream\".\nHe secure four months' work experience at a local garage last year, but that came to an end when staff were put on furlough.\nSince then the 20-year-old, who has already passed his level 2 in mechanics at college, has not managed to find anyone to take him on, despite countless applications.\nHe says the pandemic has made apprenticeships hard to come by, while another issue is that he suffers from mild attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. \n\"An employer might think that I could be a liability, which isn't the case,\" he told the BBC. \"I'm super-keen and I have a positive approach.\"\nIn the meantime, he has washed cars to pay for driving lessons. After a post of his went viral on Facebook, well-wishers boosted his efforts by donating more than \u00a3300 worth of cleaning products.\n\"I was fed up of being inside and not doing anything,\" he says. \"It gave me a better work ethic and a better approach.\"\nSince August the government has offered businesses \u00a32,000 for each apprentice aged under 25 they take on, and a payment of \u00a31,500 for those older than 25.  \nBut this is due to end on 31 March, and bodies such as The Construction Leadership Council want Mr Sunak to extend it. \nThe government promised to continue helping people \"to find new jobs, acquire new skills or start new businesses\" as the country comes out of lockdown.\nIt also said it would \"carefully tailor\" the level of job support it gave to individuals \"to reflect the changing circumstances as restrictions ease and the economy is gradually reopened\". \nIt said Mr Sunak would give more details in the Budget on 3 March.

      "tags": "Economics,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "There has arguably never been a moment in living memory where business and government need each other more than now. Clinging together like the passengers in the front car of a rollercoaster - this Budget is the moment the photo is snapped after the sickening plunge, grimaces fixed for the ride ahead. \nBusiness needs the government to go on another massive spending splurge to get us to the other side of lockdown. \nIn many ways, the \"roadmap\" out of lockdown already told us the most important stuff that will be in the Budget. Furlough, the business rates holiday, additional grants and VAT deferrals and cuts for hospitality are all pretty much guaranteed to the end of June, when the government hopes firms will be able to operate with few restrictions.\nAfter that, the roles start to reverse. \nWestminster will need help from businesses to preserve and create millions of jobs. Companies will need incentives to invest, build, hire and train - particularly younger workers who have suffered the most and on whose economic future the success of this moment may be judged for decades. \nGovernments can encourage, but ultimately it is businesses which create.\nIncreased capital allowances, the expansion of youth training programmes and subsidies like the Kickstart Scheme are all expected in a speech behind which the mantra \"jobs, jobs, jobs\" will be almost audible from the Treasury building. \nThe tight embrace between government and business seems a long way since the concerns of business were swatted away with a four-letter \"swish\" by a prime minister who saw them as an irritant in the project of getting Brexit done.\nThe UK is in more debt than it's been in for more than 50 years. At over \u00a32 trillion, it is equivalent to 100% of its entire annual income for the first time since the early 1960s, when debt was still on a downward trajectory from spending on World War Two.\nBy far the most powerful weapon against debt is growth: it has a doubly positive effect. It increases the denominator (the bottom number) of the debt to GDP ratio, while reducing the numerator (the top bit) by keeping the bill for benefits like Universal Credit lower.\nThat is why the next twist on this rollercoaster ride is the most perilous. No-one really knows how many of the almost five million workers still on furlough have a job to go back to. More than anything, this Budget is about how many of them can return to, or find new, work.\nThere will be some eye-catching whizzes and bangs as the government experiments with ideas like freeports, drums up extra funding for start-ups and proposes looser stock market listing rules to grow new firms and attract international investors. \nBut sooner or later - and I suspect the emphasis will be later than recent headlines suggest - the government will need businesses help to pay off some the UK's enormous debts. \nCorporation tax will rise slowly. But this is perhaps a good example of how little politics figures in this Budget. The chancellor arguably has more to fear from his own backbenches than he does from a Labour party, who find themselves in the unusual position of siding with the very MPs in their opposition on tax rises on businesses - who already enjoy the lowest rates in the G8.\nBut corporation tax is pretty small beer anyway. It contributes less than 8% of all tax collected by the government, compared with the 45% it receives from income tax and National Insurance from individuals who have - you guessed it - jobs, jobs, jobs. \nThe government is also scared that the \"free money\" window may be closing. Ever since the financial crisis, governments have been able to borrow at close to zero rates of interest. \nThere are signs that is changing. A 1% rise in borrowing costs will cost the government five times more than it will get by raising the corporation tax rate by 1%.  \nThat is why the government and businesses will need to hold each others' hands on a ride they really are in together."

      "text": "Artists from 41 countries will appear live at this year's Eurovision Song Contest in the Netherlands under plans set out by the event's organisers.\nExecutive supervisor Martin Osterdahl told the BBC it was \"necessary\" for participants to travel to Rotterdam.\n\"This isn't a holiday trip, this is actually a job that needs to be done,\" he said, adding that a decision had yet to be made on a possible live audience.\nLast year's event was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe contest is due to take place in Rotterdam in May this year. Dutch singer Duncan Laurence won the competition in 2019 with the song Arcade. \nSpeaking to the BBC's Newscast podcast, Mr Osterdahl said the latest plans were developed following discussions with organisers of other international live events.\n\"We have been in close contact with organisations like Formula 1, the tennis tour, the golf associations, and learned from best experiences,\" he said. \n\"We've compared our plans to the likes of the IOC [International Olympic Committee].\"\nMr Osterdahl said it had not yet been decided if an audience should attend the live event, but that organisers were hoping for \"the most normal Eurovision song contest that we can\". \n\"Hopefully we'll have some audience, it makes a huge difference to the atmosphere of the broadcast if we have some people present.\"\nHe said, however, that delegations would be smaller than usual - limited to 20 people, down from an average of 38 - and that health and safety measures to be put in place were \"very thorough\". \nEurovision presenters like Graham Norton, who commentates for the UK's BBC coverage, will broadcast from ventilated commentary booths under the plans.\nContestants had earlier been asked to produce a \"live-on-tape\" performance ahead of the competition, with the videos to be used if artists were unable to travel due to the pandemic, or forced to quarantine at the venue.\nAll 41 countries who were scheduled to compete in 2020 will return this year, as will many of the contestants who were supposed to take part last year. However, all artists will be required to perform a different song.\nReturning entrants include Ireland's Lesley Roy and Iceland's Dadi Freyr, who was tipped as a potential winner. \nNew coronavirus cases have been falling in most European countries, however some are seeing a rise in infections.\nLockdown measures - including travel restrictions and quarantine requirements - were tightened in many of the worst-affected countries over the winter, but some restrictions are now being lifted.\nThe Netherlands has recorded more than a million cases of Covid-19 and 15,775 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

You go through men faster than Taylor Swift.\"\nThe line incurred the wrath of Swift's fans, prompting criticism of the show and its cast members on social media. Some Swift fans even called for a boycott of the series.\nOn Monday, Swift herself addressed the controversy in a tweet, writing: \"Hey Ginny & Georgia, 2010 called and it wants its lazy, deeply sexist joke back.\"\nNetflix has not yet commented on the criticism, nor has anyone associated with Ginny and Georgia.\nSwift's love life has long been in the media spotlight.\nSwift has been in a relationship with 30-year-old British actor Joe Alwyn for several years. \nThe couple have largely kept their relationship private -although Alwyn is considered to be the subject of her 2019 track London Boy, in which she sang about her experiences in the city.\nThe actor has also co-written songs on Swift's two most recent albums, Folklore and Evermore, under the pseudonym William Bowery.\nIn Monday's tweet, Swift also referenced her documentary Miss Americana, which was released on Netflix in January 2020.\nCovering several turbulent years during her career, the documentary revealed intimate details of Swift's life, exploring how her relationships had been dissected by the public and press."

      "text": "Union sources have told the BBC that they are very concerned about the potential risk to thousands of UK steel and engineering jobs.\nTheir fears follow the emergence of financial problems for the owner of plants at Rotherham, Stocksbridge, Newport and Hartlepool. \nCalled the \"saviour of steel\", Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Group bought up the struggling UK steel businesses.\nHis GFG Alliance company said it had \"adequate funding\". \nThere are 3,000 direct steel employees and a further 2,000 in engineering businesses within the group. \nOne of Mr Gupta's primary sources of finance is a group called Greensill Capital, run by former investment banker Les Greensill who counts former Prime Minister David Cameron among his paid advisers. \nGreensill's exposure to Mr Gupta's business prompted the Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to \u00a310bn worth of funds held as security. \nSources close to the situation told the BBC that Greensill was in serious financial trouble and that it would \"not be wrong to surmise that it was likely to go into administration\". \nThe sources added that there was a direct link between Mr Gupta's financing difficulties and risks to thousands of industrial jobs in the UK. \nA spokesperson for steel union, Community, said: \"There's no doubt these reports are concerning and, on behalf of our members, we are pressing the company for answers. Liberty Steel UK is a crucial strategic business and we are ready to work with the company and the government to secure the business and protect jobs.\"\nMr Gupta was hailed as saving thousands of UK jobs when he stepped in to buy up plants and processing facilities that seemed on the brink of going bust. \nBut his financial arrangements have always been shrouded in secrecy and controversy. \nConnections between Greensill Capital and international money manager GAM saw a senior manager at GAM forced to resign over allegations of poor risk management and due diligence over billions in loans to Mr Gupta's empire.\nGFG Alliance is a collection of global businesses and investments owned by Sanjeev Gupta and his family. A spokesman said: \"GFG Alliance has adequate funding for its current needs and its refinancing plans to broaden its capital base and obtain longer term funding are progressing well.  \n\"Our global efficiency drive means that our core businesses are operationally strong.  We are benefiting from a recovery in steel and aluminium markets which means that most of our businesses are running at near full capacity to meet high demand and are generating positive cash flows.\"\nHarish Patel from Unite told the BBC what many in the industry have feared for some time: \"Unite has always been concerned about the financial basis that Liberty Steel is based on.\n\"The latest concerns about the future of Greensill and Sunjav Gupta's refinancing difficulties are deeply alarming and  Unite will be seeking urgent reassurances about the health of the business units in the UK.\""

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Coronavirus lockdown measures,Scottish government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland will be eased slightly when First Minister Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs about the state of the pandemic but the overall \"stay at home\" order is expected to remain in place for some weeks to come.\nMs Sturgeon has previously said that on 26 April - when non-essential shops, hairdressers and gyms can open again - the levels system will become operational once more.\nBut the new rules, outlined in the Scottish government's latest strategic framework, will make it harder than it was before for areas to drop down to lower tiers.\nIf an area is to see restrictions lifted, the number of positive cases will need to be far lower than when the system operated last year.\nUnder the new system, local authorities which have a case rate of more than 150 cases per 100,000 are likely to end up in level four - when only essential shops can open and hospitality must close.\nThe previous threshold for level four was 300 cases per 100,000.\nCases will also need to drop to below 50 per 100,000 in a local authority before it will be considered for level two, much lower than the previous rate of 150 per 100,000. That is the level where non-essential journeys outside the authority boundary are allowed and pubs can serve alcohol.\nThe government says the changes have been informed by World Health Organization (WHO) guidance, which indicates that some thresholds should be tightened.\nThe document says this \"will have the effect of keeping some areas in higher levels than they would previously have been for the same level of incidence, which we see as a necessary response to increased transmission of the new variant\".\nThere will also be some changes to the positivity rate thresholds from the levels which were originally set out in October, but the threshold for level two remains 5%.\nThe positivity rate is the percentage of all tests that come back positive and is a key measure in judging the level of community transmission within a country or local area.\nThe rate is calculated by adding up all the cases over the previous seven days and then dividing by the population of the local authority. This number is then multiplied by 100,000.\nThe Scottish government has decided to align its tiers with the WHO's \"situational levels\", which range from level nought - with no known cases in the past 28 days - up to level four, which is defined as an \"uncontrolled epidemic\".\nThe strategic framework document says that the weekly case rates and percentage of positive tests will remain \"core indicators\" when deciding which level a local authority is placed in.\nThe number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nThe most recent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart uses figures from a few days ago.\nThe chart has been colour-coded to reflect the new case rate thresholds outlined in the strategic framework.\nCurrently there are no local authorities who would fall into the level four threshold, although Clackmannanshire is close. There are 15 in level three, 11 in level two and five in level one. Orkney currently has no cases.\nThe strategic framework document, published on 23 February, says there is a need for a \"more stringent approach to the levels\" when the system returns.\nThe more cautious approach is necessary to protect against further variants of Covid-19, the Scottish government argues.\n\"Our experience over the last few months and the changed landscape brought about by the new, more transmissible variant, in particular has shown that we cannot assume that the protective measures applied within the original levels approach will have the same effectiveness as when first implemented,\" the document says.\n\"However, it is also likely that the roll-out of the vaccine programme will reduce the transmissibility of the virus for any given level of restriction.\n\"To address this issue, we have decided to adjust our levels approach primarily by rebasing the indicators that we use to guide decisions on the allocation of levels on those recommended by the WHO in their most up-to-date interim guidance.\"\nThe WHO's latest guidance was published in November 2020, before Covid vaccines were approved.\nThe Scottish government's document also says that the \"content of restrictions\" within each level will also be kept under review.\nThis means that changes could be made to the existing rules in the levels system around travel, retail and hospitality.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"As our Strategic Framework sets out, the more transmissible variant of the virus, which is now the dominant strain in Scotland, has made it more challenging to effectively suppress the virus and demanded changes to the protection levels system to make sure it's as effective as possible.\n\"Data has shown that the previous levels of restrictions suppress the new variant at a slower rate than the old variants. Consequently, we have had to adapt our approach, firstly by strengthening level four and secondly by reconsidering the stringency of the levels system more generally.\""

In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough.\nSome employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends.\nInternational travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs.\nMany forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. \nIf you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. \nThe selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay.\nIf you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: \nYou might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. \nThe amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. \nYou may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition.

      "text": "The Scottish government has agreed to release key legal advice from its court battle with Alex Salmond after MSPs threatened a vote of no confidence.\nHolyrood has twice voted to urge ministers to publish advice they were given after the former first minister took the government to court.\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney previously argued that such legal advice should remain confidential.\nBut on Monday he confirmed that the advice would be released to MSPs.\nThe move came after all opposition parties indicated they would back a motion of no confidence in Mr Swinney if he did not comply, with the SNP government facing defeat.\nThe Scottish Conservatives had lodged a one-line motion and were pushing for debate on Tuesday - but said they would withdraw it if the advice was released.\nMr Swinney said he would be handing \"key\" papers over to an inquiry committee \"to counter the false claims being made by some\" about what advice the government had been given and when.\nThe row centres on legal advice that was given to the Scottish government after Mr Salmond launched judicial review proceedings in 2018 over the way harassment complaints against him had been handled.\nThe government ended up admitting it had acted unlawfully because its investigating officer had had prior contact with the two complainers, and had to pay the former first minister more than \u00a3500,000 in legal expenses as a result.\nThe Holyrood inquiry investigating the botched probe has been keen to examine exactly what advice the government was given during the row, with Mr Salmond claiming that officials were told by lawyers that it was unlikely to win the case months before actually conceding defeat.\nThe former SNP leader said he had \"absolute reason to believe\" that counsel had informed the government on 31 October 2018 that they were facing defeat - only for the case to continue into January 2019.\nMr Swinney appeared to push back on this while confirming the advice would be published, saying: \"Serious allegations have been made - this material allows people to confirm that these allegations are false.\"\nThe SNP does not have a majority at Holyrood, and what became clear today was they would lose a vote of no confidence.\nWith that threat hanging over the deputy first minister, the government blinked and decided to take the highly unusual step of releasing the legal advice.\nIn fact, the Scottish government has never before handed legal advice over to a parliamentary committee with the expectation it will be published.\nThey're doing that because of political pressure - although they also say they are concerned that Alex Salmond's claims have threatened the integrity of the justice system.\nThis is happening the day before the Lord Advocate is due to give evidence, and two days before Nicola Sturgeon is due to appear in person. This is a massive week for this inquiry.\nMSPs twice voted to demand the inquiry was given access to all legal advice from the civil case.\nThe committee was given sight of a memo summarising key advice from the row, but continued to call for more detail - particularly after Mr Salmond's evidence session on Friday.\nOn Sunday, the Conservatives said they were giving Mr Swinney 24 hours to hand over the advice or face a motion of no confidence.\nAnd on Monday they published a motion stating that \"the parliament has no confidence in the deputy first minister, in light of the government's continued failure to publish legal advice called for in two resolutions of the parliament\".\nAll opposition parties backed the move, meaning the minority SNP government could have been heading for defeat - with Tory leader Douglas Ross saying the deputy first minister was \"out of options - release the legal advice or lose his job\".\nMr Swinney confirmed on Monday evening that \"the key legal advice that underpinned the Scottish government's defence of the judicial review\" would be released on Tuesday.\nHe said: \"In normal circumstances, government legal advice is not released. Indeed, such is the importance of being able to get frank, private advice, it is almost unheard of for the legal advice to be released.\n\"But we have to acknowledge that the issues at stake now are not normal. The very integrity of the legal system is being questioned.\n\"Serious allegations have been made. This material allows people to confirm that these allegations are false.\"\nIndependent MSP Andy Wightman - a member of the inquiry committee - said it was \"not for the government to determine what is key legal advice\", saying the motion of no confidence should be kept on the table.\nThe Scottish Conservatives then tweeted that \"we will not remove the no confidence motion until we know John Swinney will fully publish the legal advice\".\nThe inquiry committee is to take evidence from Lord Advocate James Wolffe - the government's top legal advisor - on Tuesday.\nNicola Sturgeon will then follow on Wednesday, with the first minister saying she is looking forward to putting her side across."

      "text": "Stormont ministers have met to discuss Northern Ireland's recovery plan from lockdown but it is now unlikely to be published until Tuesday.\nMinisters had initially hoped to publish the plan on Monday but work to finalise details is ongoing.\nIt is understood the blueprint will focus on nine areas across social and business settings.\nEach section will have five steps out of lockdown, guided by data.\nThat includes the infection rate of the virus, known as the R number, hospitalisations, vaccine rollout and progress in testing and tracing positive cases.\nThe delay comes as two more coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health.\nA further 138 cases of the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours.\nThe department's daily dashboard shows there are 302 Covid-19 inpatients across Northern Ireland's hospitals.\nThirty-four patients remain in intensive care and 29 coronavirus patients are on ventilators.\nExecutive ministers are due to meet on Tuesday morning with hopes of signing off the pathway-to-recovery document.\nThey will also discuss last week's decision by Agriculture Minister Gordon Lyons to halt work on post-Brexit border control posts, amid a row over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe issue was raised during Monday's executive meeting with some ministers expressing concern that Mr Lyons had taken the decision without consulting other parties.\nSpeaking later in the assembly, Mr Lyons defended his actions as \"entirely sensible and appropriate\".\nThe border control posts are based at ports and are used to check food products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nMr Lyons, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician, said he was responding to \"practical difficulties\" but the move sparked a sharp reaction from Sinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.\nOn Monday afternoon, DUP MP Sammy Wilson defended Mr Lyons' decision on border control posts and told BBC's Talkback programme the DUP would \"fight the protocol with every means we have\".\nIt is believed the Covid-19 lockdown exit plan includes nine \"pathways\" to take account of various parts of the Northern Ireland economy.\nThe plan is not expected to include indicative dates but will set out criteria that must be met before restrictions can be eased.\nNorthern Ireland's lockdown has been extended until 1 April, with a review due on 18 March.\nIn England and Scotland, lockdown exit plans that include target dates for easing restrictions have been published but the respective governments have said the lifting of the rules will only happen if certain conditions are met.\nIn Northern Ireland, children in pre-schools and pupils in primaries one to three will be the first return to class next Monday 8 March.\nThey will be followed by pupils in years 12 to 14 on 22 March.\nPupils in other years do not yet know when they will return to school.\nMeanwhile, some restrictions around visiting care homes and hospitals in Northern Ireland are being eased.\nThe new rules allowing at least one face-to-face visit per week by one person. Daily one-hour visits will be permitted in hospices and women attending maternity services will be able to have someone with them. \nCare homes that do not have an outbreak will also be allowed to facilitate a variety of visiting arrangements, including indoors where possible.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, lockdown restrictions have been extended until 5 April but some pupils are already returning to school.\nOn Monday, the Republic recorded one more coronavirus-linked death which happened in January.\nIt brings the country's death toll to 4,319. A further 687 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed. "

      "tags": "UK banking,NI economy,Banking",
      "text": "Bank of Ireland has announced it will close 15 branches in Northern Ireland, which is more than half of its 28 branches currently operating in NI.\nIt is part of a wider cost-cutting exercise that includes the closure of 88 banks in the Republic of Ireland, where 169 banks will remain open.\nThe Dublin-based bank operates across the Republic and the UK. It is one of NI's \"big four\" banks.\nThe bank's UK head office will also relocate from London to Belfast.\nThe bank has been reviewing its Northern Ireland operations and there had been speculation that it could withdraw from the market.\nThat has not happened, but Chief Executive Francesca McDonagh said the Northern Ireland business will undergo \"a material restructure\".\nThe branch closures will affect the roles of about 120 staff in Northern Ireland but will not result in compulsory redundancies, according to Ian McLaughlin, Chief Executive of Bank of Ireland UK.\nThe branches earmarked for closure are:\nThe bank would work to identify staff who could be redeployed to other roles within the company, as an alternative to redundancy, said Mr McLaughlin.\nBranch closures will not start for 12 weeks and customers will be contacted individually about the changes, he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \nAside from closing 15 branches, the restructuring of its Northern Ireland business will include simplifying its range of products with a greater focus on car finance and mortgages.\nThe bank will also continue with its strategy of withdrawing from less profitable lending across the UK.\nIt said this would mean its UK loan book shrinking by about 10% during 2021.\nThe bank's UK division made a loss of \u00a315m in 2020, compared to a profit of \u00a3152m in 2019.\nThe loss was due to impairment charges - money which must be set aside to cover loans which may not be repaid in full.\nAll banks have seen increased impairment charges due to the economic impact of the pandemic.\nThe bank as a whole showed an annual loss of \u20ac760m (\u00a3657m), again due to impairment charges.\n\"We've announced some rather eye-watering numbers this morning, like most banks,\" Mr McLaughlin told Good Morning Ulster.\n\"It's been a really tough time and anyone who tells you differently isn't really paying attention, but we've got a really solid business here,\" he insisted. \nMr McLaughlin added that the relocation of the bank's UK office to Belfast was \"really good news and a sign of our commitment to Northern Ireland\".\nHe said the branch closures were in response to changes in customer behaviour over the last four years.\nHe argued that as the popularity of digital services like online shopping had increased, banks could not be \"insulated\" from the switch to digital.\n\"Our customers are using our branches less and less and we've reached a bit of a tipping point,\" Mr McLaughlin said. \n\"Our cash usage and customer visits in the closing branches is down 70% since 2017 and commensurately our digital banking up 50% over the same period so we need to adapt and we need to change.\"\nRetail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the number of closures \"seems a step too far\".\nAcknowledging \"the significant increase in online banking\", Mr Roberts said Monday's news will have a \"negative impact\" on high streets across Northern Ireland when the lockdown ends.\n\"I have also particular concerns of the impact on rural communities, with further reduced ATM provision and the ability to access cash,\" he added.\nThe Consumer Council has said the closures risk isolating consumers by removing access to essential services.\nFinancial Services Director Scott Kennerley said many consumers and small businesses still rely on face-to-face banking.\n\"We know that some consumers in Northern Ireland still prefer to use cash so the decision by Bank of Ireland to close half of its branch network will have a negative impact on consumers and their access to cash services,\" he said.\n\"We will continue to engage with Bank of Ireland to understand how it is supporting consumers affected by this decision.\"\nBank of Ireland had already closed several branches over the last decade. \nIn 2011, it had 44 branches in Northern Ireland. \nIn August last year, the bank said it was aiming to cut 1,400 jobs from its UK and Ireland operations. \nLast week, Ulster Bank confirmed it would close its Republic of Ireland business over the next few years."

      "tags": "Russia,Alexei Navalny,United States",
      "text": "The US has imposed sanctions on senior Russian officials over the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\nThe measures, which target Russia's top spy and six others, are being co-ordinated with similar moves by the European Union.\nUS officials said intelligence had concluded that the Moscow government was behind the near-fatal nerve agent attack on Navalny last year.\nHe is the most high-profile critic of President Vladimir Putin.\nMoscow denies involvement in his poisoning and disputes the conclusion, by Western weapons experts, that Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok agent during a flight in Siberia.\nThe term Novichok - \"newcomer\" in Russian - applies to a group of nerve agents developed in a lab by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. They paralyse muscles and can lead to death by asphyxiation.\nSanctions are being imposed on seven senior Russian officials and 14 entities involved in chemical and biological production, administration officials said.\n\"Russia's attempt to kill Mr Navalny follows an alarming pattern of chemical weapons use by Russia,\" one official said.\nNovichok was used in a 2018 attack in the English city of Salisbury against a Russian exiled double-agent and his daughter.\nUnder the sanctions, the assets of the officials in the US are frozen.\nThose targeted include Alexander Bortnikov, who heads the FSB, Russia's main intelligence agency, as well as deputy Defence Ministers Alexei Krivoruchko and Pavel Popov.\nThe sanctions are the first imposed on Russia by the administration of President Joe Biden. He has taken a tougher stance than his predecessor Donald Trump towards President Putin.\nAfter phoning his Russian counterpart last month, Mr Biden said he had made it clear the days of the US \"rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyber-attacks, poisoning citizens are over\".\nIn a co-ordinated move, the EU announced on Tuesday that it had targeted four Russian government officials. \nThey are Alexandr Kalashnikov, the head of the Russian prison system, Alexandr Bastrykin, chairman of the Investigative Committee, Chief Prosecutor Igor Krasnov, and Viktor Zolotov, who heads of the National Guard. \nThe sanctions include travel bans and asset freezes.\nThe BBC's Kevin Connolly in Brussels says they are a compromise between the Baltic states, which see Russia as a dangerous neighbour, and countries - notably Germany - which rely on Russian gas imports. \nThe move follows an earlier series of EU sanctions. In October the bloc imposed travel bans and asset freezes on six Russian officials, including Mr Bortnikov, accused of involvement in the poisoning.\nA chemical weapons research centre was also targeted. Russia responded with tit-for-tat sanctions. \nThis is the first step by the Biden administration to respond to what it calls Russia's \"malign\" activity. It is a sharp turn away from the approach of the former president, Donald Trump, who was reluctant to confront the Russian leader Vladimir Putin. \nUS officials said they were seeking neither an escalation nor a reset with Russia. The goal is to have a \"predictable and stable\" relationship that leaves space for co-operation on areas such as nuclear proliferation - but also to be clear that there are costs for behaviour that crosses boundaries \"respected by responsible nations\". \nThe US is also seeking to work with European allies. The officials said the US was catching up with measures the EU had taken earlier and mirroring others it was taking now.  \nFurther sanctions could be levied in three other areas under review. These include allegations that Russia interfered in the 2020 presidential election, carried out a cyber-hack of US government networks, and paid bounties to Taliban linked militants for killing US soldiers in Afghanistan.\nThe Russian government responded even before the US and EU moves were confirmed.\nEarly on Tuesday Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated his claim that the West was \"hiding the facts that could help to understand what had happened\" to Navalny and was unfairly punishing Russia.\n\"We have repeatedly expressed our position in regards to illegitimate unilateral sanctions that... are used by the colleagues from the United States and those who take an example from them, the European Union,\" he said.\nHis government would respond in kind to any sanctions, he added.\nAn anti-corruption campaigner, he has long been the most prominent face of Russian opposition to Mr Putin's rule.\nThe 44-year-old blogger has millions of followers on social media. He managed to get some of his supporters elected to councils in Siberia in 2020.\nNavalny was poisoned and fell into a coma during a flight to Siberia last August. He was airlifted to Germany, where he recovered. In January he decided to return to Russia and was arrested on arrival.\nA court last month found that Navalny had violated the terms of an earlier sentence for embezzlement by not turning up to the probation office while he was being treated in Germany.\nHis suspended sentence was turned into an actual prison term of two-and-a-half years. Last week he was sent from detention in Moscow to a penal colony to serve out the sentence.\nNavalny and his supporters say all charges against him are politically motivated. President Biden and EU leaders have called for his immediate release."

      "tags": "BBC Three,Television",
      "text": "BBC Three will return as a fully-fledged TV channel in January 2022, six years after it moved online.\nThe channel has since been responsible for major hits including Fleabag, Normal People and Killing Eve - prompting calls for its resurrection.\nLast year, BBC research concluded there was a \"strong case\" for it to come back as a regular TV channel, focusing on younger audiences.\nMP Julian Knight said the move showed the BBC had \"failed\" those viewers.\n\"I question whether putting the clock back five years is the right way to win over 18-35s,\" said Mr Knight, who chairs the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS).\n\"The BBC needs to back success and make sure its programmes reach as many young people as possible wherever they live in the UK,\" said the BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore.  \n\"So regardless of the debates about the past, we want to give BBC Three its own broadcast channel again.\"\nAs announced in the BBC's Annual Plan last year, the channel's budget will also be doubled over the next two years - a decision that was also criticised by Mr Knight, who accused the BBC of putting extra investment into programmes while \"those over 75 are being chased to pay up for their TV licences\".\nThe BBC ended the provision of free TV licences for most over-75s last year, after the government decided to stop paying for the benefit.\nWhen it returns, BBC Three will be targeted at audiences aged 16-34, broadcasting from 19:00 to 04:00 each day.\nAs a result, CBBC's broadcast hours will revert to closing at 19:00 - as was the case before 2016. It currently runs until 21:00.\nThe move will still need approval from media regulator Ofcom before it can go ahead.\nSeven years ago the BBC announced that BBC Three would become digital only. The main reason given was the need to save money. The public narrative was: Young audiences congregate online rather than watch linear TV, so there's no point providing a linear service.\nSince then, three things have happened. The flight of young audiences to digital platforms, and away from scheduled TV, has accelerated. BBC Three has produced a big range of huge, global hits. And the pressure on the BBC, not least from Ofcom, to prove that it still appeals to young people has grown sharply.\nThis last point is critical. The BBC commissioned research showing that there is still a market of young people - albeit smaller than years ago - on linear platforms. Given the success of the shows commissioned by BBC Three, the feeling at the top of the organisation was that putting them back on a linear platform would create upside in terms of audience numbers, for relatively low cost.\nDespite the need for more savings today, that cost can be justified because when the BBC negotiates with the government over the future of the licence fee, it needs the strongest possible argument on its relevance and universal appeal.\nBBC Three was originally taken off air in March 2016. The corporation said the move would save \u00a330m a year, helping it to reduce its spending after cuts imposed by the government in 2010.\nMuch of the budget was reallocated to fund drama on BBC One, while BBC Three was expected to target younger audiences online.\nBut the plans caused controversy, prompting the Save BBC Three campaign which saw more than 300,000 people sign a petition to keep it on air.\nJournalist and founder of the campaign Jono Read said the channel's return was \"great news\".\n\"It became clear that the decision to to take it off air was a counter-productive move that bosses had taken to sacrifice the station under the guise of budget cuts, and one that was deeply unpopular with its audience.\n\"Nonetheless the online move has shown real potential for BBC Three and I think it will thrive when it is once again given the chance to combine traditional and new media when it returns to TV in 2022\", he says. \nMany of BBC Three's commissions have ended up on linear TV, with shows like Killing Eve and Fleabag attracting huge audiences on BBC One.\nNormal People, about the tangled love lives of two Irish teenagers, also became the breakout hit of the first lockdown. It was requested on the BBC iPlayer 62.7 million times last year, more than any other programme.\nOther hit shows on the channel include Man Like Mobeen, This Country, Ru Paul's Drag Race UK and the Jesy Nelson documentary Odd One Out.\nIn its online incarnation, BBC Three has won a raft of awards, including RTS Channel of the Year in 2017 and Digital Channel of the Year 2019 at the Edinburgh TV Festival. It is currently Broadcast Digital Channel of the Year.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "text": "A man who was arrested after police suspected he had breached Covid rules by going to the beach has claimed he was strip-searched while in custody. \nRadek Kotlarek, 39, from Rhos-on-Sea, Conwy, was arrested on Sunday after driving more than 20 miles to Talacre, Flintshire, with his wife and son.\nMr Kotlarek was released without charge and has not been fined for breaching Covid regulations. \nNorth Wales Police said the officers behaved in a \"calm and reasonable way\".\nNow posts from September and January on Mr Kotlarek's Facebook page have emerged in which he appeared to claim\u00a0coronavirus was \"fake\".\nNorth Wales Police said officers arrested Mr Kotlarek after he refused to give his name when they suspected he had breached coronavirus regulations. \nMr Kotlarek said he took his wife, Marta, and teenage son to the beauty spot - which is about 22 miles (35km) from their home - for a \"mental break\", with concerns their son was struggling in lockdown and because of the \"trauma\" of missing seriously ill family members in Poland.\nIn a video posted on social media the couple are heard telling the officers their trip was essential. \nMr Kotlarek is heard shouting \"stop it\" at the officers before one responds by saying: \"Stop shouting at me or I will arrest you.\"\nHe is then handcuffed after telling the officer: \"You are harassing us.\"\nCh Supt Nigel Harrison of North Wales Police said: \"The person was spoken to at Talacre beach as officers reasonably suspected he had committed an offence, which in this case was a breach in coronavirus regulations.\n\"The man, who is from the seaside town of Rhos-on-Sea, some 22 miles away, was arrested because his details could not be ascertained at the time in order to be reported for the suspected breach.\"\nWales' lockdown rules state all exercise must start from home and travel must only be for essential reasons. \nCoronavirus legislation states it is an offence to contravene an instruction given by an enforcement officer. \nSpeaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Mr Kotlarek insisted he was not a \"Covid-denier\",\u00a0despite the posts made on his Facebook account.\nThe public relations worker said government measures to tackle the infection were \"disproportionate\" and the \"media narrative over-exaggerated\".\nHe said: \"It's not like I am against the vaccines, they're great, but people should be given a free will whether they want to accept it or not.\"\nHe also strongly denied he had planned the confrontation with the police.\nAfter being arrested and taken to custody in St Asaph, Mr Kotlarek claimed he was told he would be released if he gave his name, but refused to do as he believed he had not committed a crime.\n\"They took me to an interrogation room and said if I didn't give my name they would strip-search me,\" he said.\nAllegations that Mr Kotlarek was strip-searched while in custody were put to the force, but it did not respond.\nIt was only when an officer went for scissors to cut his clothes off that Mr Kotlarek claimed he voluntarily undressed and put on a paper suit he had been supplied with.\nHe said the incident followed recent family problems, with his wife's brother seriously ill in Poland, as well as other relatives dying. \nMr Kotlarek was released after about three hours in custody and said he was considering bringing a formal complaint against North Wales Police.\nCh Supt Harrison added: \"The officers behaved in a calm and reasonable way as I would have expected.\n\"As is always the case, if the individual wishes to query or complain about the way they were treated then of course we will review the full circumstances.\""

      "tags": "Nicola Sturgeon,Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 February as schools start a phased reopening.\nThe move will include all pupils in P1-P3 as well as pre-school children.\nThere will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. \nA final decision will be taken on the partial reopening in a fortnight. \nFurther details of the next phase of the gradual return to schools will also be set out at that point, alongside a timescale for the return of in-person learning for colleges and universities.\nScotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, questioned why the first minister had not mentioned any need for P1-P3 pupils to socially distance, and said it wanted to see the scientific evidence to justify the approach. \nThe union added: \"Clearly, any school return remains contingent upon continued progress on community suppression of the virus and that is not a given so we need to see infection levels coming down substantially before the return date can be confirmed.\"\nAll of the country's other lockdown restrictions will remain in place until at least the end of the month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. \nBut she said she was \"cautiously optimistic\" that some gradual easing of the rules could be possible from early March. \nThe first minister also announced that travellers coming to Scotland from any country may be asked to quarantine in a hotel - which goes further than systems announced in the rest of the UK.\nBusiness groups have called on the Scottish government to provide firms with a route map out of lockdown. \nMs Sturgeon said the government intended to allow \"small increases\" in existing provision for children and young people with significant additional support needs from 22 February.\nAnd she said there would be a \"significant expansion\" of testing in schools and nurseries in the coming weeks, with tests available for both staff and senior secondary pupils.\nThe first minister said older pupils will only be able to return after 22 February to ensure practical work important to achieving qualifications is completed.\nOnly between 5% and 8% of a secondary school's pupil roll will be able to be present at any one time.\nMs Sturgeon also stressed that the schools announcement was dependent on the virus continuing to be suppressed.\nSchools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since the Christmas holidays, with learning being done at home and online. \nHealth experts have warned that the country risks facing a \"lost generation\" unless a way can be found to get young people back to some sort of normality. \nInterim Scottish Labour leader Jackie Baillie said that most children will have missed more than half a year of normal, in-person schooling as she called for greater investment to be put in place \"for some time to come\" to help them catch up.\nAnd the Scottish Conservatives accused the government of failing to get the proper digital support in place for home learning, which it said would further widen the attainment gap between wealthier and less well off pupils.\nThe current stay-at-home lockdown, like the last one, is a long slog. It will last what's left of the winter. But as we move into spring, change is coming.\nPlans to re-open nurseries and schools from 22 February for the youngest children will not only restore their full time education but will allow some parents to resume work.\nHowever, the phased return of schools could add to the burden some families have to carry.\nIf, for instance, you have a young child to get to school and an older pupil to organise for online learning at home, that could be harder to manage than either having both at home or both in school.\nIt is not clear how quickly full time schooling will resume for all age groups.\nIt will be another fortnight before the first minister sets out how wider restrictions might be eased from the beginning of March.\nIt is already clear that process will be gradual and that some measures like social distancing, wearing face coverings and avoiding international travel will not be lifted anytime soon.\nMs Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that she wanted to see children back in full-time, face to face education as quickly as possible.\nAnd she said she was acutely aware of the wider health, developmental and social harms being experienced by young people while they were not in school, and of the pressure school closures was putting on working parents and family life. \nBut she said the current state of the pandemic and the need to protect the country as much as possible from the virus meant that her options for reopening schools were limited.\nShe added: \"The judgment the Cabinet arrived at this morning, based on the advice of our expert advisers, is that if we all agree to abide with the lockdown restrictions for a bit longer - so that our progress in suppressing the virus continues - we can begin a phased, albeit gradual, return to school from 22 February.\"\nAll of mainland Scotland and some islands are currently under the country's toughest level four restrictions, with non-essential shops closed and strict travel rules in force. \nAnd there has been growing concern in recent days that Scotland's vaccination programme is lagging behind the rest of the UK.\nThe country had vaccinated the lowest percentage of its adult population - 13.4% - of all of the four UK nations by Tuesday.\nThe figure for England stood at 18.4% while it was 17% in Wales and 15.6% in Northern Ireland.\nThe UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has written to Ms Sturgeon offering the help of the English health department and the Ministry of Defence to accelerate the rollout in Scotland.\nMr Jack said: \"I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of Covid-19 behind us as quickly as possible, we must collaborate as  closely as possible.\"\nA further 34,881 people were given their first does of the vaccine in Scotland since Monday, the highest daily total so far.\nThe country will need to average about 40,000 a day if it is to hit its target of vaccinating everyone over the age of 70 and the extremely clinically vulnerable by the end of next week.\nIt brings the total number of people to have received the vaccine in Scotland, which has about a twelfth of the UK population, to 610,778.\nThe UK as a whole had vaccinated just over 9.6 million people by Tuesday. \nCovid-19 prevalence in Scotland has fallen under the lockdown regulations from 302 per 100,000 in the week ending 8 January to 136 per 100,000 last week.\nTest positivity has also reduced to an average of 6.6% in the seven days up to 29 January - still higher than the 5% that the World Health Organisation considers to be indicative of an outbreak being under control.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"Pressure on our NHS continues to be severe. The number of Covid patients being treated in hospital remains around 30% above the high point of the first wave last April.\n\"However, hospital admissions in this wave appear to have peaked on January 12. They have now stabilised and are starting to reduce, albeit slowly.\"\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "The furlough scheme will be extended until the end of September by the chancellor in the Budget later.\nRishi Sunak said the scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - would help millions through \"the challenging months ahead\".\nSome 600,000 more self-employed people will also be eligible for government help as access to grants is widened. \nBut Labour said the support schemes should have been extended \"months ago\".\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has protected more than 11 million jobs since its inception last March and had been due to close at the end of April.\nIt has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as tens of thousands of businesses remain shut. \nEmployers will be expected to pay 10% towards the hours their staff do not work in July, increasing to 20% in August and September, as the economy reopens. \nGovernment support for self-employed people has also been extended until September.\nA fourth grant under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) scheme will run from February until April, covering up to 80% of three months' trading profits up to \u00a37,500.\nThere will be a fifth grant from May to September.\nPeople whose turnover has fallen by 30% or more will get the 80% grant, but self-employed people whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will get a 30% grant.\nThe government is widening access to grants, meaning some 600,000 more self-employed people will be eligible.\nPeople who filed their tax returns for 2019-20 by midnight on Tuesday are now eligible.\nSpeaking ahead of the Budget, the chancellor said: \"Our Covid support schemes have been a lifeline to millions, protecting jobs and incomes across the UK.\n\"There's now light at the end of the tunnel with a roadmap for reopening, so it's only right that we continue to help business and individuals through the challenging months ahead - and beyond.\" However, he is expected to warn in his Budget that there are tough economic times ahead.\nAre you currently on furlough?  Share your experiences.\nIt is incredible to think that last year's Budget did not even contain the word \"furlough\". Official confirmation of a pandemic came hours after its publication, swiftly rendering most of its numbers obsolete.\nBut so far in this crisis, unemployment has gone up only modestly. Furlough and the separate support scheme for the self-employed have prevented mass unemployment.\nThese extensions now aim to prevent a rapid rise in joblessness at the end of the schemes. The BBC understands that unemployment forecasts will be revised down on Wednesday as the chancellor promises to deploy his \"full fiscal firepower\" to \"protect livelihoods\" - the theme of the Budget red book.\nAt more than \u00a310bn, this intervention is almost worthy of a Budget in and of itself.\nBut the full document will reveal whether the chancellor's borrowing spree is limited to the \"rescue phase\" of this crisis, or if his confidence in a jobs bounce-back means the economy does not need further stimulus and could even sustain some business-focused tax rises.\nAfter the jabs, the jobs are the great hope.\nEconomic think tank the Resolution Foundation's chief executive, Torsten Bell, said the phased tapering-off of the furlough scheme would avoid a \"risky cliff-edge\" for employers, but warned that the \"peak of unemployment is ahead rather than behind us\".\nHowever, Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the changes to support schemes \"could have been made months ago\" - accusing Mr Sunak of focusing on \"getting his moment in the sun rather than protecting jobs and livelihoods\".\nThe SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has said furlough must be in place  \"as long as businesses and devolved governments need it\".\nHe said he was \"concerned companies are going to have to step in and pay greater contributions\".  \nAnd Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said that while the extra months of furlough support offer \"some stability in the rocky months ahead\", the scheme should be extended until 2022.\nBut Chris Wootton, chief financial officer at Sports Direct, said that although the furlough extension was helpful, other assistance was needed for businesses such as his, chiefly through business rates, payment of which has been suspended for almost a year.\nHe told the BBC: \"What we really want is structural reform. This is just kicking the can down the road.\n\"We don't know what the systemic changes to consumer behaviour are going to be. We said even before Covid happened that a number of House of Fraser stores where we're working very closely with landlords, paying zero rent, they are still losing money because the business rates are far from fair.\""

      "text": "\"I felt so shocked, I was scared of what everyone would think of me.\" \nWhen Nicole Peterkin received a message from an old friend on Instagram asking about her account she thought it was a mistake.\nBut the 20-year-old retail worker from Aberdeenshire soon discovered photographs of herself on an account she did not recognise, and it was advertising sex work.\n\"I was just scared for family members finding out about it, people I went to school with, even work colleagues,\" she told BBC Scotland's The Nine programme.\n\"What would they think of me?\" \nMs Peterkin found pictures she posted on her personal Instagram account were being used in a fake social media profile that impersonated her. It advertised a scam website promising explicit images of Ms Peterkin in exchange for money and personal information.\n\"I don't have anything against anyone associated with stuff like that, but I don't want people to think I do that,\" she said.\nInstagram said it does not allow inauthentic activity on its site and blocks \"millions of fake accounts every day\". \nBut the scam Ms Peterkin fell victim to was made simple through the use of social media and free website services, and is affecting more and more young women.\nScammers search social media for public profiles they want to copy, downloading the photos to use later.\nUsing free website services like Wix they create a page that poses as a sex work site such as OnlyFans or AdmireMe, promising explicit images in exchange for money and personal information. These explicit images do not exist.\nScammers use social media platforms such as Instagram to sell the page by impersonating the original account. \nMs Peterkin's account was public at the time of the scam and the fake account was removed, but although she has now made her account private, she wants social media companies to do more to prevent these scams.\n\"I do feel a relief it's gone, but I still get people messaging me to this day, like total strangers. They say, 'I'll send you money if you send me some pictures and videos'\", she said.\n\"It does have a really bad effect on me. They need to look into it and do something about it because there are heaps of people making fake profiles of young girls and using our images.\"\nOnline safety consultant Jess McBeath, who represents the UK Safer Internet Centre in Scotland, said sexual content often drives new technologies online, and new scams.\n\"The person who's had the imagery stolen - if we think about the impact on them, that could be quite profound in terms of how they feel about themselves, how other people view them,\" she said.\n\"As well as the fact that they've got images out there and they have no control over them.\"\nMs McBeath explained that while these women were able to report the fake accounts and have them taken down, proving illegal activity is difficult. \n\"Bringing somebody to justice is probably a more complex matter,\" she said.\nFormer barrister and founder of CyberSafe Scotland, Annabel Turner, said the law does not protect young women like Nicole whose identity was impersonated.\nShe said fraud would be committed if someone paid money or gave information to the fake profiles, but it was not clear what other crimes were involved.\nShe said: \"The people that society should be most concerned to protect, in this case the young women whose identities have been copied and misused, they don't really have any choice apart from trying to get that material removed as quickly as possible.\n\"The scale of it surprises me, not that it's happening.\"\nHeather MacFarlane, who grew up in East Lothian but now works for a technology company in Manchester and promotes brands on social media, said she never expected to be the victim of this type of scam.\nBut in August last year, the 23-year-old started receiving messages from friends which pointed to a fake account using her photos to offer sex work. \n\"People actually did think that I was promoting it and that I made a separate account because maybe I didn't want my family to see it,\" she said.\nThe account impersonating her was removed after she and her friends reported it. \nBut Ms MacFarlane is worried that without more protection, it will happen again.\n\"It's horrible that it happens and it shouldn't happen, but this is the world we live in,\" she said.\nShe said those behind the scam \"saw an opportunity to exploit me and other young women that it's happened to, which is very sad to see\".\nShe added that social media sites like Instagram need to force users to verify their identity before they can make an account on the platform.\nA spokesperson for Facebook, the company which owns Instagram, said: \"We do not allow inauthentic activity on Instagram and we block millions of fake accounts every day. \n\"If someone is being impersonated on our platform, we encourage them to report the account using our in-app tools or online form, so we can take action.\"\nWix have not responded to a request for comment."

      "text": "An enhanced contact tracing effort is under way after the Brazilian variant of Covid-19 was detected in Scotland.\nThree Scottish residents tested positive for the new strain after flying into Aberdeen from Brazil, via Paris and London.\nNational clinical director Professor Jason Leitch said they were oil workers who were returning to their families.\nOther passengers who were on the same British Airways flight from London on 29 January are now being contacted.\nExperts believe this variant (P1) - first detected in northern Brazil in January - could be more contagious.\nHowever Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said there was \"currently no reason to believe\" the variant was circulating in the community in Scotland.\nA total of 20 passengers who were on flight BA1312 have already been contacted, and Ms Freeman said work was under way to get in touch with others.\nProf Leitch told BBC Scotland's The Nine that situation in Aberdeen had been \"well-handled\" by the individuals, their families and employer. \nAsked if he was concerned the north-east was a gateway to new variants via the oil industry, he said: \"It's certainly a part of the country we need to be concerned about\". \nThree other cases have also been detected in England, but they are not linked to the Scottish cases.\nOfficials are still trying to track down one of those who tested positive for the new variant in England.\nJillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said the three Scottish travellers had arrived in Aberdeen in early February, before new rules on hotel quarantine came into force.\nShe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme they had isolated together for 10 days after arrival in accommodation provided by their employer.\nThey tested positive while in isolation, having developed symptoms after arriving there.\nMs Evans said that health protection specialists were now following up \"contacts of their contacts\" in an effort to ensure that any further cases were found quickly.\nAnyone traced will be offered a Covid-19 test.\n\"That's not standard procedure, that's going one stage further,\" she said.\n\"But of course they have been quarantined for 10 days in managed isolation for that period of time, so you would think that they wouldn't have many contacts to follow up.\n\"Nonetheless, that's an added precaution that's been taken by health protection specialists.\"\nProf Leitch, said it was the first time the Brazilian variant had been detected in Scotland, but told BBC Scotland there was \"no evidence\" of community spread.\nHe said the three travellers had tested negative before leaving Brazil.\n\"The measures that were in place at the time of this were really quite rigorous,\" he said.\n\"These individuals self-isolated. They were from a high risk country, so they followed the instructions and there is no suggestion of any blame or concern about their behaviour. I think that's very important.\"\nProf Leitch added that \"enhanced\" contact tracing was necessary in this case because of concerns about the Brazil strain's resistance to immunity.\n\"The reason why we're worried scientifically is we're not absolutely certain that this version is amenable to the natural immunity some people already have and the artificial immunity we are creating with vaccination,\" he said.\n\"Everything we know says it's still very effective, but we just can't be sure yet because it hasn't been around long enough and the trials haven't completed.\"\nBoth the Scottish government and Public Health England said the variant had been designated \"of concern\" as it shared some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa - known as B.1.351.\nOne of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies.\nChief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said it was important to be \"vigilant\" for changes to the virus, with the vaccine programme placing greater pressure on it.\nHe said: \"We must continue to suppress transmission to the lowest possible level - the more virus there is around, the more likely these mutations are to appear.\""

      "text": "A single shot of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca or the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab reduces the chance of needing hospital treatment by more than 80%, an analysis in England shows.\nThe Public Health England data showed the effect kicked in three to four weeks after vaccination.\nIt was based on people aged over 80 who were the first to receive the jab.\nGovernment scientists hailed the result, but stressed that two doses were needed for the best protection.\nIt comes after similar findings were published by Scottish health authorities last week, which they hailed as \"spectacular\".\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street briefing on Monday the latest vaccine results were \"very strong\".\nHe added: \"They may also help to explain why the number of Covid admissions to intensive care units among people over 80 in the UK have dropped to single figures in the last couple of weeks.\"\nAlso speaking at the news conference, England's deputy chief medical officer - Prof Jonathan Van-Tam - said the data offered a glimpse of how the vaccine programme \"is going to hopefully take us into a very different world in the next few months\".\nBut he said it was \"absolutely critical\" that second doses \"are still part of the course of immunisation against Covid-19 and no less important\".\nProf Van-Tam stressed there was a \"significant likelihood\" that a second dose of a vaccine would \"mature your immune response, possibly make it broader and almost certainly make it longer than it would otherwise be in relation to a first dose only.\"\nMore than 20 million people in the UK have had their first dose of a vaccine - over a third of the adult population.\nMeanwhile, another 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus have been reported in the UK, and a further 5,455 new cases, according to the latest figures.\nThe PHE data, which has not been peer reviewed, also suggested the Pfizer vaccine, which started being rolled out a month before the AstraZeneca vaccine, leads to an 83% reduction in deaths from Covid. This was based on people over the age of 80 who had died.\nThe data also showed vaccination cuts the risk of people over 70 developing any Covid symptoms by around 60%, three weeks after an initial dose.\nProf Van-Tam said the decision to give the AstraZeneca vaccine to older people was \"clearly vindicated\".\nSome European nations have refused to give it to the over 65s because data from the trials was mainly on its effect among younger adults.\nProf Van-Tam said the judgement made by the UK authorities was that it was simply \"not plausible\" the vaccine would only work on younger adults.  \nHe said other countries would doubtless be \"very interested\" in the data coming out of the UK. \nDr Mary Ramsay, Public Health England's head of immunisation, said there was growing evidence that the vaccines were working to reduce infections and save lives.\n\"While there remains much more data to follow, this is encouraging and we are increasingly confident that vaccines are making a real difference,\" she said.\nHowever, more evidence is needed to know how well the vaccines protect against the Brazil variant that has recently been identified in the UK.\nThis variant has a mutation - E484 - that could reduce some of the effectiveness of the vaccines.\nIt was announced on Sunday that six new variant cases - three in England and three in Scotland - had been found through testing.\nHealth officials have been able to contact all but one of these people. The whereabouts of the remaining individual is unknown as they did not complete their test registration card. \nIt has prompted an appeal for anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February to come forward immediately by calling 119.\nThe health secretary has denied that delays in imposing quarantine hotel measures on travellers to the UK put lives at risk, as officials continue to seek the individual.\nMr Hancock said there was \"no evidence\" the infected person had not followed home quarantine rules.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK has \"one of the toughest border regimes anywhere in the world for stopping people coming in to this country who may have variants of concern\"."

      "text": "Northern Ireland's plan for easing the coronavirus lockdown is \"cautious and hopeful\", Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said.\nUnlike plans announced in England, NI's blueprint does not include a timetable.\nMs O'Neill said the executive's plan, published on Tuesday, would be an \"underpinning insurance policy\" to help protect the health service.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said the plan was \"not perfect\" but added she wanted to prevent any future lockdowns. \nMrs Foster acknowledged that there is \"a lot of frustration\" among the public who want to know when restrictions will be lifted.\nShe said the executive had faced the similar questions about setting out a timetable when they lifted previous lockdowns last year, but added they had learned a lot about the virus over the past year. \nEarlier on Tuesday, two more coronavirus-related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. \nThe number of people in hospital with Covid-19 has dropped by 13 to 289 - the lowest number since October 2020.\nThirty-four people with Covid-19 are being treated in intensive care.\nA further 149 cases have been diagnosed. \nIn the Republic of Ireland, 359 new cases were confirmed on Tuesday and 14 additional Covid-related deaths were added to the overall death toll, which now stands at 4,333.\nSpeaking in the NI Assembly, Ms O'Neill said: \"We must do everything we can to try to make this one the last lockdown.\"\nMrs Foster said the public needed to work with the executive.\n\"What we've set out today is a pathway. It's not perfect, nobody is pretending it is, but I think it gives the direction of travel in terms of where we hope to get to because people do need to have optimism,\" Mrs Foster said. \n\"That's what I'm focused on, because we certainly cannot go back into a lockdown again.\" \n\"Data, not dates\" was the mantra when Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill first announced they were preparing a plan to help Northern Ireland exit lockdown.\nBut a read of the document leaves questions as to why the data ministers will base their decisions on seems largely absent from the plan.\nAll of this is ultimately aimed at giving the executive maximum flexibility - a pick-and-mix that will allow them to move when they believe the relevant health indicators are in the right place, assessing that with \"economic and community trends\".\nAll executive ministers know the risks - and consequences - of lifting lockdown too soon, given past experience.  \nFor now, both the public and businesses are facing more uncertainty. \nThe challenge is getting people to buy into another plan that has no dates to circle in our calendars, when we are not much clearer as to when we can start looking to a future with more freedoms again.\nThe framework has been broadly welcomed, but the absence of dates has been criticised by many industry bodies.\nColin Neill from Hospitality Ulster said it was \"disappointing to see that parts of hospitality have been earmarked to reopen after non-essential retail\".\nBelfast Chamber Chief Executive Simon Hamilton said not only were there no dates, \"but there is no clarity about where certain health indicators need to be to move us through each of the steps\".\nDr David Bruce, moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said he hoped there could be some return to services in places of worship from Easter.\nOutlining the details of the recovery document, Ms O'Neill said ministers recognised there was still a \"huge risk\" with the virus, given the potential for new variants. \nThe deputy first minister said that time would be used carefully to assess the data before deciding whether the next restrictions could be eased. \n\"Each week, departments will meet as a collective to discuss the available information and to proactively consider which next steps can be proposed to the executive,\" she said.\n\"After each step we take, we will pause and reflect, look at the data and the impacts, engage with key sectors and enable them to reopen only if it is the right thing to do.\"\nHowever, Ms O'Neill added that the executive was committed to getting all children back into classrooms as \"quickly as possible\".\nMrs Foster said: \"I very much hope that on 16 March we can give clarity for the rest of the school years and I would hope that, given the data, everybody can return after Easter. \n\"We will not be able to take that decision until we review what's happening on 16 March.\"\nMinisters are also working on a separate recovery strategy through the executive's Covid-19 taskforce that would \"jumpstart economic and societal recovery\".\n\"We ask everyone to take time to read and digest, to think about the need for caution in our approach, to continue to follow the public health advice, and most certainly to take the vaccine when it is offered,\" said Ms O'Neill. \n\"We have hope for this year, and we will get there together.\"\nStep one of the recovery plan represents the current lockdown restrictions in place, with steps two to four allowing an easing of the rules and the final step entitled preparing for the future.\nThe first easements will allow changes to rules on people meeting others outdoors at their homes, changes to restrictions in places of worship and a partial return to classroom teaching.\nThe executive says the steps do not have to align, and the executive said it is possible \"we may be in different phases across the nine pathways at any given time\".\nThere are nine pathways set out by the executive:\nThe document then sets out the five-step sequencing of the executive plans to gradually lift restrictions on each of those sectors.\nThe factors for easing the lockdown include the infection rate of the virus, known as the R number, the number of people in hospital, vaccine rollout and progress in testing and tracing positive cases.\nRead the full pathway-to-recovery plan here.\nThere will also be a rolling review every four weeks, in line with how the regulations are currently reviewed. The next review is scheduled for 16 March.\nMinisters have said they must ensure any easing is gradual, to avoid moving out of lockdown too quickly and potentially leading to another rise in cases.\nThe plan will also state that keeping the R-number under one and \"as low as possible\" is the best way to suppress the virus.\nNorthern Ireland has been in lockdown since 26 December in a bid to curb cases of Covid-19, with measures already having been extended a number of times.\nWhat questions do you have about the Northern Ireland Executive's lockdown exit plan?\nWe'll answer them live during Thursday's Coronavirus Catch-up and this weekend on the BBC News NI website.\nJoin us at 19:00 GMT on the BBC News NI website, iPlayer and BBC News NI Facebook Page.\nIf you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question on this topic.

      "tags": "Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "Alex Salmond has said he has \"no doubt\" that Nicola Sturgeon has breached the ministerial code.\nThe former first minister was speaking as he made his long-awaited appearance at a Scottish Parliament inquiry. \nMr Salmond gave an account to the committee of meetings he had with Ms Sturgeon that appeared to contradict her version of events. \nBut he said it was not for him to say whether Ms Sturgeon should resign if she was found to have broken the code. \nMs Sturgeon denies breaching the code, and has accused Mr Salmond of creating \"wild\" conspiracy theories that are untrue. \nHer spokesman said Mr Salmond had failed to prove his allegations in his evidence to the committee, and \"also gave testimony which directly undermined some of the central planks of his conspiracy theories\". \nThe inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of harassment allegations against Mr Salmond.\nThe government admitted it had acted unlawfully during its investigation into the initial complaints from two female civil servants after Mr Salmond launched a judicial review case, and had to pay his legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000.\nMr Salmond was arrested two weeks after the government admitted defeat in the civil case, and was later cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault against a total of nine women after a trial at the High Court last year. \nHe has previously accused people close to Ms Sturgeon - his successor as both first minister and SNP leader - of plotting against him, and has named Ms Sturgeon's husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, as being one of them.\nMr Salmond told the committee that he had been given a memory stick in the build up to his criminal trial that contained messages which involved \"pressuring police\", \"collusion of witnesses\" and \"construction of evidence because police were felt to be inadequate in finding it themselves\".\nHe said he would \"dearly love to provide\" more detail about the messages - but was unable to do so because he was \"under an injunction\" that could see him prosecuted for revealing evidence that was given to him as part of the criminal proceedings. \nAsked what the motivation would be for a plot against him, Mr Salmond said some in the Scottish government saw the judicial review case as a \"huge, looming, enormous and difficult problem\".\nHe said the potential impact on Ms Sturgeon and others in the government of a \"disastrous\" defeat in the civil case meant \"it became very important that the criminal case overtook the judicial review\".\nPart of the written evidence submitted by Mr Salmond ahead of the committee meeting was removed on the request of the Crown Office earlier this week after it had already been published in full by the Scottish Parliament.\nThe submissions included claims that Ms Sturgeon misled parliament over when she first learned of the allegations against her former political mentor. \nThis was one of the most extraordinary episodes in Holyrood's short history.\nIn six hours of testimony, Scotland's longest serving first minister set out what he believes was a malicious plot against him by key figures in the SNP and the Scottish government - both of which he used to lead.\nHis voice cracked with emotion as he accused former colleagues of pressurising police and potential witnesses to build a criminal case against him - claims they deny.\nHe was not able to present the social media messages that he believes will prove this case but during his appearance the Scottish Parliament issued an order demanding their release by Scottish prosecutors. \nFor their parts in the botched handling of the original harassment complaints against him, Alex Salmond called for the resignation of Scotland's top civil servant and its top law officer.\nBut he stopped short of demanding his former ally, friend and political partner - Nicola Sturgeon - stand down despite arguing that she had repeatedly broken the rules for ministers.\nHe said her fate should be decided by others after she's given evidence next week and the inquiries into this toxic affair have delivered their verdicts. \nMs Sturgeon initially told parliament she had not learned of the complaints until she was informed by Mr Salmond on 2 April 2018.\nHowever, she later claimed to have \"forgotten\" about an earlier meeting in her Scottish Parliament office on 29 March of that year, when she was told about the allegations by Mr Salmond's former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein.\nMr Salmond told the committee that if Ms Sturgeon had truly forgotten about the meeting, she should have corrected the record when she did remember.\nBut he said Ms Sturgeon had only admitted that the meeting had taken place after details of it were revealed 18 months later by Sky News. \nHe also said there was \"no doubt\" that the meeting with Mr Aberdein and subsequent meetings between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon in her home were about government matters rather than SNP business, as she has claimed.\nThis could potentially be another breach of the code, which says all government business and meetings should be recorded - but none of them were.\nMr Salmond also alleged that the name of one of the women who had made complaints about him was made known to Mr Aberdein ahead of his meeting with Ms Sturgeon.\nMs Sturgeon told parliament on Thursday that \"to the very best of my knowledge I do not think that happened.\"\nThe first minister has also been accused of potentially breaching the code by allowing the government to continue opposing a civil court case brought by Mr Salmond over its handling of the initial complaints against him from two female civil servants. \nMr Salmond has alleged that the government was given legal advice that it was unlikely to win the case on 31 October 2018 - but did not concede defeat until January of the following year. \nMr Salmond said: \"I have no doubt Nicola has broken the ministerial code, but it's not for me to decide what the consequences should be.\"\nA separate inquiry headed by Irish lawyer James Hamilton is specifically looking at whether Ms Sturgeon breached the code, which states that any minister who deliberately misleads parliament would be expected to resign.\nMr Salmond said he was due to be interviewed by Mr Hamilton next week.\nThe last six hours have been detailed. Alex Salmond's complaints are numerous. But stand back from it for a second.\nThe former First Minister of Scotland has just accused his successor of breaking the ministerial code - and left open the door for her having to resign as a result.\nHe has said Scotland's most senior civil servant should quit - and that its most senior lawyer should consider his position.\nNicola Sturgeon's allies will argue he has not provided evidence for his claims of a plot against him.\nBut Ms Sturgeon will face huge questions when she appears before MSPs next week - some of the most difficult she has faced in her career. \nThe marathon evidence session - which lasted six hours - also saw Mr Salmond claim that the leadership of the Scottish government, civil service and Crown Office prosecution service had all \"failed\".\nHe said no one had taken responsibility for the \"nightmare\" he had been put through, and said the country's top civil servant, Leslie Evans should quit, and that the head of the Crown Office, Lord Advocate James Wolffe, should consider his position. \nHe also alleged that there had been a \"deliberate suppression of information inconvenient to the government\" throughout the saga.\nAnd he called for a police investigation into how details of the complaints against him were leaked to the Daily Record newspaper, and said he believed the leak came from within the government and was politically motivated. \nAn Information Commissioner's Office investigation into the leak found no \"hard evidence\" that it came from the government - but said it had \"some sympathy\" to the view that it had. \nMr Salmond went on to say he did not believe the House of Commons would accept a call from the Crown Prosecution Service in England to change a committee document, as the Scottish Parliament had done in response to the Crown Office request. \nHe said he had \"no incentive or advantage in revisiting the hurt and shock of the last three years\".\nBut he added: \"We can't turn the page or move on until the decision-making which is undermining the system of government in Scotland is addressed.\"\nHe said the country's \"move to independence\" - which he has campaigned for throughout his political life - \"must be accompanied by institutions whose leadership is strong and robust and capable of protecting each and every citizen from arbitrary authority\".\nMs Sturgeon has denied there was any conspiracy against Mr Salmond, and has said she is \"relishing\" the prospect of giving evidence to the committee next week.\nAnswering questions from journalists at her daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, she said: \"I don't think there is a shred of evidence behind those allegations and the claims that have been made\".\nShe claimed that Mr Salmond had created an \"alternative reality in which the organs of the state - not just me, the SNP and the civil service and the Crown Office and the police and women who came forward - were all part of some wild conspiracy against him for reasons I can't explain\".\nAnd she added: \"Maybe that's easier than just accepting that at the root of all this might just have been issues in his own behaviour.\"\nA spokeswoman for the government said Ms Evans continued to have the support of the first minister and would not be resigning as the head of the civil service in Scotland.\nThe spokeswoman also said the government had a \"duty to investigate the serious and specific complaints against Alex Salmond and was right to do so\".  \nShe added: \"As set out in detailed evidence to the committee, all government decisions were informed by legal advice and taken in line with the Civil Service Code.\"\nA spokesman for the Crown Office said: \"Scotland's prosecutors have acted independently and in the public interest at all times when considering matters related to this case.\"\nThe Lord Advocate will give evidence to the committee on Monday, before Ms Sturgeon - who will be the final witness - appears on Wednesday.

      "text": "The French government says older people with pre-existing conditions can now get AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, revising its stance on the issue.\n\"People affected by co-morbidities can be vaccinated with AstraZeneca, including those aged between 65 and 74,\" the health minister said.\nLast month France approved use of the vaccine for under-65s only, citing lack of data for older people.\nSince then studies have shown the jab is highly effective among the elderly.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is widely used across the UK, but several EU countries are still limiting it to the under-65s, including Germany. \nThe EU drugs regulator has approved it for all adults, but it is up to each member to set its own roll-out policy.\nIn a further development, Canada's immunisation commission on Monday advised against giving the AstraZeneca vaccine to over-65s, saying clinical trial data for that age group was too limited. \nSpeaking on television, French Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said people with pre-existing conditions - such as high blood pressure or diabetes - could get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from GP surgeries, hospitals and \"within days\" from pharmacies.\nThe policy would apply to those over 50, including those aged 65 to 75, he said.  \nThose aged over 75 will still be offered either Pfizer or Moderna jabs in a vaccination centre, he added.\nIn January French President Emmanuel Macron said the AstraZeneca vaccine was \"quasi-ineffective\" for older age groups - a claim strongly rejected at the time by the UK officials and scientists.\nBut after a European Council meeting on Friday, he said: \"If this is the vaccine I'm offered, obviously I would take it.\" \nAs more data has emerged, French health officials have tried to convince people that it is just as safe and effective as other Covid-19 vaccines. \nJust 273,000 AstraZeneca doses have been administered in France out of 1.7 million received by the end of February, health ministry figures show.\nSome French doctors had spurned the vaccine, citing initial side-effects in some people and trial data suggesting it offered minimal protection against mild disease from the South African Covid variant, though the developer said it still protects against severe disease.  \nThe MG France doctors' association has since hit back at criticism of the AstraZeneca jab and the fact that many doses remain unused. The man in charge of France's vaccine rollout has also backed it, saying it has unfairly received a \"bad press\". \nAbout three million people have so far received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in France - against more than 20 million in the UK, which has roughly the same population.\nIt is hard not to believe that there was some element of post-Brexit ill will motivating the initial French scepticism towards the AstraZeneca jab.\nBut it was noticeable how the remarks made by Mr Macron and Europe Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune that casted doubt on the vaccine's effectiveness never found a receptive audience in the French medical profession.\nThat profession - which had no political axe to grind - said early on that the jab was a welcome addition to the mix. But the politicians set the tone. They must surely take some of the blame for the slow uptake of the vaccine since its launch in France last month.\nAstraZeneca has come to be seen by too many people here as an inferior vaccination. The French government, however, now seems bent on changing that perception and accelerating take-up.\nFrance is still struggling to control increased infection rates in some areas, despite a continuing national night-time curfew. \nBars, restaurants and museums remain closed but the government wants to avoid another national lockdown, resorting instead to tighter measures in some localities such as the southern city of Nice.\nTravel to Germany from the French Moselle region has been restricted at the request of Germany which is concerned about the South African variant. Cross-border public transport is suspended, while drivers can cross but only with proof of a negative coronavirus test. \nGermany is also concerned that AstraZeneca jabs are going to waste and there are calls to widen the number of priority groups who can receive it. Only 240,000 of 1.45 million doses had been used by 23 February. \nOn Sunday, a senior German immunologist, Carsten Watzl, urged his country to change its mind and start allowing over-65s to receive the vaccine.\nGermany's vaccine commission is currently reviewing its recommendation and Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week that it was \"a vaccine that can be trusted\". \nVaccine roll-outs in many EU countries have been hit by delays. \nBritain has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme since December.\nUK health officials say it provides \"high levels of protection\" for all ages. \nNo one who received the Oxford vaccine in trials was admitted to hospital or became seriously ill due to Covid.\nThe vaccine is given via two injections to the arm, the second between 4 and 12 weeks after the first."

      "text": "Scientists say they have found that three deepwater shark species living off New Zealand glow in the dark.\nThe species were collected from the Chatham Rise - an area of ocean floor to the east of New Zealand - in January of last year, according to the study.\nOne of them, the kitefin shark, is now the largest known luminous vertebrate and can reach up to 180cm (5ft 11in).\nBioluminescence was also confirmed in the blackbelly lanternshark and southern lanternshark.\nThe three species were already known to marine biologists but this is the first time that the phenomenon of bioluminescence - organisms emitting light - has been identified in them.\nWhile many marine animals - as well as some insects such as fireflies - produce their own light, this is the first time it has been found in larger sharks.\nThe researchers suggest the sharks' glowing underbellies may help them hide from predators or other threats beneath them.\nThey say the bioluminescence is achieved through thousands of photophores (light-producing cells) located within the sharks' skin.\nThe three studied species inhabit a space called the mesopelagic zone, often called the twilight zone, which ranges from 200m  to 1,000m depth (the maximum depth reached by sunlight).\nThe species in question face an environment with no place to hide, hence the need for counterillumination as a form of camouflage,  the researchers add.\nIn the study, the scientists from the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain in Belgium and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand explain the importance of bioluminescence for marine creatures: \nIt \"has often been seen as a spectacular yet uncommon event at sea, but considering the vastness of the deep sea and the occurrence of luminous organisms in this zone, it is now more and more obvious that producing light at depth must play an important role structuring the biggest ecosystem on our planet\"."

      "tags": "Gaming,LGBT,Transgender people",
      "text": "Streaming platform Twitch has backtracked on a new policy to change its spelling of \"women\" after criticism from transgender communities.\nThe company had said it would use the term \"womxn\" in order to be more gender neutral in its language.\nBut LGBT communities online called the change transphobic because it suggested trans women were not women.\n\"We're committed to growing from these experiences... and ensuring we're inclusive to all,\" the company tweeted.\n\"Womxn\" has become a popular alternative word for people who say that the term \"women\" has patriarchal roots. Some believe the term is inclusive of trans women and some non-binary people, but that is contested.\nIt echoes the use of the word \"Latinx\" in some Spanish-speaking communities in an attempt to move away from the traditional use of genders in the language.\nTwitch, a platform that is especially popular with gamers, announced its decision to swap \"women\" for \"womxn\" as part of its celebration of Women's History Month.\n\"Join us in celebrating and supporting all the Womxn creating their own worlds, building their communities, and leading the way on Twitch,\" it said in a now-deleted tweet.\nBut the company faced a fierce backlash online as some suggested the company was making an explicit distinction between women and trans women.\n\"With womxn you're just separating them more, you're not being inclusive, you're excluding them from women,\" wrote one Twitter user.\n\"This is in fact transphobic and really outdated,\" another wrote.\nOn Tuesday Twitch apologised, writing \"we want to assure you that we have, and will continue to, work with the LGBTQIA+ community. We're still learning.\"\n\"Our good intentions don't always equate to positive impact, but we're committed to growing from these experiences, doing better, and ensuring we're inclusive to all,\" the company said.\nWhilst Twitch was attempting to be more inclusive with this initiative, the language alienated LGBT people and caused a wave of criticism.\nMany social media users are still confused about who exactly Twitch's \"all the womxn\" approach was actually aimed at. Trans women call themselves women, and many have fought to do so. Non-binary individuals do not refer to themselves as women at all.\nTwitch employees have since flagged that there was an internal backlash about the decision to use the term \"womxn\" weeks before it was revealed on social media. One worker claimed that \"everyone\" said it was a bad idea, and people called it \"offensive\", but bosses still went ahead with the public release. \nOthers have branded this a \"marketing stunt\", suggesting that the hype and attention caused by the term is exactly what those behind the initiative wanted.\nIn 2018 the London museum Wellcome Collection faced backlash online after it used the term in an advert for an event about women's writing. Critics, including numerous high-profile female journalists, said the term was \"insulting and demeaning\" to women."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's plan for easing the coronavirus lockdown is \"cautious and hopeful\", Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said.\nUnlike plans announced in England, NI's blueprint does not include a timetable.\nMs O'Neill said the executive's plan, published on Tuesday, would be an \"underpinning insurance policy\" to help protect the health service.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said the plan was \"not perfect\" but added she wanted to prevent any future lockdowns. \nMrs Foster acknowledged that there is \"a lot of frustration\" among the public who want to know when restrictions will be lifted.\nShe said the executive had faced the similar questions about setting out a timetable when they lifted previous lockdowns last year, but added they had learned a lot about the virus over the past year. \nEarlier on Tuesday, two more coronavirus-related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. \nThe number of people in hospital with Covid-19 has dropped by 13 to 289 - the lowest number since October 2020.\nThirty-four people with Covid-19 are being treated in intensive care.\nA further 149 cases have been diagnosed. \nIn the Republic of Ireland, 359 new cases were confirmed on Tuesday and 14 additional Covid-related deaths were added to the overall death toll, which now stands at 4,333.\nSpeaking in the NI Assembly, Ms O'Neill said: \"We must do everything we can to try to make this one the last lockdown.\"\nMrs Foster said the public needed to work with the executive.\n\"What we've set out today is a pathway. It's not perfect, nobody is pretending it is, but I think it gives the direction of travel in terms of where we hope to get to because people do need to have optimism,\" Mrs Foster said. \n\"That's what I'm focused on, because we certainly cannot go back into a lockdown again.\" \n\"Data, not dates\" was the mantra when Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill first announced they were preparing a plan to help Northern Ireland exit lockdown.\nBut a read of the document leaves questions as to why the data ministers will base their decisions on seems largely absent from the plan.\nAll of this is ultimately aimed at giving the executive maximum flexibility - a pick-and-mix that will allow them to move when they believe the relevant health indicators are in the right place, assessing that with \"economic and community trends\".\nAll executive ministers know the risks - and consequences - of lifting lockdown too soon, given past experience.  \nFor now, both the public and businesses are facing more uncertainty. \nThe challenge is getting people to buy into another plan that has no dates to circle in our calendars, when we are not much clearer as to when we can start looking to a future with more freedoms again.\nThe framework has been broadly welcomed, but the absence of dates has been criticised by many industry bodies.\nColin Neill from Hospitality Ulster said it was \"disappointing to see that parts of hospitality have been earmarked to reopen after non-essential retail\".\nBelfast Chamber Chief Executive Simon Hamilton said not only were there no dates, \"but there is no clarity about where certain health indicators need to be to move us through each of the steps\".\nDr David Bruce, moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said he hoped there could be some return to services in places of worship from Easter.\nOutlining the details of the recovery document, Ms O'Neill said ministers recognised there was still a \"huge risk\" with the virus, given the potential for new variants. \nThe deputy first minister said that time would be used carefully to assess the data before deciding whether the next restrictions could be eased. \n\"Each week, departments will meet as a collective to discuss the available information and to proactively consider which next steps can be proposed to the executive,\" she said.\n\"After each step we take, we will pause and reflect, look at the data and the impacts, engage with key sectors and enable them to reopen only if it is the right thing to do.\"\nHowever, Ms O'Neill added that the executive was committed to getting all children back into classrooms as \"quickly as possible\".\nMrs Foster said: \"I very much hope that on 16 March we can give clarity for the rest of the school years and I would hope that, given the data, everybody can return after Easter. \n\"We will not be able to take that decision until we review what's happening on 16 March.\"\nMinisters are also working on a separate recovery strategy through the executive's Covid-19 taskforce that would \"jumpstart economic and societal recovery\".\n\"We ask everyone to take time to read and digest, to think about the need for caution in our approach, to continue to follow the public health advice, and most certainly to take the vaccine when it is offered,\" said Ms O'Neill. \n\"We have hope for this year, and we will get there together.\"\nStep one of the recovery plan represents the current lockdown restrictions in place, with steps two to four allowing an easing of the rules and the final step entitled preparing for the future.\nThe first easements will allow changes to rules on people meeting others outdoors at their homes, changes to restrictions in places of worship and a partial return to classroom teaching.\nThe executive says the steps do not have to align, and the executive said it is possible \"we may be in different phases across the nine pathways at any given time\".\nThere are nine pathways set out by the executive:\nThe document then sets out the five-step sequencing of the executive plans to gradually lift restrictions on each of those sectors.\nThe factors for easing the lockdown include the infection rate of the virus, known as the R number, the number of people in hospital, vaccine rollout and progress in testing and tracing positive cases.\nRead the full pathway-to-recovery plan here.\nThere will also be a rolling review every four weeks, in line with how the regulations are currently reviewed. The next review is scheduled for 16 March.\nMinisters have said they must ensure any easing is gradual, to avoid moving out of lockdown too quickly and potentially leading to another rise in cases.\nThe plan will also state that keeping the R-number under one and \"as low as possible\" is the best way to suppress the virus.\nNorthern Ireland has been in lockdown since 26 December in a bid to curb cases of Covid-19, with measures already having been extended a number of times.\nWhat questions do you have about the Northern Ireland Executive's lockdown exit plan?\nWe'll answer them live during Thursday's Coronavirus Catch-up and this weekend on the BBC News NI website.\nJoin us at 19:00 GMT on the BBC News NI website, iPlayer and BBC News NI Facebook Page.\nIf you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question on this topic.

      "text": "Nearly a year after Sir Keir Starmer became Labour leader, he is being accused of not listening to grassroots activists and not being strident enough in opposition.\nThe focus of the discontent is his reluctance to call for an increase in corporation tax amidst the coronavirus pandemic.\nThose on the party's left are now publicly critical, but some current shadow ministers are privately worrying whether the party's positioning on the issue is right.\nIan Lavery and Jon Trickett were shadow ministers under Jeremy Corbyn. They share Sir Keir's call for any council tax increases to be scrapped.\nBut in a document to be published on Tuesday morning, they argue that corporation tax hits the profits of big businesses, rather than hard-pressed families.\nAnd in a pre-Budget speech on Monday, another former shadow cabinet member, Richard Burgon, declared that unless Labour is bolder, it could be outflanked on business taxes by the Conservatives.\nNow one thing that unites all three former shadow ministers was their dismissal from the frontbench when Sir Keir assumed the leadership.\nThe left of the party have been increasingly critical of Sir Keir - especially over the suspension of former leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nBut they are now becoming more vocal on policy and positioning rather than personalities.\nThere are now concerns that as the country emerges from the pandemic, some of the radical policies on which Sir Keir was elected by his membership - including increasing taxes on the better off - will be diluted.\nSome of those who know the Labour leader well suggest that these concerns are misplaced.\nThe shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has signalled that Labour is open to increasing taxes on business in future. \nMore immediately, the relatively new Labour leadership want to prove their pro-business credentials and to give a clear, unmuddied message that securing the recovery is the party's priority.\nMr Lavery and Mr Trickett say they have consulted more than 1,000 activists and are giving the grassroots a voice. \nSupport for wealth taxes runs strong amongst Labour supporters, they say, and the leadership needs to hear those views rather than make policy behind closed doors.\nBut supporters of Sir Keir are sceptical that a sample of opinion selected by his critics is representative of the views of the wider membership.\nOn Tuesday, Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted that Labour MPs had supported Sir Keir's stance at a meeting of the parliamentary party.\nAt Wednesday's budget, Sir Keir will set out his dividing lines with Rishi Sunak, when he responds to the chancellor in the House of Commons.\nBut he will know his own party is not completely united behind his approach."

      "text": "Michael Gudinski, an Australian music industry icon who helped shape its sound for decades, has died aged 68.\nThe Mushroom Records owner and veteran tour promoter died in his sleep at his home in Melbourne on Monday night, his label said.\nGudinski was best known for championing local talent, helping to create stars such as Kylie Minogue and Jimmy Barnes.\nIn a tribute, Minogue called Gudinski a \"titan of the music industry\" and said her \"heart is broken\".\n\"One of a kind and forever family to me\", she wrote on Twitter.  \"Irreplaceable and unforgettable, I'll always love you 'The Big G'\".\nAustralian rock star Barnes, who Gudinski helped to become one the country's best-selling artists, said the \"heart of Australian music\" had been \"ripped out\" by his passing.\n\"Michael Gudinski was not only that heart but he was my friend\" he said.\nAs well as helping to export home-grown stars, Gudinski also brought some of the world's biggest acts to Australia with his pioneering touring company.\nFrontier Touring led the way in luring international names to Australia in the 1980s and 1990s, including Frank Sinatra and The Rolling Stones. \nIn more recent times, it has brought out Bruce Springsteen and Ed Sheeran. Both paid tribute to the executive on Tuesday.\n\"I've toured the world for the last 50 years and never met a better promoter,\" wrote Springsteen in a detailed tribute.\n\"He will be remembered by artists, including this one, from all over the world every time they step foot on Australian soil.\"\nSheeran posted a picture of the pair, saying: \"I'll miss you mate.\"\nAmerican rock band Foo Fighters, who Gudinski helped to tour Australia, thanked him for \"giving us and countless others the best night of our lives. Over and over again\".\n\"We will miss you dearly. Rock & Roll will miss you deeply\" they said.\nWhile Gudinski worked to globalise the Australian music scene, he was also heavily focused on local music.\nWith his record label in the 1970s and 1980s, he signed up Australian acts such as Skyhooks, The Choirboys and Paul Kelly as well as New Zealand band Split Enz. \nThe acts went on to define the sound of Australian pub rock. \nIn 1987, he signed a young singer who would become Australia's biggest international pop star - Kylie Minogue.\nLast month, she praised Gudinski for organising a concert to benefit small towns hit by both bushfires and the pandemic.\n\"His passion for the music scene, for performers, crews and audiences knows no bounds,\" she wrote in the post on Instagram.\nHis death has sparked an outpouring of tributes from many others.\nActor Russell Crowe called his friend \"a towering figure on the Australian cultural landscape\".\n\"He found and celebrated the music that became the soundtrack of our lives - and he loved it and danced it just as we did,\" wrote broadcaster Virginia Trioli.\nEntertainment reporter Richard Wilkins said: \"The biggest tree in the forest has fallen. What a devastating loss.\"\nVictoria Premier Dan Andrews said \"few people... if any\" had helped shape the Australian music industry more than Gudinski.\n\"His was the beating heart of the Victorian scene, and his irrepressible spark entertained our state for 50 years\", he tweeted.   \nOthers also noted Gudinski's efforts in the past year to keep the industry afloat during the pandemic.\nWith concerts banned and music venues closed, Gudinski switched tack to create live music TV shows The Sound and State of Play - keeping bands in front of audiences.\nGudinski was awarded a string of industry accolades during his career, including the inaugural Industry Icon gong from the Australian Record Industry Association in 2013. \nHe was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2006, and was also inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Music Victoria Awards of 2013."

      "tags": "Welsh government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Welsh ministers have confirmed plans to spend an extra \u00a31.1bn in the next financial year.\nThe final budget for 2021-22 includes an extra \u00a3224m for housing, schools and other infrastructure, and \u00a3630m for the NHS and councils.\nMeanwhile \u00a3200m will be set aside to support businesses.\nWelsh Conservatives say business rate relief should continue, but ministers want to see what the chancellor will announce for England first.\nThe Welsh Government said it is waiting to hear what Rishi Sunak says about business rates in his UK government budget speech on Wednesday, and what that means for Wales.\nIt comes as the cash Welsh ministers expect to receive for Covid-19 spending from the UK government is expected to be less than a sixth of the \u00a35bn it has had for 2020-21.\nPlaid Cymru said \u00a3200m was a \"drop in the ocean\" for businesses.\nThe Welsh Government has finalised its spending plans for 2021-22, which they began to spell out in draft form last December and is worth more than \u00a317bn.\nIn the first financial year of the pandemic, Wales was given an extra \u00a35bn to spend on Covid by the UK government.\nUnder current plans, this is expected to fall to \u00a3766m. Ministers only announced plans for how they would spend 10% of that in December.\nSince then, another \u00a3650m has been announced by the Treasury for the Welsh Government as a result of additional Covid spending in England.\nThe final budget confirms some of the extra items that the Welsh Government is spending money on, with the pots of money it had left over from last year.\nMoney for the pandemic is additional to the \u00a317bn the Welsh Government spends on other policies. It has control in Wales of the NHS, education, environmental spending and transport.\nThe Welsh Government says it is setting aside \u00a3200m extra for businesses in its reserves.\nIt is not decided how that will be spent, and it is not yet clear if an existing business rate relief scheme will continue into the next financial year.\nAll retail, leisure and hospitality businesses with a rateable value of \u00a3500,000 or below are receiving 100% non-domestic rates relief until the end of March.\nA similar scheme is operational in England and reports suggest it will continue - Welsh ministers say they are waiting to see how much extra money there is from the Treasury on Wednesday.\nRebecca Evans told BBC Wales the scheme has cost around \u00a3360m in the current financial year.\n\"We would love the chancellor to say that he is intending to continue with the rate relief system,\" she said.\nBut she said the \"sheer\" amount of funding to continue to offer it in Wales means it would need extra money from the UK government.\nMost firms closed by lockdown are still awaiting a date on when they can reopen.\nMark Newbold, who owns two pubs near Bridgend, called for more clarity on support for the hospitality sector.\n\"I know they've put away \u00a3200m but that's not enough to support the whole industry,\" he said. \"There are so many businesses that have lost so much money especially last year with the great summer we had.\"\nThe Welsh Government says it is allocating another \u00a3224.5m on capital funding - cash spent on infrastructure.\nThat includes \u00a3147m on housing programmes and \u00a330m for new schools.\nAn extra \u00a38m will be given to councils and Natural Resources Wales to repair damage caused by flooding in December and January, and on wider flooding protection work.\nAnother \u00a320m will be earmarked for walking and cycling routes, which the Welsh Government said would increase total investment in active travel for the year to \u00a375m.\nAt a press conference on Monday, First Minister Mark Drakeford announced \u00a3682m in new spending, with some of the money being used to support the vaccination programme.\nA total of \u00a3630m will go on the NHS and councils, including \u00a3206m for a local government hardship fund to support social care and ensure schools can adapt.\nNHS services will get \u00a3380m, and contact tracing will receive \u00a350m.\nAnother \u00a310.5m will go to supporting vulnerable people, while \u00a318.6m will be spent on public transport.\nWelsh Conservative finance spokesman Mark Isherwood said: \"The pandemic has devastated the Welsh economy and people and businesses are crying out for more support from Labour ministers so we can support families and save Welsh jobs, but those cries have been sadly ignored.\n\"After over two decades in power and numerous budgets, successive Labour Governments in Cardiff Bay have failed to deliver for hardworking people, and sadly there's little reason to believe that this budget will be any different - it will only take us back to the same old normal under Labour.\"\nPlaid Cymru economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said there were \"large gaps\" in the budget.\n\"By refusing to extend the eligibility criteria for free school meals and to freeze council tax, Labour is failing to protect the most vulnerable from the impact of the pandemic.\"\nShe added: \"\u00a3200m is but a drop in the ocean for businesses who are, like the hospitality sector, on their knees and kept awake at night fearing closure and redundancies.\"\nMost of the cash the Welsh Government spends comes directly from the Treasury in London, but about 17% is raised through devolved taxes.\nThey include part of income tax, land transaction tax - the Welsh version of stamp duty - and landfill tax.\nAmong the announcements in December was a tax hike on second homes, to raise \u00a313m for social housing.\nAlthough this is called the final budget for the coming financial year, the reality is that it's likely to see many more amendments in the months to come.\nThe pandemic remains unpredictable, as does the state of the economy, so some of the most recent spending commitments are for a six-month period.\nThe chancellor's budget on Wednesday will change things too. If the reports of an extension to the business rate holiday in England are correct, Welsh Government may well follow suit here - new spending decisions for England mean more money on the way to Wales.\nAnd there's a Senedd election looming in May, so there may be a few late Easter bunnies being pulled out of hats.\nWhat's more, a change of government - or a new coalition agreement - would mean changed spending priorities."

We have got first aid capabilities. After an explosion people are in distress and it's our job to go.\n\"I thought we were going there (Philips Park) because they had a plan. There was no plan.\"\nCounsel to the inquiry, Paul Greaney QC, read a statement from a firefighter who recalled a paramedic who was \"pleading with us to go and help\". \nIn tears, the paramedic asked firefighters why they were \"stood around\" at the station instead of helping casualties at the arena.\nMr Topping, who was a group manager for GMFRS, said he was shocked when he found \"a lot of firefighters hanging around\" at Philips Park fire station.\n\"They were impatient, they wanted to go,\" he told the hearing. \nAfter the attack, Mr Topping said he attended a de-briefing where some firefighters turned their backs on a senior officer who had been unable to explain why they had been held back.\nHe said some firefighters were brought to tears because they felt \"such shame and disappointment\".\n\"I had never seen firefighters cry at a debrief,\" he said.\n\"We didn't respond and we didn't do our jobs to make a difference. It took me a couple of days to put my shirt back on such was the strength of my feelings.\n\"I felt ashamed to be a firefighter. I felt we had let the people of Greater Manchester down.\"\nThe inquiry has heard previously that police declared a marauding terrorist firearms attack amid erroneous reports of gunfire but failed to inform the fire and ambulance services.\nAnd none of the three blue light services met at a rendezvous point to discuss a planned response.\nMr Topping said senior incident commanders were not working properly together and were \"too secretive\".\nWhen he arrived at the scene, he wrote in his feedback he felt like he was \"gate-crashing\".\nMr Topping, who worked for GMFRS for 32 years, said he did not believe that things within the service had improved sufficiently when he retired in September.\nHe agreed with John Cooper QC, representing the bereaved families, that the scene at the fire station a mile from the arena \"felt wrong\" because important resources and services his colleagues could have provided were \"simply wasted\".\nHe said there was \"a lot of anger, upset, confusion\" among the crews who were impatient at being kept away from the scene.\nThe inquiry continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "tags": "Cruise ships,Shipping industry,India",
      "text": "Two UK cruise ships have been scrapped on an Indian beach despite assurances they would continue to be operated.\nShips at the end of their lives are considered hazardous waste and it is illegal to send them to developing countries from the UK. \nBut months after being sold at auction to buyers outside the UK they were then sold on as scrap for double the price. \nAs they were set to be used for further trading when they left UK waters, their arrival in India does not break UK law. \nAn investigation by the BBC's File on 4 programme found at least 13 other ships, mostly cargo ships, linked to the UK had arrived at the scrapping beaches of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh since the start of 2020. \nThe Marco Polo and the Magellan were sold at auction in November after their owners Cruise and Maritime Voyages went into administration. \nThe Marco Polo was built in the 1960s and was one of the world's last surviving ocean cruise liners. It was scheduled to take UK passengers to the Amazon and Norway this year, but its final voyage was to Alang in India. \nThe ship-breaking yards of Alang dominate a stretch of muddy beach just up the coast from Mumbai in north-west India, referred to as the world's largest ship graveyard. \nThe ship was bought at auction for around \u00a32m by offshore company Highseas Ltd. After the sale, it was released from UK waters on the condition it would be used for \"further trading\". \nHighSeas Ltd said the cruise ship would be used as a floating hotel in Dubai. \nBut two months after taking ownership of the Marco Polo, it was sold as scrap for around \u00a34m.\nHighSeas Ltd director Rishi Arggawal said it was always their intention the Marco Polo would be sold to new owners \"but regrettably, the intended buyers in Dubai refused to take delivery\". \nMr Arggawal said they tried to find new work for the Marco Polo as a cruise ship or a hotel without success, before selling to \"Indian interests\". \nIt is a similar story for the Magellan, which was meant to be used as a floating hotel in Liverpool for the 2021 Grand National. \nIt was bought at the auction by a Greek ship owner. Brokers say it was sold on for scrap after no new buyer was found. \nThe cruise ship industry do send old ships to be scrapped safely at EU-approved yards, but when sold at auction, which often happens when a company goes into administration, this decision is taken out of the previous owner's hands. \nThere are serious concerns about the environmental impact and working conditions in the ship-breaking industry across south Asia. \nEach year around 800 ships come to the end of their lives and need to be broken apart and recycled. \nAlthough this work can be carried out in the UK and other EU-approved ship-breaking yards, around 70% of the world's ships end up on the beaches of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh as these yards offer much higher prices for scrap steel. \nThe organisation Ship-breaking Platform has documented the deaths of more than 400 workers on these beaches since 2009. \nIt has recorded fatal accidents in the yards from workers falling from height and being killed in gas explosions, as well as longer-term sickness from exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos. \nShip-breaking Platform's director, Ingvild Jenssen, said despite laws in place making it illegal for developed countries like the UK to send hazardous waste such as old ships to developing countries, they continue to arrive\n\"There is a lot of value in these vessels because they contain large amounts of steel,\" she said. \"But they also contain large amounts of hazardous materials: asbestos; heavy metals; lead, and many materials you need to take large precautions when you're dealing with them.\" \nShip recycling consultant Merijn Hougee from Sea2Cradle says asbestos is not treated as a hazardous material in India. \n\"If you have a vessel built in the 60s, it is likely there are larger amounts of asbestos on board. There's a ban on asbestos in Europe, but in India, it's freely being traded and sold and used as second-hand building materials.\" \nA ship-breaking worker in India who spoke to the BBC said they \"pump waste, like oil and petrol, into the sea when clearing out a ship, or we use it to burn other materials on the shore\". \nHe said he has been badly burned on two occasions and did not receive sick pay while recovering. \nOnce he had to be driven an hour away to hospital as the one near the yards did not have the facilities to deal with serious injuries.\nUK shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard believes tighter, global regulation is needed to ensure that British-owned ships end up being recycled by approved ship-breaking yards. \n\"I don't think the public want to see ships that were owned by British companies polluting beaches all around the world. I think they want to see them properly disposed of, properly recycled.\" \nThe UK government said: \"The illegal export of waste is a significant threat to the global environment, and those convicted could face two years in prison or an unlimited fine.\"\nShipping's Dirty Secret is on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 GMT and later on BBC Sounds\nAdditional reporting by Chris Foote and Jim Booth"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Regular testing of secondary pupils will be a \"game-changer\" in giving confidence that schools are safe, a government science adviser has said.\nProf Calum Semple told the BBC better ventilation and face masks would also contribute to a safe reopening in England from 8 March.\nRates of infection in schools had been \"quite low\", he said.\nBut a school leaders' union warned the testing demands may mean a staggered return for many.\nSecondary pupils in England will be asked to take a rapid lateral flow test twice a week to help identify anyone who might be infectious.\nPupils are required to be given three initial tests at school or college before moving to home testing. There is no testing planned for primary school pupils.\nProf Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told BBC Breakfast: \"The good news is we're finding quite low rates of active infection within the schools.\"\nHe said 1.2% of secondary students and 1.6% of teachers had tested positive, quoting a survey published on Monday by the Office for National Statistics. The ONS tested about 12,000 pupils and teachers in early December.\nIn some areas, only 0.4% of the tests came back positive, Prof Semple said. \nThe introduction of regular testing would be \"a game-changer, it is giving confidence that schools are safe,\" he said.\nProf Semple said there was \"more and more evidence that children are not the primary drivers of transmission within the community\" unlike with flu. \nAntibody tests which showed who had been infected in the past suggested that primary school pupils were about half as likely to have had the virus as teachers, while secondary school students were about two-thirds as likely, he said.\n\"I think we're now at the stage where we can open the schools with extra measures: improved ventilation is going to be so important, face masks will help, and the lateral flow tests to identify the most infectious children,\" the professor said.\nProf Semple said that a detailed examination into how teachers caught the virus suggested that they were more likely to be infected by another adult in the staffroom than by a pupil in class.\n\"It's the interaction with other adults which poses the greater risk. Like doctors and nurses, they have to be just as careful in the coffee room and canteen as they are in the workplace environment of the classroom,\" he said.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the BBC that the testing regime would \"inevitably\" mean a staggered start for secondary school pupils.\n\"Those young people won't be able to go into their classroom until the first of those tests has been done,\" he said.\nHe said it would depend on how much space each school has to conduct the initial tests, but suggested that the week of 8 March would be a \"transitional week\" for many, with a more normal level of attendance from 15 March.\nAnnouncing the testing regime last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would offer \"even greater reassurance\", although he said the evidence showed \"schools are safe and the risk posed to children by Covid is vanishingly small\".\nReopening schools has been the government's first priority as it eases England's lockdown.\nDowning Street said regular testing will be voluntary and kits to perform the tests at home will be available within the first couple of weeks.\nSecondary pupils will also be asked to wear masks in classes, as well as in corridors and communal spaces as before, the prime minister's official spokesman said. He added that the issue will be reviewed after Easter.\nProf Semple said that the experience so far is that after undergoing tests a couple of times under supervision, children \"get used to\" the swabs - which go in the nose or the back of the throat.\nHe suggested the tests were also giving pupils an example of science in action.\n\"Perhaps we're generating a new generation of scientists in the process,\" he said."

      "tags": "France,Libya",
      "text": "French ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy has been sentenced to three years in jail, two of them suspended, for corruption.\nHe was convicted of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 - after he had left office - by suggesting he could secure a prestigious job for him in return for information about a separate case.\nSarkozy, 66, is the first former French president to get a custodial sentence.\nHis lawyer says he will appeal. Sarkozy will remain free during that process which could take years.\nIn the ruling, Judge Christine M\u00e9e said the conservative politician \"knew what [he] was doing was wrong\", adding that his actions and those of his lawyer had given the public \"a very bad image of justice\".\nThe crimes were specified as influence-peddling and violation of professional secrecy.\nIt is a legal landmark for post-war France. The only precedent was the trial of Sarkozy's predecessor Jacques Chirac, who got a two-year suspended sentence in 2011 for having arranged bogus jobs at Paris City Hall for allies when he was Paris mayor. Chirac died in 2019.\nIf Sarkozy's appeal is unsuccessful, he could serve a year at home with an electronic tag, rather than go to prison.\nHis wife, supermodel and singer Carla Bruni, reacted by describing the case as \"senseless persecution\", adding that \"the fight continued, and truth would come out\".\nNicolas Sarkozy served one five-year term as president from 2007. He adopted tough anti-immigration policies and sought to reform France's economy during a presidency overshadowed by the global financial crisis.\nCritics nicknamed him \"bling-bling\", seeing his leadership style as too brash, celebrity-driven and hyperactive for a role steeped in tradition and grandeur.\nHis celebrity image was reinforced by his marriage to Bruni in 2008. In 2012 he lost his re-election bid to Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\nSince then he has been targeted by several criminal investigations.\nIn 2017 he tried to make a political comeback, but failed as his centre-right Les R\u00e9publicains party chose another presidential candidate instead.\nSarkozy was on trial with two co-defendants, his lawyer Thierry Herzog and Gilbert Azibert, a senior judge.\nThe case centred on phone conversations between Sarkozy and Herzog that were taped by police in 2014.\nInvestigators were looking into claims that Sarkozy had accepted illicit payments from the L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign.\nThe prosecution convinced the court that Sarkozy and Herzog had sought to bribe Azibert with a prestigious job in Monaco in return for information about that investigation.\nFrench media reported that Sarkozy was heard telling Herzog: \"I'll get him promoted, I'll help him.\"\nThe phone line police tapped was a secret number set up in a fictional name, Paul Bismuth, through which Sarkozy communicated with his lawyer.\nOn Monday Herzog and Azibert were also sentenced to three years in jail, two of them suspended.\nNicolas Sarkozy is no stranger to legal investigations - since he left the presidency he has been the object of half a dozen - but up until now his record sheet has been clean. There was plenty of mud, but none of it stuck.\nHalf an hour in a courtroom in Paris's new Palais de Justice changed all that. Judge M\u00e9e read out a verdict that spared nothing, and no-one. Sarkozy, Thierry Herzog and Gilbert Azibert all knew perfectly well what they were doing, she said.\nThey were trading confidential information for professional favours. And that was corruption in any book.\nIt is not the end of the affair, by any stretch. The appeal could take years. His team will continue to argue that the case rested on ill-gotten evidence - chance eavesdroppings on confidential phone-chats between a man and his lawyer.\nBut from today Sarkozy cuts a different figure. Before he was the wronged ex-president, fighting back against a left-wing judicial cabal. Now he has been convicted in a court of law.\nHe is due to go on trial next month over the so-called Bygmalion affair, in which he is accused of having overspent in his unsuccessful 2012 campaign.\nProsecutors are also investigating claims that Sarkozy received funding for his 2007 campaign from Libya's then-leader Muammar Gaddafi.\nSarkozy has already been cleared in connection with the Bettencourt case. He had said all investigations against him were politically motivated. \nDespite his legal woes he has remained popular in right-wing circles, a year away from another presidential election."

      "text": "Texas will lift its mask requirement and allow businesses to reopen at full capacity next week, Governor Greg Abbott has announced.\n\"It is now time to open Texas 100%,\" the Republican said on Tuesday.\nTexas is the largest US state to end its mask mandate. Mr Abbott has faced criticism from his party over the measure, which was imposed last July.\nBut the administration of US President Joe Biden has made it clear coronavirus restrictions are still necessary.\nThe announcement in Texas came as similar rules were lifted in other states, including Michigan, Louisiana, and Mississippi, which also ended its mask mandate.\nThe roll-out of vaccinations against Covid-19 has boosted confidence in a return to pre-pandemic life in the US.\nOn Tuesday, President Biden said the US was on track to have enough vaccines for every adult in the country by the end of May.\nYet the wave of reopenings has put states at odds with the Biden administration and its senior health officials, who have reacted with dismay to the relaxation of coronavirus measures at a precarious time in the pandemic.\nOn Monday the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned of a \"potential fourth surge of cases\" if the country lapsed into complacency. \nCovid-19 data shows that, while infections and deaths have declined in recent weeks, they are still at high levels relative to other countries.\nIn total, the US has recorded more than 28 million infections and 516,000 deaths related to Covid-19, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University.\nMr Abbott issued an executive order that rescinded most of the coronavirus measures he imposed earlier in the pandemic.\nThe new executive order, which is to take effect on 10 March, lifts all mask requirements and forbids local authorities from penalising residents who do not wear a face covering. \nIt removes all restrictions on businesses in counties without a high number of Covid-19 patients in hospital.\n\"Too many Texans have been sidelined from employment opportunities,\" Mr Abbott said in a speech at the Chamber of Commerce in the city of Lubbock. \"Too many small business owners have struggled to pay their bills. This must end.\"\nHe said that with increased vaccinations and improved treatment for Covid-19, the state was \"in a far better position now\".\nBut, he added, \"Covid has not suddenly disappeared\". Following weeks of decline, coronavirus infections and related deaths are creeping up again in Texas, data from the Covid Tracking Project showed.\nTexas has recorded more than 43,000 deaths related to Covid-19, the third-highest state toll in the US.\nAngelica Casas, reporting from San Antonio, Texas\nGovernor Abbott's announcement was no surprise to Texans. After all, the state's pandemic response has been political from the start.\nThe state's Republican leadership favoured former President Donald Trump's relatively relaxed approach to imposing restrictions. But that created tension with local officials in the state's major cities, which all lean Democrat.\nIt was control of the disease vs control of the economy. Mask requirements vs maintaining personal liberties. And when the surges came, state politicians were more reactive than proactive.\nA year later, not much has changed. The state's death toll and current case rate are still among the highest in the US. That's why critics say Governor Abbott's decision does not follow the science.\nSo the decision will be a test to the state - but also to Mr Abbott's relationship with President Biden, who has addressed the pandemic with more urgency than his predecessor.\nIndividual states are in charge of public health policy in the US. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, most introduced restrictions on businesses and travel.\nAbout 35 required face coverings to be worn in public places - either indoors or outdoors - although enforcement of these mask mandates has been patchy.\nWith cases and deaths falling sharply in recent weeks, several states have begun easing the restrictions.\nShortly after Mr Abbott's announcement, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said he would do the same in an even shorter time frame.\n\"Starting tomorrow, we are lifting all of our county mask mandates and businesses will be able to operate at full capacity without any state-imposed rules,\" Mr Reeves said.\nHealth experts have warned that the pandemic was far from over and cases could pick up if curbs were lifted too soon.\nPresident Biden - in contrast with his predecessor Mr Trump - has made fighting the virus a priority for his administration.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Biden said he was upbeat about reaching his goal of delivering 100 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office, but urged Americans to remain vigilant in wearing masks and observing social distancing.\n\"Today's announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic,\" Biden said in a televised statement from the White House. \"But I have to be honest with you. This fight is far from over.\""

      "text": "The role of the Lord Advocate of Scotland has been brought into the spotlight as the Scottish Parliament continues its investigation into the mishandling of complaints against Alex Salmond. Who holds the post and what does he do?\nControversy over the professional double life led by whoever holds the position of Scotland's Lord Advocate is nothing new.\nTheir responsibility for prosecuting crime is said to have been enshrined in an act of parliament in 1587, the year Mary Queen of Scots had her head chopped off.\nMore than four centuries later, the incumbent performs a dual role as head of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and as a minister in the Scottish government and its principal legal advisor.\nHe or she is appointed by the Queen on recommendation of the first minister, with the support of the Scottish Parliament.\nThe wearing of two hats - one non-political and independent, the other at the heart of government - was the subject of criticism when the Scottish Parliament came into being in 1999.\nIn 2007 the then first minister, Alex Salmond, decided to depoliticise the job by reducing the number of occasions when the Lord Advocate would attend Cabinet meetings.\nIn 2018, the Scottish Conservatives raised concerns that that policy had fallen away, with the current Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC attending a majority of those meetings. The Scottish government said his attendance reflected how many legal issues were coming before the Cabinet.\nNow an almighty row has broken out over the Crown's intervention in the affair that is rocking Scottish politics.\nA Holyrood committee is trying to investigate the Scottish government's handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond.\nThe Scottish Parliament Corporate Body chose to publish Mr Salmond's submission on whether his successor Nicola Sturgeon had breached the Ministerial Code.\nThe Crown then raised \"grave concerns\" about its publication, in the belief that some of its contents could amount to a contempt of court. \nThe move appeared to raise the mind-bending prospect of Scotland's prosecution service dragging the Scottish Parliament in front of three judges in Scotland's High Court.  Organisations found guilty of contempt face an unlimited fine and individuals can be jailed for up to two years.\nHolyrood's corporate body withdrew the document and published a redacted version, prompting a furious response from opposition parties, and Mr Salmond.\nIn response, Mr Wolffe has repeated his position that he has had no personal involvement in decisions involving the former first minister. He stressed the independence of senior Crown Office lawyers who are taking these decisions and even felt the need to tell MSPs he has no party political affiliations.\nMr Wolffe said the Crown's \"sole interest\" had been securing compliance with the contempt of court order laid down in the High Court and designed to protect the anonymity of the women involved in the case.\nThis is the second of two storms currently facing the Crown Office.  \nDespite its daily work in securing convictions in the courts, its reputation has been battered by the failed prosecution of individuals linked to Rangers FC and the payment of tens of millions of pounds in damages. At some point in the future, that will be the subject of another inquiry.\nAs for the Lord Advocate, if Scottish politicians believe his dual role should come to an end, they'll have the opportunity to put that to voters at the next general election.

      "tags": "Department for Work & Pensions,Universal Credit,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Parts of the UK reliant on tourism have been most affected by the Covid-19 jobs crisis, analysis suggests.\nIn some areas, around three out of five people who began claiming universal credit at the outset of the pandemic were still doing so six months later.\nExperts said areas with seasonal employment were more likely to see furloughed workers, those in low-wage jobs or on zero-hours contracts.\nThe government said it was boosting welfare support by \"billions\" to help.\nAhead of Wednesday's Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has promised more support for the economy as Covid lockdown rules are eased.\nAnalysing official data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), the BBC Shared Data Unit found:\n\"The general consistent pattern is places that rely on people travelling to them have been the hardest hit,\" Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think-tank, said.\nEconomist Emma Congreve, from the Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of Strathclyde, said: \"The pandemic has exposed a number of underlying inequalities in the labour market.\"\nSome 7.8 million people a year choose to visit the mountains, woodlands and rivers of Gwynedd in north Wales and explore Snowdonia National Park.\nThe tourism industry employs 18,000 people and contributes \u00a31.3bn to the local economy every year. \nBut the pandemic has exposed an over-dependence on tourism, a report to the local council warns, with a 60% drop in the value of tourism in 2020.\nCouncil leader Councillor Dyfrig Siencyn told a meeting such \"unsustainable tourism\" could not continue to be accommodated.\nHe said: \"Setting a new direction is vital and I believe that the industry itself sees the need to be more reflective of our society generally\n\"The pandemic has perhaps shown we're almost wholly reliant on tourism in rural areas such as Gwynedd and have very little choice, which drives us to create a much more varied economy rather than all our eggs being in one basket.\n\"We're told that \u00a31.3bn is generated from tourism yet still have some of the lowest income levels in the country, how do you reconcile that?\nThe tourism industry accounts for one in seven jobs in the capital and contributes almost 12% of London's GDP.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for the tourism sector in the capital to be given more support, with tourism spending in London set to fall by \u00a310.9bn.\nRichard Burge, chief executive of London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said businesses in the capital had \"suffered the perfect storm of losing revenue usually provided by international and domestic visitors, commuters, and business travellers\".\nFather-of-four Brahim Rabi, 50, from Barnet in north London, was made redundant from his job as a driver for a kitchen design company in May last year.\nAs he is looking after his four young children on his own, he can only take on a part-time job. But despite sending out close to 30 applications each week, he has not been able to find employment and has been claiming universal credit for nearly six months.\nBrahim's rent went up by \u00a3100 last year, meaning he now pays \u00a31,300 a month. His benefits do not cover his rent each month and he has been borrowing money from friends and family to see his family through the crisis after his savings ran out.\n\"It has been very very hard, especially with the kids off school. \n\"I am at home 24 hours with them, thinking about whether I will have money the next day, wondering what will happen to me. \n\"It's the first time in my life I have been out of work. I have always had enough, I have always looked after my family. It makes me so sad, every time my children need something I don't know how to explain to them I don't have the money, it has been really hard for me.\n\"If I apply for 100 jobs you may hear back from one or two that reply just to say \"sorry\". The rest, you never get any reply from them. During the last year, it has been very difficult to get a job unless you know someone - all business has closed because of Covid-19.\" \nFrom February last year to October, the proportion of people claiming UC whilst in employment rose on average by four percentage points.\nIn four areas, more than half of all claimants were in employment: the Isles of Scilly, South Lakeland in Cumbria, Richmondshire in North Yorkshire, and Boston in Lincolnshire.\nRichmondshire's district council said it was \"a reflection of its low wage economy, with a lot of people working in seasonal tourist-related employment\".\nPeter Matejic, from anti-poverty charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the government would need to look \"geographically at which areas were bouncing back quicker and which sectors\" and \"think about how it can unwind the furlough scheme without bringing about a big spike in unemployment\".\nMinesh Patel, of Citizens Advice UK, said seven in every 10 people approaching the charity had not needed to apply for benefits before. \nCovid-19 meant \"overnight, loads of people lost their job or saw a drop in their hours,\" Mr Patel said.\n\"Our advisers are telling us a lot of the people coming to us are on the furlough scheme and need universal credit to top up. There has also been a rise in people in insecure work during this pandemic.\"\nIt is a means-tested benefit for people of a working age on low income. It is claimed by more than 5.5 million households. \nIt can be claimed when you are in, or out, of work.\nThe standard allowance varies from around \u00a3340 to just under \u00a3600 a month, depending on your age or whether you are single. \nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)  said UC had \"been a lifeline for millions affected by the pandemic\" and would play a \"vital role\" in the recovery of the jobs market.\nThe DWP said some UC claims were deliberately being left open for longer during the pandemic rather than closed to avoid having to restart the claims process for people who needed urgent support suddenly.\nIt said spending on working-age welfare in 2020 was - at over \u00a3100bn - set to be at its highest level on record, in real terms and as a percentage of national income and that was combined with other measures to safeguard jobs such as furlough and help for \"the lowest-paid families\" including the \u00a3170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme.\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nFor more information on methodology, click here.

      "tags": "Manufacturing,Companies,Gaydon,Aston Martin,Electric cars,Car industry",
      "text": "This week sees the return of one of the most evocative names in the British car industry to the top level of motorsport.\nOn Wednesday, Aston Martin will unveil its first Formula 1 car in more than 60 years. \nThe move into F1 is the keystone of a bold plan to revive the flagging fortunes of the company and turn it into a sporting and commercial brand to rival Ferrari.\nIt is the brainchild of Canadian billionaire and executive chairman Lawrence Stroll. His intention, he says, is to build a business that will have \"the strongest profile of any luxury automotive brand\".\nIn early 2020, Aston Martin Lagonda was in deep trouble. Sales were poor, and the company was burning through cash. Its shares, launched on the London stock market in 2018, had been haemorrhaging value. \nLawrence Stroll provided a lifeline. \nA billionaire who made most of his money through investments in luxury designer brands, notably Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors, he led a group of investors who were willing to inject new funds into Aston Martin.\nThe need for those funds became more acute when the effects of the Covid pandemic emerged and the industry ground to a halt. \nThe move left Mr Stroll as executive chairman - and in charge of the company. Meanwhile, he had already taken control of an F1 team, after leading a bid for the assets of Force India, which went into administration in 2018.\nThese elements are now coming together. The F1 team, which spent two seasons competing as Racing Point, has been rebranded as Aston Martin.\nWhen it takes to the track this year, it will be the first time an Aston Martin has competed in F1 since a largely unsuccessful foray in 1959 and 1960.\nWith four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel and Mr Stroll's son Lance as the team's drivers, it will be used to focus attention on the car company, which has been heavily restructured.\nThe parallels with Ferrari are evident and Mr Stroll clearly admires his Italian rivals.\n\"Ferrari has a great business model, and there are a great deal of similarities,\" he explains.\n\"But Aston Martin has a British, iconic 108-year history. If I'm not mistaken, about 50 years longer than Ferrari!\n\"F1, for a luxury performance automotive company, is the greatest platform in the world.\"\nF1, he argues, provides both a marketing platform and an environment in which technology can be developed and refined for the next generation of roadgoing sports cars.\nBut the car industry is changing, and while policymakers around the world are increasingly forcing manufacturers to look towards electric cars, F1 appears to have no plans to abandon fossil fuels.\n\"F1 already uses the lowest emission power units in the world, which sadly is the world's best kept secret,\" says Mr Stroll.\nThe F1 community, he insists, is well aware of the direction in which the world is going, and has ambitious plans for new technologies to mitigate emissions further, using new engines and special fuels.\nMeanwhile electrification, he says, should not be a problem for the sportscar business.  \n\"The most important thing for any company, as far as I'm concerned, is its brand. We have the greatest iconic brand in Aston Martin,\" he says.\nElectric and hybrid technology, he explains, can simply be brought in from the German firm Mercedes-Benz. \nThe two companies have a technical partnership, while Mercedes' parent company Daimler also has a 20% stake in Aston Martin.\nSo as far as he is concerned the issue for the future is not so much the technology itself, as how it is sold. \nHe has made clear, too, that a major part of Aston's brand identity is its British heritage. This is, after all, the brand marketed around the world as James Bond's company car of choice.\nBut Mr Stroll is Canadian. His chief executive, Tobias Moers, is German. Aston Martin's shareholders are international. So what is really left of that British identity?\n\"There are about 2,500 people who work between here [in the Gaydon headquarters] and in Wales,\" he says.\n\"There are another 500 people that work at the F1 factory in Silverstone.\n\"As far as leadership is concerned, I most definitely am Canadian. I've had Canadian businesses, American businesses.\n\"All the experience I have of building some of the best luxury businesses around the world will be brought into this business.\n\"But its roots and its heritage and about 99% of its employees are most definitely British.\""

      "tags": "Tax,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021,Coronavirus pandemic,UK High Streets,Income tax",
      "text": "A \u00a35bn scheme for High Street shops and hospitality firms in England has been unveiled, with Rishi Sunak promising more support to come for the economy.\nAhead of Wednesday's Budget, the chancellor said the grants, worth as much as \u00a318,000 per firm, will help them reopen as England eases lockdown.\nIt was broadly welcomed by firms but some groups said it was not enough.\nDespite concerns about the country's debt, Mr Sunak told the BBC's Marr show his priority was still jobs and firms.\nThe chancellor said public finances faced \"enormous strains\" due to the pandemic. \"I want to level with people about the challenges we face,\" he said.\nBut the new \u00a35bn grant scheme would help people \"reopen their businesses\" and is \"the right thing to do now\", Mr Sunak said. \nHe said it had been an \"incredibly difficult year\" for the High Street and hospitality sectors, and the grants would give them the \"support they need to get them through, get them back on their feet\".\nIt was, he said, part of a range of support measures since the start of the pandemic and would continue. \"We went big, we went early - and there's more to come,\" he told Marr.\nThe chancellor has faced calls to raise taxes from some parts of the Tory party, while Labour and other Conservative MPs have opposed increases. \nThere are newspaper reports this weekend suggesting Mr Sunak could freeze some income tax thresholds for three years and raise corporation tax. However, the chancellor would not comment on tax measures, saying more would be disclosed in the Budget.\nThe government has so far borrowed \u00a3271bn this financial year - up \u00a3222bn on 2019-20. This has pushed the national debt to \u00a32.13 trillion.\nNearly 700,000 shops, restaurants, hotels, hair salons, gyms and other businesses in England, will be eligible for the so-called \"restart grants\", to be distributed directly to firms by local authorities from April. It will replace the current monthly grant system.\nThe funding takes the total spent on direct grants to businesses during the pandemic to \u00a325bn, the Treasury said. The devolved nations will receive equivalent extra funding.\nNon-essential shops in England, along with outdoor hospitality, will be allowed to reopen from 12 April at the earliest.\nOther announcements ahead of Mr Sunak's annual economic speech on Wednesday, have included:\nMike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, welcomed the \"much-needed lifeline\" provided to businesses by the grants, but called for the chancellor to set out more funding \"for those that have been excluded from income support throughout this crisis\".\nUK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said businesses were \"crying out for the cash\" and urged the grants to be paid as soon as possible.\nAnd Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, which represents chain stores, said the latest money was a \"vital injection of funding\" but warned it would \"only provide temporary relief\" if the business rate holiday did not continue.\nOther groups called for the extension of the furlough scheme and the temporary reduction in value added tax (VAT) on hospitality sales.\nLast year was the worst for the High Street in more than 25 years as the pandemic accelerated the move towards online shopping, with more than 180,000 jobs lost in retail alone, according to the Centre for Retail Research.\nSome Conservative MPs, such as former Brexit secretary David Davis, have spoken out against attempts to increase taxes. But Conservative former chancellor Lord Clarke has encouraged Mr Sunak to consider raising VAT, national insurance and income taxes in order to repair the public finances.\nLabour has said it opposes tax rises in the short-term and has called for a \u00a320 uplift in universal credit to be kept. The party also called for more help for young people to avoid a \"lost generation scarred by unemployment\".\nOn Sunday, economists at the respected EY Item Club said it was right for the chancellor to continue nursing the economy through recovery rather than introduce Budget measures to re-build the country's battered finances. \nMartin Beck, senior economic adviser to the Item Club, said: \"Despite an almost unprecedented peacetime deficit, serious action to repair the public finances can wait. The chancellor's focus should still be on supporting the economy through the pandemic and premature fiscal tightening could undermine recovery. \n\"With the cost of government debt still historically low, there is no evidence yet of any significant constraint on government borrowing.\"\nAre you a small or medium business owner?

      "title": "Calls for Nicola Sturgeon to quit over Alex Salmond revelations",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is facing calls to resign after new documents raised further questions about her involvement in the Alex Salmond saga.\nThe government has published emails showing it continued a doomed legal fight with Mr Salmond despite its lawyers advising it was likely to lose. \nFurther evidence from two other witnesses has also called into question Ms Sturgeon's version of events. \nScotland's first minster is to face an inquiry over the affair on Wednesday. \nThe Scottish Parliament set up a special committee to investigate the mishandling of sexual harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. MSPs heard from the former first minister last week and now it is Ms Sturgeon's turn.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there was \"no longer any doubt that Nicola Sturgeon lied to the Scottish Parliament and broke the ministerial code on numerous counts.\"\nHe added: \"No first minister can be allowed to mislead the Scottish people and continue in office, especially when they have tried to cover up the truth and abused the power of their office in the process.\n\"The weight of the evidence is overwhelming. Nicola Sturgeon must resign.\"  \nThe party, which had earlier published a dossier claiming Ms Sturgeon has breached the ministerial code up to 38 times, said it would be submitting a motion of no confidence in the first minister to the Scottish Parliament.\nLabour MSP Jackie Baillie said the new documents showed that the government's handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond had been \"indefensible\". \nBut the pro-independence Scottish Greens, who could hold the balance of power in any vote of confidence, said it was \"for the committee and the ministerial code inquiry to do the jobs they've been tasked with.\" \nThe Liberal Democrats said the new documents \"look very serious\" for the first minister, but added: \"She deserves her day to respond to these allegations before we decide what to do next.\"\nA spokesman for Ms Sturgeon said she would address the issues \"and much more besides\" at the Holyrood Committee on the Scottish government's Handling of Harassment Complaints.\nHe added: \"But to call a vote of no confidence in the middle of a pandemic, before hearing a single word of the first minister's evidence, is utterly irresponsible.\"\nThe first minister has denied breaching the ministerial code - the rules setting out how government ministers are expected to behave - and has said she is \"relishing\" the opportunity to put her side of the story forward at the inquiry.\nShe has also dismissed Mr Salmond's claims that people close to her - including her husband Peter Murrell, the SNP chief executive - had plotted against him as untrue.\nMs Sturgeon said there was no evidence to back up the allegations and has accused her predecessor of creating an \"alternative reality\". \nA raft of new documents published by the government on Tuesday evening included email advice it had received warning that it was likely to lose a judicial review of its handling of the complaints against Mr Salmond. \nEmails showed a senior lawyer was \"very concerned indeed\" about the case in October 2018, with the government's counsel urging it to admit defeat by 6 December.\nBut it did not do so until January 2019, when it had to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000 - on top of its own costs - after admitting its investigation into the allegations had been unlawful.\nThis was because the civil servant tasked with investigating the complaints had already been in contact with the complainers.\nSenior lawyer Roddy Dunlop QC said on 31 October that this \"presents a very real problem indeed\",  as it could appear that the investigating officer was \"not eligible\".\nRelations with the external counsel worsened after a series of problems with bringing forward documents to the civil court, with the lawyers writing on 19 December that they had suffered \"extreme professional embarrassment\" and that the case was becoming \"unstatable\".\nBy 28 December the lawyers had threatened to resign from the case, and the government conceded defeat days later. \nMr Salmond was later cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault against a total of nine women after a separate criminal trial at the High Court in Edinburgh in March of last year.\nOn top of the Covid crisis, Nicola Sturgeon now has a major political crisis to deal with as well.\nThe Conservative's call for her resignation backed up with plans for a vote of no confidence is a major escalation in political tensions at Holyrood.\nIf she was to lose a confidence vote, she would be expected to resign as first minister.\nThe SNP does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament - the opposition is strong enough to vote down the government, if it so chooses. \nHowever, both Labour and the Liberal Democrats want to wait to hear the first minister's evidence to the Holyrood inquiry before deciding their positions.\nMy sense is the Greens would not try to oust the first minister before they have seen the findings of two inquiries into her handling of harassment complaints.\nThat could help to sustain her in office although the parliamentary arithmetic would still be tight.\nAll of this with just over nine weeks to go to the Holyrood election \u2014 where the public will give their verdict on all parties and whoever leads them.\nThe Scottish government had refused to publish the legal advice it had received until opposition parties threatened to have a vote of no confidence in Deputy First Minister John Swinney. \nMr Swinney said the papers showed that legal advice was \"optimistic\" in the first instance, but that it \"became gradually but progressively less optimistic over time\".\nAnd he said the government had taken the \"right and proper\" approach by conceding \"within a matter of days\" of being told the case was no longer winnable. \nThe Scottish Conservatives said not all of the government's correspondence with its lawyers had been released, as the inquiry committee and parliament had demanded, and said they would push ahead with a vote of no confidence in Mr Swinney on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, the committee has also published submissions from Duncan Hamilton - a former SNP MSP and lawyer for Mr Salmond - and Kevin Pringle, a former SNP communications director.\nMr Salmond had cited both men as backing up his claims about his meetings with Ms Sturgeon, including allegations the name of one of the complainers was passed to Mr Salmond's former chief of staff in a breach of confidence.\nBoth said they agreed this had happened - despite Ms Sturgeon telling MSPs that \"to the very best of my knowledge I do not think that happened\".\nMs Sturgeon has also maintained that she only learned of the complaints against Mr Salmond at a meeting at her home on 2 April 2018 - despite accepting she had met his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, at her Holyrood office on 29 March.\nMr Pringle and Mr Hamilton said they had taken part in a conference call with Mr Aberdein ahead of the 29 March meeting, and said he was clear that \"the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the two complaints\".\nMr Hamilton was present at the meeting on 2 April, and said that \"when we arrived, everyone in the room knew exactly why we were there - no introduction to the subject was needed and no one was in any doubt what we were there to discuss\".\nThe former MSP also insisted that Ms Sturgeon had offered to assist Mr Salmond in seeking mediation with the complainers saying she had told him that \"if it comes to it, I will intervene\".\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs in January 2019 that \"I was always clear that I had no role in the process - I did not seek to intervene in it at any stage\".\nMr Salmond was SNP leader for a total of 20 years and first minister for seven before being succeeded in both roles by Ms Sturgeon after the independence referendum in 2014. \nHis long-awaited appearance at the inquiry last Friday saw him claim that \"Scotland's leadership has failed\" as he called for Mr Murrell and the country's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, to quit and Scotland's top law officer, Lord Advocate James Wolffe, to consider his position. \nHe alleged that there had been a \"deliberate suppression of information inconvenient to the government\" throughout the saga, including part of his written evidence to the committee that was removed after a request from the Crown Office despite having already been published by parliament.  \nMr Salmond also told the committee that he had been given a memory stick in the build up to his criminal trial that contained messages which involved \"pressuring police\", \"collusion of witnesses\" and \"construction of evidence because police were felt to be inadequate in finding it themselves\".\nHe described the messages - which are believed to have been handed over to the committee by the Crown Office on Tuesday - as \"probably the most shocking thing I have seen in my life\".\nBut he said he could not give any further details because he had been told he could face prosecution if he did so."

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Brazil coronavirus variant now found in the UK appears more contagious and may evade immunity provided by past infection, scientists say.\nExperiences from Manaus - the Amazonian city hit hard by the P.1 variant - suggest it could be up to twice as transmissible as earlier Covid there, the first detailed study suggests.\nThe preliminary work puts the chance of reinfection at between 25% and 60%.\nBut experts say this should not be used to predict what may happen in the UK.  \nIndeed, one of the lead researchers said it was unlikely P.1 would quickly take off in Britain when only six cases had been identified and these were being closely monitored. \nInfectious diseases expert Prof Ester Sabino, from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, said: \"You need many introductions [of a virus] to start an epidemic. Six is very few. I would say if you take care and do contact tracing, this is going to decrease.\"\nProfessor Sharon Peacock, who is director of the UK's centre leading on genetic testing of coronavirus, said: \"We are taking appropriate action. These are very interesting and important findings for Brazil, but how they relate to the UK is yet to be determined.\"\nUpdating MPs on the six cases of the Brazil variant seen in the UK, Health Secretary Hancock said: \"We have no information to suggest the variant has spread further.\"\nOne of the six people affected has not yet been identified, but the search has narrowed from the whole country down to 379 households in the south-east of England.\nMr Hancock said: \"We're contacting each one.\"\nThe researchers have been tracking coronavirus in Brazil for nearly a year now. Manaus, like many other regions around the world, encountered a large first wave in the spring of 2020. \nLots of people were infected with the original version of the virus at that time, with blood test results suggesting as many as three-quarters of the population getting some degree of protection or immunity from this exposure. \nDespite this, people in Manaus were hit badly by another wave of coronavirus in the winter. \nThe research team from Brazil and Imperial College London have been studying the genetic makeup of coronavirus in some of those who were infected between November and December, as well as modelling the pandemic outcomes. \nThey say the P.1 variant probably emerged in early November, dominated and spread quickly, and caused many reinfections. \nThe data is preliminary, but fits with what experts have suspected - that some of these new variants of coronavirus the world is seeing are more infectious and can evade some of the immunity people may have already built against Covid. \nThis raises questions about how well current vaccines, which were designed around earlier versions of the virus, might work and how countries can ease restrictions without case levels rising too high.  \nWork is already under way to redesign or tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new \"variants of concern\", although existing ones should still provide some protection, particularly against severe disease. \nUpdated vaccines could be ready within months, meaning the UK would have millions of doses ready to give people a booster shot before next winter to make sure the population is protected. \nThe priority, along with mass vaccination, is to keep cases low to reduce the chance of new and emerging variants from spreading. \nMr Hancock said: \"Our current vaccines have not yet been studied against this variant and we're working to understand what impact it might have, but we do know that this variant has caused significant challenges in Brazil, so we're doing all we can to stop the spread of this new variant in the UK, to analyse its effects and to develop an updated vaccine that works on all these variants of concern and protect the progress that we've made as a nation.\""

Profits jumped from just $21.7m in 2019 to $671.5m.\nWhile some companies have started to ease staff back into the office, many others have said they expect that some of the increased flexibility introduced during the pandemic will linger.\n\"The future is here with the rise of remote and work from anywhere trends,\" Mr Yuan said in prepared remarks for investors. \"We recognize this new reality and are helping to empower our own employees and those of our customers to work and thrive in a distributed manner.\" \nSusannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Zoom's fate would depend on how it manages to compete against firms such as Microsoft and Google, which have introduced similar features.\n\"Although it stole an early march on other players in the first few months of the crisis, it does now have much stiffer competition from the likes of Microsoft and Google who have significantly upped their game,\" she wrote in a research note.\n\"It may be that we have become so used to pandemic habits that we will stick with our virtual social lives, particularly for long distance friendships and work relationships. But just how large a slice of the live video pie Zoom manages to hang on to will depend on how it matches up to its powerful rivals.\""

      "tags": "Scottish government,Alex Salmond inquiry,John Swinney,Scottish Parliament",
      "text": "Scottish government lawyers had \"reservations\" about its court battle with Alex Salmond more than two months before it conceded the case.\nThe judicial review was examining whether the government's handling of harassment complaints against the former first minister was legal.\nMr Salmond has said the government was told in October 2018 that it was likely to lose the case.\nBut it did not admit it had acted unlawfully until January 2019.\nThe government ultimately had to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000 on top of its own costs.\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney has now admitted that concerns were raised ahead of the government admitting defeat. \nBut he insisted there were \"good public policy arguments and reasonable grounds\" to continue contesting the case for a further two months. \nThere have been claims that continuing to contest the case after being given legal advice that it was unlikely to succeed would be a waste of public money and potentially a breach of the ministerial code. \nThe government is to release key papers - including external legal advice - to the Holyrood inquiry committee that is investigating the saga, with Mr Swinney saying the unusual move was to \"counter false claims being made by some\".\nThe Scottish Conservatives said they would press ahead with a vote of no confidence in the deputy first minister, saying he was \"releasing only the evidence he wants us to see\".\nThere has been a long-running row over the legal advice given to the Scottish government after Mr Salmond launched judicial review proceedings in 2018 over the way internal harassment complaints against him had been investigated.\nThe government admitted in January 2019 that its approach had been unlawful, because its investigating officer had had prior contact with the two complainers - in breach of a newly-designed procedure.\nMr Salmond had claimed that ministers were given legal advice on 31 October 2018 which \"indicated that on the balance of probability, the government was going to lose the judicial review\".\nHe said that \"if the case was continued in the knowledge of the first minister against that legal advice, that would be a breach of the ministerial code\".\nThe Holyrood committee investigating the government's botched handling of the complaints has been pushing to see the full legal advice for some time, and MSPs have twice voted to say it should be handed over.\nOn Monday, Mr Swinney confirmed that key papers would be handed over - after it became clear that all opposition parties were set to back a motion of no confidence in his position.\nHe confirmed that concerns had been raised about the issue which ultimately collapsed the government's case, but insisted there were other reasons to fight on.\nThe committee has previously been shown a memo summarising legal advice, which said external counsel had threatened to resign on 28 December 2018 and that Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans was told the next day that \"the only sensible and defensible position is to concede the petition\".\nIn a letter to the committee published on Tuesday, Mr Swinney said: \"The documents confirm that, whilst reservations were raised about the judicial review following the identification of the issue of prior contact with the complainers in late October, there were good public policy arguments and reasonable grounds for the government to continue to defend the judicial review and to seek a determination from the court on the matters raised, until the events of late December 2018.\"\nMr Swinney also told the committee that the documents being released should be with them by Tuesday afternoon.\nHowever the Scottish Conservatives said they would not be withdrawing their motion of no confidence until the committee was satisfied that all of the advice had been handed over.\nLeader Douglas Ross said: \"Recklessly continuing with the judicial review when it was doomed would clearly be a breach of the ministerial code. The public deserve to know exactly what mistakes were made.\n\"John Swinney is not getting away with releasing only the evidence he wants us to see. We will press ahead with the vote of no confidence until all the legal advice is published.\"\nIn his letter, the deputy first minister said that the release of the material meant \"the Scottish government will have responded to all of the committee's requests for specific documents within our legal and other obligations\".\nHe said he hoped that it would \"assist the committee in fulfilling its remit and address some of the allegations that have been raised, without evidence, in the past few days\".\nOn Tuesday morning, Lord Advocate James Wolffe - the government's top legal advisor and head of the prosecution service - mounted a defence of the role of the Crown Office in the various rows over Mr Salmond's submissions.\nMr Wolffe told the inquiry committee that \"any suggestion from any quarter\" that the prosecution service had not acted independently \"would be wholly without foundation\".\nHe said the parliament had been \"right\" to redact one of Mr Salmond's written statements after the Crown Office raised concerns that \"certain parts of the submission were liable to be a breach of a court order\".\nHe added: \"Mr Salmond has stated that the Crown has tied his hands in respect of the use of information that he holds - it is the law, not the Crown, that stays his hands\".\nThe Lord Advocate also denied that there was a conflict between his post combining the roles of government minister and independent prosecutor, saying: \"My fundamental responsibility is to the rule of law and the administration of justice - that fundamental principle underpins all of the functions I have.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Schools,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Regular testing of secondary pupils will be a \"game-changer\" in giving confidence that schools are safe, a government science adviser has said.\nProf Calum Semple told the BBC better ventilation and face masks would also contribute to a safe reopening in England from 8 March.\nRates of infection in schools had been \"quite low\", he said.\nBut a school leaders' union warned the testing demands may mean a staggered return for many.\nSecondary pupils in England will be asked to take a rapid lateral flow test twice a week to help identify anyone who might be infectious.\nPupils are required to be given three initial tests at school or college before moving to home testing. There is no testing planned for primary school pupils.\nProf Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told BBC Breakfast: \"The good news is we're finding quite low rates of active infection within the schools.\"\nHe said 1.2% of secondary students and 1.6% of teachers had tested positive, quoting a survey published on Monday by the Office for National Statistics. The ONS tested about 12,000 pupils and teachers in early December.\nIn some areas, only 0.4% of the tests came back positive, Prof Semple said. \nThe introduction of regular testing would be \"a game-changer, it is giving confidence that schools are safe,\" he said.\nProf Semple said there was \"more and more evidence that children are not the primary drivers of transmission within the community\" unlike with flu. \nAntibody tests which showed who had been infected in the past suggested that primary school pupils were about half as likely to have had the virus as teachers, while secondary school students were about two-thirds as likely, he said.\n\"I think we're now at the stage where we can open the schools with extra measures: improved ventilation is going to be so important, face masks will help, and the lateral flow tests to identify the most infectious children,\" the professor said.\nProf Semple said that a detailed examination into how teachers caught the virus suggested that they were more likely to be infected by another adult in the staffroom than by a pupil in class.\n\"It's the interaction with other adults which poses the greater risk. Like doctors and nurses, they have to be just as careful in the coffee room and canteen as they are in the workplace environment of the classroom,\" he said.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the BBC that the testing regime would \"inevitably\" mean a staggered start for secondary school pupils.\n\"Those young people won't be able to go into their classroom until the first of those tests has been done,\" he said.\nHe said it would depend on how much space each school has to conduct the initial tests, but suggested that the week of 8 March would be a \"transitional week\" for many, with a more normal level of attendance from 15 March.\nAnnouncing the testing regime last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would offer \"even greater reassurance\", although he said the evidence showed \"schools are safe and the risk posed to children by Covid is vanishingly small\".\nReopening schools has been the government's first priority as it eases England's lockdown.\nDowning Street said regular testing will be voluntary and kits to perform the tests at home will be available within the first couple of weeks.\nSecondary pupils will also be asked to wear masks in classes, as well as in corridors and communal spaces as before, the prime minister's official spokesman said. He added that the issue will be reviewed after Easter.\nProf Semple said that the experience so far is that after undergoing tests a couple of times under supervision, children \"get used to\" the swabs - which go in the nose or the back of the throat.\nHe suggested the tests were also giving pupils an example of science in action.\n\"Perhaps we're generating a new generation of scientists in the process,\" he said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

      "tags": "Coronavirus testing",
      "text": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock has denied that delays in imposing quarantine hotel measures on travellers to the UK put lives at risk.\nIt comes as officials seek a person in England who has been infected with a concerning variant of the virus which causes Covid-19 first found in Brazil. \nThey are one of six cases of the P1 variant found in the UK in February.\nMr Hancock said there was \"no evidence\" the infected person had not followed home quarantine rules.\nAsked by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg if the delay to hotel quarantine measures could have put lives at risk, the health secretary said \"no\".\nMr Hancock said home quarantine measures and travel restrictions on Brazil had already been in place before the hotel policy was implemented.\nHe told a Downing Street press conference there had not been \"any further knock-on transmissions in the data\" and he hoped the evidence that the five known cases had followed the rules was \"very reassuring to people\".\nHe added the government intended to go ahead as planned with the reopening of schools in England on 8 March.\nThe person infected with the variant who has not been traced is understood to have used a home testing kit, but did not complete their registration form properly.\nIt has prompted an appeal for anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February to come forward immediately by calling 119. \nAs the person has not been identified officials do not know if they have recently travelled abroad or if they have been self-isolating, as they will not have received their test result.\nPublic Health England's Dr Susan Hopkins said they were tracking the Brazilian variant \"very closely\" and said it was \"extremely rare\" for someone not to provide their full contact details.\nShe added PHE was doing \"everything they can to track down the individual\".\nOn Monday, a further 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported, with 5,455 new cases identified across the UK.\nWhile figures are often lower at the start of the week due to reporting lags, cases are down by 49% compared with last Monday.\nMore than 20.2 million people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to the latest government figures.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the search for the infected individual demonstrated the \"slowness of the government to close off even the major routes\" and said he still thought \"we have not secured our borders in the way that we should have done\". \nDuring a visit to a school in Stoke-on-Trent, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had one of the \"toughest border regimes anywhere in the world\" and said the government had moved \"as fast as we could\" with introducing hotel quarantine measures.\nIt is tempting to think that, if officials can identify the one missing case, the UK will be able to stamp out the Brazil variant. \nBut it's unlikely this will be possible. There will no doubt be more cases either of this variant or others circulating with the E484 mutation that allows the virus to escape some of the effect of the vaccines. \nThat's because not all positive cases can be checked for variants. The UK carries out nearly half of the genomic sequencing in the world and can check around 25,000 positive tests a week for variants. \nThat means about a quarter of positive cases were checked last week, but a month ago - with infection rates higher - it was under one in 10. \nWhat is more, not everyone who is positive comes forward for a test in the first place. We are seeing just the tip of the iceberg.\nSo what is the strategy? Keep cases low, and where possible try to limit the spread of these variants. \nAnd in the future, update the vaccines to work better against the variants - if that is needed.   \nThe hotel quarantine rule came into force on 15 February. It means that travellers coming to England from 33 countries - including Brazil - must pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while in Scotland the rule applies to international travellers from all countries.\nBefore that date, travellers arriving into the UK still needed to self-isolate in their homes for 10 days.\nAll travellers to the UK also need to present a negative Covid test result, taken a maximum of 72 hours before their departure. \nHealth officials believe the missing person may have used a home testing kit.\nEvery home testing kit has a unique barcode on it. \nPeople must register this barcode online to link the test to a person's contact details.\nWithout doing this, the test will effectively be anonymous.\nSo, what is likely an error in that registration process meant the positive result has been picked up but there is no one to send it to.\nTests done in person at drive-thru or walk-in centres are less likely to see this occur, as much of the information is filled in before the person arrives and there are staff on hand to make sure it is done correctly.\nIn any given week, around 1.5% of cases passed on to contact tracers do not have the person's contact details.  \nThe unidentified England case of the Brazil variant is not currently linked to five other UK cases.\nTwo of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire. They tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force. Everyone in five postcode areas of South Gloucestershire is now being invited to take a Covid test, even if they do not have symptoms.  \nTwo other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant.\nThe other three cases are Scottish residents who flew to Aberdeen from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said.\nHolyrood said the three people tested positive while self-isolating. Other passengers who were on the same flight to Aberdeen are now being contacted and there is no reason to believe the variant is in circulation in Scotland, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said.  "

Not much escapism in that.\nIt's less of a surprise to anyone who's played The Last of Us Part 2.\nThe shock would have been if the game did not dominate the BAFTA nominations. \nIt's already won big at the 2020 Game awards and was crowned BBC Sounds podcast Press X to Continue's game of 2020. \nDespite controversies over its depiction of violence, divisive plot twists and character portrayals (dancing very carefully around spoilers here) the title had an overwhelmingly positive reaction from players and critics. \nThe praise for its storytelling, diverse cast and sheer jaw-dropping emotional moments have also clearly won the BAFTA nominations panel over.\nUsually a place where independent games thrive - this year the awards look like they could be dominated by PlayStation exclusives made by big studios.\nNot only does The Last of Us Part 2 have the most nominations for in history, but other PS only titles like Ghost of Tsushima (10), Spiderman: Miles Morales (7) and Dreams (6) have landed a hatful of nominations too.\nBafta has announced the show will be a 90-minute online live stream, hosted by presenter and journalist Elle Osili-Wood.\nSee the full list of nominees here.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Vaccination,Pfizer,Omicron variant,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."
