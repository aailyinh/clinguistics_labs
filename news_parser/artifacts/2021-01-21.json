      "title": "Covid-19 vaccines: Health minister accused of 'misleading' over claim",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,NHS Wales",
      "text": "The health minister has been accused of \"misleading\" people after claiming the majority of over 80s had been vaccinated against Covid-19.\nVaughan Gething said he understood most people in the age group had received their first dose of the vaccine.\nFigures show there have been 43,879 doses issued - 23.9% of the priority group.\nThe Welsh Conservatives accused him of misleading people, but Mr Gething said he had made an \"innocent mistake\".\nAccording to Public Health Wales figures, the total number of first dose vaccinations has reached 190,435 in Wales - 6% of the population.\nThe figures also show 86,717 front-line health workers have also been given a first dose.\nMore than half of care home residents and two thirds of care home workers have also had their first doses.\nIn a virtual session of the Senedd on Tuesday, Mr Gething appeared to contradict the figures, saying it was his \"understanding\" that the vaccine roll out had reached \"the majority\" of Wales' over 80s population.\nMr Gething also told the Welsh Parliament that he expected 70% of over 80s in Wales and 70% of care home residents and staff to receive their first jab by the end of this weekend.\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies accused Mr Gething of misleading the Senedd, saying: \"We need an urgent statement from the health minister clarifying the situation.\"\nMr Gething has since admitted making \"an innocent mistake\" and said: \"There was a minor amount of confusion about the difference between care home residents, where we had vaccinated a majority, and over 80s.\"\nHe said that vaccination for that cohort is a \"significant priority\" and he was still \"positive\" that the target to vaccinated 70 per cent by the end of the week can be achieved.\nHe added that over 70s would be contacted soon, \"I fully expect that every health board will be inviting people over 70 to come forward for their vaccination over the next week.\"\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said that Mr Gething's aim to have over 70% of over 80s would have the jab by the end of the week, would have been \"quite a task in three days\".\n\"The health minister should explain if he thinks we're still on track. Communication is key in building public trust,\" he added.\nIn total, 9,364 (56%) of care home residents and 20,087 (67.5%) of care home workers have been given a first dose.\nThe aim is for 70% of the over 80s and care home residents to be given a first dose of vaccine by 24 January.\nThere are another 30,388 people, not designated, who have been given first doses. These include social workers and some in the main priority groups, where the data is not quite ready to be included.\nHealth officials also say there is a time lag - which can be up to five days - between the day a person is vaccinated and when the recorded data is checked and finally published. \nThis week, more than 60,000 doses of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine and 90,000 of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines to hospitals and GP practices would be rolled out. \nAsked if he shared the same confidence as the health minister that they could meet the 70% target by the weekend, Wales' chief pharmaceutical officer said he expected the roll-out to increase further, particularly as GPs would be prioritising the over 80s and care home residents into the weekend.\nThese include GPs vaccinating into the evening and over the weekend, although it could again be a few more days before those doses finally show up on the officially published data.\n\"I'm very confident that the numbers will be reflected for the over 80s by the end of the week,\" said Andrew Evans.\n\"We know that GPs across Wales are very keen to get their hands on the vaccine and, as it has happened, supply hasn't been able to meet their demand so we're confident there's the capacity and the system.\"\n\"We're all very focused on making sure we offer as many people in those [priority] groups get the vaccine as quickly as possible.\"\nResponding to criticism that the Welsh Government was falling behind other nations in administering the vaccine, Mr Evans said that Wales was moving as quickly as possible.\nHe explained that there were challenges around transportation and storage of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine which has to be kept at ultra-low temperatures in specialist centres. \nMr Evans also said that plans for the Oxford AstaZenca vaccine were based on the allotted number that they received by Public Health England each week.\n\"We get an indication week of what allocation we're getting for next week for the AstraZenca of vaccine,\" he added.\n\"It doesn't have the same shelf-life problems that the Pfizer vaccine does, so it's not the case that every dose delivered gets delivered immediately, but we know that all the professionals who are involved in the programme are ensuring that as much vaccine as they get is used within a week of receiving it.\"\nMore people have now had the first dose of the vaccine than the number - 185,035 - who have tested positive for Covid-19.\nMeanwhile, weekly figures - up to Sunday - show the vaccine roll-out across different parts of Wales, by health board.\nThe rates of first doses to Welsh residents range from 4.4% of the population in north Wales to 5.8% in Powys.\nMr Evans said the amount of vaccine a health board might have at any one time reflected the capacity or number of appointments it might have booked for its vaccination centres. \n\"That's what explains some of the variation in uptake between areas in Wales,\" he added."

      "tags": "Personal finance,Housing market,Mortgages",
      "text": "Low-deposit mortgages have made a return as the market emerges from a Covid-related slowdown.\nMortgage products for homeowners with a deposit of 10% of their property's value have risen more than fourfold compared with last summer's low.\nThe increase, based on figures from financial information service Moneyfacts, could offer some relief to first-time buyers.\nBut the cost of mortgages will remain an issue for many.\nIn early September last year, there were only 44 mortgage products available for those able to offer a 10% deposit. At the same time, first-time buyers putting money aside for a deposit were faced with pressures of poor savings rates and rising house prices.\nThat choice has now risen to 197 products, according to the Moneyfacts figures, with some big lenders returning in recent weeks.\nMortgage products for those able to offer a 15% deposit have also risen sharply, although the choice was already much greater.\n\"First-time buyers who may have been concerned that with record low savings rates and increasing house prices, their homeownership dreams may have had to be shelved, may have been pleased to note that we are now seeing some providers return products for those with 10% deposits,\" said Eleanor Williams, from Moneyfacts.\nLenders had been grappling with the practical effects that the coronavirus pandemic brought to their business.\nWhile some new businesses targeted first-time buyers on social media, many traditional lenders withdrew products from the market.\nStaff shortages, and employees working from home, meant they were unable to process applications as fast as they had before the pandemic.\nThere were also concerns among lenders that, despite strong activity in the housing market, riskier - and younger - first-time buyers could find it difficult to make mortgage repayments during an economic slowdown caused by the pandemic.\nResearch has shown that younger workers are more at risk of redundancy.\nAaron Strutt, from mortgage broker Trinity Financial, said lenders were now working more efficiently despite staff still being at home.\nHe said that some of the biggest mortgage lenders had returned to the market. Some of the mortgage rates they were offering were not as attractive as they had been, but competition would help push down costs.\n\"If you are planning to purchase a property and have a 10% deposit the mortgage rates are not as cheap as they used to be, but they are getting better,\" he said. \nMany thousands of existing mortgage-holders who had struggled to make their repayments during the pandemic had taken payment \"holidays\", which are deferrals on payments.\nThe latest figures from UK Finance, which represents lenders, show that 130,000 mortgage payment holidays were in place at the end of December 2020, down from a peak of 1.8 million in June last year."

      "tags": "Glastonbury,Glastonbury Festival,Music",
      "text": "Glastonbury Festival has been cancelled for a second year running due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe news was announced on Thursday on the Worthy Farm event's Twitter page.\n\"With great regret, we must announce that this year's Glastonbury Festival will not take place,\" said festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis. \n\"And that this will be another enforced fallow year for us. Tickets for this year will roll over to next year. Michael & Emily.\"\nIt comes in the same week that the future of UK music was up for debate at a DCMS inquiry into streaming, and in Parliament regarding post-Brexit music touring visas.\nThe full statement on the festival website read: \"In spite of our efforts to move heaven and earth, it has become clear that we simply will not be able to make the Festival happen this year. We are so sorry to let you all down.\"\nIt confirmed that as with last year, anyone with a ticket will now be offered the opportunity to roll their \u00a350 deposit over to next year, when the festival will hopefully resume. It had been due to take place in June 2021.\n\"We are very appreciative of the faith and trust placed in us by those of you with deposits, and we are very confident we can deliver something really special for us all in 2022!\"\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden shared his \"disappointment\" at the lack of a Glastonbury 2021, on Twitter.\n\"This regrettable but understandable decision is recognition that public health comes first\" he posted, \"and that right now, getting 200k fans together in just a few months looks very difficult to make safe\".\nHe added: \"We continue to help the arts on recovery, including looking at problems around getting insurance. I'm Glastonbury will be back bigger and better next year.\"\nJulian Knight MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said news of this year's cancellation was \"devastating\". \n\"We have repeatedly called for ministers to act to protect our world-renowned festivals like this one with a government-backed insurance scheme. Our plea fell on deaf ears and now the chickens have come home to roost,\" he said.\n\"The jewel in the crown will be absent but surely the government cannot ignore the message any longer - it must act now to save this vibrant and vital festivals sector.\"\nOn 5 January the government responded to a report by UK Music called Let the Music Play: Save Our Summer 2021, which outlined a range of measures that could help the industry get back up and running.\nThe government said: \"We know these are challenging times for the live events sector and are working flat out to support it.\n\"Our \u00a31.57bn Culture Recovery Fund has already seen more than \u00a31bn offered to arts, heritage and performance organisations to support them through the impact of the pandemic, protecting tens of thousands of creative jobs across the UK, including festivals such as Deer Shed Festival, End of the Road and Nozstock.\"\nLast year's 50th anniversary Glastonbury was meant to be headlined by Sir Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar, but it was cancelled during the initial national lockdown in March 2020.\nLast month, organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC she hoped this year's festival could go ahead, despite the \"huge uncertainty\" surrounding live music in the pandemic.\n\"We're doing everything we can on our end to plan and prepare,\" she told the BBC, \"but I think we're still quite a long way from being able to say we're confident 2021 will go ahead.\"\nEavis said Glastonbury lost \"millions\" in 2020. Her father, Michael, has previously warned the festival \"would seriously go bankrupt\" if they had to cancel again next year.\nBut that scenario is unlikely \"as long as we can make a firm call either way in advance\", Eavis clarified to the BBC.\nNo line-up details had been confirmed for 2021. But just before Christmas, Sir Paul McCartney told the BBC the event was not in his calendar, as it would be a \"superspreader\".\nAt the start of January, MPs were told that some of the UK's biggest music festivals could be called off by the end of this month.\nEvents are \"rapidly approaching the determination point\", after which they'll have to pull the plug, said the Association of Independent Festivals.\nOrganisers will be in \"absolutely dire straits\" financially if the season is cancelled, added Anna Wade, of Winchester's Boomtown Fair.\nThey were speaking to MPs examining the plight of music festivals in the UK.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It will over-top in the next few hours. As a result we will be issuing a flood warning to homes.\n\"This will be through texted flood alerts to some people, and police officers, PCSOs, firefighters, and volunteers will be knocking on doors.\"\nHe said police will be supported by North West Ambulance, the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance.\n\"I think it's important to stress that if you are contacted and advised to evacuate then we would strongly urge you to do so,\" he added.\nWater levels in the area were expected to peak at about 23:00 GMT on Wednesday.\nA major incident has also been declared in Derbyshire, where authorities believe a small number of evacuations are \"likely\" on Thursday morning, when the River Derwent is expected to peak.\nCounty council leader Barry Lewis said it could rival levels seen in November 2019, depending on the weather overnight.\nSpeaking after a Cobra emergency meeting on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said work was under way to ensure transport and energy networks, and local council services, were prepared.\nHe added that work was also taking place to ensure the necessary numbers of sandbags were available.\n\"We want to make sure that we are totally prepared in every part of the UK for flooding, because it is coming on top of the stress people are already under fighting Covid,\" he said.\n\"We looked at particularly Manchester, we've got a situation potentially developing there,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"We are looking at a pattern of rainfall possibly not as bad at the end of this week, maybe worse next week.\"\nPeople in Greater Manchester have also been advised not to travel.\nStephen Rhodes, from Transport from Greater Manchester, said there was disruption across the network.\n\"Let's work together and not put our emergency services and the NHS - who are already working extremely hard due to the Covid-19 pandemic - under any more pressure,\" he said.\nIn Merseyside, the M57 has been closed in both directions between junction 6 and 7 due to flooding.\nElsewhere in England:\nThe Environment Agency has issued more than 100 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action required, while there are also more than 200 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible.\nThe North West, Yorkshire and the Midlands have been preparing for widespread flooding following the Met Office's amber weather warning for heavy rain until midday Thursday.\nThe Met Office said some isolated areas could see up to 200mm (7.8in).\nLabour's shadow floods minister Stephanie Peacock said urgent action was needed.\n\"Once again the government's response to inevitable flood events has been slow and uncoordinated,\" the Barnsley East MP said.\n\"We must ensure councils are supported to protect people, businesses, and local communities, and that all of the necessary precautions are also in place to protect those fighting the floods in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended until 5 March, the first and deputy first ministers have said.\nThe executive backed the health minister's proposal on Thursday and will review the move on 18 February.\nBut ministers were also told that restrictions may have to remain in place until after the Easter holidays.\nA lockdown closing non-essential retailers and encouraging employees to work from home began after Christmas.\nFamily gatherings are prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons.\nSchools are closed to most pupils until after February's half-term but a paper looking at reopening will be put to ministers at next week's executive meeting.\nThe lockdown came in response to a spike in the number of cases of coronavirus, which followed a relaxation of some rules in the run-up to Christmas.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said extending the restrictions was an \"appropriate and necessary response\" to tackle the \"imminent threat\" posed by Covid-19.\nShe said she understood it would be difficult for many people to accept, given the uncertainty facing families and businesses, but added: \"To not press forward would risk all of the hard-won gains.\"\nThe first and deputy first ministers were right to state just how tough this decision will be for many people.\nBut there's an acceptance among the public that restrictions would have to be extended, given how bad things are in our hospitals.\nTheir decision also suggests politicians have perhaps learned from the last wave of the pandemic, when restrictions were turned on and off sporadically, and the impact that had both on cases and the messaging. \nThey're not alone in sustaining tough lockdown measures, with other UK nations and the Republic of Ireland also keeping their restrictions in place for several more weeks.\nBeyond that, it is thought health officials also want to ensure the vaccination programme is also \"well advanced\" before any restrictions are relaxed.\nThe hope is that, by spring, the picture will have improved significantly. \nUntil then the price we are paying for relaxations before Christmas looks likely to keep rising.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised the executive was asking a lot of everybody but insisted the measures were important.\n\"We don't know what will come after [5 March],\" she said.\nMs O'Neill said there was a commitment not to keep restrictions in place longer than necessary but decisions would have to be taken in line with the health advice and concerns about a new variant of the virus which is more transmissible.\nThe executive's decision comes as another 21 deaths were recorded by the Department of Health on Thursday.\nThe reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R-number - had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations.\nBut the latest estimate from the Department of Health says it is sitting between 0.65 and 0.85 for cases within the community but is still above one for hospital admissions and intensive care.\nWhile some may wonder why are restrictions are being extended when the executive's policy has always been based on this rate of infection, the difference is that this time around there are three times as many people in Northern Ireland's hospitals than there were in last April's peak.\nDaily case numbers are still significantly higher too.\nWhile ministers have agreed to keep the current restrictions in place until March, Health Minister Robin Swann said it was possible they could be needed until Easter, which this year falls in the first week of April.\nIt is understood this plan is being discussed across the four UK nations but ministers will have to consider that in the review next month.\nMinisters were also warned that restrictions would be eased on a step-by-step basis in line with reducing pressures on the health service and ensuring the vaccination programme is \"well advanced\" before any relaxations are agreed.\nMrs Foster pleaded with people struggling with their mental health during the lockdown to \"please seek help\".\nMore than 100 medically-trained military personnel are to be deployed to help health staff deal with the pressure the latest phase of the pandemic is placing on hospitals.\nThe chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the \"sustained pressure on our health service\" would probably last for three to four weeks.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, 51 Covid-19 related deaths and 2,608 new cases of the virus were recorded on Thursday.\nSimon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said the extension of the lockdown would be of \"little surprise to most businesses\".\nThe Stormont executive has agreed how to allocate almost \u00a3300m to help businesses, education, tourism and transport during the next phase of the lockdown.\nA total of \u00a3100m is going towards the Local Restrictions Support Scheme, the grant for business premises forced to closed due to the restrictions.\nThere will also be \u00a316m for tourism and hospitality, two sectors which have largely been unable to operate.\nIn addition, two more support schemes for the sector have been opened.\nOne aimed at large tourism and hospitality businesses is offering a pot of \u00a326m, with the Department for Economy having identified 250 businesses that will be eligible.\nThe other is a \u00a34m scheme to support those who provide bed-and-breakfast accommodation.\nJanice Gault from the trade body the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the schemes were a \"real lifeline for the sector\".\n\"Trading over the last year has been limited with reserves now severely depleted and businesses operating in survival mode,\" she added.\nAlso among those to receive the extra cash will be limited company directors, who had not received support since March.\nLast week, a scheme was announced to give directors \u00a31,000 grants which one director described as a \"kick in the teeth\" given that he had little to no income for the past 10 months.\nBut that scheme is to be boosted with another \u00a320m so the payments on offer will more than treble to \u00a33,500.\nLocal newspapers will also benefit from 12 months of rates relief."

      "text": "The inauguration of President Joe Biden is a \"step forward\" for the United States, which has \"been through a bumpy period\", Boris Johnson has said. \nCongratulating Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the UK PM said it was a \"big moment\" for the UK and the US and their \"joint common agenda\". \nMr Johnson said he looked forward to working with the US on tackling climate change and the coronavirus pandemic.\nMaking his inaugural address, Mr Biden said \"democracy has prevailed\". \nHe promised to be a president \"for all Americans\" and said his \"whole soul is in putting America back together again\".\nOutgoing President Donald Trump, who has not formally conceded to Mr Biden, did not attend the ceremony.\nPresident Biden began work straight away on reversing a number of his predecessor's policies, including rejoining the Paris climate change agreement - gaining the praise of Mr Johnson.\nThe PM tweeted it was \"hugely positive news\", adding: \"I look forward to working with our US partners to do all we can to safeguard our planet.\" \nEarlier this week the former head of the civil service Lord Sedwill suggested Mr Johnson would be glad Mr Trump had not been re-elected for a second term as US president.\nWriting in the Daily Mail, Lord Sedwill said those who believed Boris Johnson would have preferred Mr Trump to win again were \"mistaken\".\nThe former cabinet secretary - who stepped down in September - said a second term for Mr Trump \"would not have been to the benefit of British or European security, to transatlantic trade, let alone the environmental agenda to which the prime minister is so committed\".\nMr Johnson's public stance toward the former president has varied over the years.\nIn 2015, when he was Mayor of London, Mr Johnson accused Mr Trump of \"stupefying ignorance\" over his comments about violence in the city.\nBut as foreign secretary, following Mr Trump's election as president, he said there was a \"lot to be positive about\", and in 2019, praised his \"many good qualities\".\nFor his part, Mr Trump has appeared largely supportive of Mr Johnson, backing his flagship Brexit policy and at one point saying of the British PM: \"They call him Britain Trump.\"\nAnd echoing his predecessor, in 2019 Mr Biden described the UK prime minister as a \"physical and emotional clone\" of Mr Trump.\nAfter winning the presidential election Mr Biden phoned Mr Johnson ahead of other European leaders and expressed his desire to strengthen the historic \"special relationship\" between the two countries.\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said it was the job of all UK prime ministers to have a \"good, close working relationship\" with US presidents but, right now, there were many things the two countries \"wanted to do together\". \n\"When you look at the issues which unite me and Joe Biden, the UK and the US right now, there is a fantastic joint common agenda,\" he said. \"For us and America, it is a big moment.\"\nHe said he hoped the UK could help the US commit to a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in the run up to the climate change conference COP 26, to be held in Glasgow this year.\nUK prime ministers like to consider American presidents as their best diplomatic friend.\nThat relationship, particularly when it comes to security and defence, is unusually close.\nWhen, as with Donald Trump, that friend has been unpredictable and unconventional, that has made for some very awkward political moments.\nSo for the government, this a really important and positive turning of the page.\nThe terribly over-used phrase the 'special relationship', which provokes neurotic behaviour on this side of the Atlantic, has meant the most when there has been a genuine personal chemistry between the two leaders - whether Thatcher and Reagan, or Bush and Blair.\nThere is nothing automatic about Mr Biden and Mr Johnson developing that kind of political friendship.\nBut in the words of one former senior minister, for the UK Biden means \"we will lose exclusivity but gain predictability: easier to work with, less cringeworthy and more dependable, but we may not be the only girlfriend on speed dial\".\nRead Laura's blog.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy described Mr Biden as \"a woke guy\".\nAsked if he agreed, Mr Johnson said: \"I can't comment on that. What I know is that he's a firm believer in the transatlantic alliance and that's a great thing.\"\nHe added that there was \"nothing wrong with being woke - I put myself in the category of people who believe that it's important to stick up for your history, your traditions and your values, the things you believe in.\"\nOpposition leader Sir Keir Starmer also sent his congratulations to the new president and vice-president.\n\"The US begins a new chapter in its history, one of hope, decency, compassion and strength,\" the Labour leader said, adding \"together, our two nations can build a better, more optimistic future for our world.\"\nAnd First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"Warm congratulations and best wishes to President Biden and Vice President Harris. \n\"Scotland and the USA share long-standing bonds of friendship and co-operation. We look forward to building on these in the years ahead.\" \nWriting in the Daily Mail, former UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Mr Biden's election presented the UK with a \"golden opportunity\" for Western democracies to reverse the trend towards \"absolutism\" - and a \"few strongmen facing off against each other\" - in global affairs.\nThe Queen sent a private message to Mr Biden before his inauguration, Buckingham Palace has said."

      "text": "Teachers are set to decide GCSE, AS and A-level grades in Wales after a system replacing end-of-year exams was axed.\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams said the pandemic had left her \"no choice\" in scrapping the classroom assessments.\nGrades determined by schools and colleges based on the work covered would be \"simple and clear\", she said.\nExams were cancelled in favour of assessments in November, but these were also ditched when schools were told to close until February half term.\nAdvice from the Design and Delivery Group of school and college leaders said grades should be based on \"evidence of learning\".\nThe approach is similar to the so-called 'Centre Assessed Grades' given to students in the summer of 2020 when the Covid-19 crisis affected end-of-year assessments.\nThe new measures include:\nMs Williams said in November that end-of-year exams would be cancelled because the varying impact of Covid-19 on different schools and pupils meant it was not possible to ensure a level playing field.\nA new system based on a mix of assessments was put in place, drawn up by an exams advisory group made up of school and college leaders.\nHowever, when it was announced schools and colleges would stay closed for most pupils until at least 29 January, and probably until after February half-term, the advisory group was asked to look again at how assessments should be carried out.\nMs Williams said: \"The worsening situation with the pandemic has meant we have no choice but to revisit our approach to ensure wellbeing and public confidence in our qualifications system.\n\"The proposals we are announcing today puts trust in teachers' and lecturers' knowledge of their learners' work, as well as their commitment to prioritise teaching and learning in the time available to support learners' progression.\"\nShe said they were working with universities to see how they can \"provide a bridge into courses\".\n\"Teaching the core content and aspects of each course remains my absolute priority for learners in exam years, so they are supported to progress with certainty into their next steps, with confidence in their grades\", she added.\nWJEC chief executive Ian Morgan, said that after an \"exceptional year\" there needs to be a different approach to assessment in 2021.\n\"Our teams will work at pace to develop a package of guidance for our teachers, including adapted past papers, mark schemes, and a range of support materials. We will also work with the Design and Delivery Advisory Group to develop a quality assurance process to support schools and college,\" he said.\nIn England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said grades would be decided by schools and colleges but pupils could be asked to sit mini-exams to help teachers with their assessments.\nCarys, an A-level student from Ysgol Bro Edern in Cardiff, said before the announcement she wished students had been given a clearer picture about what they would be facing.   \n\"It has been very confusing for us,\" she said.\n\"I feel like we're all asking the teachers what's happening, what's going on, and they're just as much as in the dark as we are.\"\nCarys said she and her friends had struggled to see how the external assessments would be different to their cancelled exams.  \n\"It is causing a large concern to us all and we're not quite sure what we're aiming towards,\" she said.\n \"I just want all our hard work to be credited.\"\nBetsy, a GCSE pupil also at Ysgol Bro Edern, said she felt the fairest way to grade pupils this year was to let teachers decide on grades. \n\"It has been very challenging,\" she said.\n\"I know many pupils who have been off school for weeks, or months even.\"\n\"I feel like the most fair way to do this is to just collect loads of coursework and trust the teachers to give us predicted grades,\" she said.\n\"They know the effort we've put in through the lockdown and through the online learning.\n\"I know that we will always be classed as the coronavirus year that didn't do exams.\n\"Universities hopefully will take that into consideration.\"\nThe NASUWT union, which represents some teachers in Wales, said \"the devil will be in the detail\" and full consultation with teachers is needed as there were concerns over fairness and staff workloads.\n\"How is this going to be achieved and what are the workload implications going to be on already hard pressed teachers?\" said Neil Butler of the NASUWT.\nUCAC, another teaching union, said it was \"the only realistic solution under the current circumstances\".\nBut their general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young added he would like to see external standardisation between schools.\nThe school leaders' union NAHT Cymru said they were pleased to get clarity - but are \"concerned about the proposed processes for appeals.\n\"The suggestion that initial appeals are made directly to the school or college is misguided in principle, and logistically unworkable,\" said director Laura Doel.\nExecutive members of the National Education Union Cymru said they were pleased to be moving to a system \"with more trust in teachers and lecturers\" and were keen there was \"no repeat of the position we all found ourselves in last summer\".\nThe director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, Eithne Hughes, said it was a \"pragmatic solution\" but more detail is needed regarding quality control.  \nThe announcement does not include vocational and technical qualifications, which are being considered separately.\nQualifications Wales said it would work with the awarding bodies offering Wales-only vocational qualifications \"to reflect these arrangements in those qualifications\".\nIt added it would \"continue to work with our fellow regulators to determine the arrangements for vocational and technical qualifications offered across the UK. Ofqual are currently consulting on proposals\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you on Friday morning.\nPeople attending house parties of more than 15 people in England will face fines of \u00a3800, Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced. The fines will double on repeat offences, rising to a maximum of \u00a36,400, she told a Downing Street briefing. \"The science is clear:\u00a0such irresponsible behaviour poses a significant risk to public health,\" Ms Patel said. The \u00a3800 penalty for attending illegal parties comes in addition to \u00a310,000 fines levied on the organisers. Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said 250 party organisers had been fined \u00a310,000 since August. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said it is \"too early to say\" when England's coronavirus restrictions might be eased. A decision on lifting lockdown will only be taken after mid-February, he said, when 15 million people in priority groups are expected to have had their first vaccine dose. Dr Marc Baguelin from Imperial College, who is part of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, warned that opening pubs and restaurants before May would be likely to cause \"another wave\" of cases. Meanwhile Northern Ireland's lockdown has been extended until 5 March, with ministers being told that restrictions may be necessary until after the Easter holidays. \nThe most common Covid-related crimes being prosecuted are assaults on emergency workers, prosecutors have said. Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, said many of these were police officers being \"coughed or spat on\" by suspected coronavirus rule-breakers. Assaults on emergency workers made up more than a quarter of the 6,500 coronavirus-related crimes prosecuted between April and September. Of these, 1,137 were charges for breaking coronavirus regulations, including a man who claimed the 15 people at his house party were all in his support bubble.\nWorthy Farm will have to wait another year to see the crowds return as the pandemic puts paid to the 2021 Glastonbury Festival. Organisers Michael and Emily Eavis had hoped to reopen the festival in June after cancelling last year, but said they were not able to make it happen \"in spite of our efforts to move heaven and earth\". Ticket holders from the October 2019 sale will be able to roll over their deposit to guarantee the chance to buy a ticket in 2022. A lesser known festival - the Dorset Knob Throwing and Frome Valley Food Festival - also announced it was cancelled. Celebrating traditional savoury biscuits known as knobs, events such as knob-and-spoon racing, splat the knob, knob darts, and pin the knob on the Cerne Abbas giant will have to wait until May 2022.\nOver the last few days, several cathedrals have opened as vaccination centres - now it is the turn of a mosque. The Al-Abbas Islamic Centre in Balsall Heath, Birmingham is the first Islamic place of worship to become a venue for the vaccine as it seeks to dispel misinformation and improve uptake among local South Asians. \"It will send a strong message to our Muslim brothers and sisters. We are doing this to say a big 'no' to fake news and a big 'yes' to the vaccine,\" said imam Sheikh Nuru Mohammed. \"Muslim scholars advise us to get the vaccine because the sanctity of life is important in Islam.\"\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said he hopes schools would reopen by Easter.

There were also 57 flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible.\nA yellow warning for ice was issued for the north and parts of mid Wales, starting at 01:00 on Thursday and lasting until 10:00, as rain clears.\nA minor landslip was reported on the mountainside above Pentre in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Natural Resources Wales, who have responsibility for the land, said there is no immediate threat after an initial inspection, but the council urged residents to keep away from the area.\nFlood warnings are in Carmarthenshire - the River Towy and isolated properties between Llandeilo and Abergwili, the River Gwendraeth Fawr at Pontyates and Ponthenry, the River Hydfron at Llanddowror and the River Taf at Trevaughan in Whitland.\nThe other flood warnings cover the River Ely at Peterston-Super-Ely in Vale of Glamorgan, the River Vyrnwy in the Meifod area in  Powys, the River Rhyd Hir at Riverside Terrace in Gwynedd, two for the River Wye at Glasbury and Builth Wells, the Lower Dee Valley from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadows, the River Dyfi at Pont ar Dyfi, the River Usk from Brecon to Glangrwyne, two at the River Severn at Abermule to Fron and Aberbechan and the River Lower Clydach at Clydach Bridge, Swansea.\nIn River Aeron at Aberaeron, in Ceredigion, the River Loughor at Ammanford and Llandybie and the River Wye at Builth Wells, Powys, are also covered by the warning.\nA person had to be saved from a car stuck in floodwater in Corwen, Denbighshire, North East Wales Search and Rescue tweeted.\nRest centres have been opened in St Asaph and Ruthin after some localised flooding following heavy rainfall throughout the day. Denbighshire council invited affected residents to use the facilities at the towns' main leisure centres.\nAnd Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said crews were called to help a motorist whose vehicle had become stuck in 3ft of water in Machynlleth.\nIn Broughton, Flintshire, Ray and Jacqui Littler said they and their daughter waited all afternoon for help at their flooded bungalow after emergency services told them they were \"flat out\".\nThey eventually decided to leave their home on Main Road, which was under 10 inches of water, to stay with friends.\nNeighbours blamed a blocked culvert on the fields opposite the road. Police closed the road at about 16:00 GMT and Flintshire council attended, after three houses were affected, with the gardens of two pensioners' bungalows also under water. \nSouth Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had been called to two incidents overnight with reports of water entering properties in Pontycymmer in Bridgend and Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent.\nOn Wednesday morning, it dealt with flooding at properties in Tyfica Road, Pontypridd, and Trebanog Road in Porth, Rhondda, where a crew was helping residents divert and pump out water.\nFirefighters also had to rescue 46 sheep from land surrounded by water at Merthyr Road, Llanfoist, Monmouthshire.\nCrews from Abergavenny and Ebbw Vale were called to help the stricken animals near the River Usk.\nIn Rhondda Cynon Taf, there were also reports of flooding in properties at Pembroke Street, Aberdare and Clydach Vale, Tonypandy.\nA tweet from Pontypridd Plaid Cymru councillor Heledd Fychan showed fast-flowing water in the River Taff which runs through the town.\nJudy Corbett, owner of 16th Century Gwydir Castle in Llanrwst, Conwy, which flooded last year, told BBC Radio Wales things were \"looking pretty dire here this morning\".\nShe said: \"We've been obviously monitoring the levels overnight so we've had another sleepless night worrying about the weather but the levels are rising and the water is very violent this morning and of course, we've got another a whole day ahead of us.\"\nThe Met Office warned spray and flooding could lead to \"difficult driving conditions and some road closures\" and the downpours could cause delays.\nTraffic Wales said restrictions were in place on the M48 Severn Bridge where traffic is coming off eastbound at junction two or westbound at junction one before being directed back on to cross the bridge, which remains open.\nIn Flintshire, the A548 Coast Road has been closed at Tan Lan and Mostyn, the A5118 at Padeswood, the A541 between Llong to Pontblyddyn, Bagillt High Street and the B5101 between Treuddyn and Llanfynydd.\nThe A485 in Garreg is also closed from the Brondaw Arms to Pont Aberglaslyn.\nIn Powys, the A487 over the Dyfi Bridge, near Machynlleth, is closed while the A458 at Llanfair Caereinion is blocked in both directions from Bridge Street to Guilsfield turn-off because of flooding.\nThe A483 in Builth Wells at the station is also closed along with the bridge over the River Wye.\nCapel Bangor in Ceredigion has temporary traffic lights on the A44 at Lovesgrove Roundabout due to flooding, which is affecting traffic between Aberystwyth and Llangurig.\nIn Bridgend, New Inn Road has been closed in both directions at The Dipping Bridge, affecting traffic between Ewenny village and the A48.\nSouth Wales Police warned people not to attempt driving through floodwater after the A4118 at Llanddewi on Gower became blocked.\nIn Gwynedd, the council tweeted that Ffordd Siliwen, Bangor, had been closed following a landslip.\nA section of the A470 Dolgellau Bypass has also been closed along with the A4085 at Garreg.\nNational Rail said some lines between North Llanrwst, Conwy, and Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd were blocked due to heavy rain while services were also disrupted between Shrewsbury and Machynlleth in Powys. \nAlterative road transport will run in place of cancelled services, it said. \nThe Met Office said 56mm (2.2in) of rain had fallen at Capel Curig in Snowdonia by 18:00 GMT on Tuesday.\nForecasters also said fast flowing and deep floodwater \"could cause a danger to life\".\nThe Met Office warned flooding could lead to some communities being cut off and possible power cuts.\nStrong winds will also follow the torrential rain, with forecasters predicting this may cause \"travelling difficulties across areas higher and more exposed routes\"."

      "text": "Northern Ireland Executive ministers have agreed to lift more Covid-19 public health restrictions this week, allowing theatre and concert venues to reopen.\nThe rules on live music and the number of people who are allowed to meet in a private home are also being eased.\nMinisters have been gradually lifting restrictions in the past few months, following the strict lockdown they imposed across Northern Ireland after Christmas 2020.\nHowever, a recent surge in infection rates and the resulting pressure on hospital admissions mean some restriction remain in place for now. \nBBC News NI explains the latest rules on socialising, travel, face coverings and other areas.\nYes. On Monday, ministers agreed that a total of 10 people from three households would now be allowed to meet inside a home.\nChildren under 12 do not count towards the total.\nPreviously, the limit was six people from two households (or 10 people if one household was bigger than six people).\nOvernight stays have been allowed for some time.\nYes, and the numbers allowed to enter have been gradually increasing. \nFrom Monday 26 July, a maximum of 15 people from an unlimited number of households are able to meet in a private garden.\nAgain, children aged 12 and under do not count towards this limit. \nYes, you can.\nA traffic light system for international travel came into force on 24 May, with a limited number of countries on the green list meaning people arriving in Northern Ireland from those areas were exempt from quarantine.\nWith the expanded vaccination rollout, more significant changes took effect on 19 July.\nNew rules came into force on that date which meant travellers arriving in Northern Ireland from amber countries (except France) were able to avoid quarantine if they had received both their Covid-19 vaccines in the UK. \nThese passengers still need to produce evidence of a negative Covid-19 test before departure and take a PCR test on day two after arrival.\nThere are exemptions for some including children under 18, those medically advised against vaccination and clinical trial participants.\nOn Thursday 29 July, the NI Executive announced that people who have been fully vaccinated in the EU (except France) or the US will not need to isolate when coming to Northern Ireland. \nThe move, from Monday 2 August, brings Northern Ireland in line with England, Scotland and Wales.\nThere are also no limits on travel to other parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland, known as the Common Travel Area (CTA).\nOn 24 May, the Northern Ireland Executive lifted its guidance on self-isolating after travelling to another part of the CTA.\nTesting is still advised after arriving back in Northern Ireland from another part of the CTA but it is guidance only.\nYes, live music resumed from 5 July with a number of restrictions, but these rules are in the process of being eased.\nStormont ministers have now agreed that concert venues and theatres can reopen from 18:00 BST on Tuesday 27 July.\nBut the venues must sell tickets in advance of performance, they must have allocated seating and ensure social distancing of at least 1m (3ft).\nVolume restrictions on live indoor music which were in force from 5- 26 July have now been lifted.  \nHowever, dancing is not permitted and this restriction is not due to be reconsidered by ministers before 12 August.\nNightclubs in Northern Ireland remain closed at present. \nAlthough Prime Minister Boris Johnson removed the legal requirement to use face coverings in England from 19 July, that change did not apply in Northern Ireland.\nMasks have been mandatory on public transport in Northern Ireland since July 2020 and in shops since August 2020, with a limited number of exemptions.\nBut from 26 July, people attending indoor religious services in Northern Ireland will no longer have to wear a face covering during the service.\nHowever, it is still be a legal requirement to wear face masks when entering and exiting the building, and guidance will recommend that worshipers keep their masks on during services. \nFace coverings remain compulsory in other settings, including:\nIt's a more complicated picture.\nThe executive says from 26 July, where it's still the law to socially distance - such as restaurants and workplaces - the limit will be reduced to 1m for indoors activities.\nThe 1m rule was then extended to include retail and shopping centres.\nIt will be removed for all outdoor activities from law but guidance will be that social distancing is recommended at 1m (3ft) where possible.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan recently said more significant changes were coming and that he hoped the executive could agree on 12 August to put in place a date to end social distancing in law.\nThat meeting could also see ministers discuss lifting the remaining restrictions on hospitality, such as the numbers of people allowed to sit at a table together.\nThese ceremonies have been continuing with restrictions through the latest lockdown, but from 24 May, post-wedding and civil partnership receptions were allowed to resume.\nHowever, mitigations remain in place including:\nFrom 26 July, normal services resumed at MoT centres.\nDuring MoT examinations, a vehicle can be shared by the driver and the examiner for five minutes if both wear a mask. \nCustomers will be permitted to be seated safely for eight minutes and must remaining socially-distanced and wear a mask.\nThe executive said that was to allow customers to be present in testing halls and take their vehicle through the process with examiners.\nOn the same date - 26 July - other close-contact services such as hair and beauty salons do not need clients to book ahead for appointments first and overlapping appointments will also be allowed.\nQuite possibly, but do not expect Northern Ireland's rules to directly match the timeline in other parts of the UK.\nThe Northern Ireland Executive can change the restrictions regularly in line with new public health advice and said it is conscious of the pace of change in other jurisdictions.\nIt has said its decisions have been taken in a \"local context\".\nThe executive's planned meeting on 12 August will look at the requirements for face coverings and self-isolation as well as its guidance around working from home and relaxing restrictions on meeting at home.\nThat day could see ministers agree a date to end some of the measures that have dominated lives and livelihoods since last March.\nBut as ever, putting that in place requires support from the executive's five parties.\nAchieving political consensus on how and when to end restrictions remains challenging to navigate."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,James Gallagher,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is one of two being rolled out across the UK. \nThe government aims to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February and has got off to a strong start, with more than four million jabs administered.\nThe vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus.\nIt is a new type of jab called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack.\nThe genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells. \nThe exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective. \nThis is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans. \nThe concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases.\nThe vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use.   \nNHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, and the over 80s are first in line to receive the two vaccines being rolled out in the UK - Pfizer and Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab. \nAbout half of over-80s in the UK have now been vaccinated. \nPeople in England in their 70s, and those listed as clinically extremely vulnerable, are now beginning to receiving their offers of a jab.\nOut of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list. \nThere will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population.\nThe vaccine was initially delivered in hospitals. It is now also being administered through GPs and care homes, as well as local vaccination centres in venues such as sports halls and mass vaccination hubs in places like cathedrals and sports halls. \nHowever, there are logistical challenges for the Pfizer vaccine:\nIt is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting. \nIf immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu.\nThe vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggests it works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities.\nEarly evidence suggests the Pfizer vaccine is likely to protect against a coronavirus variant that is spreading around the UK.\nSome people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine. \nNothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks. \nThe data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported.  \nIf there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent.\nHowever, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised.\nHopefully yes, but not for some time.\nIf enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures.  \nHowever, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time.\nSo testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet. \nThe vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property. \nThey already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of this year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further.\nWe do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups. \nThese will be crucial for understanding how it will be used.\nAbout a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab is also being used in the UK, and supplies of the approved Moderna vaccine should arrive in the spring."

      "title": "Covid: 'Too early' to say if lockdown will end in spring - Boris Johnson",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It is \"too early\" to say whether England's Covid restrictions will be able to end in the spring, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nOnce the four priority groups have been vaccinated, by mid-February, \"we'll look then at how we're doing,\" he said.\nNearly two million people in the UK have had their first dose of vaccine in the past week, government figures show.\nScientist Marc Baguelin, who advises the government, has said restaurants and bars should not reopen before May. \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson has said he \"certainly hopes\" schools in England can fully reopen before Easter, while Downing Street refused to be drawn on whether this would happen by then.\nA further 1,290 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test and there have been another 37,892 cases, according to the latest government figures. \nAnd almost five million people in the UK have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\nSpeaking after a study suggested infections might have increased at the start of the latest lockdown in England, Mr Johnson said it was \"absolutely crucial\" that people observed the restrictions. \nReferring to figures from the Imperial College London survey, he said they showed the new variant of the virus was \"not more deadly but it is much more contagious and the numbers are very great\". \nFigures published by Public Health England show cases - meaning people who come forward to get tested while they are infected - have fallen across England since early January.\nWith the two sets of figures pointing in different directions, it will be some time before it is known for sure how long it will take for lockdown to relieve the pressure on hospitals. \nDr Baguelin, from Imperial College, who sits on a sub-group of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the premature opening of the hospitality sector would lead to a \"bump\" in Covid-19 cases.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme even a partial reopening would generate \"an increase in the R number\". An R number above one means the epidemic is growing.\n\"Something of this scale, if it was to happen earlier than May, would generate a bump in transmission, which is already really bad,\" he said.\n\"So you have a lot of pressure on hospitals, you will have another wave of some extent. At best you will keep on having very, very unsustainable level of pressure on the NHS.\" \nNHS England figures show one in 10 major hospital trusts had no spare adult critical care beds last week.\nThis is a debate that is going to start to dominate public discourse.\nWith the vaccination programme under way, there is huge clamour to know what will happen once the most vulnerable are vaccinated, by mid-February.\nThe problem is there are still so many unknowns.\nFirstly, it is hard to predict by how much lockdown will have reduced infection levels, considering there is a new faster-spreading variant to deal with.\nThe level of uptake will also be crucial. Surveys suggest as many as one in five may not have the vaccine - although the older, more vulnerable groups tend to be the most willing to be vaccinated.\nAnd the fact that no vaccine is 100% effective means come February there could still be significant numbers of very vulnerable people who are not protected.\nAnother factor is whether the vaccine stops transmissions - so-called sterilising vaccination.\nTrials have shown the vaccines are good at stopping symptoms developing. But that does not mean someone who has received a jab will not pass on the virus.\nIf it does not, that, of course, has implications on how many control measures have to be kept in place. It will take us at least until spring to know the answer to this.\nAt this stage, it seems hard to see much beyond the possible reopening of schools come March.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was an \"impossible question\" to ask how long the lockdown would need to last. \nUnder the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons.\nThis includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn Northern Ireland, coronavirus lockdown restrictions will be extended until 5 March, BBC News understands.\nIn Scotland, lockdown has been extended until at least the middle of February, with most school pupils to continue learning from home.\nAnd in Wales health minister Vaughan Gething has said no \"significant easing\" of Wales' Covid restrictions should be expected when the current guidelines are reviewed this month.\nSir Keir added that the coronavirus vaccines were \"really good news\" but \"should not mask the fact that we have still got a very serious problem\".\nThe government is aiming to offer a vaccine to all over-70s, the extremely clinical vulnerable and health and care workers by mid-February.\nSixty-five new vaccination centres are opening in England, including a mosque in Birmingham and a cinema in Aylesbury.\nIn other developments: "

      "text": "Four royal aides say they do not wish to \"take sides\" over a letter from the Duchess of Sussex to her father, the High Court has been told. \nIn a letter lawyers for the four said they believed their clients could \"shed some light\" on the letter's drafting but the four were \"strictly neutral\".\nMeghan is suing the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online publisher over articles that reproduced parts of the letter.\nShe claims her privacy and copyright were breached by the newspaper group.\nHer lawyers are asking for summary judgement - a dismissal of Associated Newspapers' (ANL) defence instead of a trial.\nThe five articles, published in February 2019, were a \"triple-barrelled invasion\" of the duchess's privacy, correspondence and family, the lawyers claim. \nShe is seeking damages from the newspaper group for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act over the articles.\nANL claims Meghan wrote her letter \"with a view to it being disclosed publicly at some future point\" in order to \"defend her against charges of being an uncaring or unloving daughter\", which she denies.\nOn the second day of the hearing on Wednesday, ANL's barrister Antony White QC told the court that a letter from the so-called \"palace four\" showed that \"further oral evidence and documentary evidence is likely to be available at trial which would shed light on certain key factual issues in this case\".\nHe said it was \"likely\" there was also further evidence about whether Meghan \"directly or indirectly provided private information\" to the authors of an unauthorised biography of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Finding Freedom.\nThe four aides are: Jason Knauf, former communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Christian Jones, their former deputy communications secretary, Samantha Cohen, formerly the Sussexes' private secretary, and Sara Latham, their ex-director of communications.\n\"None of our clients welcomes his or her potential involvement in this litigation, which has arisen purely as a result of the performance of his or her duties in their respective jobs at the material time,\" their lawyers said in a letter sent on their behalf.\n\"Nor does any of our clients wish to take sides in the dispute between your respective clients. Our clients are all strictly neutral.\n\"They have no interest in assisting either party to the proceedings. Their only interest is in ensuring a level playing field, insofar as any evidence they may be able to give is concerned.\"\nTheir letter said that their lawyers' \"preliminary view is that one or more of our clients would be in a position to shed some light\" on \"the creation of the letter and the electronic draft\".\nIt also said they may be able to shed light on \"whether or not the claimant anticipated that the letter might come into in the public domain\" and whether or not the duchess \"directly or indirectly provided private information, generally and in relation to the letter specifically, to the authors of Finding Freedom\".\nBut Justin Rushbrooke QC, representing the duchess, said the letter from the four \"contains no information at all that supports the defendant's case on alleged co-authorship (of Meghan's letter), and no indication that evidence will be forthcoming that will support the defendant's case should the matter proceed to trial\".\nMeghan, 39, sent a handwritten letter to her father in August 2018, following her marriage to Prince Harry in May that year, which Mr Markle did not attend. The couple are now living in the US with their son Archie. \nThe full trial of the duchess's claim had been due to be heard at the High Court this month, but last year the case was adjourned until autumn 2021.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Justice Warby reserved his judgement, which he said he would deliver \"as soon as possible\"."

I will always fight for you. I will be watching. I will be listening.\n\"I wish the new administration great luck and great success. I think they will have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular.\"\nBut, as with his farewell video address on Tuesday, he did not mention Mr Biden by name.\nMr Trump added: \"Goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form. Have a good life. We will see you soon.\"\nHe also paid tribute to his Vice-President Mike Pence, who was not at Andrews, having chosen instead to attend the inauguration ceremony.\nMr Trump will be the first president not to attend his successor's inauguration since Andrew Johnson snubbed Ulysses S Grant in 1869.\nHe flew off to begin post-presidential life at his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Palm Beach.\nIn his last hours, Mr Trump granted clemency to more than 140 people, including his former adviser Steve Bannon, who was facing fraud charges.\nIn a farewell video message on Tuesday, Mr Trump called on Americans to pray for the incoming administration. He said he was proud of what he had achieved over the past four years.\nMr Trump has been relatively quiet since his supporters attacked Congress on 6 January, and his Twitter account was suspended.\nHe has never congratulated Joe Biden on victory and had always disputed the result of the presidential election, citing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.\nBut White House spokesman Judd Deere told AFP that Mr Trump had left a traditional letter for Mr Biden."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government,Housing market,Estate agents,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "House hunters are taking advantage of lockdown rules to travel hundreds of miles to view homes, estate agents say.\nIn-person viewings are allowed in England, but estate agents have raised concerns about their safety and say some buyers are travelling across the country to look at second homes.\nFirms have said they are also currently facing increased demand before the stamp duty holiday ends on 31 March.\nThe government said the housing market is \"a key part of our economy\".\nIt has said the housing market in England will remain open during the national lockdown - but advises that initial viewings should be done virtually \"wherever possible\". \nBut firms say many buyers don't want virtual appointments. And many companies report increased demand as buyers rush to beat the end of the stamp duty holiday - applied on the first \u00a3500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland.\nOne estate agent who works in Yorkshire, who asked not to be named, said she knows colleagues who are \"ready for a complete nervous breakdown\" because they are being asked to book more in-person viewings and valuations.\nShe said people are travelling hundreds of miles to view properties \"because they can\" and some often \"don't social distance\" when they get there. She said many virtual slots go unused because \"people want physical viewings\".\n\"I was in one the other day and there's a three-year-old that comes and sits next to me\u2026 bringing me a doll. How can you say 'back off?' You can't,\" she said.\n\"I just think it's bonkers. I want to earn money, I want to earn commission, but not under these circumstances,\" she added.\nPaul Le Bas, regional director of a family-run estate agency in Hayle, Cornwall, said he would like the government to ask people not to travel to estate agents outside their local areas for non-essential purposes.\nHe said he turned down one person who wanted to travel about 400 miles from Bradford to look at a potential second home.\n\"We've taken the view as an agency that if it's just for a second home we don't deem that as essential travel, you can do that when lockdown's been lifted,\" he added. \"We weren't prepared to put ourselves at risk or our clients at risk. They got a bit shirty with us.\"\nRoly Matthews, director of an independent agency in Elmbridge, Surrey, said most of his clients want in-person viewings and estate agents have had to \"feel their way a bit as to what they think is essential or not\".\nHe knows some agencies are not screening their clients, giving members of the public \"a mixed signal\" and said the government would be \"sensible\" to consider further restrictions.\nMark Hayward, chief policy advisor at NAEA (National Agency of Estate Agents) Propertymark, said estate agents are under additional pressure to complete deals with the stamp duty deadline approaching.\n\"We've seen levels of sales on a monthly basis not seen since 2004,\" he said. \"We know the volume of sales that has to go through to qualify for that stamp duty holiday is large.\"\nHe urged estate agents to follow NAEA guidelines for house viewings, such as sanitising surfaces and limiting time in the property. The organisation also recommends people seeking to view property \"must be in a position to proceed\".\n\"In other words, they've either got cash or they've sold their own property so they're not having to go and put the house on the market and create huge delays.\"\nLast week, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer referred to house viewings when he raised concerns that England's lockdown may not be tough enough.\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the housing market has been allowed to remain open as it creates \"jobs as well as homes\". \n\"But all parties involved must continue to play their part in reducing the spread of the virus, by following our guidance to be Covid secure,\" a spokesman said.\nA petition calling for the stamp duty holiday to be extended by six months has gained over 115,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for debate in Parliament."

Because, although we had a vaccine then, the arrangements for delivering it were very much less clear and much more protracted than it has been this time. \n\"The arrangements for the GPs to deliver, and now pharmacists to deliver, all of that is a tremendous improvement on what I saw at the last pandemic.\" \nIn September, Dame Deirdre accused successive governments across the UK of taking \"their eye off the ball\" and failing to prepare for a global pandemic.\nShe also correctly warned of the \"real danger\" of a damaging second wave of Covid and has remained critical of failures to get adequate testing and tracing capability up and running in the early stages of the pandemic.  \nShe added: \"I would say the testing and tracing is another matter, and I think there has been justifiable criticism of that.\"\nDame Deirdre, who lives in Cardiff, said she was still \"waiting impatiently\" for her vaccine appointment, but called on people to see the bigger picture. \n\"Let's get it in perspective. This is a massive logistical exercise, together with a narrow pipeline of supply of the vaccine, and so I'm not a bit surprised that it's taking as long as it is to get round to everybody. But I have every confidence that they will.\" \nThe Welsh Government, along with other UK nations, has committed to vaccinating all four of the highest priority groups by the middle of February, including the over-80s.\nLatest figures on vaccination in Wales show that, as of 20 January, there had been 175,816 people to get a first dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThis accounts for 5.6% of the population in Wales, while 7.1% have received a vaccination in England, 7.3% in Northern Ireland, and 5.7% in Scotland.\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething has denied Covid-19 vaccines were being held back, following comments from First Minister Mark Drakeford that the supply had to last until February to prevent \"vaccinators standing around with nothing to do\".\nMr Drakeford later said on social media that \"nobody is holding back vaccines\" and Mr Gething added: \"We're rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as possible.\"\nDame Deirdre said she believed the targets were achievable, but people's anxieties were \"understandable\".\nShe added: \"Some recent research by Imperial College shows that people in my age group, people over 70, are the people most worried about this pandemic and about their own safety. \n\"So it's not surprising that people are worried and concerned, dismayed, when they don't get the letter and then that turns to anger. But I would say to them, let's keep it in proportion, let's look at the perspective.\n\"If you'd asked me last May and June whether we would even have a vaccine, I would have been highly sceptical. \n\"Then once you've got the vaccine, there is the whole logistical exercise of the publicity, letting people know what's likely to happen, getting the personnel assembled to do that, getting the premises.\n\"And it's not easy, it's not easy to do all that very, very quickly.\""

      "text": "Unilever has said that by 2030 it will refuse to do business with any firm that does not pay at least a living wage or income to its staff.\nThe consumer goods giant defined a living wage as one that covered a family's basic needs \"and helped them break the cycle of poverty\".\nIt said it wanted to raise wages for people outside its own workforce in order to promote economic inclusion.\nUnilever is one of the first big companies to make such a commitment.\nOxfam called the move a \"step in the right direction\".\nUnilever, whose products include Marmite, Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Dove soap, said it was committed to helping to build \"a more equitable and inclusive society\".\n\"Our ambition is to improve living standards for low-paid workers worldwide,\" it said.\n\"We will therefore ensure that everyone who directly provides goods and services to Unilever earns at least a living wage or income, by 2030.\"\nThe wage should be enough to cover food, water, housing, education, healthcare, transport and clothing, and also include a provision for unexpected events, Unilever said.\nThe firm said it was working with partners to establish exact rates of pay in the 190 countries where it operates. \nHowever, Unilever's chief human resources officer Leena Nair said it would pay twice as much as the minimum wage in some countries. \nUnilever said it already paid its own employees at least a living wage, but it wanted to secure the same for more people beyond its workforce, specifically focusing on the most vulnerable workers in manufacturing and agriculture.\nWhile there is no doubting Unilever's desire to improve the lot of those who make its products, there is also a commercial reason for its living wage initiative.\nIt wants all of its suppliers to pay their staff a decent wage by 2030, a plan that has the potential, given Unilever's enormous size and global reach, to change the lives of millions of people.\nBut the company also believes the move will give it an advantage in the fierce battle to attract buyers.\nAlan Jope, Unilever's Scottish-born chief executive, says customers want to buy products with good credentials, and that this desire has only increased during the pandemic.\nMr Jope's comments suggest that the next consumer battlegrounds might not be price, convenience or range of product, but environmental and social considerations.\nUnilever wants to get ahead of that trend, and plans to do well by doing good.\n\"We will work with our suppliers, other businesses, governments and NGOs - through purchasing practices, collaboration and advocacy - to create systemic change and global adoption of living wage practices,\" it added.\nIt has more than 60,000 direct suppliers worldwide, from smallholder farmers to major companies.\nAll of them will be covered by its commitment, it said, with millions of people set to benefit.\nUnilever already audits its suppliers over climate change commitments, and will use these existing arrangements to make sure workers are being paid a living wage.\nSuppliers not willing to sign up may lose their contracts with the firm, Ms Nair said.\nAlso by 2030, Unilever said, it would equip 10 million young people with essential job skills.\nAdditionally, it committed to spending \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.8bn) with suppliers owned and managed by people from under-represented groups by 2025 in an effort to improve diversity.\n\"The two biggest threats that the world currently faces are climate change and social inequality,\" said Unilever chief executive Alan Jope.\n\"The past year has undoubtedly widened the social divide, and decisive and collective action is needed to build a society that helps to improve livelihoods, embraces diversity, nurtures talent, and offers opportunities for everyone.\"\nHe told the BBC's Today programme that Unilever wanted to be a \"positive force in the world in tackling this persistent and worsening issue of social inequality.\"\n\"Without healthy societies, we don't have a healthy business,\" he said.\nThe move is the latest in a series of ethical initiatives by Unilever, including promoting vegan food products and experimenting with a four-day working week.\nGabriela Bucher, executive director at Oxfam International, welcomed Unilever's announcement, calling it \"an important step in the right direction\".\nShe said: \"Unilever's plan shows the kind of responsible action needed from the private sector that can have a great impact on tackling inequality and help to build a world in which everyone has the power to thrive, not just survive.\"\nLaura Gardiner, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said commitments such as Unilever's show how some employers \"are leading the way in spreading the living wage through both their business networks, and across their global operations\".\nUnilever's living wage move is unusual among big firms.\nFood services giants Sodexo and Compass Group, which are on the Living Wage Foundation's list of recognised service providers, have made similar supply chain commitments in the UK."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned there will be \"tough weeks to come\" as the UK reported another all-time high of daily coronavirus deaths. \nA further 1,820 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to government figures.\nIt means the total number of deaths by that measure is now 93,290.\nMr Johnson said there was now a \"race against time\" to vaccinate the vulnerable but he hoped there would be a \"real difference\" by spring.  \nIn an interview with broadcasters, he said the high number of deaths was \"appalling\" and a reflection of the peak infection rates seen a couple of weeks ago. \nHe said: \"I must warn people there will be tough weeks to come, but as the vaccine goes in and that programme accelerates, there will be, I think, a real difference by spring.\"\nJust under half of the newly reported deaths occurred on Tuesday, while a further quarter took place on Monday or Sunday with the remainder last week or even earlier.\nThe previous highest number of daily deaths was the 1,610 reported on Tuesday. \nSome 4,609,740 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine - a rise of 343,163 from yesterday.\nThere were also a further 38,905 cases, with 3,887 more patients admitted into hospital. \nIt is the second consecutive day deaths have hit a new high. \nThat, sadly, was to be expected as it is a reflection of the surge in cases seen during December.\nIt takes a week or two from the point of infection for someone to become seriously ill - and they can then spend some time in hospital. The high number is also a result of delays reporting deaths - a quarter happened last week or even before.\nBut make no mistake the death toll is going up. If you look at the average over the course of a week, the numbers being reported at the moment are twice what they were just two weeks ago.\nHowever, we also know they should soon start coming down. Daily infections are falling, with signs lockdown is taking effect. For four days in a row new diagnoses have been below 40,000 - after averaging 60,000 at the start of year.\nIt could be another week or so before we start to see the impact of that in the death figures. The hope then would be that within a few weeks we could start seeing a more rapid fall as the impact of the vaccination programme begins to bite.\nBut before that happens the daily totals reported could, sadly, go even higher.\nNew coronavirus cases are down by 21.5% over the last seven days. But the number of patients being admitted into hospital in the same period has not yet fallen (up by 0.5%).\nThe prime minister said it looked as though infection rates across the country overall might now be peaking or flattening, but he cautioned that \"they're not flattening very fast\". \nAsked if daily deaths would continue to rise, he said it was \"difficult to predict\". \nHe added: \"We must hope that by getting the numbers of daily infections down in the way that perhaps has been happening since the lockdown that will feed through into a reduction in deaths as well. \n\"But I must stress that we have tough weeks to come now as we roll out the vaccine. \n\"The light will only really begin to dawn as we get those vaccination numbers up.\"\nEarlier, the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told Sky News: \"This is very, very bad at the moment, with enormous pressure, and in some cases it looks like a war zone in terms of the things that people are having to deal with.\"\nHe said there was \"light at the end of the tunnel\" in the form of the vaccination programme.\nBut he said vaccines were \"not going to do the heavy lifting for us at the moment, anywhere near it\".\nMilitary personnel are going to be deployed to a number of hospitals to help staff cope with high numbers of cases, including in Northern Ireland and Exeter. \nAnd this week 10 hospital trusts across England consistently reported having no spare adult critical care beds.\nIn other developments, Home Secretary Priti Patel said ministers were working to ensure police and other frontline workers were moved up the priority list for the Covid vaccine.\nMr Johnson said the government must rely on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, but wanted front-line workers to be immunised \"as soon as possible\".\nHe also said the vaccination programme remained \"on track\" despite \"constraints on supply\"."

      "text": "A housebound 84-year-old woman said she was told she may have to wait up to two months to have her coronavirus vaccine if she could not get to her GP surgery.\nStuart Wilson said his mother Julia was immobile and she required two people with a hoist to get her up. \nHe said her surgery in Sketty, Swansea, called on Tuesday offering a jab but they were told it would take time to arrange a house visit.\nWelsh Government said a mobile service could take a jab to the housebound.\nDr Chris Johns, from Sketty Medical Centre, said: \"I can give assurances that no housebound patient is being asked to wait this long for their vaccination.\n\"This is a massive undertaking by GPs and we would ask older patients, if they are mobile, to attend one of our vaccination clinics instead.\"\nHe said teams have already made close to 200 house calls to vaccinate those unable to come to the surgery and over the next few weeks GPs would continue to go to patients' homes \"where necessary\".\nMore than 175,000 vaccines have been administered across Wales so far.\nUnder Welsh Government plans, the goal is for everyone over the age of 70 to be offered a vaccination by mid-February.\n\"I'm appalled,\" said Mr Wilson. \"It's completely immoral.\"\nMr Wilson said the call left his mother \"concerned and distressed\" so with her permission he spoke to the GP surgery himself.\nShe has been with the surgery, which is the Sketty branch of Sketty and Killay Surgeries, for about five years, and they are familiar with her condition as she receives home visits for flu jabs.\n\"What I can't understand is how they can invite somebody for a vaccination and then turn around and say because you're housebound, they can't give it yet,\" he added. \n\"I'm not asking for preferential treatment; we're not asking to be bumped up the list. I was disgusted by the total lack of information.\"\nMr Wilson said he knew of three other cases where patients have been given the same information.\nHe said disabled people should receive equal treatment. He has also taken the issue up with the disability rights association, Disability Wales, who have been asked to comment.\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said: \"Those who cannot attend their appointment or cannot travel to the vaccination venue can let your health board know through the NHS booking system. They will then be offered another appointment on another day or at a more convenient location.\n\"There are also plans in place for people who are housebound and for care homes, which will mean the vaccine can be safely taken to them using a mobile service if they are unable to attend a GP surgery or mass vaccination centre.\"\nMeanwhile, the Welsh Government has been criticised over the speed of rolling out vaccines to the over 80s age group.\nSteve Hockridge's 92-year-old mother Sheila suffers from Alzheimer's disease and lives alone in Cardiff.\nHe contacted her surgery but was told they had \"no information\" about when she would receive a vaccine.\n\"My confidence in the Welsh Government has been knocked,\" he said. \n\"After all the clarity during this pandemic, with this area they seem to be very, very secretive, giving different messages [which are] quite often conflicting.\"\nIn Wrexham, Helen Field said her mother, Eileen, 94, was also still waiting to hear about her vaccine.\n\"Our relations over the border in the Wirral area who are in a similar age group of over 80s and 90s have all received their second vaccine,\" she said.\n\"The difference is quite alarming and I just want to know what's going on in Wales and why they are so slow in putting the vaccines out?\n\"Nobody can seem to give us any information and it seems to be so poorly organised.\"\nThe Welsh Government spokesperson said: \"Every day in Wales we are speeding up the vaccination programme. \n\"Thousands more people are receiving their first dose of the Covid vaccine and more clinics are opening with 45 vaccination centres operating or due to be operating shortly, and more than 250 GP surgeries being involved by the end of this month. As of 20 January, more than 175,816 people in Wales have been vaccinated.\""

      "text": "Kamala Harris has made history as the first female, first black and first Asian-American US vice-president.\nShe was sworn in just before Joe Biden took the oath of office to become the 46th US president.\nMs Harris, who is of Indian-Jamaican heritage, initially ran for the Democratic nomination.\nBut Mr Biden won the race and chose Ms Harris as his running mate, describing her as \"a fearless fighter for the little guy\".\nPrior to taking the oath at the US Capitol, Ms Harris paid tribute to the women who she says came before her.\n\"I stand on their shoulders,\" she said in a video.\nEugene Goodman, the Capitol police officer who was hailed as a hero for steering a pro-Trump mob away from Senate chambers during the 6 January riot, escorted Ms Harris at the inauguration.\nMs Harris, 56, was born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents: an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father.\nShe went on to attend Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities. She has described her time there as among the most formative experiences of her life.\nMs Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as \"an American\".\nAfter four years at Howard, Ms Harris went on to earn her law degree at the University of California, Hastings, and began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office.\nShe became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first female and the first African American to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state.\nIn her nearly two terms in office as attorney general, Ms Harris gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her to election as California's junior US senator in 2017. She was only the second black woman ever elected to the US senate.\nShe launched her candidacy for president to a crowd of more than 20,000 in Oakland at the beginning of 2019.\nBut Ms Harris failed to articulate a clear rationale for her campaign, and gave muddled answers to questions in key policy areas like healthcare.\nShe was also unable to capitalise on the clear high point of her candidacy: debate performances that showed off her prosecutorial skills, often placing Mr Biden in the line of attack, most notably criticising his praise for the \"civil\" working relationship he had with former senators who favoured racial segregation.\nShe dropped out of the presidential race in December 2019.\nBut Mr Biden chose her as his number two in August, calling her \"one of the country's finest public servants\".\nAfter Mr Biden was announced as the next president in November, Ms Harris tweeted a video of her congratulating her running mate. \n\"We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!\" she beamed."

      "tags": "Kamala Harris,US election 2020,United States,California,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Kamala Harris savoured the moment she became the first woman, and the first black and Asian American, to be vice-president-elect, with a very hearty laugh. \nIn a video posted to her social media she shares the news with President-elect Joe Biden: \"We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!\"\nHer words are about him but the history of the moment is hers. \nJust over a year ago, as the senator from California hoping to win the Democratic nomination for presidency, she launched a potent attack on Joe Biden over race during a debate. Many thought it inflicted a serious blow on his ambitions. But by the end of the year her campaign was dead and it was Mr Biden who returned the 56-year-old to the national spotlight by putting her on his ticket.  \n\"It is a big reversal of fortune for Kamala Harris,\" says Gil Duran, a communications director for Ms Harris in 2013 and who has critiqued her run for the presidential nomination. \n\"Many people didn't think she had the discipline and focus to ascend to a position in the White House so quickly... although people knew she had ambition and star potential. It was always clear that she had the raw talent.\"\nWhat she has demonstrated from the moment she took the national stage with her pitch for the presidency - is grit. \nBorn in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents - an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father - her parents divorced when she was five and she was primarily raised by her Hindu single mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist. \nShe grew up engaged with her Indian heritage, joining her mother on visits to India, but Ms Harris has said that her mother adopted Oakland's black culture, immersing her two daughters - Kamala and her younger sister Maya - within it. \n\"My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,\" she wrote in her autobiography The Truths We Hold. \"She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.\" \nHer biracial roots and upbringing mean she embodies and can engage with and appeal to many American identities. Those parts of the country which have seen rapid demographic change, enough change to alter a region's politics, see an aspirational symbol in her. \nBut it was her time at Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life. \nLita Rosario-Richardson met Kamala Harris while at Howard in the 1980s when students would gather in the Yard area of the campus to hang out and discuss politics, fashion and gossip. \n\"I noticed she had a keen sense of argumentation.\" \nThey bonded over an aptitude for energetic debate with campus Republicans, their experience growing up with single mothers, even just both being the Libra star sign. It was a formative era politically too. \n\"Reagan was president at the time and it was the apartheid era and there was a lot of talk about divestiture with 'trans Africa\" and the Martin Luther King  holiday issue,\" Ms Rosario-Richardson says. \n\"We know that, being descendants of enslaved people and people of colour coming out of colonisation, that we have a special role and having an education gives us a special position in society to help effect change,\" she explains - it was a philosophy and a call to action that was part of the university experience Ms Harris lived.\nShe returned to address students at Howard in 2017 and  took them on a journey from the Ferguson race protests of 2014 to the halls of Capitol Hill in just one sentence: \n\"You students have joined the fight for justice - you protested. From the streets of Ferguson to the halls of the United States Congress, you have lived the words of James Baldwin, 'There is never a time in the future in which we will work out our salvation. The challenge is in the moment, the time is always now.'\"\nBut Ms Harris also operates with ease in predominantly white communities. Her early years included a brief period in Canada. When Ms Gopalan Harris took a job teaching at McGill University, Ms Harris and her younger sister Maya went with her, attending school in Montreal for five years.  \nMs Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as an \"American\". \nShe told the Washington Post in 2019, that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. \"My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,\" she said.\nIn 2014, Senator Harris married lawyer Doug Emhoff - now a fixture at her campaign stops - and became stepmother to his two children. \nLast year she wrote an article for Elle magazine about the experience of becoming a stepmother and unveiled the name that would then come to dominate many headlines that followed.\n\"When Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom'. Instead they came up with the name 'Momala'.\"\nThey were portrayed as the epitome of modern American \"blended\" family, an image the media took to and one that occupied many column inches about how we talk about female politicians.\nOn becoming vice-president-elect, she is unlikely to lose this nickname but many argue she should also be seen and recognised as the descendant of another kind of family and that is the inheritor of generations of black female activists.\n\"She is heir to a legacy of grassroots organisers, elected officials, and unsuccessful candidates who paved this path to the White House. Black women are seen as a political force of nature in democratic politics and the Democratic party,\" Nadia Brown, associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, told the BBC. \nFannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Septima Clark are some of the names she follows in the footsteps of, Ms Brown argues. \n\"Her win is historic but it is not hers alone. It is shared with countless black women who made this day possible.\"\nBut from the very earliest, as her friend Ms Rosario-Richardson attests, she showed the skills that allowed her to be one of few women to break through barriers.  \n\"That is what attracted me to get her to join debate team [at Howard University], a fearlessness.\"\nWit and humour is part of that armoury. The laugh she greeted the president-elect with, when making that first momentous phone call, was one her friend recognised immediately and intimately.  \n\"It clearly shows her personality, even in the short time she has been on the campaign trail.\"  \n\"She has always had that laugh, she has always had a sense of humour too, she had a sense of wit - even in the context of a university debate -  to get those points across.\"\nThe ability to deliver zingers to her opponents in live debate was very much part of the momentum behind the start of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.  She wasn't afraid of confrontation as in this Twitter exchange with Donald Trump Jr last October. \n\"Why is @KamalaHarris the only person that laughs at her jokes... always way to long and way too hard?\" Mr Trump's son asked. \n\"You wouldn't know a joke if one raised you,\" she wrote back. \nA simple burn on social media, but a popular shorthand for the kind of skills that meant a career in law and politics was a natural fit.\nAlthough her career as a prosecutor is what made her a politician, it brought with it political benefits and risks. \nShe began work in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office and became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first black person to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. \nShe gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her election as California's junior US senator in 2017. \nBut straddling the line between pleasing left-leaning California Democrats and being a politician for a nation where the left does not decide who gets to be president has been hard.\nShe gained favour among progressives for her acerbic questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, but as a presidential candidate for the Democratic Party her adept debate performances were not enough to compensate for poorly articulated policies.\nWalking the fine line between the progressive and moderate wings of her party, she ended up appealing to neither. \nDespite leftward leanings on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, she faced repeated attacks for not really being progressive enough.\n\"Kamala is a cop\" became a common refrain on the campaign trail. But those same law enforcement credentials proved beneficial on the national stage when Democrats needed to win over more moderate voters and independents.  \nShe was \"someone with a law enforcement background, and perceived in her own state as being insufficiently progressive... and trying to project an inauthentic self\", Mr Duran says, but adds \"that looks very different in a vice-presidential slot\".\nAs the US grapples with an ongoing racial reckoning and there is scrutiny over police brutality, Ms Harris has taken a front row seat, using her sizable microphone.\nOn talk shows she calls for changes to police practices across the US, on Twitter she calls for the arrests of the police officers who killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African-American woman from Kentucky, and she speaks frequently about the need to dismantle systemic racism.  \nShe has the law enforcement background but she has often said that her identity makes her uniquely suited to represent those on the margins.\nNow she has the chance to do just that and from inside the White House.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Common Travel Area (CTA),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Northern Ireland has been in lockdown since 26 December, in a bid to control the spread of Covid-19.\nRestrictions had been eased in the run-up to Christmas, which led to a sharp spike in cases in January, causing severe pressure on the health service.\nMedically-trained military personnel will be deployed to help, but a union has questioned the move and said NI should have entered a stricter lockdown sooner.\nWith Stormont ministers extending the current lockdown, could other measures could be on the table?\nIt's worth bearing in mind that NI is already in tight lockdown restrictions and has been for almost a month.\nBut the current measures are now set to remain in place until at least 5 March.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said health officials had not requested any other measures be toughened up at this time, given the duration and extent of the current rules.\nThe initial lockdown began last March, with non-essential retail not permitted to open again until 12 June. \nBy law people are required to stay at home during the lockdown unless they have a reasonable excuse, such as going out for exercise, medical or food needs.\nPeople are also required to wear face masks in shops and on public transport, with only a limited number of exemptions. \nThose who breach the rules can face fines, with businesses that break the law also able to be fined if they do not follow the rules.\nHowever, DUP minister Edwin Poots has expressed concern that not enough has been done by the PSNI to enforce the laws.\nIt is a difficult balance for the executive to strike. \nThey previously announced that \"Covid marshals\" would be deployed in the retail sector to ensure social distancing in queues and adherence to the rules.\nMinisters want to ensure as many people as possible follow the restrictions voluntarily while ensuring the PSNI has enough powers to manage the situation.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann has not ruled out revisiting whether the level of fines people can face should be increased, and said he would raise the matter with his executive colleagues.\nThe 2020 lockdown saw many businesses right across Northern Ireland forced to close, with retail and hospitality among them.\nThere was confusion over whether construction and manufacturing should stop, with the executive later clarifying that essential work on building sites could continue. \nIn the latest lockdown, the sector has been permitted to remain fully open.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, all non-essential construction has been ordered to stop during a fresh lockdown there. \nLike in the previous lockdown, people have again been told to work from home unless they cannot.\nBut it is worth pointing out many companies have had time to prepare since last March, making their workplaces Covid-secure to allow more staff to attend in person.\nThe executive has a defined list of essential businesses here. \nThere has also been confusion about what elements of the retail sector can operate. \nAll but essential retail shops were told to close on 26 December, and click-and-collect is only allowed for those essential retailers.\nBut concerns were later raised that some larger chains were \"gaming\" the regulations by selling non-essential items, with smaller independent shops who had to close arguing they were being treated unfairly.\nThe executive met with retailers last week to discuss this, but it seems unlikely it will act to define essential items in regulations. \nA similar situation in Wales last year led to criticism after supermarkets were told by law not to sell certain items.\nThe majority of pupils are in an extended period of remote learning until after half-term in February, but some children of key workers and vulnerable children are still permitted to attend the classroom.\nLast week it emerged that at least eight times as many pupils in Northern Ireland attended schools in the first week of term in 2021 compared to the first lockdown in 2020. \nThough part of this is due to special schools remaining open for all pupils, unlike in March to June last year.\nThe executive could potentially revisit the list of services it defines as meeting the \"key worker\" definition for childcare, if it wanted to reduce this further.\nIt is also possible schools could remain closed to most pupils for a longer period, in line with extending the lockdown to 5 March.\nThe executive says workers, builders, tradespeople and other professionals can continue to go into people's houses to carry out work such as repairs, installations and deliveries. \nBut it does not define further what this type of work should include.\nIt is possible ministers could tighten the circumstances in which work can be carried out in someone's home, but the guidance already specifies a limited number of exemptions for allowing others inside your home during the lockdown. \nHouse moves are also allowed under the regulations, although they were paused in the first lockdown.\nMusic lessons and private tutoring are permitted in someone's home, with mitigations.\nDuring the first week of lockdown from 26 December, people were told not to leave their homes between 20:00 and 06:00 every day - effectively amounting to a curfew. \nMinisters could decide to impose the measure again, if they felt that was necessary - but initially it was imposed to stop house parties over New Year's Eve.\nAll but essential travel is not permitted outside of Northern Ireland, and anyone entering Northern Ireland must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival or face a fine.\nHowever, there is no formal travel ban on passengers from Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland entering Northern Ireland.\nThe executive had voted by a majority before Christmas not to impose such a ban, despite calls from Sinn F\u00e9in for it to happen. \nOther parties argued that the public health advice did not propose a ban in law, and that travel from the Republic of Ireland to NI should be restricted as well due to its rise in cases.\nThe current guidance states that anyone coming into NI from within the Common Travel Area who is staying for more than 24 hours should self-isolate for 10 days, but there are exemptions for those who \"cross the border\" regularly for work or other essential reasons.\nThe executive also does not have a formal limit in law for travelling to exercise, unlike in the Republic of Ireland where it is 5km (3 miles).\nJustice Minister Naomi Long said there is an \"advisory limit\" of 10 miles for exercise in Northern Ireland."

      "title": "Inauguration fashion: Purple, pearls, and mittens",
      "tags": "Jill Biden,United States,Fashion,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Politicians in pearls, the colour purple and warm woollen mittens - these are just a few of Washington's favourite things from the 2021 Inauguration.\nWith America's leaders in the spotlight on the inauguration - and world - stage, sometimes what they wear can say more than their speeches.\nDC-based fashion consultant Lauren Rothman says Americans have always taken an interest in what political leaders don for inaugural celebrations. And in 2021, with an ongoing pandemic and economic crisis as well as the swearing-in of the first female vice-president, things feel \"even more loaded\".\nIt's all about optics for the politically fashion-minded, says Ms Rothman, who helps style politicians for events including inaugurations past.\nSo let's see how outspoken this year's inauguration crowd really was, from the Bidens to Bernie Sanders - with a little help from some real fashion experts.\nVice-President Kamala Harris' purple ensemble has already made an impact.\n\"Symbolically, it's a bipartisan colour because it marries [Republican] red and [Democratic] blue,\" says Ms Rothman, noting a number of elected officials or spouses had opted for purple today. \nBut that's not the only reason purple has a special place for US women in politics. The suffragettes often wore the colour in the 1900s while campaigning for women's right to vote. \nProfessor Elka Stevens, coordinator of the fashion design programme at Howard University, also notes it's a colour of significance in the black community - one tied to the Christian experience as well. Ms Harris' pearl necklace also made reference to a tradition in her Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, the oldest all-black sorority in the US. \nAdd it all up and Ms Harris' choice of pearls and a purple sharp-cut Christopher John Rogers coat was \"an excellent first building block on what the legacy is of how to look like a woman in power\", Ms Rothman says.\nBoth Mrs Biden and Ms Harris also took care to choose emerging US brands for their inaugural looks. Ms Harris' outfit, from head-to-toe, showed off African-American designers. \nAnd we can't forget Doug Emhoff either, America's \"first second gentleman\".\n\"He chose to do everything that he should, which is to not distract and perfectly fit in,\" says Rothman.\nWe can't discuss political fashion without bringing up Michelle Obama.\nHer purple Sergio Hudson sweater and palazzo pants plus coat look, along with perfectly curled hair, did not disappoint fans of the former first lady.\n\"It's a different dress code and different expectation for women who are first ladies versus people who aren't, like women who are elected,\" says Ms Rothman.\nFrom baring her arms to wearing both high-end and High Street fashion, Mrs Obama was \"legacy-making\" in a way that hearkened back to Nancy Reagan and Jackie Kennedy, Ms Rothman says. \nShe also put many \"independent and ethnic American designers\" on the map during her eight years in the White House.\nNewly former First Lady Melania Trump, too, had a clear style, often spotted in sleek looks from well-known brands (think Chanel, Herm\u00e8s). \nOne of her favourite designers was French-American Herv\u00e9 Pierre, but Prof Stevens also notes she faced a challenge dressing all-American as many US labels said they would not dress her.\nFor her final look of the day, Melania swapped out the all-black suit she left the White House in for a Gucci dress with a bold orange print.\n\"The curtain is down and she's onto the next phase of her life,\" says Ms Rothman of the sharp contrast. \"I think that's what she's using her clothing to signal: that DC is over.\nHe may not win the best-dressed award any time soon, but veteran Senator Bernie Sanders certainly won Twitter with his extra large mittens.\nMr Sanders' pair of eye-catching woolly mittens were given to him two years ago by a Vermont schoolteacher who made them from repurposed sweaters and recycled plastic bottles. Those, coupled with a snap of him alone in a crossed-arm pose, made for prime meme fodder.\n\"What we love about it is that it's so authentically Bernie,\" says Ms Rothman. \nWhen asked for his thoughts on all the stir his inauguration look caused, Mr Sanders simply said: \"In Vermont we dress warm...and we're not so concerned about good fashion. We want to keep warm. And that's what I did today.\"\nInauguration 2021 featured performances from Jennifer Lopez (in a crisp white ensemble) and Lady Gaga.\nBut it was Gaga's custom black-and-red Schiaparelli gown that stole the show or, more specifically, the large golden dove-shaped brooch she wore atop it.\nAside from the Hunger Games comparisons, the almost operatic outfit served another fun purpose in Ms Rothman's eyes.\n\"She brought the inaugural ball to the stage in a year where you're not going to get all of the dress up, the ball gowns that we have come to look at and adore and criticise.\"\nYouth poet laureate Amanda Gorman was another star on today's stage. \nThe self-described \"skinny black girl, descended from slaves and raised by a single mother\", touched on many heavy themes in her verses, but her outfit was a breath of fresh air.\nYellow is a colour of hope, energy, light. And her bright red Prada headband was a bold complement. To Prof Stevens, it was almost crown-like.\n\"It also honed attention on her hair, because no one else had that particular hairstyle. And we know that hair can be political as well.\"\nOur last noteworthy youthful garb of the day was Ella Emhoff, stepdaughter to the vice-president. \nHer dainty white collar atop a bejewelled plaid Miu Miu coat was particularly striking - or in the words of Teen Vogue, \"just *chef's kiss*\" - and to Prof Stevens, reminiscent of late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\"I really thought about our democracy, justice, the collars [Ginsburg] wore and the messages she would send. I think this was [also] an ode to femininity.\"\nAnd as for her brother Cole's look? Prof Stevens' takeaway was: \"You need some gloves, young man.\" \nAnd last but not least, let's consider the new president and first lady.\nProf Stevens says the political dress mirrored a desire to project comfort and to reassure the nation that US democracy is safe and its way of life is \"going back to something familiar\" despite Covid-19.\nThere may not have been anything ground-breaking in Mr Biden's Ralph Lauren suit; perhaps the more interesting aspect is the way he wore it.\n\"As a Washington insider he's been wearing suits for decades,\" says Ms Rothman. \"He showed that he knows what works.\"\nAlso notable with both Biden's ensembles today: the colour blue. Prof Stevens notes that blue is recognised as a colour of trustworthiness; of stability; of confidence, especially for men.\nAs for Jill Biden's custom-made, Swarovski-crystal-accented aquamarine coat from the up-and-coming New York Makarian label? \nBoth Prof Stevens and Ms Rothman say it signalled responsibility and modesty. \n\"We already know [the Bidens] are very united, but it signalled that they're here and ready to do the work,\" Ms Rothman says.\n All images copyright.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Scientists tracking the spread of coronavirus in England say infection levels in the community may have risen at the start of the latest lockdown.\nInfections in 6-15 January were up by 50% on early December, with one in 63 people infected, Imperial College London's initial findings suggest.\nSwab tests from 143,000 people indicate 1.58% had the virus during in early January - up from 0.91% in December.\nMinisters say the report does not yet reflect the impact of the lockdown.\nThe latest round of results from Imperial College's React-1 infection survey - one of the country's largest studies into Covid-19 infections - are interim with the full set of results to be published in a week's time.\nBut Imperial College London's Prof Paul Elliott warned if the high prevalence continues \"more lives will be lost\".\nThe report also says there are \"worrying suggestions of a recent uptick in infections\" and Prof Elliott said the third lockdown - introduced on 6 January - was not having the same impact as the first, in April.\nLondon had the highest level in the January period - 2.8%, up from 1.21% in early December.\nProf Elliott old BBC Radio 4's Today programme the current R rate - which represents how many people an infected person will pass the virus on to - was \"around 1\".\n\"We're seeing this levelling off, it's not going up, but we're not seeing the decline that we really need to see given the pressure on the NHS from the current very high levels of the virus in the population,\" he said.\n\"To prevent our already stretched health system from becoming overwhelmed, infections must be brought down,\" Prof Elliot added.\nBefore the Covid rules were tightened, the restrictions faced by people in England varied depending on where they lived.\nThe researchers say the government's latest daily case figures, which show a slowdown, may reflect a drop in cases just after Christmas, which is only now being registered. \nAnd they suggest infection levels may have gone up in early January as a result of people's activity increasing after the Christmas holiday period. \nThey admit there is some uncertainty in their data amid a \"fast-changing situation\" but say it is more up to date than the daily government figures because it does not rely on those being tested developing symptoms and then waiting to have their infections confirmed by a laboratory.\nThe UK recorded another all-time high of daily coronavirus deaths on Wednesday. A further 1,820 people died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to government figures - taking the total number of deaths by that measure to 93,290.\nThe findings of the study are seemingly at odds with recent figures from NHS Test and Trace, which has been reporting recent decreases in daily infections and has prompted some experts to suggest that we might be beginning our journey out of the woods. \nThe researchers behind the study say the test and trace figures may be reflecting an initial drop in infections just after Christmas, which is only now being registered on the official figures. \nThe study's more up to date findings indicate that infection levels did not continue to fall in the first two weeks of January and may even have gone up. So why has this happened?\nData on people's movements has shown that there's been increased activity which the scientists involved say has kept transmission of the virus at a high level. The Department of Health says that the study does not yet reflect the impact of the lockdown in England. \nBut if this trend continues, say the scientists, the numbers admitted to hospital with severe Covid illness, will not fall in the short term, as some had hoped.\nThis is one set of figures over a short number of days so there might be a more optimistic picture when the study reports its full set of results in a week's time. But there is no getting away from the fact that ministers will be disappointed not to have seen a fall at this stage. \nUnless things change, even tougher measures will have to be considered.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said there will be \"tough weeks to come\" but he hoped there would be a \"real difference\" by spring as the vaccine programme accelerates.\nIt comes as another 60 NHS Covid-19 vaccination centres in England, including a mosque in Birmingham and a cinema in Aylesbury, will welcome their first patients later.\nMinisters have sought to reassure people in the top four priority groups for the Covid vaccination that they will get their jab by the government's mid-February target, following complaints from some GPs about unpredictable supplies.\nSome 4.6m people in the UK have now received the first dose of a Covid vaccine.\nFacebook mobility data, which tracks people's movements, suggested a fall in activity at the end of December but a rise at the start of the new year.\nAnd Prof Elliott said everyone should \"reduce their mobility as much as we can\".\nA new, more transmissible variant and the fact larger households and deprived communities were more likely to be affected, may also be factors.\nThe Imperial survey is one source of data used to estimate the UK's reproduction (R) number, along with other surveys, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for example, and figures on confirmed cases and hospital admissions.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the React findings showed \"we must not let down our guard over the weeks to come\".\n\"It is absolutely paramount that everyone plays their part to bring down infections,\" he said. \n\"This means staying at home and only going out where absolutely necessary, reducing contact with others and maintaining social distancing.\""

One of the injured was in a serious condition and taken to hospital, according to officials. \nSpanish reports said the upper floors affected were being used to house local priests.\nRescue workers evacuated more than 50 people from a care home next-door to the building in Caille de Toledo, but a school on the other side was closed at the time of the blast.\nFour floors of the building were destroyed in the explosion, which could be heard in many areas of Madrid. Images shared on social media showed billowing smoke and debris strewn along the street.\nEmergency services said nine fire crews and 11 ambulances were at the scene and some of those caught up in the blast were treated on the street.\nPolice officers cleared the area, closing it to all traffic and pedestrians, and appealed to local residents not to come near.\n\"The noise was very loud, very loud, really,\" Lorenzo Fomento, who was working from home at a nearby apartment, told AFP news agency. \"I never heard anything so loud before,\" he added.\nThe director of the nursing home, Antonio Berlanga, said all the elderly residents were fine and places were being found for them to spend the night."

      "text": "The government has decided not to move ahead with plans to decriminalise non-payment of the TV licence fee, but said it would \"remain under active consideration\".\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the criminal sanction was \"increasingly unfair and disproportionate\".\nHowever, he also noted an alternative system could result in \"significantly higher fines\" for licence fee evaders.\nThe BBC said the current system was \"the fairest and most effective\". \nMoney raised from the licence fee, which costs \u00a3157.50 a year (or \u00a353 for black and white TV sets), pays for BBC shows and services - including TV, radio, the BBC website, podcasts, iPlayer and apps.\nIn 2019, the licence fee accounted for about 76% of the BBC's total income of \u00a34.9bn, with the remainder coming from commercial and other activities (such as grants, royalties and rental income).\nMr Dowden's comments came as the government published the findings of a public consultation on the issue of decriminalisation.\nA public consultation launched by the government in February 2020 asked whether non-payment of the licence fee should continue to be a criminal offence.\nIt explored whether the current system could be replaced with a civil enforcement scheme.\nThe consultation, which lasted eight weeks, received 154,737 responses from members of the public, campaign organisations and other stakeholders.\nCurrently, anyone who watches or records live TV or uses iPlayer without a TV licence is guilty of a criminal offence and could go to prison.\nThe government has committed to maintaining the current licence fee funding model until 2027 - when the current Charter period ends.\nThe government said it \"remains concerned that a criminal sanction for TV licence evasion is increasingly disproportionate and unfair in a modern public service broadcasting system\".\nIt said respondents highlighted the \"considerable stress and anxiety\" the criminal sanction can cause for individuals, particularly vulnerable people.\nHowever, the government also said it recognised there could be damaging consequences for the public if the current system was abandoned. \nMr Dowden acknowledged there was \"the potential for significantly higher fines and costs for individuals who evade the licence fee requirement\" under a civil regime.\nThe consultation also \"highlighted significant impacts in terms of both the cost and implementation\" of a new system, particularly as evasion is currently handled \"very efficiently in the Magistrates Court\".\nResponding to Thursday's publication of the government's findings, a BBC spokesperson said: \"The current system remains the fairest and most effective. \n\"The responses to the government's consultation shows the majority back the current system. The BBC will fully engage with the government going forward on how we can continue to play an important role for the public.\"\nThe government said it remained determined that any change to the TV licence enforcement scheme \"should not be seen as an invitation to evade the TV licence requirement, nor should it privilege the rule-breaking minority over the rule-abiding majority\".\n\"The issue of decriminalisation will remain under active consideration while more work is undertaken to understand the impact of alternative enforcement schemes,\" it added.\nIf decriminalisation of the TV licence fee were to go through, it would have a considerable impact on BBC funding.\nMr Dowden added the government would take forward the findings of its consultation into the next licence fee settlement, which will set the level of the licence fee for a period of at least five years from 2022.\nNegotiations formally begun for the next licence fee settlement recently, Mr Dowden confirmed.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "UK floods: How can you protect your home or business?",
      "text": "More than five-and-a-half million properties in England and Wales are deemed to be at risk from flooding.  \nThis year has seen most parts of the UK being affected, with thousands of properties being flooded. \nDespite efforts to improve and strengthen community flood defence schemes, many homes and businesses remain vulnerable.\nThe Environment Agency acknowledges that it is impossible to completely flood-proof a property, but there are a number of measures to prevent flood-water getting in and limit the damage.\nThere are a number of routes in which floodwater can enter a property. \nAs well as coming through doors and patios, water can find its way in through air bricks on exposed walls and through gaps in the floor.\nAnother way is via through drains and pipes as the pressure created by flooding can reverse the flow, causing water to back-up and enter a home through sinks, toilets, washing machines etc.\n The Environment Agency lists two ways that homes and businesses can protect properties: \"flood resistance\" measures, and making a building \"flood resilient\".\nFlood resistance refers to preventing water from entering in the first place.\nThe traditional methods of using sandbags can help for short periods when used in conjunction with plastic sheeting, and they can prevent contaminated mud and silt from entering a property.\nBut they do allow water to seep through and are not as effective as purpose-designed flood products.\nThere are a range of products on the market that are designed to offer protection.\nThese include:\nFlood protection experts recommend that people buy products that have been awarded a kitemark, as this means that the product has undergone a series of tests to ensure it is fit for purpose.\nIf a product is awarded a kitemark, it means that it meets the requirements outlined in PAS-1188 - a quality benchmark developed by the British Standards Institution (BSI), the Environment Agency and other partners.\nThe benchmark covers a range of product types, including removable products that act as barriers across vulnerable points, such as doors and airbricks; temporary, freestanding barriers which are assembled close to, but not in contact with, a building; and property flood skirt systems.\nAs well as fitting flood protection measures to your home, another measure is landscaping your garden in a way that helps divert water away from your property.\nIt is impossible to guarantee that flood-water will not enter your property, even if you have taken steps to protect your property. \nThe Environment Agency lists a number of ways to make your home \"flood resilient\", which will limit the damage and allow residents to return to their property quickly (on average, people are unable to live in their homes for nine months after being flooded).\nThese include:\nThis will depend on the size of your property and the level of flood resistance and resilience  you require.\nFigures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) estimate that protecting a property against shallow flash floods will cost in the region of \u00a32,000-\u00a36,000.\nHowever, protection against prolonged flooding requires bigger changes and could cost up to \u00a340,000.\nBut the Environment Agency says taking measures to protect your property will limit the distress and damage caused by flooding, reduce the level of repairs and will allow you to return to your home or business more quickly.\nAs an estimated one-in-six homes are located within at-risk areas, more than one million people have signed up to the Environment Agency's flood warning service. \nAs well as its flood warning service, the Agency has a section on its website that offers practical advice on how people can protect their homes and businesses from flooding, including an interactive guide on ways to reduce flood damage.\nIt also offers advice on how to develop a \"flood plan\" and what you and your neighbours need to do once a flood warning has been issued for your area.\nThe National Flood Forum, a charity that is dedicated to representing people living in areas at risk from flooding, has produced the \"blue pages\", which is an independent directory of flood protection products."

      "tags": "Donald Trump,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Joe Biden has been sworn in as the 46th US president, ending one of the most dramatic political transitions in American history.\n\"Democracy has prevailed,\" he said after taking the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts.\nDonald Trump - who has not formally conceded the presidency to Mr Biden - snubbed the inauguration ceremony, in a departure from longstanding precedent.\nThe new president swiftly signed a raft of measures reversing Trump policies.\nKamala Harris was sworn in as vice-president ahead of Mr Biden. She is the first woman - and the first black and Asian-American person - to serve in the role, a heartbeat from the presidency.\nThe inauguration took place at the US Capitol. There is extra-tight security after the building was stormed by violent pro-Trump protesters in a deadly riot on 6 January.\nSome 25,000 National Guards protected the ceremony, which missed the traditional hundreds of thousands of spectators because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn his inaugural address, Mr Biden said it was a day of \"history and hope\". \n\"My whole soul is in putting America back together again,\" he added.\nHighlighting a message of unity after the turbulent Trump years, he promised to be a president \"for all Americans\" - including those who voted against him.\nAmong those attending the ceremony were three of his predecessors: Barack Obama - under whom Mr Biden served for eight years as vice-president - Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Mr Trump's vice-president, Mike Pence.\nThe inauguration ceremony included musical performances by Lady Gaga - who sang the national anthem - as well as Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks.\nAn evening concert at the Lincoln Memorial in the city will be hosted by Tom Hanks and will feature Bruce Springsteen, John Legend, Jon\u00a0Bon Jovi, Justin Timberlake, and Demi Lovato.\nIn the afternoon, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris visited Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia to pay their respects to US war dead.\nThe new president's motorcade then left for the White House. He walked the last block with his family, and hugged his wife Jill before entering their new home.\nMr Biden later told reporters that Mr Trump had written \"a very generous letter\" to him, adding: \"Because it was private, I won't talk about it until I talk to him.\"\nJoe Biden knows he has a hard job ahead of him. In his inaugural address, he outlined the biggest challenges facing his presidency - a devastating pandemic, massive job losses, a threatened environment, urgent calls for racial justice and a resurgence of political extremism. \nMr Biden didn't offer a laundry list of solutions. Those will come in policy addresses and announcements of executive action in the coming days or even hours.\nIn his first address as president, he offered only an overarching prescription for the nation's ills. \"Unity is the path forward,\" he said. \"And we must meet this moment as the United States of America.\"\nStanding on ground that was occupied two weeks ago by an angry mob supporting his predecessor, Mr Biden called for an end to what he termed an \"uncivil war\".\nBiden campaigned as a centrist capable of healing the nation's wounds. In the months since his victory, the breadth of the divisions in the US has only become more apparent. With his party in control of Congress, he will have an opportunity to enact an ambitious presidential agenda. Keeping the nation united while doing so would be a significant accomplishment.\nMr Trump was the first president not to attend his successor's inauguration since 1869. He left the White House early on Wednesday, and flew to the nearby Andrews Air Force base.\nIn his farewell address at the base, he highlighted what he regarded as the successes of his presidency. \"What we've done has been amazing by any standard,\" Mr Trump said.\nThe 74-year-old then left for his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida, where he arrived later in the morning.\nIn his last hours as president, Mr Trump granted clemency to more than 140 people, including his former adviser Steve Bannon, who had been facing fraud charges.\nThe political drama surrounding Mr Trump is far from over. The US Senate is expected to put him on trial soon, following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives for allegedly inciting the Capitol riot.\nOn Tuesday, the Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said the mob had been provoked by Mr Trump and fed lies.\nThe new president set to work straight after the inauguration. He signed executive orders aiming to:\nOther orders cover race and gender equality.\nVice-President Harris swore in three new Democratic senators on Wednesday, leaving the upper chamber of Congress evenly split between the two main parties. This will allow the vice-president to act as a tie-breaker in key votes. \nMr Biden's legislative ambitions could be tempered by the slender majorities he holds in both the Senate and House of Representatives, however.

      "text": "About 80 people were evacuated because of flooding related to mine works, authorities have confirmed.\nA major incident was declared after at least eight streets were left under water in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot.\nEmergency services said there were no injuries and all those evacuated had been found accommodation, but people are asked to avoid the area.\nMore than 30 residents of Cwrt-Clwydi-Gwyn care home were among those moved as a precaution.\nUp to 45 firefighters were involved at the scene, along with boats and pumping equipment, and emergency services said they would remain overnight.\nIn a joint statement the police, fire service and Neath Port Talbot Council said the cause of the flooding was being investigated and \"the water level will continue to be monitored\".\nDeputy chief fire officer Roger Thomas, from Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, had said earlier 100 properties were involved.\nHe added: \"First and foremost, our thoughts are with those who have been affected by the events of today.\n\"This incident involved a large multi-agency response to what was a dynamic and fast-moving incident, with incredible efforts by everyone involved to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the affected community.\"\nThe Welsh Government said it would work with councils across Wales to deliver payments of \u00a3500-\u00a31,000 to households affected by flooding following days of heavy rain brought by Storm Christoph.\nNeath and Port Talbot council said a local rest centre was available, and measures had been put in place to protect against Covid-19.\nChief executive Karen Jones added: \"Council officers have been on site since around midday and there will be a continued council presence in the area throughout the night.\n\"Our main focus at present is on continuing to support residents who had to leave their homes and ensuring others have a safe place to go if further evacuations are necessary.\"\nCouncil leader Rob Jones said earlier that early indications suggest the flooding is related to mine works - but the volume of water involved was making it difficult to fully assess the situation.\nThe Coal Authority confirmed it had begun an investigation into what happened.\n\"There are a number of historic underground mining features in the area,\" chief executive Lisa Pinney said.\nNathan Wilcox, who has lived in the village for 10 years, said he looked out of the window and \"saw all the water gushing down the bank and over the bollards\".\nWater then flooded over sandbags into the utility room of his house. \n\"All the neighbours were out asking people if they needed help... some of us carried children out and make sure they were safe, other people were helping with sandbags to try and keep the water out the best we can,\" he said.\n\"It's surreal, I could never imagine anything like this happening.\"\nGeorgina May Branston, 22, said she was in work when she got a panicked phone call from her mum, and came home to find the street \"totally flooded\".\n\"It's worrying, it's the anticipation of what we are going to have to do,\" she said, saying they had watched the flood waters rising towards their home.\n\"With everything going on, this is the last thing people need.\"\nRhys Williams, BBC News\nThree hours since the incident was first reported water is still flowing as strongly as ever on Drummau Road.\nThe fire service said the water level rose more than 2ft (0.7m) in an hour up to 15:30GMT.\nResidents said they were told by emergency service personnel that an underground mine shaft had collapsed.\nAbout a hundred homes have been evacuated and more could be forced to leave if the water continues to rise.\nCwrt-Clwydi-Gwyn care home has told relatives that 32 residents would be moved to its other homes in the area due to the flooding.\n\"Whilst all residents tested negative for Covid-19 on Sunday, as a precautionary measure, residents will self-isolate when they join their new home,\" a spokesman said.\n\"Whilst this relocation is an important measure to keep everyone safe, we know the virus remains a very real risk, and we will be maintaining all possible infection control processes during the transition.\"\nSkewen lies within an old coal mining hotspot, with several former colliery sites near the village as coal was mined in the 19th and early 20th Century. \nThere were colliery sites in the village near what is now Drumau Road, in the north of the village and another close to Old Road, near Neath Abbey. \nSkewen was part of a collection of collieries between Neath and Llanelli. \nGraham Levins, secretary of the Welsh Mines Preservation Trust, said old mines often contain groundwater which can flood in heavy rain. \nHe said: \"A lot of them go very, very deep down, much below the local water level and that's why they had all the big wheels to pump the water out. \n\"It fills up with water and will find a way out. Normally rainfall you get it doesn't cause a lot of problems but when you get really heavy rain the water drains down through the ground and builds up.\""

      "text": "Thousands of London taxi drivers plan to sue Uber for damages alleging the ride-hailing firm operated unlawfully.\nThe planned group legal action could, if successful, hit Uber with a bill for millions of pounds.\nThe action, part of a planned anti-Uber campaign by black-cab drivers this year, claims it didn't follow private hire rules between 2012 and 2018.\nUber said it \"operates lawfully in London and these allegations are completely unfounded\".\nThe group action, which will be launched by law firm Mishcon de Reya, will allege that for six years Uber operated unlawfully in London.\nTaxi rules in London mean that people have to contact a centralised office for minicabs, whereas they can hail a black cab on the street.\nThe lawsuit will claim that between 2012 and 2018, Uber let people hail its drivers directly, contravening those rules.\nLitigation specialist RGL Management, which is also working with the cabbies to bring the case, said more than 4,000 had signed up so far.\nThere are about 5,200 further registrations being processed, with hundreds of enquiries per day, it said. The firm is funding a marketing campaign, and is looking to sign up as many as 30,000 eligible drivers.\nA full-time driver over those six years could claim about \u00a325,000 in lost earnings, it added. The group action is aiming to bring a case to the High Court no later than the first quarter of 2022.\nThis is not the first time that London's black cabs have done battle with Uber, but today's announcement shows neither side have conceded defeat. \nThe proposed claim itself is huge - loss of earnings for up to 30,000 drivers for nearly 6 years -  and comes at a time when London black cabs and private hire vehicle drivers are struggling for work after nearly a year of lockdowns and restrictions.\nUber might now have its licence back, but the black cabs aren't willing to give them an easy ride.\nAn Uber spokeswoman said: \"Uber operates lawfully in London and these allegations are completely unfounded.\n\"We are proud to serve this great global city and the 45,000 drivers in London who rely on the app for earnings opportunities, and are committed to helping people move safely.\"\nUber has had a torrid history in the UK capital including previous lawsuits.\nIn February 2019 cab drivers lost a legal challenge which argued that Uber's London operating licence was granted by a biased judge.\nUber then went on to lose its licence to operate in London in November 2019 after safety concerns.\nBut in September last year it was spared a London ban after a judge upheld an appeal against Transport for London's decision over safety."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

All the information out there and it's really hard to process and get to a point where you're in a mindset where you know what's happening. \n\"There's such a high level of uncertainty you're constantly worried or actually doubting what's going to happen next. \n\"When you have goals for the future it's something to help you get through this but when you're in the circumstances we're in now, it's really hard to find the motivation and a purpose for what you're doing now.\"\nTo try and stay positive Angel has been trying to get out for walks during her school breaks or watch Netflix. \nShe said she has also tried to learn some sign-language during lockdown and attempted yoga.\nEmrys, 11, from Bridgend, said he misses not having the structure of a school day and seeing his friends.\nHe added: \"I'm a social person. I have friends, I chat with them, I play with them, and it's hard not being with my friends but I mean the family will have to do.\"\nHe and his six-year-old sister, Clara, have enjoyed going for walks with their parents and have been learning some new skills including washing dishes, cooking dinner and baking cakes.\nMeanwhile, 11-year-old Sophie has found it difficult to not get bored during long periods of time in the house. \n\"I'd say I cope OK with it at some points, but then not okay with it at other points,\" she added. \nAlicia is studying for her A-levels and has friends who have dropped out of their studies this year because of the stress and anxiety caused by the uncertainty about exams and their futures.\nThe 17-year-old also said it was \"heart-breaking\" not being able to see many of her close friends for almost a year.\nShe added: \"My thoughts are, it's less of a luxury now, I need to be able to go out to see them and to work.\"\nBefore the pandemic, Sarah, 16, from Swansea enjoyed going to her local youth club and took part in a local drama group but it how now moved online, giving a different experience. \n\"It's quite sad because I used to enjoy being able to do those things whenever it was on, but I think I'm getting used to do everything online,\" she said.\nAs a person who does not cope very well with not knowing what will happen next, the pandemic has caused anxiety at times for Sarah.\n\"I am finding it quite scary but hopefully things will change and I'll be able to go back soon,\" she said. \n\"I think if you're really struggling with something, talking really helps so it would be nice to see people in person.\"\nChildren's helpline MEIC Cymru said it had seen a 10% increase in the number of calls from young people, parents, and carers during the pandemic compared with previous years.\nStephanie Hoffman, Head of Social Action at Promo Cymru, the charity which runs the helpline, said: \"We're seeing what I'd say are many more substantive contacts, so a lot more contact dealing with really serious issues to do with social well-being, mental health and relationships, as opposed to what we might have seen more of in the past. \n\"Now we're dealing with situations which can be quite complicated.\"\nOf the survey, Ms Holland said: \"We've heard a lot from adults showing concern for children at the moment, such as parents, carers and professionals working with children about the potential impact of the lockdown on children. \n\"Those voices are important to hear, but it's also important we hear directly from children and young people because sometimes they can be surprising.\"\nWe know that Covid-19 vaccinations have been on people's minds in Wales - with many wanting to know when they or their loved-ones will receive theirs. \nIf you have a question about this issue, a story you'd like to share or a query about anything else related to coronavirus, you can sent it to us using the form below.\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "One of the mysteries of Covid-19 is why oxygen levels in the blood can drop to dangerously low levels without the patient noticing. \nIt is known as \"silent hypoxia\".\nAs a result, patients have been arriving in hospital in far worse health than they realised and, in some cases, too late to treat effectively. \nBut a potentially life-saving solution, in the form of a pulse oximeter, allows patients to monitor their oxygen levels at home, and costs about \u00a320. \nThey are being rolled out for high-risk Covid patients in the UK, and the doctor leading the scheme thinks everyone should consider buying one.\nA normal oxygen level in the blood is between 95% and 100%.\n\"With Covid, we were admitting patients with oxygen levels in the 70s or low-or-middle 80s,\" said Dr Matt Inada-Kim, a consultant in acute medicine at Hampshire Hospitals.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Inside Health: \"It was a really curious and scary presentation and really made us rethink what we were doing.\"  \nDr Inada-Kim became the national clinical lead of the Covid Oximetry@home project.\nA pulse oximeter slips over your middle finger and shines a light into the body. It measures how much of the light is absorbed in order to calculate oxygen levels in the blood. \nIn England, they are being given to people with Covid who are over 65, younger but have a health problem, or anyone doctors are concerned about. Similar schemes are being rolled out across the UK.\nPeople measure and record their oxygen levels three times a day. \nIf oxygen levels drop to 93% or 94%, then people speak to their GP or call 111. If they go below 92%, people should go to A&E or call 999 for an ambulance.\nStudies, which have not been reviewed by other scientists, have shown even small drops below 95% are linked to an increased risk of dying. \nDr Inada-Kim said: \"The point of this whole strategy is to try to get in early to prevent people getting that sick, by admitting patients at a more salvageable point in their illness.\"\nChris Harris, who is 70, was one of the first patients to benefit from the scheme.\nHe was being treated for a urinary infection in November last year, but then when he developed unexpected flu-like symptoms his GP sent him for a Covid test. It was positive.\n\"I don't mind admitting I was in tears, it was a very stressful, frightening time,\" he told Inside Health. \nHis oxygen levels dropped a couple of percentage points below the normal zone, so after a call with his GP, he went to hospital. \nAt this point he was still feeling fine, but things changed the day after he was admitted. \n\"My breathing started to get a little bit laboured, I had a high temperature as the days went on, [my oxygen levels] were progressively getting lower, they were in their 80s,\" he told me.\nChris was treated, did not need intensive care and has made a full recovery.\nHe said: \"I may have gone [to hospital] as the very last resort and that's the frightening thing. It was the oxygen meter that forced me to go, I would have just sat it out thinking I would recover. \n\"I am extremely lucky and very, very grateful.\"\nHis GP, Dr Caroline O'Keefe, says she has seen a massive increase in the number of people being monitored.\nShe said: \"On Christmas Day we were monitoring 44 patients, today I have 160 patients who I am monitoring daily. So we are certainly busy.\"\n\"We've had to quadruple the size of our team in the last two weeks.\" \nOverall, NHS England has supplied around 300,000 pulse oximeters for the home-monitoring scheme.\nDr Inada-Kim says there isn't definitive proof that the gadget saves lives and it could take until April to know for sure. However, the early signs are all positive.\n\"What we think we can see are the early seeds of a reduction in the length of stay after a hospital admission, an improvement in survival and a reduction in the pressures on the emergency services,\" he said.\nHe is so convinced of their role in tackling silent hypoxia that he said everyone should consider buying one. \n\"Personally I would, and I know a number of colleagues who have bought pulse oximeters to distribute to their loved ones,\" he said.\nHe advised checking they had a CE Kitemark and to avoid apps on smartphones, which he said were not as reliable. \nFollow James on Twitter."

      "text": "The government is being urged to give GCSE and A-level students more information about this year's exams as soon as possible. \nHead teachers say it would help pupils deal with the disruption caused by the recent Omicron surge.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh governments have confirmed that face coverings will remain compulsory in high schools. \nAll UK schools must offer face-to-face teaching to every age group, and provide effective online learning for pupils who are absent or isolating.\nThe specific Covid measures in place vary across the nations. \nAll school staff and secondary school pupils are asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week (three in Wales).\nIn England, secondary school pupils no longer need to wear masks in the classroom, and won't be required to wear them in communal areas from 27 January.\nA teachers union has urged the government to give GCSE and A-level students information about this year's exams ahead of the planned update on 7 February. Pupils will be offered a choice of topics in some subjects, but don't yet have the final details. \nIn Wales, some schools have reintroduced year-group bubbles, and have staggered start and finish times. Face coverings will remain compulsory in classrooms and communal areas until the end of the February half term, when schools will be expected to revert to their normal timetable. Rules will be reviewed on 10 February. \nIn Northern Ireland, schools reopened with the same measures as last term. New guidance says all primary and post-primary pupils in a class where there are multiple Covid cases should take an LFT. The overall guidance to schools will be reviewed in mid-February.\nIn Scotland, social distancing remains in place, pupils are separated into groups where possible. Pupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the 1m (3ft) social distancing rule still applies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the guidance for schools was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nThe latest data for England shows that 415,000 pupils (5.1%) were absent for Covid-related reasons on 20 Jan, up from 3.9% on 6 January.\nOver the same period, 4.5% of teachers and leaders were off because of Covid, although a quarter of schools had absence rates above 15%.\nIn addition, 4.7% of teaching assistants and other staff were off for Covid-related reasons. \nThe latest data in Northern Ireland shows that on 24 January, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covid - the highest rates since the new term began.\nIn Scotland on 21 January, 30,238 students (4.4%) were missing from school due to Covid-related reasons. \nMany schools have told the BBC they can't find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. A number of supply teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.\nEngland's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says the government is considering options to deal with staff shortages. \nHe previously urged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response.\nMr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes in the event of teacher shortages. \nBut teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children.\nYes - as long as they don't have any of the main Covid symptoms, under-18s don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. \nSimilarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. \nHowever, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advised to take LFTs for at least seven days. \nAll primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland should take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. \nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the second jab typically given 12 weeks after the first.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has also recommended that booster doses should be offered to children aged:\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has also been approved for five to 11-year-olds who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from Covid. \nThe JCVI also recommends that primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, but it's not yet clear when they might get the doses.\nChildren who aren't considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after testing positive for Covid before being vaccinated.\nVentilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid. \nIn England, the government is making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. \nLabour says this isn't enough, but the Department for Education says the units are only required in areas where doors and windows cannot be opened effectively.\nSome 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors had already been promised for England's schools to help identify areas with poor ventilation, but teaching unions complained this won't solve the problem. \nThe Scottish government gave \u00a3100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.\nThe Welsh government has a \u00a36m programme to increase air circulation and purity which will provide 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines."

      "text": "A diplomatic row has broken out between the UK and EU over the status of the bloc's ambassador in London.\nThe UK is refusing to give Joao Vale de Almeida the full diplomatic status that is granted to other ambassadors.\nThe Foreign Office is insisting he and his officials should not have the privileges and immunities afforded to diplomats under the Vienna Convention. \nIt is understood not to want to set a precedent by treating an international body in the same way as a nation state.\nAs it stands, the ambassador would not have the chance to present his credentials to the Queen like other diplomatic heads of mission. \nThe British decision is in marked contrast to 142 other countries around the world where the EU has delegations and where its ambassadors are all granted the same status as diplomats representing sovereign nations. \nJosep Borrell, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, has written to the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, to express his \"serious concerns\". \nThe issue is expected to be discussed by EU foreign ministers next Monday when they meet for the first time since the post-Brexit transition period ended on 31 December. \nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office wants to treat the EU delegation only as representatives of an international organisation. \nThis means EU diplomats would not have the full protection of the Vienna Convention, giving them immunity from detention, criminal jurisdiction and taxation. \nThe rights given to staff of international organisations are more ad hoc and less fixed. \nThe EU argues it is not a typical international organisation because it has its own currency, judicial system and the power to make law.\nIn his letter to Mr Raab last November, seen by the BBC, Mr Borrell says: \"Your service have sent us a draft proposal for an establishment agreement about which we have serious concerns. \n\"The arrangements offered do not reflect the specific character of the EU, nor do they respond to the future relationship between the EU and the UK as an important third country. \n\"It would not grant the customary privileges and immunities for the delegation and its staff. The proposals do not constitute a reasonable basis for reaching an agreement.\"\nEU officials privately accuse the Foreign Office of hypocrisy because when the EU's foreign service - known as the External Action Service - was set up in 2010 as a result of the Lisbon Treaty, the UK signed up to proposals that EU diplomats be granted the \"privileges and immunities equivalent to those referred to in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961\".\nOne EU source said: \"It seems petty. This is not about privileges, it's about principle. What does it say about the UK, about how much the British signature is worth?\"\nSome in the EU also fear hostile states might copy the UK and downgrade the protections granted to EU diplomats in their own countries. This could open them up to being harassed and make them easier for them to be expelled.\nA European Commission spokesman said: \"The UK, as a signatory to the Lisbon Treaty, is well aware of the EU's status in external relations, and was cognisant and supportive of this status while it was a member of the EU.\n\"The EU has 143 delegations, equivalent to diplomatic missions, around the world. Without exception, all host states have accepted to grant these delegations and their staff a status equivalent to that of diplomatic missions of states under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and the UK is well aware of this fact.\"\nHe added: \"Nothing has changed since the UK's exit from the European Union to justify any change in stance on the UK's part. \n\"The EU's status in external relations and its subsequent diplomatic status is amply recognised by countries and international organisations around the world, and we expect the United Kingdom to treat the EU Delegation accordingly and without delay.\"\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"Engagement continues with the EU on the long-term arrangements for the EU delegation to the UK. While discussions are still ongoing, it would not be appropriate for us to speculate on the detail of an eventual agreement.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government,Housing market,Estate agents,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "House hunters are taking advantage of lockdown rules to travel hundreds of miles to view homes, estate agents say.\nIn-person viewings are allowed in England, but estate agents have raised concerns about their safety and say some buyers are travelling across the country to look at second homes.\nFirms have said they are also currently facing increased demand before the stamp duty holiday ends on 31 March.\nThe government said the housing market is \"a key part of our economy\".\nIt has said the housing market in England will remain open during the national lockdown - but advises that initial viewings should be done virtually \"wherever possible\". \nBut firms say many buyers don't want virtual appointments. And many companies report increased demand as buyers rush to beat the end of the stamp duty holiday - applied on the first \u00a3500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland.\nOne estate agent who works in Yorkshire, who asked not to be named, said she knows colleagues who are \"ready for a complete nervous breakdown\" because they are being asked to book more in-person viewings and valuations.\nShe said people are travelling hundreds of miles to view properties \"because they can\" and some often \"don't social distance\" when they get there. She said many virtual slots go unused because \"people want physical viewings\".\n\"I was in one the other day and there's a three-year-old that comes and sits next to me\u2026 bringing me a doll. How can you say 'back off?' You can't,\" she said.\n\"I just think it's bonkers. I want to earn money, I want to earn commission, but not under these circumstances,\" she added.\nPaul Le Bas, regional director of a family-run estate agency in Hayle, Cornwall, said he would like the government to ask people not to travel to estate agents outside their local areas for non-essential purposes.\nHe said he turned down one person who wanted to travel about 400 miles from Bradford to look at a potential second home.\n\"We've taken the view as an agency that if it's just for a second home we don't deem that as essential travel, you can do that when lockdown's been lifted,\" he added. \"We weren't prepared to put ourselves at risk or our clients at risk. They got a bit shirty with us.\"\nRoly Matthews, director of an independent agency in Elmbridge, Surrey, said most of his clients want in-person viewings and estate agents have had to \"feel their way a bit as to what they think is essential or not\".\nHe knows some agencies are not screening their clients, giving members of the public \"a mixed signal\" and said the government would be \"sensible\" to consider further restrictions.\nMark Hayward, chief policy advisor at NAEA (National Agency of Estate Agents) Propertymark, said estate agents are under additional pressure to complete deals with the stamp duty deadline approaching.\n\"We've seen levels of sales on a monthly basis not seen since 2004,\" he said. \"We know the volume of sales that has to go through to qualify for that stamp duty holiday is large.\"\nHe urged estate agents to follow NAEA guidelines for house viewings, such as sanitising surfaces and limiting time in the property. The organisation also recommends people seeking to view property \"must be in a position to proceed\".\n\"In other words, they've either got cash or they've sold their own property so they're not having to go and put the house on the market and create huge delays.\"\nLast week, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer referred to house viewings when he raised concerns that England's lockdown may not be tough enough.\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the housing market has been allowed to remain open as it creates \"jobs as well as homes\". \n\"But all parties involved must continue to play their part in reducing the spread of the virus, by following our guidance to be Covid secure,\" a spokesman said.\nA petition calling for the stamp duty holiday to be extended by six months has gained over 115,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for debate in Parliament."

      "title": "Biden inauguration: Katy's anthem, Bernie's mittens and other moments",
      "tags": "Kamala Harris,Bernie Sanders,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Joe Biden is officially president, Kamala Harris is the country's first Madam Vice-President and Donald Trump flew off to play golf - all of that we expected.\nBut here's a look at those inauguration day moments you might have missed, some solemn, some emotional, but also the podium wipe guy.\nIt was hard to find any downbeat comments after the white-clad Katy fired off her epic anthem to close out the day in front of the Washington Monument - as the Bidens stood watching from their balcony.\nAlthough Firework as a song has drawn many interpretations, from sex to firework safety to LGBT rights, it seemed a pretty good fit here.\nThe exploding background didn't do any harm, but the lyrics weren't too off track either.\n\"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag/Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?\"\nWell-known Twitch streamer hasanabi tweeted \"katy perry is right, trump DID make me feel like plastic bag!\"\nOh, and the song swept back into the US iTunes chart of course.\nThat's how it all ended but let's go back to the start...\nBefore Joe took over, Donald first had to leave.\nPerhaps not all of the Trump administration could be called carefully choreographed, but the strains of Frank Sinatra's My Way ringing out as Air Force One swept Mr Trump out of the presidency and off to Florida is hard to fault. \nWe can't say for sure he planned it himself and the other tunes banging out at Andrews base - like Elton John's Funeral for a Friend - were hard to parse for some.\nMr Trump's a big fan of Sinatra apparently. Though it's not reciprocated - Sinatra's daughter, Nancy, said her father loathed the then real estate mogul.\nThe other Trumpism drawing attention was Melania's outfit change. \nIt was quickly pointed out that Mrs Trump had used her flight from Andrews to Florida to quickly update her wardrobe to suit her new, post-first lady life.\nSome noted her relaxed smile after touching down in Florida - an apparent contrast to her demeanour at her husband's inauguration four years ago. \nAnd on to the inauguration ceremony...\nThe first sensation came from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders with his sensible choices for Washington's near-freezing weather - an outdoorsy jacket with woollen mittens accoutred with a brown manila envelope. \nChannelling a grumpy uncle at a February wedding or a man in an unheated waiting room, he brought new glory to the timeworn philosophy of bringing yourself and nothing else to an occasion. \nIt's clearly a creed that President Biden's choice for Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, ascribes to as she too was pictured wearing a cold-defying black parka, a face mask and black gloves. And a BYOB (bring your own blanket).\nBut the patterned brown wool mittens have a story of their own that is also very on brand and had some gushing. The mittens were reportedly made by schoolteacher Jen Ellis from his home state of Vermont, using repurposed wool sweaters and recycled plastic bottles.\nA nod to Senator Cory Booker for one of the coldest barbs of the day.\nThe New Jersey Democrat got a ton of reaction for his Facebook post welcoming the inauguration no-show of the 45th president, Donald Trump, by saying the temperature was -45.\nThe colour purple - well hues of it at least - hit the small screen in a big way.\nKamala Harris in purple, Hillary Clinton in amethyst, Michelle Obama in a plum-coloured turtleneck and trouser design.\nWhy purple? Well it has a long history with the suffragette movement, and has been promoted by some as an intertwining of Republican red and Democrat blue. It's a unity thing.\nLady Gaga appeared with a gold Schiaparelli gilded dove of peace brooch so large it threatened to fly her off the stage as she sang the national anthem. Suffice it to say she was on less controversial ground with an ancient symbol of love and peace than a dress made of meat (like the one she wore back in 2010).\nOne - in fact two - of the sweetest outfits were worn by Amara and Leela Ajagu, the four- and two-year-old great nieces of Kamala Harris. They wore their faux leopard fur coats because they wanted to be like her.\nMs Harris had worn a similar outfit in a 1970s photo with the children's grandmother (and her sister), Maya Harris.\nWhich brings us on the kids' father, Nikolas. He's the partner of Kamala's niece, Meena, and was also the subject of a social media trawl after an eagle-eyed screen-shotter spied a pair of jaunty Dior Air Jordan 1 sneakers on the stairs during  Senator Amy Klobuchar's speech.\nHe did get some stick, with tongue-in-cheek praise for \"making black history\" and \"daring to drip\" at a presidential inauguration. The shoes are limited edition and could get $10,000 on resale. Meena later explained in a tweet.\nBut it wasn't all fashion.\nBarack Obama - the country's first black president - exchanged an inauguration day fist bump with Kamala Harris.\nThe moment was celebrated as a historic passing of the torch between the two political trailblazers, the only black Americans in history elected to serve in the White House. \nKamala Harris also had a special security escort: Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman.\nMr Goodman has been hailed as a hero after his actions during the storming of Capitol Hill earlier this month. Footage from inside the deadly insurrection shows the officer singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chamber, while the lawmakers hid inside. \nMr Goodman accompanied Ms Harris in his new role as deputy Senate sergeant-at-arms.\nShe took her oath with her trademark smile about to burst through the historic moment, and as President Biden took his the emotion was also evident on his wife Jill's face. \nAnd as the podium was handed from one storied speaker to another - from senators to longtime advisers of President Biden - one man made sure to jostle them to the side before they took the microphone, for their own protection of course.\nPodium wipe guy, as he became known, disinfected the stand between each speaker and was lauded (online) as one of the unsung heroes of the day. It's never been seen before at an inauguration, it's a ritual that may well be here to stay.\nAnd finally - we knew to expect poet Amanda Gorman in the inauguration line-up, but we did not know how much she would resonate with people around the world.\n\"When day comes, we ask ourselves where can we find light in this never-ending shade?\" began Gorman, the country's youngest ever inaugural poet.\nAt today's celebration, the 22-year-old performed her poem titled \"The Hill We Climb\"- penned after the Capitol riots. The writer and performer became the country's first national youth poet laureate in 2017. \nToday, the self-described \"skinny black girl, descended from slaves... [who] can dream of becoming president\" has found \"herself reciting for one\". But her ambitions don't end there - according to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Ms Gorman has promised a future presidential run of her own. "

      "tags": "Russia,Alexei Navalny,Moscow,Vladimir Putin",
      "text": "A video investigation by Russia's leading opposition figure that claims President Vladimir Putin spent illicit funds on an extravagant Black Sea palace has reached more than 20 million people within a day of publication.\nAlexei Navalny's team released it after he was jailed on his return to Moscow.\nThe investigation alleges the property cost \u00a31bn ($1.37bn) and was paid for \"with the largest bribe in history\".\nThe Kremlin denies the property belongs to the president.\nClaims that federal officials were guarding a vast palace complex on the Black Sea coast were \"pure nonsense\", spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\nThe Navalny investigation describes the property as 39 times the size of Monaco. \nThe report was released on Tuesday, two days after Mr Navalny flew back from Germany and was arrested at the airport.\nHe was placed in pre-trial detention for 30 days on Monday on a charge of violating probation terms for a suspended sentence for embezzlement that he maintains is politically motivated. A separate case against him was due to start on Wednesday but was postponed.\nThe 44-year-old was almost killed in a nerve agent attack last August, which he blamed personally on Mr Putin. The Kremlin denies involvement. \nThe opposition politician's allegations of security service involvement have, however, been backed up by reports from investigative journalists.\nThe report claims the property in the resort town of Gelendzhik was constructed using illicit funds provided by members of Mr Putin's inner circle, including oil chiefs and billionaires.\n\"[They] built a palace for their boss with this money,\" Mr Navalny says in the video.\nIt alleges that Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) owns some 27 sq miles (70 sq km) of land surrounding the private residence.\nThe report describes various details of the property, and claims it features a casino, an underground ice hockey complex and a vineyard.\n\"It has impregnable fences, its own port, its own security, a church, its own permit system, a no-fly zone, and even its own border checkpoint,\" Mr Navalny says in the video.\n\"It is a separate state within Russia,\" he adds. \"And in this state there is a single, irreplaceable tsar. Putin.\"\nMr Peskov told state news agency RIA Novosti on Tuesday that claims made in the report were \"untrue\" and that the president \"doesn't own palaces\". \nHe went further on Wednesday, insisting that the president declared all his property annually. \"These are all absolutely unfounded claims,\" he said. \"This is pure nonsense and... there's nothing else in it.\"\nThe video report was released on Tuesday and, within little over 24 hours, it had already been viewed more than 22 million times.\nIt ends with a plea for people to take to the streets. \"If 10% of those who are disaffected take to the streets, the government will not dare falsify elections,\" Mr Navalny says.\nAlexei Navalny had already raised the stakes by returning to Russia. It was a direct challenge to President Putin: the man he accuses of ordering his poisoning. \nSo it came as no surprise when he was detained at the airport and remanded in custody for 30 days. \nBut it seems that from his cell, Russia's most high-profile opposition figure still has the power to embarrass the Kremlin. Within hours his investigation into \"Putin's Palace\" had notched up millions of views.\nMr Navalny's supporters have called for protests this weekend to demand his release. Will images of an opulent palace and new accusations of corruption bring more people onto the streets? \nThat's unclear. One thing, however, is certain: Mr Navalny has achieved something that seemed impossible just a day ago. In his confrontation with the authorities, he's raised the stakes even higher.\nOn 2 February, a court will consider whether a suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years that Mr Navalny received in 2014 on fraud charges should be converted into a jail term.\nThree days later, he will face another court appearance, on a charge of libelling a World War Two veteran.\nHe is being held at the Matrosskaya Tishina prison in Moscow, after a judge ordered his detention until 15 February for violating the terms of his suspended fraud sentence. Instead of reporting regularly to the prison service, he was recuperating in Germany from the nerve agent attack.\nA makeshift courtroom was organised on Monday at a police station in Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow, where Mr Navalny had spent the night. \nHe travelled to Russia from Germany - where he had been receiving medical treatment since August - despite warnings he would be arrested on arrival.\nMr Navalny said his legal treatment was beyond a \"mockery of justice\" and described Monday's hearing as \"lawlessness of the highest grade\".\nHis lawyers have said they are planning to appeal against the \"illegal\" court decision, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. \nThere are also questions over whether his detention contravenes a 2018 decision by Europe's top human rights court, which found the fraud charges against Mr Navalny were \"arbitrary\"."

      "text": "Boris Johnson expects everybody to go \"above and beyond\" in following Covid rules, his spokeswoman has said after Conservative Welsh politicians were seen drinking during a pub alcohol ban.\nSenedd Tory leader Paul Davies, Darren Millar and Labour's Alun Davies have apologised for drinking in the Welsh Parliament days after the ban started. \nThey are not thought to have broken the rules, but the two Tories admitted it would not be seen as in their spirit.\nSenedd authorities are investigating.\nA fourth Senedd Member Nick Ramsay has denied being part of the gathering.\nOn 8 December, a group of Members of the Senedd and staff drank alcohol in the Ty Hywel building in Cardiff Bay, which houses the Senedd's offices.\nA ban on the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premises came into force in Wales at 18:00 GMT on 4 December - four days before the politicians were seen drinking together - although hospitality businesses could sell alcohol to take away after 18:00.\nCatering company Charlton House has the licence for serving alcohol on Senedd premises. \nThe Welsh Government stated on Tuesday that the alcohol ban applied to the person running the licensed premises, rather than customers.\nSpeaking at a journalists' lobby briefing Allegra Stratton, Boris Johnson's press secretary, said she had not spoken to the prime minister about whether Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies should remain in post.\nBut she added: \"The prime minister needs everybody - no matter their status, no matter their position in life - to be going above and beyond in following the rules on Covid.\"\nThe former chairman of a Westminster standards watchdog questioned whether the three involved should be put up for election at the next Welsh Parliament polls on 6 May. \nSir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said if the allegations were proven \"then both parties are bound to ask questions\" ahead of the election. \n\"Do they want such people, who have shown such a lack of leadership, standing for election?,\" he said. \nHe told BBC Radio Wales: \"I think it's very serious, poor behaviour by a group of politicians who we expect to give a lead about the spirit of the rules never mind the precise detail.\"\nHe said the action by the Labour Party - to suspend Alun Davies - was appropriate and the Conservatives \"should have done the same\". \nMr Ramsay was deselected by his local Conservative group last month after 13 years.\nA statement from his solicitor, Tim Gir, said Mr Ramsay was at the tea room on his own at the Senedd, without an invitation from anyone else, after work.\n\"He was hungry and he wanted to get something to eat. He was working on an article for the Argus [newspaper]. He sat on his own and was socially distanced,\" said Mr Gir.\n\"He attended the tea room at approximately 6pm. He had a chicken curry. He left at about 8pm. Others came in whilst he was there but it was not a 'gathering' Mr Ramsay was part of.\"\nOn Wednesday afternoon the health minister said the \"last thing\" that should happen at the end of an investigation was that \"it's only staff who essentially get thrown under the bus, everyone needs to look what they've done\".\nAt a press conference, Vaughan Gething refused to be drawn on whether the Tory members should stand down or be suspended.\nBut he said the Labour group's decision to suspend Alun Davies \"was the right thing\" to do.\nHe said he himself had been subject of press stories \"where some people made comments, without wanting to understand the facts or not being interested in them so I don't think I should then lay in on an issue like this\".\nBut, he added: \"Any sense of people not all being in this together, isn't helpful in terms of the message that we all need to follow.\"\nA senior Conservative source has told BBC Wales they were \"totally flabbergasted\" that the party Senedd members involved have not stood down pending the investigation.\n\"There's a lot of anger and I don't know how they can continue,\" the source added.\n\"Everyone I've spoken to in the party is just completely baffled by this.\n\"This is a complete own goal.\"\nDavid Fouweather, a Conservative councillor in Newport, said the Tories involved should \"stand aside and go\".\nOne senior Conservative grassroots official who contacted BBC Wales said: \"I'm furious. The party messaging is trying to break up the Cardiff Bay cartel and they're having nice drinks with Alun Davies who, let's not forget, has been really vicious in public against us.\n\"I've spoken to a lot of Conservatives and they're not happy at all.\n\"Nobody is going to put their head on the line for Paul Davies. I'll be very surprised if he continues to the end of the week.\"\nThe official also referred to Mr Millar's call at the start of the pandemic for the first minister to sack Health Minister Vaughan Gething over claims he broke Covid rules at the time when he sat and ate chips while on a walk with his family. \nThe grassroots activist said: \"Darren Millar talking about Vaughan Gething having his chips - well, what on earth is he doing?\"\nAnother Conservative councillor said: \"Paul's position as leader is now untenable, especially when you consider the strain that hardworking people are under.\"\nA senior Welsh Government minister also joined calls for the Conservative Party to take action of its own.\nEluned Morgan, mental health minister, said she had written to the party asking it suspend those involved while \"investigations continue into this alleged incident\".\nLabour has suspended Alun Davies from the party's Senedd group pending an investigation.\nPlaid Cymru MS Rhun ap Iorwerth said politicians failed to set \"the best example that's something that should be regretted by all of us\".\n\"I want to be talking about how we can push government to deliver better in its response to this pandemic,\" he said.\n\"It's a matter of concern to me that distractions like this move the focus from where it should be and where you then have questions about the role of political leaders - and I count all of us, whether in government or in opposition, in that bracket.\"\nCharlton House said it was \"aware of an alleged breach of public health regulations at the Senedd estate\" and took its \"responsibilities and obligations to restrictions and public health regulations across the UK very seriously\". \n\"We are currently undertaking a full investigation into this matter,\" the firm added. \nWales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said it was \"important that everybody follows the rules\".\n\"I don't know the details of what may or may not have happened down there, I'm sure that will come out in the fullness of time,\" he told BBC Wales Live on Tuesday.\nA statement on behalf of Paul Davies, Darren Millar and Welsh Conservative chief of staff Paul Smith, who was also at the meeting, said they were \"profoundly sorry\".\n\"While we did not break the rules, we recognise that what was part of a day's work would not be seen to be following the spirit of them, especially given the tough time the country has been going through,\" the statement said.\nA spokesman for the Senedd Labour Group said a member had been suspended from the group \"while an investigation takes place into this alleged incident\". \nIn his statement, Labour's Alun Davies said: \"I am very sorry if my actions have given the impression that I am in any way not committed to upholding the regulations which I have consistently supported throughout the last year.\"\nHe said the purpose of the meeting \"was to seek to persuade the Welsh Conservatives to support my proposal for a Welsh Hearts Bill, which the Senedd endorsed on 21 October, and to make a commitment to enact this life-saving legislation in their manifesto for May's election\". \nAlun Davies added: \"The Senedd Commission has already confirmed to me that I did not breach the coronavirus regulations on the consumption of either food or alcohol that were in force at that time.\"\nA spokesman for the Senedd Commission said: \"We are aware of an incident on the Senedd estate last month which may have been contrary to public health regulations in force at the time. \n\"The Senedd Commission takes the public health regulations in Wales very seriously and is currently investigating the matter in order to establish an accurate account of what took place and to determine whether action may be required.\""

      "tags": "Washington DC,US election 2020,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Chief Justice Roberts, Vice-President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice-President Pence. My distinguished guests, my fellow Americans.\nThis is America's day. This is democracy's day. A day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages, America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge. Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause, a cause of democracy. The people - the will of the people - has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded.\nWe've learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile and, at this hour my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundations, we come together as one nation under God - indivisible - to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.\nAs we look ahead in our uniquely American way, restless, bold, optimistic, and set our sights on a nation we know we can be and must be, I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. And I know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength, the strength of our nation, as does President Carter, who I spoke with last night who cannot be with us today, but who we salute for his lifetime of service.\nI've just taken a sacred oath each of those patriots have taken. The oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. On we the people who seek a more perfect union. This is a great nation, we are good people. And over the centuries through storm and strife in peace and in war we've come so far. But we still have far to go.\nWe'll press forward with speed and urgency for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibility. Much to do, much to heal, much to restore, much to build and much to gain. Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now. A once in a century virus that silently stalks the country has taken as many lives in one year as in all of World War Two.\nMillions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself, a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear now. The rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism, that we must confront and we will defeat.\nTo overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America, requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy - unity. Unity. In another January on New Year's Day in 1863 Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper the president said, and I quote, 'if my name ever goes down in history, it'll be for this act, and my whole soul is in it'.\nMy whole soul is in it today, on this January day. My whole soul is in this. Bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation. And I ask every American to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the foes we face - anger, resentment and hatred. Extremism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness, and hopelessness.\nWith unity we can do great things, important things. We can right wrongs, we can put people to work in good jobs, we can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome the deadly virus, we can rebuild work, we can rebuild the middle class and make work secure, we can secure racial justice and we can make America once again the leading force for good in the world.\nI know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal, that we are all created equal, and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism and fear have torn us apart. The battle is perennial and victory is never secure.\nThrough civil war, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setback, our better angels have always prevailed. In each of our moments enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward and we can do that now. History, faith and reason show the way. The way of unity.\nWe can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbours. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature. For without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury, no progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge. And unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America.\nIf we do that, I guarantee we will not failed. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we've acted together. And so today at this time in this place, let's start afresh, all of us. Let's begin to listen to one another again, hear one another, see one another. Show respect to one another. Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war and we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. \nMy fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. We have to be better than this and I believe America is so much better than this. Just look around. Here we stand in the shadow of the Capitol dome. As mentioned earlier, completed in the shadow of the Civil War. When the union itself was literally hanging in the balance. We endure, we prevail. Here we stand, looking out on the great Mall, where Dr King spoke of his dream.\nHere we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And today we mark the swearing in of the first woman elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can't change. Here we stand where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace.\nAnd here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen, it will never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever. To all those who supported our campaign, I'm humbled by the faith you placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this. Hear us out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart.\nIf you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peacefully. And the guardrail of our democracy is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. If you hear me clearly, disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you. I will be a President for all Americans, all Americans. And I promise you I will fight for those who did not support me as for those who did.\nMany centuries ago, St Augustine - the saint of my church - wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love. Defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects we as Americans love, that define us as Americans? I think we know. Opportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honour, and yes, the truth.\nRecent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens as Americans and especially as leaders. Leaders who are pledged to honour our Constitution to protect our nation. To defend the truth and defeat the lies.\nLook, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs. I understand like their dad they lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling thinking: 'Can I keep my healthcare? Can I pay my mortgage?' Thinking about their families, about what comes next. I promise you, I get it. But the answer's not to turn inward. To retreat into competing factions. Distrusting those who don't look like you, or worship the way you do, who don't get their news from the same source as you do.\nWe must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say. Just for a moment, stand in their shoes.\nBecause here's the thing about life. There's no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days you need a hand. There are other days when we're called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be, that's what we do for one another. And if we are that way our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. And we can still disagree.\nMy fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us we're going to need each other. We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We're entering what may be the darkest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation, one nation. And I promise this, as the Bible says, 'Weeping may endure for a night, joy cometh in the morning'. We will get through this together. Together.\nLook folks, all my colleagues I serve with in the House and the Senate up here, we all understand the world is watching. Watching all of us today. So here's my message to those beyond our borders. America has been tested and we've come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances, and engage with the world once again. Not to meet yesterday's challenges but today's and tomorrow's challenges. And we'll lead not merely by the example of our power but the power of our example.\nFellow Americans, moms, dads, sons, daughters, friends, neighbours and co-workers. We will honour them by becoming the people and the nation we can and should be. So I ask you let's say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, those left behind and for our country. Amen.\nFolks, it's a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy, and on truth, a raging virus, a stinging inequity, systemic racism, a climate in crisis, America's role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with one of the greatest responsibilities we've had. Now we're going to be tested. Are we going to step up?\nIt's time for boldness for there is so much to do. And this is certain, I promise you. We will be judged, you and I, by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era. We will rise to the occasion. Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children? I believe we must and I'm sure you do as well. I believe we will, and when we do, we'll write the next great chapter in the history of the United States of America. The American story.\nA story that might sound like a song that means a lot to me, it's called American Anthem. And there's one verse that stands out at least for me and it goes like this:\n'The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day, which shall be our legacy, what will our children say?\nLet me know in my heart when my days are through, America, America, I gave my best to you.'\nLet us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great nation. If we do this, then when our days are through, our children and our children's children will say of us: 'They gave their best, they did their duty, they healed a broken land.'\nMy fellow Americans I close the day where I began, with a sacred oath. Before God and all of you, I give you my word. I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution, I'll defend our democracy.\nI'll defend America and I will give all - all of you - keep everything I do in your service. Thinking not of power but of possibilities. Not of personal interest but of public good.\nAnd together we will write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity not division, of light not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness. May this be the story that guides us. The story that inspires us. And the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history, we met the moment. Democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrive.\nThat America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forbearers, one another, and generations to follow.\nSo with purpose and resolve, we turn to those tasks of our time. Sustained by faith, driven by conviction and devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts. May God bless America and God protect our troops."

      "title": "Kamala Harris and a 1986 snapshot of that Howard generation",
      "tags": "Kamala Harris,US Capitol stormed,US election 2020,Joe Biden",
      "text": "There is a photograph of Kamala Harris, taken in 1986, while she was a student at Howard University. \nShe and two other friends, all shoulder pads and plaid, are smiling and laughing, a crowd behind them. It's a picture brimming with energy and hope. \nIt's been used a lot in telling the extraordinary story of her rise to become the first black and Asian American woman to be vice-president and the first person who attended one of America's HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) to get to such a position. \nBut this is the story of the other women in the photograph, her two best friends - Valarie Pippen and Karen Gibbs - as well as of others who might have been milling about in the background there. \nThis was the 1980s, when the children of America's civil rights generation came of age. Being at Howard University, an HBCU at a time when solidarity with the global anti-apartheid movement was reaching fever pitch and at the height of Reaganism, was a formative experience for many of them.\nNow they are about to witness one of their own become vice-president. What have their journeys been like and what does this moment feel like?\nHistorically Black Colleges, like Howard University, were founded in order to educate African Americans who were otherwise prohibited from attending college, after slavery. \nAlthough that has now changed, a core part of the Howard message remains its focus on cultivating black leaders - it is not just about academic achievement, but social activism too.  \nKamala Harris has made clear the influence Howard University had on her career and life goals. Last week, on the anniversary of her sorority's founding date, she posted on Instagram, paying homage to her Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, and referring to her days at Howard, attending anti-apartheid marches and being part of the debate team: \"Howard taught me that while you will often find that you're the only one in the room who looks like you, or who has had the experiences you've had, you must remember: you are never alone.\" \nLike Ms Harris, I also went to Howard University and became a member of that same sorority decades later. \nI became intrigued by the stories of the other women and graduates who ventured out into the same world during the same time as Kamala.\nIn that photograph, Valarie Pippen is on the right and smiling with confidence at the camera. \nHer parents attended historically black colleges after moving north with the great migration, which was the movement over decades of millions of African Americans to the North from the South, where economic uncertainty and segregation prevailed. They settled in the Chicago region and forged successful careers. \nShe was led to Howard, specifically, after her older brother attended and brought home a yearbook that intrigued her.\n\"The culture was festive and lively yet focused on academic and cultural advancement of oppressed people,\" says Ms Pippen. \"We knew that our generation would make a difference with our success.\"\nMs Pippen says that at Howard University \"we all had more of a striving to do well, a striving to live with integrity and to make your mark on the world\".\nComing from a high-achieving and proud black family with high expectations of their children, she was brought up knowing that her college experience was going to be important.  \nShe is now a healthcare consultant, and after graduating from Howard she attended medical school at Yale. \nShe recalls the commitment to academic excellence, the need to prove your worth out there in the world and how that also translated into many nights studying with her good friend Kamala.    \n\"There was one year at Howard, we both stayed for summer school. We worked during the day, did night classes and we studied together afterwards. We did that for the whole summer and we had fun.\n\"She was born for the job. Her dedication - like mine - was to academics, being an all around good person and to integrity.\"\nIn the 1990s, 52% of black pharmacy recipients, 30% of dentistry degree recipients, and 27% of theology degree recipients were all educated at HBCUs.\nToday, the two oldest HBCU medical schools - Meharry Medical College and Howard University - are responsible for more than 80% of black doctors and dentists practising in the US. \nHBCUs have educated three-quarters of all black people holding a doctorate; three-quarters of all black officers in the armed forces; and four-fifths of all black federal judges, according to the US Department of Education. \nThe culture they fostered was hugely important for many ambitious and successful middle- and upper-class class black families going out into a world to become leaders in their field, within one generation of getting the right to vote.   \nKaren Gibbs, pictured on the left in that photo, remains best friends with the vice-president elect and Valarie Pippen. \nShe is now an attorney and speaks of her time at Howard in the same way Kamala Harris has in the past.\nThere was \"a lot of black pride and a lot of black love\" in the Howard community, says Ms Gibbs. \n\"We had black professors who loved us. That was the beauty of going to Howard. They nurtured us, they groomed us. They were realistic to tell us what we would confront when we left Howard - but they equipped us to realise and achieve our dreams.\" \nThat environment was especially important as an escape from the realities of society.\n\"I was raised in a rural area in Delaware, and the people there were really racist. I had been called bad names by a lot of people, despite having a black family and smaller community filled with educators and proud of their roots,\" says Ms Gibbs.\nThat is one of the reasons that she wanted to attend Howard University, to become a civil rights lawyer. She made the move so that she could be surrounded by \"love\" and \"support\". \n\"It was never a matter if I would go to an HBCU,\" it was just a matter of which she would go to. \nMs Gibbs and Ms Pippen's experience at Howard University strikes a chord with others who were also there in the 1980s. \nThey speak of the open fostering of social awareness and political activism in movements happening off campus.  \nBeing in the nation's capital, Howard in particular had a front-row seat to some memorable episodes in politics. \nDexter Cole, a Howard alumnus and now top executive at TV One, told the BBC that \"our parents actively participated in the civil rights movements and were at the forefront, and we came to Howard with a sense of commitment to not only improve the lives of ourselves, but others as well\".\nAcross the nation, HBCUs were training a generation who would have a large impact on the world, and the progression of the broader African-American community. \n\"We understood that we were agents of change.\"\nMr Cole explained that \"social unrest was very prevalent, but as a student body we knew that we had a seat at the table because of those we saw who went before us\".\n\"I remember marching on Capitol Hill on the National Mall. There was a group of students going to protest to make Martin Luther King Jr's birthday a national holiday, and now I look there is a memorial just where I marched.\n\"We knew what our rights were and we were determined to invoke our right. That's why there were so many of us active in the anti-apartheid movement - we saw it play out in the US,\" says Ms Gibbs. \n\"It was a time when a lot of people from the era transcended into important places in different parts of society,\" says Lita Rosario-Richardson.\nMs Rosario-Richardson is currently an entertainment lawyer. On campus, she recruited Ms Harris on to the debate team.  \n\"The election of Kamala Harris has really made crystal clear that Howard prepares you for anything,\" she adds. \nAlthough it is no surprise to those who knew Kamala Harris that she is now the vice-president of the United States, it feels like a vindication for their own personal journeys and the philosophy they took forward with them into the wider world. \n\"It was instilled that with your education comes a responsibility to improve the world - specifically our own people. And, we see that that has benefited everyone in America. \n\"Kamala is a child of desegregation, like myself. Her nomination seemed historically fit, and she's the right person for it,\" Ms Rosario-Richardson adds.\n\"Alumni like Thurgood Marshall - the first black Supreme Court Justice - who attended Howard laid the framework.\"\nEven during their time as students, these alumni felt that they were connected to greatness and expected to make big strides in the world. \nIt was not a feeling confined to Kamala Harris. The stories of these women show many have become movers and shakers in their own fields.\n\"All this has come full circle,\" says Andrea Holmes, a graduate who is now a marketing executive. \n\"The vice-presidency is where she belongs. She is the role model of the world and to all women and little girls.\" \nThe original photograph of Kamala, Valarie and Karen was taken in 1986 at Howard University's famous Homecoming.  \nAt most schools in the US, homecoming is an annual tradition marked by an American football game and partying. At Howard University, homecoming is marked by a football game as well as a week of events where all generations come back to meet and celebrate. Notable graduates as well as celebrities and artists come to perform, join discussions, and be part of the week. \nAs a graduate, I know Homecoming remains a highly anticipated annual event, an experience like no other. That picture captures the energy, friendship and ambition of a group of women, at Howard in an electric era, who felt capable of anything. \nValarie Pippen remembers the moment: \"The weekend was truly exhilarating, and you can see from the looks and smiles on our faces we were having the time of our lives.\" "

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: No more 'easy wins' for hospital staff",
      "tags": "Queen Elizabeth University Hospital,NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The emergency department at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is the biggest and busiest in Scotland.\nAmbulances keep arriving, bringing more patients. In a curtained cubicle, one man is explaining to the doctor that he's been in pain for days, but he put off coming in \"because of everything that's going on\".\nDr Alan Whitelaw, who runs the department, says that while there might be fewer patients coming through his door, there are no longer any \"easy wins\".\n\"Those that are coming are the sick people,\" he says. \"We are undoubtedly seeing the effects of people not seeking healthcare for six to 10 months.\n\"We are seeing disease that we wouldn't always see and we are seeing it further down the road.\n\"We are making more diagnoses that potentially would be made in primary care or outpatient clinics.  On top of that we've got lots of Covid patients coming through the door.\n\"So it is those two things together that currently put the NHS under that significant pressure.\"\nAll over Scotland, hospitals are under severe pressure, with some treating significantly more coronavirus patients than they did during the first wave of the pandemic.  \nPublic visitors are not allowed at the QEUH, but BBC Scotland was given special permission to film to highlight the impact of Covid and the importance of following lockdown rules.\nOn the day of the BBC's visit, there are 244 Covid patients. Critical care is running at capacity, and across the whole hospital it's a constant challenge to find space for new patients. \nDr Whitelaw says the level of unpredictability is extreme. His team has run out of spare beds.\n \"We are ten months into strange and difficult times. It's winter, no-one's had a holiday, no-one's had much downtime. \n\"Hospitals are fuller in winter, beds are tighter and patients are sick\".\nUpstairs, one ward that previously treated patients with infectious diseases like flu or norovirus, is now a Covid ward. All 28 beds are full.\nSome patients here are recently diagnosed, others are coming to the end of their isolation, while some have been stepped down from critical care, but need rehabilitation.\nSenior charge nurse Karen Paton says it feels like patients are now sicker for longer.\n\"We've had this going on for more or less a year now and staff are beginning to feel the emotional distress of it,\" she says.\n\"Having to deal with patients succumbing to coronavirus, and just having the emotions of all the patients not being able to have contact from their families.\n \"I think it's beginning to take its toll on everybody.\"\nIn one room on the ward is Gerry Gilroy, who tested positive for Covid in late December. By 8 January, the day of his 66th birthday, he could barely get out of bed and couldn't eat.\n\"It just hit me and I knew there was something not right,\" he says.\n\"I know how serious it is. I never thought it would hit me. It's been a bit of an experience but thankfully I'm on the mend.\n\"The staff here are superb. When I get out of here, if I can do something for the NHS I'm going to. Doctors, cleaners, nurses, all top drawer.\"\nThe impact of Covid is being felt across the hospital. The acute receiving area used to be the first stop for people who needed urgent surgery.\nNow it's where medics like Dr Colin Perry assess Covid patients sent in by their GP or NHS 24. It's another area that's full.\n\"In the first wave our ICU was busy and it remains very busy, but during that period we had free beds,\" says Dr Perry.\n\"This time we have much more pressure on the downstream ward areas, so it is harder to manage the wider needs of the hospital and make room for patients to move through the system.\n\"The numbers are far higher than they were a year ago.\"\nRepurposing so many wards to treat coronavirus patients has meant some routine work had to be postponed, but staff are working to prioritise all different kinds of treatment.\nHelen Dorrance is a senior surgeon who specialises in bowel cancer at the QEUH. On the day the BBC visits she is operating on patients from another hospital to help relieve pressures there.\nDemand for critical care makes it difficult to operate some services, but cancer treatment is still running.\n\"We work together as a team across the region to make sure people who are the highest priority get dealt with,\" she says. \"But everyone gets their fair share and access to the care they need.\n \"It's not a choice, we do have to provide the best care we can for Covid patients and my critical care colleagues are stepping up to the mark.\n\"But the rest of us are making sure the rest of the service runs the way it should, so if you have your heart attack or stroke the right people are there to give you the best care.\"\nComing to hospital for any reason during the pandemic is a different experience, and services are stretched.\nBut the emergency department's Dr Whitelaw adds that no matter what happens, they will cope.\n \"We don't come to work to worry or be fearful, we come to work to do our best and to help,\" he says. \n\"I think there's an uncertainty about what the next two to three weeks look like. \n\"It might be very, very challenging but I have absolute faith that the staff here will continue to do everything that is required.\n \"I think the public should be reassured that no matter what is thrown at us we will definitely get through it.\""

      "tags": "Glastonbury,Glastonbury Festival,Music",
      "text": "Glastonbury Festival has been cancelled for a second year running due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe news was announced on Thursday on the Worthy Farm event's Twitter page.\n\"With great regret, we must announce that this year's Glastonbury Festival will not take place,\" said festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis. \n\"And that this will be another enforced fallow year for us. Tickets for this year will roll over to next year. Michael & Emily.\"\nIt comes in the same week that the future of UK music was up for debate at a DCMS inquiry into streaming, and in Parliament regarding post-Brexit music touring visas.\nThe full statement on the festival website read: \"In spite of our efforts to move heaven and earth, it has become clear that we simply will not be able to make the Festival happen this year. We are so sorry to let you all down.\"\nIt confirmed that as with last year, anyone with a ticket will now be offered the opportunity to roll their \u00a350 deposit over to next year, when the festival will hopefully resume. It had been due to take place in June 2021.\n\"We are very appreciative of the faith and trust placed in us by those of you with deposits, and we are very confident we can deliver something really special for us all in 2022!\"\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden shared his \"disappointment\" at the lack of a Glastonbury 2021, on Twitter.\n\"This regrettable but understandable decision is recognition that public health comes first\" he posted, \"and that right now, getting 200k fans together in just a few months looks very difficult to make safe\".\nHe added: \"We continue to help the arts on recovery, including looking at problems around getting insurance. I'm Glastonbury will be back bigger and better next year.\"\nJulian Knight MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said news of this year's cancellation was \"devastating\". \n\"We have repeatedly called for ministers to act to protect our world-renowned festivals like this one with a government-backed insurance scheme. Our plea fell on deaf ears and now the chickens have come home to roost,\" he said.\n\"The jewel in the crown will be absent but surely the government cannot ignore the message any longer - it must act now to save this vibrant and vital festivals sector.\"\nOn 5 January the government responded to a report by UK Music called Let the Music Play: Save Our Summer 2021, which outlined a range of measures that could help the industry get back up and running.\nThe government said: \"We know these are challenging times for the live events sector and are working flat out to support it.\n\"Our \u00a31.57bn Culture Recovery Fund has already seen more than \u00a31bn offered to arts, heritage and performance organisations to support them through the impact of the pandemic, protecting tens of thousands of creative jobs across the UK, including festivals such as Deer Shed Festival, End of the Road and Nozstock.\"\nLast year's 50th anniversary Glastonbury was meant to be headlined by Sir Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar, but it was cancelled during the initial national lockdown in March 2020.\nLast month, organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC she hoped this year's festival could go ahead, despite the \"huge uncertainty\" surrounding live music in the pandemic.\n\"We're doing everything we can on our end to plan and prepare,\" she told the BBC, \"but I think we're still quite a long way from being able to say we're confident 2021 will go ahead.\"\nEavis said Glastonbury lost \"millions\" in 2020. Her father, Michael, has previously warned the festival \"would seriously go bankrupt\" if they had to cancel again next year.\nBut that scenario is unlikely \"as long as we can make a firm call either way in advance\", Eavis clarified to the BBC.\nNo line-up details had been confirmed for 2021. But just before Christmas, Sir Paul McCartney told the BBC the event was not in his calendar, as it would be a \"superspreader\".\nAt the start of January, MPs were told that some of the UK's biggest music festivals could be called off by the end of this month.\nEvents are \"rapidly approaching the determination point\", after which they'll have to pull the plug, said the Association of Independent Festivals.\nOrganisers will be in \"absolutely dire straits\" financially if the season is cancelled, added Anna Wade, of Winchester's Boomtown Fair.\nThey were speaking to MPs examining the plight of music festivals in the UK.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Its recommendations were published in May 2019.\nPlanned reforms include making \u00a32.5bn available for technical qualifications for adult learners through the National Skills Fund, a lifelong student loan entitlement for up to four years of higher education and the prioritising of funding for STEM subjects.\nBut the Augar review's recommendations to reduce tuition fees to \u00a37,500, alongside implementing reforms to minimum entry standards and foundation years at universities, were not addressed in this latest response. \nThe DfE said given the pandemic \"now is not the right time to conclude the review in full\". \nAny further reforms are expected to be announced at the next Spending Review.\nMr Augar also suggested the return of maintenance grants for poorer university students as part of his review, but there was not mention of this in the interim response. \nUniversity and College Union general secretary Jo Grady said: \"Sadly this interim response confirms that there will not be a radical change to the current system. \n\"The Westminster government is wasting an opportunity to make a real difference for students and institutions.\"\nProf Julia Buckingham, president of Universities UK , welcomed the prospect of lifelong loans, saying \"it is encouraging to see government's commitment to making lifelong learning opportunities more accessible to all\".\nHowever, Prof Buckingham said \"government should provide maintenance grants for those who need them the most, including those considering studying shorter courses on a modular basis\". \nAs part of its Skills for Jobs White Paper, published alongside higher education reforms, the DfE said it wanted to \"put an end to the illusion that a degree is the only route to success and a good job and that further and technical education is the second-class option\".\nA white paper is a policy document produced by the government to set out their proposals for future legislation.\nThe measures put forward include:\nIn December, the government announced that tens of thousands of adults without an A-level or equivalent would be able to benefit from nearly 400 fully-funded courses from April.\nIt was the first major development in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Lifetime Skills Guarantee (LSG) scheme, which was launched in September.\nMr Johnson said it would mean \"everyone will be given the chance to get the skills they need, right from the very start of their career\".\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said: \"These reforms are at the heart of our plans to build back better, ensuring all technical education and training is based on what employers want and need, whilst providing individuals with the training they need to get a well-paid and secure job.\"\nBritish Chamber of Commerce director general Adam Marshall welcomed the plans to put the skills needs of businesses at the heart of further education. \n\"As local business leaders look to rebuild their firms and communities in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, it is essential to ensure that the right skills and training provision is in place to support growth,\" he added. \nBut organisations representing school and college leaders are also sceptical that there is enough funding for the further education sector to deliver on the proposals.\nIn November, an the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said FE colleges and sixth forms faced significant financial uncertainty. \nChief executive of the Association of Colleges David Hughes said: \"Colleges have been calling for this, after years of being overlooked and underutilised, but government has to not only recognise the vital college role, it also needs to increase funding.\""

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nParents will know a fortnight in advance when their children will return to schools in England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says. Telling BBC Breakfast he wants pupils back in classrooms at \"the earliest possible opportunity\", he says he's \"not able to exactly say\" when schools will reopen but the \"key criteria\" will be whether pressure on the NHS was lifting. \nScientists tracking the spread of coronavirus in England say infection levels may have risen at the start of the latest lockdown. Swab tests from 143,000 people indicate 1.58% had the virus during the period 6-15 January - up from 0.91% in early December, according to Imperial College London researchers. Ministers say the Imperial College London report does not yet reflect the impact of the national lockdown in England.\nAnyone going on a Saga holiday or cruise this year must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the tour operator says. People aged over 50 in the UK have been rushing to book holidays as vaccinations boost confidence. The company, which specialises in tours for this age group, says it won't restart travel packages until May to give customers enough time to get jabs.\nHouse hunters are taking advantage of a loophole in lockdown rules to travel hundreds of miles to view homes, estate agents say. In-person viewings are allowed in England, but agents have raised concerns about safety and tell us how some people are travelling across the country to look at second homes. The government says the housing market in England will remain open but that initial viewings should be done virtually \"wherever possible\". \nRandi Lippert, 28, moved to London from Canada for work just before the first coronavirus lockdown last year. \"I didn't have much in-office time to bond with my new team members before we all had to work from home,\" she says. Thankfully, she's been getting to know her new workmates over \"Zoom lunch\". Business reporter Anne Cassidy looks at how companies are encouraging staff to socialise remotely - and other ways the lunch break is changing.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nIf your school-age children are at home and you don't have a laptop, you can check out our guide to the support available for remote learning.\nMore information, advice and guides are on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Social distancing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More of us are now able to meet up outside with friends and family.\n\"The evidence is very clear that outdoor spaces are safer than indoors,\" Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical officer, has said. \nResearchers say infections can happen outdoors, but the chances are massively reduced.\nFresh air disperses and dilutes the virus.\nIt also helps to evaporate the liquid droplets in which it is carried.\nOn top of that, ultraviolet light from the Sun should kill any virus that's out in the open. \nEven so, there are a handful of cases where it's believed that infections did happen outside.\nOne study found that two men in China talking face-to-face for at least 15 minutes was enough to spread the virus.\nIf someone's infected - maybe without realising it because they have no symptoms - they'll be releasing the virus as they breathe, especially if they cough.\nSome of that will be carried in droplets, most of which will quickly fall to the ground but could reach your eyes, nose or mouth if you're within 2m (6ft) of them.  \nSo the advice is to avoid being face-to-face if you're that close.\nThe infected person will also release smaller particles called aerosols. \nIndoors, these can accumulate in the air and be a hazard. Outside they should rapidly disperse. \nWalking past someone in the street or having a jogger run by you, means you're close together for a few seconds at most. \nFleeting encounters are highly unlikely to be long enough for enough virus to reach you. \nProf Cath Noakes, an airborne infection expert from the University of Leeds, says someone would have to cough right at you, at the moment you're inhaling, for an infection to happen. \nBut she also warns of friends spending a long time together outdoors and assuming they're completely safe.\nGoing for a run with someone and following close behind them for 20 minutes or more, breathing in their slipstream, might be a problem, she says.\n\"The sad fact is that your greatest risk is from the people you know.\" \nScientists have found that the risks are low in fully open spaces.\nBut they worry about areas that are not just crowded but also partly enclosed, such as market stalls or bus shelters. \nWhenever the air is still, it can become stagnant and contaminated. \nIt's in environments like narrow pathways or busy queues that government advisers say face coverings may be needed. \nIf an infected person coughs into their hand and then wipes it on a surface, the virus may survive there for hours.\nResearchers in the US found virus on the handles of rubbish bins and the buttons at pedestrian crossings.\nThey reckon this may have led to infections in the area, though at a relatively low level compared with other ways of spreading the virus. \nIn colder weather, the virus may last longer in the open - it thrives in low temperatures. \nAdded to that, your nose runs in the cold, and a common reaction is to wipe it with your hand.\nThat might raise the chances of surfaces becoming contaminated.\nHowever, many scientists now think that the amount of virus likely to be left on a surface in this way would be minimal, and would disperse within an hour or two.  \n\"The chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small,\" says Prof Emmanuel Goldman of Rutgers University.\nAll the evidence points to the vast majority of Covid infections happening indoors.\nThe virus is transmitted through human interaction, especially when people are together for a long period of time.\nThat means the virus can spread in several different ways. \nEither infected droplets can land on people close by, or contaminate surfaces that others touch.\nAnd if rooms are stuffy, tiny virus particles can accumulate in the air and get inhaled. \nIt's in households where all of this is most likely to happen."

      "tags": "Schools,Secondary education,Coronavirus testing,Young people,Liverpool,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found.\nThis is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage.\nIncreased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in very specific locations - local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets.\nSome of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not have Covid symptoms.\nThe testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.\nSurge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.\nEast\nNorth West\nWest Midlands\nSouth East\nSurge testing is also currently being carried out in specific and targeted locations within the following local authority areas:\nLondon\nSouth East\nNorth West\nYorkshire and the Humber\nTargeted community testing is also taking place in various health board areas across Scotland. \nScientists have identified a number of \"variants of concern\" - these are  newly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. \nAlso, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines.\nThe Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). \nThe variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming system which uses Greek letters instead. \nThe PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test \nPeople tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. \nThis involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis.\nIt is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result.\nThe lateral flow test \nThis also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes.\nWherever you are in the UK, if you have symptoms you should book a free test online. You will be sent to a testing site or have a testing kit sent to your home. \nIf you have problems booking, call 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland. \nAnyone in England can now get free lateral flow tests each week - even if they do not have symptoms. These can be ordered online, by calling 119, or can be collected from test centres and pharmacies. \nAnyone in Scotland can also order free lateral flow tests online, or collect them from test centres.\nAnyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. NHS Test and Trace will tell their contacts to isolate if necessary.\nSelf-isolating means not leaving home for exercise or even to buy food, medicines or other essentials.\nPeople in England who fail to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to \u00a310,000.\nAnyone on a low income who has been told to self-isolate can claim a \u00a3500 payment."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nearly two million people in the UK have received their first dose of a Covid vaccine in the past week, government figures show.\nBy the end of Tuesday 4.61 million people had received their initial jab, up from 2.64 million the week before.\nMatt Hancock told MPs: \"We're giving 200 vaccinations every minute\".\nBut Boris Johnson warned there were \"unquestionably going to be a tough few weeks\" while the vaccine was rolled out and urged people to observe lockdown.\nSpeaking during a visit to flood-hit Didsbury in Manchester, the prime minister said it was still \"too early\" to say when some lockdown restrictions could be lifted in England.\nHe said figures from an Imperial College London survey showed the new variant of the virus to be \"not more deadly but it is much more contagious and the numbers are very great\".\nThe study suggests there was a rise in infections in the community at the start of the latest lockdown in England.\nMeanwhile, NHS England figures show one in 10 major hospital trusts had no spare adult critical care beds last week.\nThe UK recorded another all-time high of daily coronavirus deaths on Wednesday. A further 1,820 people died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to government figures - taking the total number of deaths by that measure to 93,290.\nSixty-five new vaccination centres have opened in England, including a mosque in Birmingham and a cinema in Aylesbury.\nTwo million jabs a week are needed for the government to achieve its target of offering a vaccine to all over 70s, the extremely clinical vulnerable and health and care workers by mid-February.\nGiving a statement in the Commons, Health Secretary Mr Hancock said the country had an \"immense infrastructure in place that, day by day, is protecting the vulnerable and giving hope to us all\". \nDescribing this as a \"huge feat\", he said the government was making \"good progress\" towards its target. \nAsked about difficulties in getting vaccines to rural areas and whether the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine could be prioritised for these as it is easier to store, Mr Hancock said the challenge was that supply was \"lumpy\", with manufacturers working \"as fast as possible\". \nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said new variants of the virus showed vaccination needed to go \"further and faster\". \nHe asked if there was a contingency plan in place in case vaccines needed to be redesigned to contain mutations.\nMr Hancock said the early indications were that the new variant was dealt with by the vaccine \"just as much as the old variant\".\nHe also said 63% of residents in elderly care homes had now received a vaccine.\nFormer Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is now chairman of the Common's Health Select Committee, asked about establishing \"quarantine hotels\" to combat new strains, as well as whether there should be further restrictions on household mixing outside bubbles and mandating FFP2 masks in shops and on public transport.\nMr Hancock said the clinical advice was that the current guidelines on personal protective equipment (PPE) were \"right and appropriate\" and said \"very significant measures\" had been brought in for international travel.\nIn Northern Ireland more than 160,000 people have received a first vaccine dose, while in Wales, where more than 175,000 people have received a jab, people waiting for theirs have been urged to show \"patience\" and \"perspective\".\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insisted her country's vaccine programme was not lagging behind, during First Minister's Questions on Wednesday.\nIn England the rollout of the vaccine started with people aged 80 and over. In some regions where the majority of these have been vaccinated, the programmes are now moving on to the over 70s.\nHome Secretary Priri Patel, who will lead a Downing Street press conference later, said ministers were working to ensure police and other front-line workers are moved up the priority list, while Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Breakfast he hoped teachers and support staff could be moved up the list.\nMeanwhile, pumps and sandbags were brought in to protect supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from the risk of flood water at a warehouse in Wrexham, north-east Wales.\nYoung people in Wales have been asked to share their experiences of the pandemic in a survey by the nation's Children's Commissioner."

      "tags": "Washington DC,US election 2020,Donald Trump,US politics,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "At 12:01, in the midst of his inaugural address, Joe Biden officially became the 46th president of the United States.\nHe was already well into outlining exactly how daunting a task he - and the nation - have ahead in what he called its \"winter of peril\".\nAmerica is facing a devastating pandemic which has resulted in massive job losses and business closures, a threatened environment, urgent cries for racial justice and resurgence in \"political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism\".\nHis speech was not a laundry list of proposals and solutions. Those were reserved for his first 17 executive actions as president - on immigration, climate change, transgender rights and public health, among others. \nThe Biden administration has also frozen all of Trump's last-minute regulations pending further review.\nInstead, Biden used his speech to offer hope - and to argue, at times forcefully, that the nation must be united in facing the challenges ahead; that it has to move past its current \"uncivil war\".\n\"Without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury,\" he said. \"No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos.\" \n\"This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge,\" he continued. \"And unity is the path forward\".\nAt times, Biden's speech seemed a direct rebuttal to his predecessor's administration, although he did not mention Donald Trump by name.\nWhere Trump frequently spoke of American greatness and glorified its founders, Biden noted that the nation's history has been a \"constant struggle\" between its ideals and sometimes harsh realities.\nWhere Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway spoke of \"alternative facts\" almost four years ago, Biden said: \"There is truth and there are lies - lies told for power and for profit.\"\nBiden wrapped up his inaugural address by warning that America must not \"turn inward\" - both as individuals retreating into \"competing factions\" and as a nation on the world stage.\n\"We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again,\" he said.\nRhetorically, Biden turned the page from Trump's days of \"America first\". \nThe first 100 days of any administration are always important to a new president. What are his priorities? What will he try to accomplish when his political capital is at its highest?\nJoe Biden and his presidential team have had nearly three months to plan out his first actions upon taking the oath of office, but executive action is the (relatively) easy part. \nHis speech reflected the reality that he enters office with his top priorities already determined for him.\nHis government will be responsible for distributing the coronavirus vaccine in an efficient and equitable way. After that, he will have to focus on the societal and economic disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nThe virus has exacerbated income inequality and pushed many households to the brink of economic ruin. It's devastated the travel and hospitality industries and placed incredible strain on the finances of state and local governments.\nHis pledge to seek unity will be tested early, as he pushes a sharply divided Congress to pass another, massive round of pandemic stimulus aid. If he wants to enact it quickly, he will need Republican support in the Senate, and already there are signs that some on the right may be lining up in opposition to more spending.\nThen there's Trump's Senate impeachment trial, which will present yet another challenge to national unity. It will keep Trump's name in the news for weeks, as his defenders rally to his side and his detractors call for consequences for his actions.\nAfter that, Biden's potential political paths diverge. He has said he wants to improve healthcare in the US, address growing college debt, make new investments in infrastructure and tackle climate change. \nHe's pledged to push immigration reform legislation that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented migrants - a political lightning rod that helped fuel Trump's first presidential run.\nWhat he prioritises, and how successful his first efforts are, could determine the overall success of his administration. To make lasting change - policies that can't be undone by future presidents - he will have to work with Congress.\nThe inauguration ceremony is over. But, as Biden noted in his speech, the American people face one of the most challenging times in their nation's history. \n\"We will be judged by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era,\" he said.\nBiden campaigned against Trump for the opportunity to face those crises. Now he has his chance."

      "tags": "Trump pardons,Steve Bannon,Donald Trump,United States",
      "text": "In the final hours of his presidency, Donald Trump has pardoned 73 people, including his former adviser Steve Bannon, who is facing fraud charges.\nAnother 70 people had sentences commuted, ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration at noon (17:00 GMT).\nRapper Lil Wayne received a pardon and there were commutations for rapper Kodak Black and former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.\nThe president has not issued preemptive pardons for himself or family members.\nHe can still issue more pardons on Wednesday morning, as he remains president until Mr Biden takes the oath of office outside the US Capitol.\nThe inauguration ceremony will be tight on security following the recent breach of the Capitol by violent pro-Trump protesters. It will also be stripped of crowds due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nA statement from the White House listed the 73 individuals who had received pardons and the 70 who had their sentences commuted.\nAlthough many on the list are conventional examples of convicts whose cases have been championed by rights activists and supporters in the community, others maintain the president's trend of focusing on allies.\nSteve Bannon was a key strategist and adviser to President Trump during his 2016 campaign. He was charged in August last year with fraud over a fundraising campaign to build a wall on the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration, a key plank of Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\nProsecutors said Mr Bannon and three others defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with the \"We Build the Wall\" campaign, which pledged to use donations to build segments of the barrier and raised $25m (\u00a318m). It was alleged Mr Bannon received more than $1m, at least some of which he used to cover personal expenses. He denied the claims.\nAs he was yet to stand trial his pardon is unusual, though certainly not unprecedented.\nThe White House statement said Mr Bannon had been \"an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen\". It said prosecutors had \"pursued\" him with charges \"related to fraud stemming from his involvement in a political project\".\nA full pardon was also issued to Elliott Broidy, a Republican fundraiser who admitted accepting funds to lobby Mr Trump for Chinese and Malaysian interests. The White House cited his \"philanthropic efforts\".\nKen Kurson, a friend of Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner charged with cyberstalking during a divorce, was pardoned.\nLil Wayne, whose real name is Dwayne Carter, pleaded guilty to a federal weapons charge last year and has been pardoned. He posted a photo of himself with Mr Trump during the election campaign praising the president's work on criminal reform.\nAs the list of pardons became clear, Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff said: \"Thank God we have only 12 more hours of this den of thieves.\"\nOther key recipients were:\nHowever, a number of people whose names had been promoted in the media for possible pardons - including Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, and Joe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger King - have not been included.\nIt is common for outgoing presidents to issue pardons before they leave the White House.\nAlexander Hamilton proposed the system in 1787, arguing it could \"restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth\". It is carried in Article II of the Constitution.\nThe president can only act on federal, not state, crimes. A pardon cancels a criminal conviction, while a commutation shortens or ends a prison sentence.\nPardons have been controversial since they started. In the early years of the US, some acts of treason, piracy and rebellion were forgiven.\nOne man convicted of stealing mail refused a pardon in 1833 and he was executed after the Supreme Court ruled he could turn it down.\nIn latter days, Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon for all offences he may have committed, and Jimmy Carter pardoned most who had evaded the Vietnam War draft - both examples of preemptive pardons.\nBill Clinton caused uproar when he pardoned scores of people on his last day in office, including his half-brother, Roger.\nMr Trump has always projected himself as a \"law and order\" president. In terms of numbers, his pardons and commutations are low. Only George HW Bush issued fewer in modern times.\nMr Trump has granted less than 1% of requests for clemency, the lowest on record.\nHowever, it is the nature of the pardons that has caused controversy. A number of those pardoned have been close associates and allies, such as former campaign manager Paul Manafort, long-time ally Roger Stone and his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles. Steve Bannon adds to that list.\nOpponents accuse him of using his constitutional powers unconventionally, to benefit his friends and close supporters.\nThere had been speculation Mr Trump could try to pardon himself or his family members ahead of any possible charges.\nIt is unclear whether he has the legal power to do so and there is no precedent of a US leader issuing such a pardon.\nHe does face a possible Senate impeachment trial for \"incitement to insurrection\", although dates have yet to be set for that.\nWe will bring you all the latest developments, with analysis from reporting teams in Washington at the Capitol and on the National Mall.\n\u2022Online: Follow the latest updates and live video on the BBC News website and @BBCNorthAmerica.

      "text": "NI's largest healthcare union has said it has not objected to military personnel being brought in to help medical staff deal with Covid-19.\nHowever, Unison said it had questions over the move and there had \"disappointingly\" been no consultation.\nAn initial statement from the union on the subject was criticised by some politicians.\nUlster Unionist leader Steve Aiken described it as \"appallingly inappropriate\".\nA new statement issued on social media, from the union's regional secretary Patricia McKeown, said the first statement had been \"misunderstood\".\nSpeaking to Good Morning Ulster, she acknowledged the initial statement had caused \"stress and hurt\" to Unison members and apologised for that.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann has asked the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to help out, primarily at a number of hospitals across NI.\nMore than 100 medically-trained military personnel will be deployed.\nIn the union's initial statement, issued on Wednesday, it said it would ask Mr Swann for \"detailed reasons\" for the move.\nIt said this would include \"seeking information as to what other avenues of support have been sought, such as securing additional staffing from private sector healthcare providers\".\nHowever, following criticism, Ms McKeown said in a new statement on Thursday morning that the union was \"happy to clarify\" its position. \n\"To be absolutely clear, Unison has not objected to assistance from military personnel.\"\nShe added: \"In our experience the deployment of military personnel into public services is a decision taken as a last resort. \n\"We were immediately concerned that a request for aid of this nature indicates a crisis that is moving out of control. \n\"This is why it is important that we know in advance what options are being explored.\"\nThe union said it was important to get detailed information on how, when and where external personnel would be deployed and what the management and accountability structures will be in place for them.\nSpeaking on Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday, Ms McKeown said: \"We put a statement out last night, it said what we were going to do, but it didn't say why we were going to do it.\n\"That caused stress and hurt to our members and I am very, very sorry for that. That's why we corrected it.\"\nShe added that if military personnel were being brought in \"it means that all options have been exhausted, there's a big decision facing us now and that decision is a stronger lockdown\".\nThe earlier statement from the union, issued on Wednesday night, had been criticised by some politicians.\nUlster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said: \"Judging by the number of healthcare workers who have contacted me tonight they are absolutely incredulous at the Unison statement this evening. \n\"Getting help is what is needed - time for Unison to withdraw its appallingly inappropriate remarks.\"\nDUP assembly member Jonathan Buckley said: \"This statement from Unison is extremely disappointing and is out of step with both Unison's own members and the wider public. \n\"I have already been contacted by health service staff making clear that this does not represent their views.\"\nHis party colleague Paul Frew tweeted: \"Utterly appalling. A lot of anger tonight for a union that is supposed to support its membership.\"\nSpeaking on Good Morning Ulster, West Belfast People Before Profit assembly member Gerry Carroll said: \"We all recognise that we're in a really desperate situation, a really difficult situation.\n\"But people want to see the health service expanded permanently and not just a short-term fix which people have questioned on a number of grounds.\"\nHowever, Ulster Unionist Doug Beattie said nurses and doctors were exhausted.\n\"What we're really talking about here is a surge of some personnel in order to support out frontline nurses who are dead on their feet,\" he said.\n\"The here and now is about saving lives.\"\nOn Wednesday, Sinn F\u00e9in responded to Mr Swann's decision by saying it would not \"rule out\" any measures that help save lives and that \"any effort to make the threat posed by Covid-19 into an orange and green issue is divisive and a distraction\".\nThe chief executive of the Belfast Health Trust, Dr Cathy Jack, told Stormont's health committee that the move would ensure staff can continue to deliver care to as many patients as possible.\nShe said the military personnel are \"band 4 medically-trained technicians\" who will \"be working under normal management structures\".\n\"This is another group of highly-trained individuals that will support staff and I welcome this.\"\nDr Jack said discussions were \"ongoing\" about how private health care providers could help in this phase of the pandemic.\nShe said a small number of private lists were being used for surgeries with low-risk cancers and more would be freed up in March \"to allow us to try and catch up on the backlog\".\nThe Military Aid to the Civil Authorities (MACA) request means armed forces staff will assist nurses and help on the wards in a move designed to ease the pressure on staff. \nIt is thought the first military staff will be made available as early as next week. \nMr Swann said the Army has previously carried out pandemic roles in Northern Ireland with \"aeromedical evacuation, real-estate and ongoing logistical planning\". \nThe health minister added it would have been an abdication of responsibility if he did not avail of help from the military.\nHe said while coronavirus cases were lower than two weeks ago, the challenge posed remained \"intense\" and intensive care pressures were expected to increase further in the next eight to 10 days.\nAs of Wednesday, there were 832 people in hospital in Northern Ireland with coronavirus, of whom 67 were in intensive care, with 57 ventilated.\nA further 22 people with coronavirus died, bringing the Department of Health's total to 1,671 while there were 905 new cases."

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has begun to undo some of Donald Trump's key policies, hours after being sworn in.\nIn his initial acts as the 46th US president, he signed 15 executive orders - the first to boost the federal response to the coronavirus crisis.\nOther orders reversed the Trump administration's stance on climate change and immigration.\nPresident Biden set to work at the Oval Office having been sworn in earlier on Wednesday at the US Capitol.\nThe inauguration was unlike any other due to coronavirus restrictions, with few present to witness the oaths and ceremonies. \nDonald Trump - who has still not formally conceded the presidency to Mr Biden - snubbed the event in a departure from longstanding precedent.\n\"There is no time to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face,\" President Biden tweeted as he headed to the White House following his inauguration.\nPresident Biden \"will take action - not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration - but also to start moving our country forward,\" a statement detailing his executive orders said. \nOn coronavirus, a series of measures will be enacted to tackle the pandemic which has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the US.\nThere will be a mandate to wear masks and practise social distancing on all federal government property.\nA new office will be set up to co-ordinate the response to the pandemic and the US will halt the process - begun by the Trump administration - of withdrawing from the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThe move to re-engage with the WHO was welcomed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who said it was \"absolutely critical\" for a more co-ordinated global response, his spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said.\nMr Biden has also pledged to make the fight against climate change a top priority of his administration.\nHe signed an executive order beginning the process of rejoining the 2015 Paris climate agreement, from which Mr Trump formally withdrew the US last year.\nMr Biden's climate envoy, former US Secretary of State John Kerry, tweeted that the commitment set \"a floor, not a ceiling\" for America's climate leadership and urged international co-operation ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26) in Glasgow in November.\nMr Biden has also revoked the presidential permit granted to the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, which environmentalists and Native American groups have fought for more than a decade.\nThe move will be discussed when Mr Biden makes his first phone call to a foreign leader - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - on Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.\nThe privately financed pipeline - estimated to cost about $8bn (\u00a35.8bn) - would carry about 830,000 barrels of heavy crude a day from the oil sands of Alberta, in Canada, to Nebraska.\nBarack Obama vetoed a bill approving construction of the pipeline in 2015 but the decision was overturned by President Trump.\nOn immigration Mr Biden has revoked the Trump administration's emergency declaration that helped fund the building of a wall along the Mexican border and also ended a travel ban on some majority-Muslim countries.\nOther orders cover race and gender equality.\nJoe Biden and his presidential team have had nearly three months to plan out his first actions upon taking the oath of office. Donald Trump had used his executive authority broadly, to advance large swaths of his political agenda, so how - and when - Biden would begin undoing those actions would have particular importance.\nIt didn't take long for the newly inaugurated president to show his hand. He targeted, in particular, some of the most controversial portions of Trump's agenda. The Biden administration also will freeze all of Trump's last-minute regulations pending further review. \nExecutive action is the (relatively) easy part, however. For Biden to make lasting change - policies that can't be undone by future presidents - he will have to work with Congress to pass legislation on issues like pandemic relief, citizenship for undocumented migrants, healthcare reform and voting-rights protections.\nHe also declined, for now, to take other executive actions, like cancelling student loan debt, lifting Mr Trump's trade restrictions or enacting new criminal justice measures.\nWith Democrats in control in the House of Representatives and Senate, Biden has a window for accomplishments, although it will require surmounting Republican procedural obstacles and keeping his party in line. The president's decades of experience as a legislator could come in useful.\nBiden calls for unity - it won't be easy\nAt the first news conference of the Biden presidency, press secretary Jen Psaki was asked if her priority was to promote the interests of President Biden, or provide \"the unvarnished truth\".\nShe said she had \"deep respect for the role of a free independent press\" and that she would join the president in bringing \"transparency and truth back to government\".\nPresident Trump - and his press secretaries - often had a combative relationship with the media.\n\"Democracy has prevailed,\" President Biden said after taking the oath of office with Chief Justice John Roberts on stage in front of the US Capitol.\nDelivering a message of unity after the turbulent Trump years, he promised to be a president \"for all Americans\" - including those who voted against him.\nThree of his predecessors attended the ceremony: Barack Obama - under whom Mr Biden served for eight years as vice-president - Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Mr Trump's vice-president, Mike Pence.\nKamala Harris was sworn in as vice-president ahead of Mr Biden. She is the first woman - and the first black and Asian-American person - to serve in the role.\nThere was extra-tight security for the ceremony after the US Capitol was stormed by violent pro-Trump protesters on 6 January.\nMr Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, together with Ms Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, then walked down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, greeting friends and supporters.\nThe inauguration ceremony included musical performances by Lady Gaga - who sang the national anthem - as well as Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks.\nAmanda Gorman, America's first-ever National Youth Poet Laureate, recited her work The Hill We Climb.\nA 90-minute televised evening concert entitled \"Celebrating America\" was staged at the Lincoln Memorial in the city. Hosted by Tom Hanks, it featured Bruce Springsteen, John Legend, Jon Bon Jovi, Justin Timberlake, and Demi Lovato and culminated in a spectacular fireworks display.\nMr Trump was the first president not to attend his successor's inauguration since 1869. He left the White House early on Wednesday, and flew to the nearby Andrews Air Force base.\nIn his farewell address at the base, he highlighted what he regarded as the successes of his presidency. \"What we've done has been amazing by any standard,\" Mr Trump said.\nThe 74-year-old then left for his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida, where he arrived later in the morning.\nIn his last hours as president, Mr Trump granted clemency to more than 140 people, including his former adviser Steve Bannon, who had been facing fraud charges.\nThe political drama surrounding Mr Trump is far from over. The US Senate is expected to put him on trial soon, following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives for allegedly inciting the Capitol riot.\nOn Tuesday, the Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said the mob had been provoked by Mr Trump and fed lies."

      "tags": "Vaccination,Brazil,India,South Africa,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A new type of coronavirus has been found that scientists say is of \"great concern\". \nThe Omicron variant worries experts because it is very different to the types of Covid current vaccines are designed to fight. \nA variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.\nOmicron is strikingly different from many other types due to the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone. \nIn particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.\nEarly signs are that current vaccines might not work quite as well against Omicron.\nData from around the world suggests Omicron may be more infectious and spreads very easily. \nThis suggests the variant might be better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infection. \nPreliminary lab studies show two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough. An answer could be giving people extra doses to boost their immunity, like the UK is doing now.\nUK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.\nExperts say Omicron might be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.\nEven so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.\nAs with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. \nAlthough current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron they are still the best line of defence against Covid. \nThey have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. \nDoctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. \nThe government is ramping up its vaccination programme in response to Omicron, and hopes to offer every adult in the UK a booster jab by the end of January. \nAlthough Covid infections have been rising, the number of hospitalisations and deaths has remained well below the levels seen in earlier waves. Experts say this is because of the success of the vaccine programme. \nUpdated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.\nManufacturers could scale up production quickly too and regulators have already discussed how to fast track the approval process. \nModerna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March. \nThe most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern and, along with Omicron, include:\nUK officials are also keeping an eye on a recent descendent of the Delta variant, called AY.4.2 or \"Delta plus\". \nViruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce but they aren't perfect at it. Errors can creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus - in other words, a variant. \nIf this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. \nThe more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. \nThat's why keeping infections down is important. Vaccines help by cutting transmission as well as protecting against serious Covid illness. \nExperts say it is possible that the new highly altered variant B.1.1.529 may have originated in a patient whose immune system was unable to get rid of a Covid infection quickly, giving the virus more time to morph.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It is \"too early\" to say whether England's Covid restrictions will be able to end in the spring, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nOnce the four priority groups have been vaccinated, by mid-February, \"we'll look then at how we're doing,\" he said.\nNearly two million people in the UK have had their first dose of vaccine in the past week, government figures show.\nScientist Marc Baguelin, who advises the government, has said restaurants and bars should not reopen before May. \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson has said he \"certainly hopes\" schools in England can fully reopen before Easter, while Downing Street refused to be drawn on whether this would happen by then.\nA further 1,290 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test and there have been another 37,892 cases, according to the latest government figures. \nAnd almost five million people in the UK have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\nSpeaking after a study suggested infections might have increased at the start of the latest lockdown in England, Mr Johnson said it was \"absolutely crucial\" that people observed the restrictions. \nReferring to figures from the Imperial College London survey, he said they showed the new variant of the virus was \"not more deadly but it is much more contagious and the numbers are very great\". \nFigures published by Public Health England show cases - meaning people who come forward to get tested while they are infected - have fallen across England since early January.\nWith the two sets of figures pointing in different directions, it will be some time before it is known for sure how long it will take for lockdown to relieve the pressure on hospitals. \nDr Baguelin, from Imperial College, who sits on a sub-group of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the premature opening of the hospitality sector would lead to a \"bump\" in Covid-19 cases.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme even a partial reopening would generate \"an increase in the R number\". An R number above one means the epidemic is growing.\n\"Something of this scale, if it was to happen earlier than May, would generate a bump in transmission, which is already really bad,\" he said.\n\"So you have a lot of pressure on hospitals, you will have another wave of some extent. At best you will keep on having very, very unsustainable level of pressure on the NHS.\" \nNHS England figures show one in 10 major hospital trusts had no spare adult critical care beds last week.\nThis is a debate that is going to start to dominate public discourse.\nWith the vaccination programme under way, there is huge clamour to know what will happen once the most vulnerable are vaccinated, by mid-February.\nThe problem is there are still so many unknowns.\nFirstly, it is hard to predict by how much lockdown will have reduced infection levels, considering there is a new faster-spreading variant to deal with.\nThe level of uptake will also be crucial. Surveys suggest as many as one in five may not have the vaccine - although the older, more vulnerable groups tend to be the most willing to be vaccinated.\nAnd the fact that no vaccine is 100% effective means come February there could still be significant numbers of very vulnerable people who are not protected.\nAnother factor is whether the vaccine stops transmissions - so-called sterilising vaccination.\nTrials have shown the vaccines are good at stopping symptoms developing. But that does not mean someone who has received a jab will not pass on the virus.\nIf it does not, that, of course, has implications on how many control measures have to be kept in place. It will take us at least until spring to know the answer to this.\nAt this stage, it seems hard to see much beyond the possible reopening of schools come March.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was an \"impossible question\" to ask how long the lockdown would need to last. \nUnder the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons.\nThis includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn Northern Ireland, coronavirus lockdown restrictions will be extended until 5 March, BBC News understands.\nIn Scotland, lockdown has been extended until at least the middle of February, with most school pupils to continue learning from home.\nAnd in Wales health minister Vaughan Gething has said no \"significant easing\" of Wales' Covid restrictions should be expected when the current guidelines are reviewed this month.\nSir Keir added that the coronavirus vaccines were \"really good news\" but \"should not mask the fact that we have still got a very serious problem\".\nThe government is aiming to offer a vaccine to all over-70s, the extremely clinical vulnerable and health and care workers by mid-February.\nSixty-five new vaccination centres are opening in England, including a mosque in Birmingham and a cinema in Aylesbury.\nIn other developments: "

Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

A further 1,820 people died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to government figures - taking the total number of deaths by that measure to 93,290.\nSixty-five new vaccination centres have opened in England, including a mosque in Birmingham and a cinema in Aylesbury.\nTwo million jabs a week are needed for the government to achieve its target of offering a vaccine to all over 70s, the extremely clinical vulnerable and health and care workers by mid-February.\nGiving a statement in the Commons, Health Secretary Mr Hancock said the country had an \"immense infrastructure in place that, day by day, is protecting the vulnerable and giving hope to us all\". \nDescribing this as a \"huge feat\", he said the government was making \"good progress\" towards its target. \nAsked about difficulties in getting vaccines to rural areas and whether the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine could be prioritised for these as it is easier to store, Mr Hancock said the challenge was that supply was \"lumpy\", with manufacturers working \"as fast as possible\". \nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said new variants of the virus showed vaccination needed to go \"further and faster\". \nHe asked if there was a contingency plan in place in case vaccines needed to be redesigned to contain mutations.\nMr Hancock said the early indications were that the new variant was dealt with by the vaccine \"just as much as the old variant\".\nHe also said 63% of residents in elderly care homes had now received a vaccine.\nFormer Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is now chairman of the Common's Health Select Committee, asked about establishing \"quarantine hotels\" to combat new strains, as well as whether there should be further restrictions on household mixing outside bubbles and mandating FFP2 masks in shops and on public transport.\nMr Hancock said the clinical advice was that the current guidelines on personal protective equipment (PPE) were \"right and appropriate\" and said \"very significant measures\" had been brought in for international travel.\nIn Northern Ireland more than 160,000 people have received a first vaccine dose, while in Wales, where more than 175,000 people have received a jab, people waiting for theirs have been urged to show \"patience\" and \"perspective\".\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insisted her country's vaccine programme was not lagging behind, during First Minister's Questions on Wednesday.\nIn England the rollout of the vaccine started with people aged 80 and over. In some regions where the majority of these have been vaccinated, the programmes are now moving on to the over 70s.\nHome Secretary Priri Patel, who will lead a Downing Street press conference later, said ministers were working to ensure police and other front-line workers are moved up the priority list, while Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Breakfast he hoped teachers and support staff could be moved up the list.\nMeanwhile, pumps and sandbags were brought in to protect supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from the risk of flood water at a warehouse in Wrexham, north-east Wales.\nYoung people in Wales have been asked to share their experiences of the pandemic in a survey by the nation's Children's Commissioner."

      "text": "Storm Christoph has caused widespread flooding in England and Wales, and more than 2,000 homes have been evacuated. \nWhat are the main methods being used to tackle - and reduce the risk of - floods from risking life and damaging property?\nThe Environment Agency uses a range of temporary or \"demountable\" flood barriers to provide protection in flood-prone areas.  \nLightweight metal barriers are relatively inexpensive, can be placed in various positions, and removed when waters recede. \nFrame barriers use the weight of the floodwater itself to hold them in place. \nTemporary barriers can also be added to permanent flood defences, such as raised embankments, increasing the level of protection.\nNatural flood management consists of small measures to reduce the flow of water before it reaches larger rivers. \nMeasures might include using small barriers in ditches and fields, or notches cut into embankments, to divert the water into open land. \nLetting pools form outside the main channel of a river means the water is temporarily removed from the main flow - reducing the power of the floodwaters.\nNatural flood management offers a sustainable approach to managing floods and is intended to complement flood barriers and concrete walls.\nTrees can also help defend against floods. Planting more trees catches rainfall and helps take water from the soil - although the Environment Agency says large areas must be reforested to make a real difference. \nFelled trees can also be laid across streams in wooded areas and help push unusually high waters into surrounding woodlands. Such schemes need very careful planning and management. \nSustainable drainage is often used in towns and cities, which are prone to flash flooding after sudden heavy rain.  \nIn urban areas, large areas of ground are covered in concrete and tarmac. Rain is channelled straight into drainage systems, which can become overwhelmed.\nIn the UK, the Flood Act of 2010 obliges builders to landscape developments so that water from roofs and driveways seeps into open ground rather than rushing into the water system.\nGuidelines suggest the ground should be able to absorb the water - a process known as infiltration. \nLarge \"detention basins\" can also be built to collect rainwater and hold it, managing the volume of water entering urban rivers, while ponds offer further water-holding capacity. \nThe basic aim of dredging is to remove silt - which consists of fine sand, clay and small particles of rock - from the river's bed, potentially increasing its capacity to carry water downstream. \nThe process usually involves an excavator, or vacuum pump, mounted on a barge or on the riverbank, to remove silt from the river. \nBut the issue of whether rivers should be dredged is not clear-cut. \nThe Environment Agency says that while dredging can improve general land drainage, it cannot prevent rivers from flooding, due to the huge volumes of water involved.\nIn some cases dredging can even make flooding worse. \nProfessor Dan Parsons from the University of Hull says: \"it is the water surface slope of the river, rather than the river bed that is most important in moving water through a landscape. In lowland reaches, where rivers meet tidal forces, dredging can actually make matters worse by reducing this surface slope.\"\nDredging is also costly, sometimes harmful to the environment, and can weaken riverbanks as well as the foundations of bridges and weirs.\nAfter a major flood, large volumes of silt may accumulate in slow-flowing areas and the river may need to be dredged repeatedly.\nIn the March 2020 budget, \u00a35.2bn was promised over five years to fund flood defences in England. \nThe money is due to be available from April this year and will help build 2,000 new flood and coastal defence schemes.\nThe funding was announced after a series of floods caused major damage in the Midlands, Wales and South Yorkshire. \nFlooding can come from all sorts of water sources, including groundwater, reservoirs and surface water. But cities and towns that lie on rivers or near the sea are most at risk.\nGenerally speaking, increased rainfall causes flooding inland, while high tides and storms are behind much coastal flooding - and both can happen together.\nFlooding has always been an occasional part of life in such areas, but experts warn that climate change is worsening the situation.\nIn early 2019, Environment Agency chairwoman Emma Howard Boyd said that some communities might eventually have to move entirely. \n\"We can't win a war against water by building away climate change with infinitely high flood defences,\" she said.\nResearchers have also warned that coastal areas in Northern Europe are also at higher risk of flooding in the coming years because of rising temperatures.

The council said it would be investigating the cause of the flooding, which forced road closures and evacuations.\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) said the River Dee, which runs through Bangor-on-Dee, was at its highest recorded level since the water gauge became operational in 1996 - 16.45m (54ft).\nIt urged people across Wales to remain vigilant, with river levels not set to have peaked until late Thursday evening, adding they would remain high until Friday morning.\nThe Met Office said over the past two days Wales had the highest rainfall of the four UK nations. \nBetween 19 and 21 January, Aberllefenni in Gwynedd saw 188mm (7.5in) of rain, more than average rainfall for Wales for the whole of January, which is 156.89mm (63in).\nThat was followed by 180mm (7in) in Crai reservoir, Powys, 169.8mm (6.6in) in Treherbert, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and 166mm (6.5in) in both Maerdy, RCT, and Capel Curig, Conwy.\nThe flooding threatened the supply of the coronavirus Oxford vaccine, which is produced at Wrexham Industrial Estate.\nWrexham council leader Mr Pritchard said it had to work to \"make sure we didn't lose the vaccinations in the floods\".\n\"I've been up all night... it's a very difficult time for us,\" he added.\nWockhardt UK, which manufactures the vaccine, said at about 16:00 GMT on Wednesday, excess water surrounded part of its buildings.\n\"The site is now secure and free from any further flood damage and operating as normal,\" it said.\nA multi-agency statement described the situation in Bangor-on-Dee as a \"major incident\".\nIt said: \"As a severe weather warning indicates that there is a risk to life...\n\"The evacuation effort continues, with all routes in and out of the village currently closed to the public due to the flooding.\"\nEarlier, some residents in Ruthin were told to leave their homes - people have been told Covid rules allow them leave their homes in an emergency.\nMeanwhile, a man's body was recovered from the River Taff near Blackweir in Cardiff.\nDozens of ducks and chickens, and 12 huskies were rescued by the RSPCA from a flooded farm in Bangor, while they also took hay to two donkeys stranded by flood water in Mold.\nDave Brown said the flooding in his home in Broughton, Flintshire, was horrific and his mother-in-law was rescued by firefighters.\n\"You don't realise the damage water does and everything that floats - the sheer volume of water. I am 6ft tall and it almost took me out,\" he said. \nWrexham council said some of the people forced to leave their homes were with relatives, while it found others accommodation after having to initially seek refuge in a church hall.\nNine properties in Berse Road in New Broughton were also evacuated. \nThe situation in Ruthin, Denbighshire, overnight was \"horrendous\", town councillor Stephen Beach said.\n\"The whole of Ruthin was on edge,\" he said.\n\"Some people were accommodated at the leisure centre, and others were offered places to stay by local residents. The community was superb.\n\"It was the sheer volume of water that came down - there was no stopping it.\"\nWeather and flood warnings\nA yellow weather warning for ice for Wales has been issued by the Met Office until 10:00 GMT on Friday, with concerns it could lead to travel disruption, slips and falls.\nNumerous flood warnings and alerts remain in place across Wales, including two severe flood warnings.\nThe agency said flood defences were being used and river levels at Holt, Wrexham, would remain high for some time.\"There is therefore a significant risk of localised flooding problems and due to that the severe flood warning will remain in place until the levels drop,\" Keith Iven of NRW said\nIn Monmouthshire roads were closed following flooding, and the council said while water levels at the River Usk were dropping, a \"second peak\" on the River Wye had been expected on Thursday night.\nThe council had warned people living in Riverside Park, Monmouth, may be impacted and council workers were prepared to offer support.\nMid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had attended 98 flooding-related incidents\nIt said it deployed swift water rescue teams to rescue 13 people from vehicles in floodwater. It also winched vehicles from water and pumped water from properties. \nIn Cardiff, emergency services attended a crash involving a number of vehicles at about 07:40 on the A4232 between Culverhouse Cross and the M4.\nNo-one was seriously injured, but both carriageways were closed for just over an hour. The road has since reopened.\nIn Carmarthen, people were treated for the effects of fumes after using a generator to pump water from their homes. \nIn Knighton and Crickhowell in Powys, crews spent Wednesday night pumping out a number of properties.\nIn Borth, Ceredigion, floodwater hit the water treatment plant, an electrical substation and eight properties.\nOgwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team had to rescue a man from the roof of his car.\nIt said he had tried to drive through the river ford along the road from Llandygai to Bangor, in Gwynedd, but had become stuck in deep water and had climbed onto the roof. He was not injured.\nRhondda Cynon Taf council said it was aware of a minor landslip on the mountainside above Pentre. \nIt said an initial inspection determined there was no immediate threat to the area and a further detailed inspection would be carried out on Friday. It asked people to avoid the area.\nDozens of roads have been closed across Wales, and while Covid rules are in place stopping people from travelling apart from for essential reasons, people are being warned not to travel in affected areas due to widespread flooding.\nChris Lloyd from North Wales Mountain Rescue Association warned people to not visit flood-hit areas to view the damage.\nHe told BBC Radio Wales: \"People who are going out to look at the floods are not only putting themselves at risk, but putting additional people on the roads which professional emergency services don't want - we don't want any more incidents.\"\nDenbighshire council said Ysgol Bodfari in Denbigh and Ysgol Caer Drewyn, Corwen, which had been open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers, have been closed.

      "text": "Ministers are working to ensure police and other front-line workers are moved up the priority list for the Covid vaccine, the home secretary has said. \nPriti Patel told the BBC there was \"a lot of work taking place in government right now\" on the issue. \nThe committee advising the government on vaccines has also said it will consider factors like exposure risk and occupation in the rollout's next phase.\nThe most vulnerable are being prioritised for the vaccine first. \nThe government is aiming to offer everyone in the top four priority groups a first dose by mid-February. \nSpeaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the government was \"on track\" to meet the pledge, however, he said it was \"very hard\" because of constraints on supply. \nAsked whether groups whose work brings them into contact with others, such as police officers, emergency service workers and teachers, should be vaccinated next, the prime minister said the government must rely on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). \nHowever, he said the government wanted those groups to be vaccinated \"as soon as possible\". \nMs Patel, in response to being asked whether she wanted to see police officers \"bumped up the queue\" for the vaccine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's both police, fire and other front-line workers. And the health secretary and I are working to absolutely try and make that happen.\n\"This isn't just something we are thinking about. There is a lot of work taking place in government right now. \n\"If the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation says that is a possibility, we can make it happen. We have the supply, we have the logistical plans in place, we will absolutely work to make that happen.\"\nWhen will I get a vaccine?\nMs Patel added that Health Secretary Matt Hancock was \"supporting all our efforts across government on this\" and she was talking to police partners, including the National Police Chiefs Council and the Met Police Commissioner, about getting officers \"ready to take the vaccine when that comes\". \nProf Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of the JCVI, which advises the government, said phase two of the rollout would continue to work down the priority list through the over-50s. \nHowever, he told BBC Radio 5 live phase two would also concentrate on people who are potentially at risk of being exposed to the virus, such as teachers and police officers, as well as \"those that are important to keep the economy running\". \n\"There are a lot of factors in phase two which we'll be looking at in depth,\" he added. \nQuestions about who will be next in the priority list for vaccination once the first phase is complete keep coming.\nIf all goes well with rollout, by the end of April all the over-50s and younger adults with health conditions should have been offered a jab.\nBut what happens after that has not been decided - and will not be until nearer the time.\nMinisters heed the advice of an expert committee, the JCVI, and they want to know more about the effectiveness of vaccine and to what extent it stops transmission - people who have been vaccinated passing on the virus even if they themselves do not fall sick.\nKnowing that is crucial. \nIf it stops transmissions - known as sterilising immunity - the next phase could involve targeting the vaccine at people who are most likely to spread it. \nThat could see younger age groups prioritised, for example.\nBut if the vaccine does not do that the preference, as it is currently, would be to target the vaccine at those most at risk.\nOnce you get down to the under-50s without health conditions the risk is small. Less than 1% of Covid deaths have been in these age groups.\nAt such low levels of risk exposure becomes a more crucial factor, which is why there is a logic in targeting key workers like teachers, the police and transport workers.\nBut phasing vaccination in this way is more complex than simply working through the age groups, and so, in the end, may mean vaccination rollout takes longer overall\nThere is a fine balance to tread.\nAsked when phase two would begin, Prof Harnden said: \"We haven't put a timescale on it, but we will be looking at this over the next few weeks.\"\n\"One of the really difficult things about this vaccine is we don't know yet whether it prevents transmission,\" he said. \n\"If we can show through data that the vaccine does prevent transmission, it's a whole new ball game in terms of who we immunise because of course we may look at groups that actually transmit that virus to others.\"\nIt comes after Met Police Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said she was \"baffled\" about why front-line police officers were not closer to the front of the queue to receive the vaccine.\nThe Fire Brigades Union said it was \"glad\" Ms Patel \"appears to be listening\" to its calls for firefighters to receive priority access to vaccinations. \nBut it said \"vaccines alone will not secure the safety of firefighters and the public\" and called for safety measures in fire services to be properly implemented. \nThe teachers' union NASUWT welcomed support from ministers to prioritise education staff for the vaccine and called for the government to \"make good\" on their comments. \nGeneral secretary Dr Patrick Roach said: \"Alongside the need for tougher control measures in schools and colleges, providing education workers with access to vaccines will help to minimise further disruption to children's education and help ensure the safe and sustainable resumption of school and college-based education for all pupils as quickly as possible.\"\nLast week, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said he wanted school staff to be a \"top priority\" for the vaccine in the next phase of the rollout. \nMs Patel was also asked about why the rollout of the vaccine appeared to be slower this week than last week. \nShe said Pfizer, which is producing one of the vaccines being used in the UK, was upgrading its factories and changing its supply chains, which would \"inevitably have an implication in terms of the actual supply of the vaccine\". \nMore than 4.2 million people in the UK have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine so far, including more than half of over-80s and half of elderly care home residents.

      "text": "The health minister has been accused of \"misleading\" people after claiming the majority of over 80s had been vaccinated against Covid-19.\nVaughan Gething said he understood most people in the age group had received their first dose of the vaccine.\nFigures show there have been 43,879 doses issued - 23.9% of the priority group.\nThe Welsh Conservatives accused him of misleading people, but Mr Gething said he had made an \"innocent mistake\".\nAccording to Public Health Wales figures, the total number of first dose vaccinations has reached 190,435 in Wales - 6% of the population.\nThe figures also show 86,717 front-line health workers have also been given a first dose.\nMore than half of care home residents and two thirds of care home workers have also had their first doses.\nIn a virtual session of the Senedd on Tuesday, Mr Gething appeared to contradict the figures, saying it was his \"understanding\" that the vaccine roll out had reached \"the majority\" of Wales' over 80s population.\nMr Gething also told the Welsh Parliament that he expected 70% of over 80s in Wales and 70% of care home residents and staff to receive their first jab by the end of this weekend.\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies accused Mr Gething of misleading the Senedd, saying: \"We need an urgent statement from the health minister clarifying the situation.\"\nMr Gething has since admitted making \"an innocent mistake\" and said: \"There was a minor amount of confusion about the difference between care home residents, where we had vaccinated a majority, and over 80s.\"\nHe said that vaccination for that cohort is a \"significant priority\" and he was still \"positive\" that the target to vaccinated 70 per cent by the end of the week can be achieved.\nHe added that over 70s would be contacted soon, \"I fully expect that every health board will be inviting people over 70 to come forward for their vaccination over the next week.\"\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said that Mr Gething's aim to have over 70% of over 80s would have the jab by the end of the week, would have been \"quite a task in three days\".\n\"The health minister should explain if he thinks we're still on track. Communication is key in building public trust,\" he added.\nIn total, 9,364 (56%) of care home residents and 20,087 (67.5%) of care home workers have been given a first dose.\nThe aim is for 70% of the over 80s and care home residents to be given a first dose of vaccine by 24 January.\nThere are another 30,388 people, not designated, who have been given first doses. These include social workers and some in the main priority groups, where the data is not quite ready to be included.\nHealth officials also say there is a time lag - which can be up to five days - between the day a person is vaccinated and when the recorded data is checked and finally published. \nThis week, more than 60,000 doses of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine and 90,000 of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines to hospitals and GP practices would be rolled out. \nAsked if he shared the same confidence as the health minister that they could meet the 70% target by the weekend, Wales' chief pharmaceutical officer said he expected the roll-out to increase further, particularly as GPs would be prioritising the over 80s and care home residents into the weekend.\nThese include GPs vaccinating into the evening and over the weekend, although it could again be a few more days before those doses finally show up on the officially published data.\n\"I'm very confident that the numbers will be reflected for the over 80s by the end of the week,\" said Andrew Evans.\n\"We know that GPs across Wales are very keen to get their hands on the vaccine and, as it has happened, supply hasn't been able to meet their demand so we're confident there's the capacity and the system.\"\n\"We're all very focused on making sure we offer as many people in those [priority] groups get the vaccine as quickly as possible.\"\nResponding to criticism that the Welsh Government was falling behind other nations in administering the vaccine, Mr Evans said that Wales was moving as quickly as possible.\nHe explained that there were challenges around transportation and storage of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine which has to be kept at ultra-low temperatures in specialist centres. \nMr Evans also said that plans for the Oxford AstaZenca vaccine were based on the allotted number that they received by Public Health England each week.\n\"We get an indication week of what allocation we're getting for next week for the AstraZenca of vaccine,\" he added.\n\"It doesn't have the same shelf-life problems that the Pfizer vaccine does, so it's not the case that every dose delivered gets delivered immediately, but we know that all the professionals who are involved in the programme are ensuring that as much vaccine as they get is used within a week of receiving it.\"\nMore people have now had the first dose of the vaccine than the number - 185,035 - who have tested positive for Covid-19.\nMeanwhile, weekly figures - up to Sunday - show the vaccine roll-out across different parts of Wales, by health board.\nThe rates of first doses to Welsh residents range from 4.4% of the population in north Wales to 5.8% in Powys.\nMr Evans said the amount of vaccine a health board might have at any one time reflected the capacity or number of appointments it might have booked for its vaccination centres. \n\"That's what explains some of the variation in uptake between areas in Wales,\" he added."

      "text": "Low-deposit mortgages have made a return as the market emerges from a Covid-related slowdown.\nMortgage products for homeowners with a deposit of 10% of their property's value have risen more than fourfold compared with last summer's low.\nThe increase, based on figures from financial information service Moneyfacts, could offer some relief to first-time buyers.\nBut the cost of mortgages will remain an issue for many.\nIn early September last year, there were only 44 mortgage products available for those able to offer a 10% deposit. At the same time, first-time buyers putting money aside for a deposit were faced with pressures of poor savings rates and rising house prices.\nThat choice has now risen to 197 products, according to the Moneyfacts figures, with some big lenders returning in recent weeks.\nMortgage products for those able to offer a 15% deposit have also risen sharply, although the choice was already much greater.\n\"First-time buyers who may have been concerned that with record low savings rates and increasing house prices, their homeownership dreams may have had to be shelved, may have been pleased to note that we are now seeing some providers return products for those with 10% deposits,\" said Eleanor Williams, from Moneyfacts.\nLenders had been grappling with the practical effects that the coronavirus pandemic brought to their business.\nWhile some new businesses targeted first-time buyers on social media, many traditional lenders withdrew products from the market.\nStaff shortages, and employees working from home, meant they were unable to process applications as fast as they had before the pandemic.\nThere were also concerns among lenders that, despite strong activity in the housing market, riskier - and younger - first-time buyers could find it difficult to make mortgage repayments during an economic slowdown caused by the pandemic.\nResearch has shown that younger workers are more at risk of redundancy.\nAaron Strutt, from mortgage broker Trinity Financial, said lenders were now working more efficiently despite staff still being at home.\nHe said that some of the biggest mortgage lenders had returned to the market. Some of the mortgage rates they were offering were not as attractive as they had been, but competition would help push down costs.\n\"If you are planning to purchase a property and have a 10% deposit the mortgage rates are not as cheap as they used to be, but they are getting better,\" he said. \nMany thousands of existing mortgage-holders who had struggled to make their repayments during the pandemic had taken payment \"holidays\", which are deferrals on payments.\nThe latest figures from UK Finance, which represents lenders, show that 130,000 mortgage payment holidays were in place at the end of December 2020, down from a peak of 1.8 million in June last year."

      "text": "Scientists tracking the spread of coronavirus in England say infection levels in the community may have risen at the start of the latest lockdown.\nInfections in 6-15 January were up by 50% on early December, with one in 63 people infected, Imperial College London's initial findings suggest.\nSwab tests from 143,000 people indicate 1.58% had the virus during in early January - up from 0.91% in December.\nMinisters say the report does not yet reflect the impact of the lockdown.\nThe latest round of results from Imperial College's React-1 infection survey - one of the country's largest studies into Covid-19 infections - are interim with the full set of results to be published in a week's time.\nBut Imperial College London's Prof Paul Elliott warned if the high prevalence continues \"more lives will be lost\".\nThe report also says there are \"worrying suggestions of a recent uptick in infections\" and Prof Elliott said the third lockdown - introduced on 6 January - was not having the same impact as the first, in April.\nLondon had the highest level in the January period - 2.8%, up from 1.21% in early December.\nProf Elliott old BBC Radio 4's Today programme the current R rate - which represents how many people an infected person will pass the virus on to - was \"around 1\".\n\"We're seeing this levelling off, it's not going up, but we're not seeing the decline that we really need to see given the pressure on the NHS from the current very high levels of the virus in the population,\" he said.\n\"To prevent our already stretched health system from becoming overwhelmed, infections must be brought down,\" Prof Elliot added.\nBefore the Covid rules were tightened, the restrictions faced by people in England varied depending on where they lived.\nThe researchers say the government's latest daily case figures, which show a slowdown, may reflect a drop in cases just after Christmas, which is only now being registered. \nAnd they suggest infection levels may have gone up in early January as a result of people's activity increasing after the Christmas holiday period. \nThey admit there is some uncertainty in their data amid a \"fast-changing situation\" but say it is more up to date than the daily government figures because it does not rely on those being tested developing symptoms and then waiting to have their infections confirmed by a laboratory.\nThe UK recorded another all-time high of daily coronavirus deaths on Wednesday. A further 1,820 people died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to government figures - taking the total number of deaths by that measure to 93,290.\nThe findings of the study are seemingly at odds with recent figures from NHS Test and Trace, which has been reporting recent decreases in daily infections and has prompted some experts to suggest that we might be beginning our journey out of the woods. \nThe researchers behind the study say the test and trace figures may be reflecting an initial drop in infections just after Christmas, which is only now being registered on the official figures. \nThe study's more up to date findings indicate that infection levels did not continue to fall in the first two weeks of January and may even have gone up. So why has this happened?\nData on people's movements has shown that there's been increased activity which the scientists involved say has kept transmission of the virus at a high level. The Department of Health says that the study does not yet reflect the impact of the lockdown in England. \nBut if this trend continues, say the scientists, the numbers admitted to hospital with severe Covid illness, will not fall in the short term, as some had hoped.\nThis is one set of figures over a short number of days so there might be a more optimistic picture when the study reports its full set of results in a week's time. But there is no getting away from the fact that ministers will be disappointed not to have seen a fall at this stage. \nUnless things change, even tougher measures will have to be considered.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said there will be \"tough weeks to come\" but he hoped there would be a \"real difference\" by spring as the vaccine programme accelerates.\nIt comes as another 60 NHS Covid-19 vaccination centres in England, including a mosque in Birmingham and a cinema in Aylesbury, will welcome their first patients later.\nMinisters have sought to reassure people in the top four priority groups for the Covid vaccination that they will get their jab by the government's mid-February target, following complaints from some GPs about unpredictable supplies.\nSome 4.6m people in the UK have now received the first dose of a Covid vaccine.\nFacebook mobility data, which tracks people's movements, suggested a fall in activity at the end of December but a rise at the start of the new year.\nAnd Prof Elliott said everyone should \"reduce their mobility as much as we can\".\nA new, more transmissible variant and the fact larger households and deprived communities were more likely to be affected, may also be factors.\nThe Imperial survey is one source of data used to estimate the UK's reproduction (R) number, along with other surveys, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for example, and figures on confirmed cases and hospital admissions.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the React findings showed \"we must not let down our guard over the weeks to come\".\n\"It is absolutely paramount that everyone plays their part to bring down infections,\" he said. \n\"This means staying at home and only going out where absolutely necessary, reducing contact with others and maintaining social distancing.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Unilever",
      "text": "Unilever has said that by 2030 it will refuse to do business with any firm that does not pay at least a living wage or income to its staff.\nThe consumer goods giant defined a living wage as one that covered a family's basic needs \"and helped them break the cycle of poverty\".\nIt said it wanted to raise wages for people outside its own workforce in order to promote economic inclusion.\nUnilever is one of the first big companies to make such a commitment.\nOxfam called the move a \"step in the right direction\".\nUnilever, whose products include Marmite, Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Dove soap, said it was committed to helping to build \"a more equitable and inclusive society\".\n\"Our ambition is to improve living standards for low-paid workers worldwide,\" it said.\n\"We will therefore ensure that everyone who directly provides goods and services to Unilever earns at least a living wage or income, by 2030.\"\nThe wage should be enough to cover food, water, housing, education, healthcare, transport and clothing, and also include a provision for unexpected events, Unilever said.\nThe firm said it was working with partners to establish exact rates of pay in the 190 countries where it operates. \nHowever, Unilever's chief human resources officer Leena Nair said it would pay twice as much as the minimum wage in some countries. \nUnilever said it already paid its own employees at least a living wage, but it wanted to secure the same for more people beyond its workforce, specifically focusing on the most vulnerable workers in manufacturing and agriculture.\nWhile there is no doubting Unilever's desire to improve the lot of those who make its products, there is also a commercial reason for its living wage initiative.\nIt wants all of its suppliers to pay their staff a decent wage by 2030, a plan that has the potential, given Unilever's enormous size and global reach, to change the lives of millions of people.\nBut the company also believes the move will give it an advantage in the fierce battle to attract buyers.\nAlan Jope, Unilever's Scottish-born chief executive, says customers want to buy products with good credentials, and that this desire has only increased during the pandemic.\nMr Jope's comments suggest that the next consumer battlegrounds might not be price, convenience or range of product, but environmental and social considerations.\nUnilever wants to get ahead of that trend, and plans to do well by doing good.\n\"We will work with our suppliers, other businesses, governments and NGOs - through purchasing practices, collaboration and advocacy - to create systemic change and global adoption of living wage practices,\" it added.\nIt has more than 60,000 direct suppliers worldwide, from smallholder farmers to major companies.\nAll of them will be covered by its commitment, it said, with millions of people set to benefit.\nUnilever already audits its suppliers over climate change commitments, and will use these existing arrangements to make sure workers are being paid a living wage.\nSuppliers not willing to sign up may lose their contracts with the firm, Ms Nair said.\nAlso by 2030, Unilever said, it would equip 10 million young people with essential job skills.\nAdditionally, it committed to spending \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.8bn) with suppliers owned and managed by people from under-represented groups by 2025 in an effort to improve diversity.\n\"The two biggest threats that the world currently faces are climate change and social inequality,\" said Unilever chief executive Alan Jope.\n\"The past year has undoubtedly widened the social divide, and decisive and collective action is needed to build a society that helps to improve livelihoods, embraces diversity, nurtures talent, and offers opportunities for everyone.\"\nHe told the BBC's Today programme that Unilever wanted to be a \"positive force in the world in tackling this persistent and worsening issue of social inequality.\"\n\"Without healthy societies, we don't have a healthy business,\" he said.\nThe move is the latest in a series of ethical initiatives by Unilever, including promoting vegan food products and experimenting with a four-day working week.\nGabriela Bucher, executive director at Oxfam International, welcomed Unilever's announcement, calling it \"an important step in the right direction\".\nShe said: \"Unilever's plan shows the kind of responsible action needed from the private sector that can have a great impact on tackling inequality and help to build a world in which everyone has the power to thrive, not just survive.\"\nLaura Gardiner, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said commitments such as Unilever's show how some employers \"are leading the way in spreading the living wage through both their business networks, and across their global operations\".\nUnilever's living wage move is unusual among big firms.\nFood services giants Sodexo and Compass Group, which are on the Living Wage Foundation's list of recognised service providers, have made similar supply chain commitments in the UK."

      "text": "Stormont minister Edwin Poots has been diagnosed with a cancerous growth on his kidney and fears it could spread because of surgery delays.\nHe told the BBC's Stephen Nolan the prognosis is good but he needs surgery.\nThe cancer was discovered when he was in hospital in December for emergency surgery to remove his appendix.\nHe said the announcement that all urgent cancer surgery was being cancelled due to coronavirus pressures \"came as an awful blow\".\n\"It is absolutely doubtless that there were will be excess deaths,\" the DUP agriculture minister said.\nMr Poots, who is currently on a waiting list for cancer surgery, said his political ideology had always been against private healthcare, but he is now contemplating having a private operation.\n\"I would never have taken out private health insurance because I have always believed that what is good enough for the public is good enough for me as a public representative,\" he told the Nolan Show.\n\"But whenever I need it, it is not here to help me because it is totally absorbed in dealing with Covid-19 and that's hugely disappointing at a personal level.\"\nMr Poots added he had not yet made a decision on paying for his surgery, but would give it \"serious consideration\".\n\"If I have to spend \u00a310,000 or \u00a315,000 - I don't know how much it would be to be honest - if I have to spent that, I will do, because it is better to have something out of you that has the potential to take your life than carry on,\" he told the programme.\n\"Some people may criticise me for that but I'm not going to give up my life for a political ideology.\"\nThe 55-year-old added: \"Why would you let it spread to another organ, or let it grow, if you know the problem exists?\n\"My prognosis is good. I don't need chemotherapy. I don't need radio therapy. I need an operation.\"\nThe former health minister said he did not regret previously calling for some of the coronavirus restrictions to be lifted, despite health chiefs warning they were needed to protect the NHS. \nHe said he argued strongly that the executive needed to get tough on people who he described as \"superspreaders\" who ignored the law. \nThe assembly member for Lagan Valley said doctors believed he would need six weeks' recovery time.\nMr Poots, who had emergency surgery to remove his appendix in December, said he would be keen to get back to work as soon as possible.\n\"After my previous surgery, I got my iPad sent down to my hospital bed and got straight into my work again. I would get bored laying about,\" he said.\n\"I'll make that call with my party leader as to whether it is wise for me to carry on at that stage or whether I need to step back for a period of time. That's a judgment call I will make closer to the time.\"\nDUP leader Arlene Foster said on Twitter that she had spoken to Mr Poots after he received his diagnosis.\nThe first minister added she was reassured by the support for her party colleague from across the political spectrum.\n\"He has great determination & is sustained by a loving wife, family & great faith,\" she tweeted.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill also tweeted a message of support for Mr Poots.\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president said she was thinking of Mr Poots and his family and sent him her best wishes.\nMr Poots said his Christian faith was playing a key role in getting him through.\n\"I believe God will bring me through this and he has made people who are extremely bright and capable to be able to do what is needed to be done to save my life,\" he added. \nListen to Edwin Poots's full interview with Stephen Nolan again on BBC Sounds.

      "text": "Heavy snowfall during Storm Christoph has caused travel disruption in parts of Scotland.\nVehicles were stuck on the A9 south of Inverness and many roads in the Borders were affected by snow.\nThe Queensferry Crossing was closed for a time earlier due to the risk of falling ice before later reopening.\nAn amber alert for south-east Scotland was lifted at 08:00 but yellow alerts are in place in other parts of the country until Friday.\nTraffic was queued on the A9 after lorries and cars became stuck in snow between Tomatin and Carrbridge.\nTractors were used to tow lorries on to cleared stretches of the road.\nHeavy snow has also closed the main route to Applecross at the Bealach na Ba.\nThe A939 Cock Bridge to Tomintoul road in Moray was closed after Police Scotland shut the snowgates due to the wintry conditions.\nSnow had also affected traffic on parts of the M8.\nOn the Highlands' Far North Line, a landslip between Fearn and Tain stations has affected services.\nNetwork Rail Scotland said a section of the railway was open with a 5mph speed restriction in place.\nChris Tracey, Bear Scotland's south east unit bridges manager, said the Queensferry Crossing was temporarily closed for the safety of bridge users.\nHe said: \"We had already mobilised additional ice patrols in response to the weather forecast and the bridge was closed at 04:00 when staff observed ice falling from the structure.\"\nThe bridge was reopened after the risk had passed.\nPolice Scotland has urged people to avoid travelling in the affected areas. \nChief Superintendent Louise Blakelock said: \"Government restrictions on only travelling if your journey is essential remain in place and with an amber warning for snow, please consider if your journey really is essential and whether you can delay it until the weather improves.\n\"If you deem your journey is essential, plan ahead and make sure you and your vehicle are suitably prepared by having sufficient fuel and supplies such as warm clothing, food, water and charge in your mobile phone in the event you require assistance.\"\nPeople heading for the Pentland Hills, south-west of Edinburgh, have been urged to be aware of potential avalanche risk after avalanche debris was spotted on Turnhouse Hill.\nTweed Valley Mountain Rescue Team said the \"full depth\" avalanche had enough snow to knock a person off their feet, or even bury them.\nTeam leader Dave Wright said avalanches in the Pentland Hills were unusual and walkers, skiers and snowboarders might not appreciate the potential risk.\nHe said there had been heavy snowfalls in the hills this week and the avalanche occurred at some point on Thursday afternoon.\nMeanwhile, the potential avalanche hazard in all six mountain areas covered by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service - Glen Coe, Lochaber, Creag Meagaidh, Torridon and Northern and Southern Cairgorms - has been classed as \"considerable\".\nThe amber weather warning for snow covered a slice of Scotland from south of Edinburgh to close to the Scotland-England border and was valid until Thursday morning.\nHowever, further alerts remain in place.\nIn north-east Scotland and Orkney, a yellow warning for heavy rain and potential flooding is in place until 04:00 on Friday.\nYellow warnings for snow and ice are also in place in parts of northern and western Scotland until 12:00 on Friday.\nTransport Scotland said it was \"closely monitoring\" the road network and a multi-agency response team would be operational during the weather warnings."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,NI Health,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended until 5 March, the first and deputy first ministers have said.\nThe executive backed the health minister's proposal on Thursday and will review the move on 18 February.\nBut ministers were also told that restrictions may have to remain in place until after the Easter holidays.\nA lockdown closing non-essential retailers and encouraging employees to work from home began after Christmas.\nFamily gatherings are prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons.\nSchools are closed to most pupils until after February's half-term but a paper looking at reopening will be put to ministers at next week's executive meeting.\nThe lockdown came in response to a spike in the number of cases of coronavirus, which followed a relaxation of some rules in the run-up to Christmas.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said extending the restrictions was an \"appropriate and necessary response\" to tackle the \"imminent threat\" posed by Covid-19.\nShe said she understood it would be difficult for many people to accept, given the uncertainty facing families and businesses, but added: \"To not press forward would risk all of the hard-won gains.\"\nThe first and deputy first ministers were right to state just how tough this decision will be for many people.\nBut there's an acceptance among the public that restrictions would have to be extended, given how bad things are in our hospitals.\nTheir decision also suggests politicians have perhaps learned from the last wave of the pandemic, when restrictions were turned on and off sporadically, and the impact that had both on cases and the messaging. \nThey're not alone in sustaining tough lockdown measures, with other UK nations and the Republic of Ireland also keeping their restrictions in place for several more weeks.\nBeyond that, it is thought health officials also want to ensure the vaccination programme is also \"well advanced\" before any restrictions are relaxed.\nThe hope is that, by spring, the picture will have improved significantly. \nUntil then the price we are paying for relaxations before Christmas looks likely to keep rising.\nDeputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised the executive was asking a lot of everybody but insisted the measures were important.\n\"We don't know what will come after [5 March],\" she said.\nMs O'Neill said there was a commitment not to keep restrictions in place longer than necessary but decisions would have to be taken in line with the health advice and concerns about a new variant of the virus which is more transmissible.\nThe executive's decision comes as another 21 deaths were recorded by the Department of Health on Thursday.\nThe reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R-number - had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations.\nBut the latest estimate from the Department of Health says it is sitting between 0.65 and 0.85 for cases within the community but is still above one for hospital admissions and intensive care.\nWhile some may wonder why are restrictions are being extended when the executive's policy has always been based on this rate of infection, the difference is that this time around there are three times as many people in Northern Ireland's hospitals than there were in last April's peak.\nDaily case numbers are still significantly higher too.\nWhile ministers have agreed to keep the current restrictions in place until March, Health Minister Robin Swann said it was possible they could be needed until Easter, which this year falls in the first week of April.\nIt is understood this plan is being discussed across the four UK nations but ministers will have to consider that in the review next month.\nMinisters were also warned that restrictions would be eased on a step-by-step basis in line with reducing pressures on the health service and ensuring the vaccination programme is \"well advanced\" before any relaxations are agreed.\nMrs Foster pleaded with people struggling with their mental health during the lockdown to \"please seek help\".\nMore than 100 medically-trained military personnel are to be deployed to help health staff deal with the pressure the latest phase of the pandemic is placing on hospitals.\nThe chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the \"sustained pressure on our health service\" would probably last for three to four weeks.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, 51 Covid-19 related deaths and 2,608 new cases of the virus were recorded on Thursday.\nSimon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said the extension of the lockdown would be of \"little surprise to most businesses\".\nThe Stormont executive has agreed how to allocate almost \u00a3300m to help businesses, education, tourism and transport during the next phase of the lockdown.\nA total of \u00a3100m is going towards the Local Restrictions Support Scheme, the grant for business premises forced to closed due to the restrictions.\nThere will also be \u00a316m for tourism and hospitality, two sectors which have largely been unable to operate.\nIn addition, two more support schemes for the sector have been opened.\nOne aimed at large tourism and hospitality businesses is offering a pot of \u00a326m, with the Department for Economy having identified 250 businesses that will be eligible.\nThe other is a \u00a34m scheme to support those who provide bed-and-breakfast accommodation.\nJanice Gault from the trade body the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the schemes were a \"real lifeline for the sector\".\n\"Trading over the last year has been limited with reserves now severely depleted and businesses operating in survival mode,\" she added.\nAlso among those to receive the extra cash will be limited company directors, who had not received support since March.\nLast week, a scheme was announced to give directors \u00a31,000 grants which one director described as a \"kick in the teeth\" given that he had little to no income for the past 10 months.\nBut that scheme is to be boosted with another \u00a320m so the payments on offer will more than treble to \u00a33,500.\nLocal newspapers will also benefit from 12 months of rates relief."

      "tags": "Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's biggest ever vaccination programme is being rolled out weeks ahead of schedule, Health Minister Robin Swann has said.\nThe first vaccine was approved for UK use in early December and within days it was being given to vaccinators in NI, as well care home residents and staff.\nSince then, two more vaccines have also been approved by UK regulators.\nPeople in groups most at risk of dying or becoming seriously ill as a result of Covid are being given priority.\nThree vaccines have been approved for use in the UK: \nThe first two are already in use in Northern Ireland, but supplies of the Moderna vaccine are not expected to arrive in the UK until the spring. \nEach of the approved vaccines is given to patients in two doses, a number of weeks apart.\nPatients are being offered vaccines in order of priority, based on age and clinical vulnerability, as Covid-19 poses most danger to people who are elderly or who have underlying health problems.\nOn 12 January, Northern Ireland's Department of Health published a detailed timetable for delivering vaccinations to prioritised groups:\nOn Friday February 19, the department announced that carers over the age of 18 could also now book their vaccine appointment.\nPrioritisation was decided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments on immunisation.\nIt is expected that mass vaccination will only become available to the general population from the summer of 2021.\nThe latest available figures from the Department of Health show a total of 418,209 vaccines had been administered by 17 February. \nOf that figure, 29,476 jabs were second doses.\nAs of 16 February the following had received first doses:\nBy 4 February every one of Northern Ireland's 483 care homes had been visited by mobile vaccination teams, while 90% of homes had been visited for second doses.\nEarlier, the Department of Health said there had been an uptake level of more than 90% among residents - and about 80% among staff.\nOn 2 December, the UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nSix days later, Belfast nurse Joanna Sloan became the first person in Northern Ireland, and indeed on the island of Ireland, to be vaccinated.\nThe 28-year-old leads the Belfast Health Trust's vaccination programme.\nLater on 8 December, the first care home residents in Northern Ireland were vaccinated at Palmerston residential home in east Belfast.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was approved for use in the UK on 30 December 2020.\nOn 4 January 2021, 94-year-old Eileen Lynch became Northern Ireland's first recipient.\nThe pensioner said she felt \"delighted and privileged\" after getting the injection at her GP surgery on the Falls Road in west Belfast.\nThe UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), confirmed the US-made Moderna vaccine was safe and effective to use on 8 January.\nThe UK has pre-ordered 17m doses, but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring 2021.\nPfizer-BioNTech, which produced its vaccine in Belgium, has reported 95% protection against Covid-19.\nThe Moderna vaccine offers similar protection at nearly 95%, while trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine showed it was between 62% and 90% effective.\nResearch from Oxford University found the AstraZeneca vaccine offered 76% effective protection from a single dose for three months.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech product is an RNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.\nAn RNA vaccine had never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received such a vaccine in clinical trials.\nThe Moderna vaccine uses the same RNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and reported similar effectiveness.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. \nIt has been modified to look more like the coronavirus, but cannot cause illness.\nThe jab prompts the immune system to start making antibodies and primes it to attack any coronavirus infection.\nAll the approved vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection.\nInitially, the strategy for the Pfizer vaccine was to offer people the second dose 21 days after their initial jab - full immunity starts seven days after the second dose.\nBut when approval was announced for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 30 December, it was also announced that the new priority would be to give as many people a good level of protection with the first shot of either vaccine, rather than providing the required two doses to a smaller number of people in as short a time as possible.\nEveryone will still receive their second dose, but this will now be within 12 weeks of their first. \nThe US regulator and some UK experts have questioned the policy, saying it is premature without more trial evidence, but the UK's MHRA says it is a pragmatic decision that will protect more people.\nAn Oxford University study has suggested that, with no fall in protection during the three-month period following the first jab, research supported gaps between first and second doses of between four and 12 weeks.\nThe official guidance states that every person should get the same vaccine for both doses.\nHowever, in the very rare circumstance in which only one vaccine is available at a vaccination site or it's unknown which product an individual received for their first dose, Public Health England has advised a different vaccine could be administered. \nBut this advice does stress \"this option is preferred if the individual is likely to be at immediate high risk or is considered unlikely to attend again\". \nExperts have concluded that both vaccines are very effective, and have not stipulated a preference for either one in any specific population.\nIn Northern Ireland, care home residents were given the Pfizer jab, while other people aged 80 and over were called to their GP surgery to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Housebound patients have also received this vaccine.\nIn January, the Department of Health announced a new twin-track approach for younger groups.\nThis allowed people aged 65-69 to book slots at their local vaccination centres, where they received the Pfizer jab.\nPeople aged over 70 were to attend their GP and receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nHowever on 17 February it was announced that any over-70s who had not yet been contacted by their GP to come for vaccination could book a slot for the Pfizer vaccine at a local centre. \nThe Pfizer jab at the vaccine centres is also being given to people in NI who received a shielding letter as they are clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) as well as carers who are in receipt of caring benefits, are registered care home partners or whose illness would jeopardise the welfare of the person they care for.\nMeanwhile people aged 18-64 with underlying health conditions - as well as their carers - will be contacted by GPs for an Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. \nThere are some questions over when exactly people with asthma will get vaccinated as some will be in the 18-64 group with underlying conditions, some in the CEV group and some will not fall into any group.\nTheir GP will assess the severity of their condition and they will then be assigned to a group for vaccination priority.\nThe eventual aim is that as many people as possible over the age of 18 receive a Covid-19 vaccine. \nIt won't be compulsory, though - no other vaccines in the UK are - as experts say this wouldn't help create confidence in the vaccine.\nThe government has so far ordered seven different types of vaccine and expects to receive 367 million doses.\nIf everyone needs two doses, that would certainly be enough for every adult in the UK.\nAnyone with a previous history of allergic reactions to the ingredients of the vaccine should not receive it, but those with any other allergies such as a food allergy can now have the vaccine. \nA severe allergic reaction - known as anaphylaxis - is a very rare side-effect with any vaccine, but it can happen in those at risk. Most people, however, will not be affected in any way.\nThe medical regulator, the MHRA, says anyone due to receive their vaccine should discuss any medical history of serious allergies with their healthcare professional beforehand.\nVaccination with either vaccine should only be considered for pregnant women when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks - for instance where the risk of exposure to coronavirus is high and cannot be avoided, or where the woman has underlying health conditions that put her at high risk of complications of Covid-19.\nWomen should discuss the benefits and risks of having the vaccine with their healthcare professional and reach a joint decision based on individual circumstances. \nWomen who are breastfeeding can be given the vaccine. \nThere are no specific safety concerns with the vaccines - but they were not tested on pregnant women during the trials.\nPregnant women are likely to be low down the list of priority groups because of their age, and may only be offered a vaccine in the second phase in 2021.\nNo - this vaccine is being rolled out free to people via the NHS.\nYou can't jump the queue by paying for it but there should be plenty of vaccine to go round.\nIf you're eligible for a flu vaccine, you should get it as soon as possible, particularly if you will also be in a high-risk priority group for a Covid jab.\nHaving both illnesses at once this winter could be dangerous. \nAt its last meeting, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended leaving at least seven days between the vaccines.\nSome people have mild symptoms, such as muscle aches or a bit of a temperature, after being vaccinated.\nThis is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients will be listed.\nRussia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics. \nBoth work in a similar way to the Oxford vaccine.\nHere are some of your questions about the roll-out of the vaccination, new international travel rules and school closures."

      "text": "Fines of \u00a3800 for anyone attending a house party of more than 15 people will be introduced in England from next week, under new Covid measures.\nThese will double for each repeat offence to a maximum of \u00a36,400.\nAt a No 10 news conference, Home Secretary Priti Patel said there remained a \"small minority that refuse to do the right thing\". \n\"To them my message is clear. If you don't follow rules then the police will enforce them,\" she said.\nCurrently in England the fine for those attending illegal indoor gatherings stands at \u00a3200 - or \u00a3100 if paid early.\nFines of up to \u00a310,000 for holding large illegal gatherings of more than 30 people will still only apply to the organisers.\nPolice will continue to follow the strategy of engaging with the public, explaining the rules and encouraging compliance, but the Home Office has warned that in severe breaches of lockdown rules, offenders should expect to receive a fine.\nMs Patel said the government would \"not stand by while a small number of individuals put others at risk\".\nShe was joined at the briefing by NHS England regional medical director for London Dr Vin Diwakar, who compared breaking the rules to turning on a light in the middle of a blackout during the Blitz.\n\"It doesn't just put you at risk in your house, it puts your whole street and the whole of your community at risk,\" he said.\nWelcoming the fines announcement, Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said large gatherings were \"dangerous, irresponsible, and totally unacceptable\".\nHe added: \"I hope that the likelihood of an increased fine acts as a disincentive for those people who are thinking of attending or organising such events.\"\nOfficial figures will be released next week showing how many fines have been given out since the start of this latest national lockdown, Mr Hewitt said. \nHowever, he stressed that \"forces are telling us there has been a significant increase\" in recent weeks. \n\"That's reflecting the fact that we've had more officers out on dedicated patrols taking targeted action against those small few who are letting everybody down,\" he said.\nAccording to Mr Hewitt, three police officers were injured in Brick Lane, east London, last week, after more than 40 people were found cramped indoors at a house party.\nMeanwhile, more than 150 people were found at a party in Hertfordshire, complete with music equipment including mixing decks and amplifiers, and another officer was injured.\nHe said forces in England had issued 250 fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to people organising large gatherings between late August, when regulations were introduced, and 17 January.\nIn some other recent examples of lockdown breaches:\nThe latest fines announcement comes after figures showed that assaults on emergency workers made up more than a quarter of Covid-related crimes prosecuted in the first six months of the pandemic.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there were 1,688 such offences between 1 April and 30 September in England and Wales.\nThey were among almost 6,500 crimes related to coronavirus in that period.\nSome 1,137 charges were brought for breaking coronavirus laws, according to the figures published by the CPS - which cover completed prosecutions. \nOn Thursday, it was reported that another 1,290 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK, bringing the total to 94,580.\nAnd a further 37,892 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus were announced, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 3,543,646."

      "tags": "Donald Trump,US politics,Coronavirus pandemic,Joe Biden",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden has issued two more executive orders as he continues to roll back his predecessor's agenda.\nHe signed one order on boosting food assistance and another on raising the federal minimum wage to $15.\nBrian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council, said the action would \"provide a critical lifeline\" to millions of families. \nIt comes a day after the new US president signed a raft of orders to boost the fight against coronavirus.\nThis included expanding testing and accelerating vaccine distribution. \nMr Biden said it would take months to defeat the pandemic but America would \"get through this\" if people stood together.\nThe Trump administration was widely accused of failing to get to grips with the pandemic. \nThe US has recorded the highest coronavirus death toll of any country in the world, with more than 410,000 fatalities, according to data collated by John Hopkins University. It has recorded more than 24.6 million cases. \nMr Biden signed the two executive orders on Friday.\nThe first increases food aid for children who rely on school meals as a main source for nutrition, but are unable to access them because of remote learning.\nIt also creates a guarantee that workers can access unemployment benefits if they refuse a job on the grounds that it could jeopardise their health.\nThe second is aimed at expanding protections for federal workers, by restoring collective bargaining rights and promoting a $15 (\u00a311) hourly minimum wage. \nMr Deese said the orders were \"not a substitute\" for a $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill that Mr Biden wants Congress to pass, but an essential lifeline for people who need immediate assistance.\n\"The American people cannot afford to wait,\" he told reporters. \"So many are hanging by a thread. They need help, and we're committed to doing everything we can to provide that help as quickly as possible.\"\nThe day after taking office, Mr Biden signed 10 executive orders as part of a sweeping \"wartime\" Covid action plan.\nThis included increasing vaccinations and testing, and expanding the production of essential equipment.\nMr Biden said that the \"bold practical steps\" that he was taking would not come cheaply.\n\"Let me be clear - things will continue to get worse before they get better,\" he said, adding that he expected the number of dead to top half a million by next month.\n\"This is a wartime undertaking,\" he said, repeating that more Americans had already died in the pandemic than in the whole of World War Two.\nHe mentioned the vaccine, saying that its rollout had been a \"dismal failure so far\", and described his plan for 100 million jabs in his first 100 days in office as \"one of the greatest operational challenges our nation has ever taken on\".\nBut when challenged by a reporter who suggested the target might be too low, he snapped back: \"When I announced it you all said that it's not possible. Come on. Give me a break, man.\" \nSome US media commentators have argued that Mr Biden's goal of one million doses administered daily to Americans is not ambitious enough.\nThe daily average for coronavirus vaccine doses over the last week, including under the Trump administration, already sits at 980,000, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker.\nMr Biden also promised to be transparent about setbacks, and allow scientists to work free from political interference.\n\"I'm convinced the American people are ready to spare no effort to get this done,\" he concluded. \"We can do this if we stand together.\"\nSpeaking separately chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci spoke about the vaccine rollout, saying the Biden administration was \"amplifying\" the programme that was already there.\nIf, as hoped, 70-85% of the population was vaccinated by the end of summer, there would be \"a degree of normality\" by autumn, he said.\nDr Fauci said his main concern was persuading people who were sceptical about the vaccine to take it.\nHe added that the administration was in talks with manufacturers to produce more vaccine, amid reports of supply problems. Some regional officials say they have run out of available vaccine.\nNearly 20 million shots have been administered so far.\nDr Fauci, who served under Mr Trump, also welcomed the new administration's emphasis on science.\n\"The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the evidence, what the science is... it is something of a liberating feeling,\" he said, whereas under Mr Trump, \"you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions\".\nThe new administration has released a seven-point plan which includes efforts to facilitate effective distribution of vaccines and reliable access to testing.\nThe Trump administration had been criticised for a lack of strategy at the federal level.\n\"The American people deserve an urgent, robust and professional response to the growing public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak,\" an introduction to the plan said.\nIt said Mr Biden believed the government \"must act swiftly and aggressively to help protect and support\" essential workers and the most vulnerable.\nAlthough executive orders do not require congressional approval, much of the funding for the planned measures is contained in the $1.9tn stimulus package announced by Mr Biden last week.\nHe will need co-operation from the Senate and House of Representatives for the package to be adopted smoothly.\nThe aim is to reopen most schools safely within 100 days, and establish vaccine centres at stadiums and community facilities. \nInternational travellers will need to test negative before departing for the US and self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival.\nOn top of the already announced rules on wearing masks and social distancing on all federal government property, face coverings will become mandatory in airports and on many planes, trains and buses. \nThere will be more funding for state and local officials to help tackle the pandemic, and a new office will be established to co-ordinate the national response. \nThe Defense Production Act will be used to speed up production of personal protective equipment and essential supplies needed for vaccine production. Mr Trump used the same piece of legislation to compel the production of items in short supply last year. \nIn a further break with the previous administration, Dr Fauci said the US would join the Covax scheme designed to deliver Covid vaccines to poor countries. \nSpeaking by video call to the World Health Organization in Geneva, he also stressed that the US would continue to provide funding for the WHO, in line with Mr Biden's move to reverse Mr Trump's decision to leave.

      "title": "Kamala Harris: What the vice-president did on her first day",
      "tags": "Kamala Harris,US election 2020,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Kamala Harris has made history, becoming the first woman and first black and South Asian American to serve as US vice-president. \nSo what does the job involve? And what did Ms Harris do first?\nHistorically speaking, not a lot. It has been described as the least understood, most ridiculed and most often ignored constitutional role in the federal government, and for a long time it stayed that way.\n\"The role of the vice-president was, frankly, to just be that heartbeat away from the president,\" said Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Centre. Unless the president died, or was seriously ill, the vice-president's job was largely to sit around and wait. \nFor some vice-presidents, the dynamic meant holding a job you hoped would never be needed. \"One of the vice-presidents in the early 20th Century said, 'Every day I ring the doorbell at the White House and hope the president will answer,'\" Ms Perry said. \nThat's not a role to take lightly. Nine of the country's 45 presidents has left office before the end of their term, eight by death - about one fifth of all presidents - giving their vice-presidents a sudden promotion. At 78 years old, Mr Biden is the oldest president to assume the office, putting added stress on his next-in-line. \nIt wasn't until the 1970s, under President Jimmy Carter, that the vice-president began to assume a bigger role. \nMr Carter, a former Georgia governor, had built his candidacy around being a political outsider. \"He knew he didn't know Washington,\" Ms Perry said. So when he won the nomination, he called on Walter Mondale, a long-time US senator, to show him the ropes and be a \"true governing partner\". \nWhile their close relationship was new, their strategic match followed a well-worn pattern of vice-presidents offering geographical or ideological balance to the president. \nThe practice has continued on most recent political tickets. Barack Obama, then a relative political newcomer, tapped Joe Biden, a 35-year veteran of the US Senate. Donald Trump went with Mike Pence, whose evangelical bona fides were thought to smooth over Mr Trump's image for the religious right. And Ms Harris offers a counter to Joe Biden's age, gender and race.\nWhat's more, this time the ceremonial role held by the vice-president as president of the Senate will prove crucial for Ms Harris' party. There is currently a 50-50 seat split between Democrats and Republicans in the upper chamber, and Ms Harris will cast the deciding ballot in any tie. \nAs she walked along Pennsylvania Avenue with her family in the inauguration parade, Vice-President Harris knew her ceremonial tasks were over.\n\"I'm just walking to work,\" she said.\nMoments later she was entering the White House, her new workplace, to join her new boss in tackling some pretty daunting challenges.\nShe has reportedly been in all the key meetings during the transition, helping to shape the Biden agenda, so would have had major input on the 15 executive orders he signed on Wednesday.\nIt wasn't long after arriving at the White House that she was off to the Senate, over which she now presides in her new job.\nThere she swore in three new senators, and gave a chuckle as she read out her own resignation.\nShe has not yet moved into the vice-presidential residence, so spent the night in her current address.\nOn Thursday morning she watched the virtual inaugural prayer service and received a daily intelligence briefing. \nMs Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff will set up home in a different white house - a 19th Century mansion on the grounds of the US Naval Observatory in north-west Washington. \nThe estate is close to the White House grounds, where Ms Harris will have her office, and not far from Georgetown University's law school, where Mr Emhoff, an attorney, is set to teach. \nTo get around, Ms Harris and Mr Emhoff will also have access to Air Force Two, a Boeing 757, and they will have round-the-clock security. \nWhile Mr Biden and Mr Obama often put their bromance on display during their time in the White House, close personal relationships between presidents and vice-presidents have not been the norm, Ms Perry said.\nBut since Mr Biden officially brought on Ms Harris this summer, it has seemed to be smooth sailing, Ms Perry said. \nMr Biden has said \"there's not a single decision I've made yet\" about his administration that he hasn't consulted with Ms Harris on first. She has also interviewed each of Biden's potential cabinet nominees.\nA friendly relationship makes sense between the two, considering it was Ms Harris' close relationship with Mr Biden's son, Beau - who died of brain cancer in 2015 - that reportedly sealed the deal for Mr Biden. \nIt's a surprise to some who remember Ms Harris' sharp debate-stage attacks aimed directly at Mr Biden when they were both competing for the Democratic nomination. \"Biden clearly lets bygones be bygones,\" Ms Perry said. \nMr Biden is likely to model Ms Harris' role after his own time as vice-president. \nWhen he introduced her as his running mate at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, he recalled the time he was chosen for the same job by Barack Obama in 2008. \nMr Obama asked what Mr Biden wanted from the role. \n\"I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions,\" Mr Biden said. \"That's what I asked Kamala. I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room. To always tell me the truth.\" \nMs Harris joined Mr Biden's team as a political star in her own right. Though her own presidential bid failed to find its focus and sputtered to an early halt, it earned her a devoted fan following (they call themselves the #KHive).\nAnd despite continued criticism from the left wing of her party, Ms Harris had one of the most liberal voting records in the US Senate, pursuing progressive causes like gay rights, immigration, legalisation of marijuana and gun control. She also has an extensive legal r\u00e9sum\u00e9, having served as California's top lawyer before her Senate bid. \nHer legal experience and advocacy for police reform will be useful in a White House that has promised to address \"systemic\" misconduct in US police forces. This summer, amid a wave of Black Lives Matters protests, Ms Harris was a vocal supporter of the demonstrations and called for a \"reimagining\" of US policing.\nBut as a vice-presidential \"first\" three times over, she will enter office shouldering heavy expectations. \"While I may be the first woman in this office,\" Ms Harris is fond of saying, \"I will not be the last.\" \nThe historic moment for black Americans is worth celebrating, said Jennifer Edwards, senior director at racial justice organisation Color of Change. \"But we learned time and time again that representation alone doesn't lead to transformative change.\"  \n\"Hundreds of thousands of black women have fought, organised and voted to reach this moment. Now, Vice-President Kamala Harris has a responsibility to represent demands of the people who ushered her into office,\" she said.  \nMs Edwards said she will be looking for progress in Covid-19 economic relief, on criminal justice and voting and election reform. \nAs the more left-wing half of the political partnership, Ms Harris may face blame for perceived shortfalls here, and elsewhere in their progressive agenda. \nAnd reports that Mr Biden will not seek re-election will mean a balancing act for Ms Harris - how to remain a loyal aide to Mr Biden while also plotting her own run. \nFirstly, it's crucial that the American public see the vice-president as competent, and able to take the reins as commander-in-chief at any moment.\nThis has not always been the case. President George Bush's deputy, Dan Quayle, for example, was \"not viewed as the brightest bulb in the drawer,\" Ms Perry said.\nThe impression was cemented during a visit to an elementary school. A student was called upon to write a word, 'potato', on the chalkboard. \"The student wrote 'potato' as it was correctly spelled,'\" Ms Perry said. But Vice-President Quayle chipped in, saying the word needed an E at the end. \nA vice-president should also avoid getting on their boss's bad side. \nSoon after his 1828 election, President Andrew Jackson developed a deep dislike of Vice-President John Calhoun. The two differed on policy and on Washington's social scene. The antipathy between the two grew so intense that Mr Calhoun became the first vice-president in US history to resign. \nStill, the title for worst vice-presidential mistake probably rests with the country's third, Aaron Burr. While in office, Mr Burr shot and killed his rival, American founding father Alexander Hamilton, in a duel. But while it ruined his reputation, Mr Burr still completed his term, sheltered from prosecution. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "tags": "Poetry,Joe Biden",
      "text": "Amanda Gorman has become the youngest poet ever to perform at a presidential inauguration, calling for \"unity and togetherness\" in her self-penned poem.\nThe 22-year-old delivered her work The Hill We Climb to both the dignitaries present in Washington DC and a watching global audience.\n\"When day comes, we ask ourselves where can we find light in this never-ending shade?\" her five-minute poem began.\nShe went on to reference the storming of the Capitol earlier this month.\n\"We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy,\" she declared.\n\"And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.\"\nIn her poem, Gorman described herself as \"a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother [who] can dream of becoming president, only to find her self reciting for one\".\nAmerica's first-ever National Youth Poet Laureate did her job, which was to find the right words at the right time. \nIt was a beautifully paced, well-judged poem for a special occasion, but it will live long beyond the time and space of the moment. \nAmanda Gorman delivered her piece with grace, the words it contained will resonate with people the world over:  today, tomorrow, and far into the future.\nThe writer and performer, who became the country's first National Youth Poet Laureate in 2017, followed in the footsteps of such famous names as Robert Frost and Maya Angelou.\n\"I really wanted to use my words to be a point of unity and collaboration and togetherness,\" Gorman told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme before the ceremony.\n\"I think it's about a new chapter in the United States, about the future, and doing that through the elegance and beauty of words.\"\nGorman's reading was widely praised. \nUS broadcaster and actress Oprah Winfrey tweeted that she had \"never been prouder to see another young woman rise\".\nAlso on Twitter, Joanne Liu, the former head of aid agency M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, described the poem as \"the most inspiring 5:43 minutes for the longest time\".\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama praised Gorman's \"strong and poignant words\" adding: \"Keep shining, Amanda!\"\nUS politician and rights activist Stacey Abrams said the poem was \"an inspiration to us all\".\nFormer presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted that Gorman had promised to run for president in 2036 and added: \"I for one can't wait.\"\nIllinois poet laureate Angela Jackson said the recitation was \"so rich and just so filled with truth\".\n\"I was stunned that she was so young and so wise,\" Jackson told the Chicago Sun-Times.\nGorman said she \"screamed and danced her head off\" when she found out she had been chosen to read at President Biden's swearing-in ceremony.\nShe said she felt \"excitement, joy, honour and humility\" when she was asked to take part, \"and also at the same time terror\".\nAnd she added that she hoped her poem, completed on the day supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, would \"speak to the moment\" and \"do this time justice\".\nBorn in Los Angeles in 1998, Gorman had a speech impediment as a child - an affliction she shares with America's new president.\n\"It's made me the performer that I am and the storyteller that I strive to be,\" she said in a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times.\n\"When you have to teach yourself how to say sounds [and] be highly concerned about pronunciation, it gives you a certain awareness of sonics, of the auditory experience.\"\nGorman became LA's youth poet laureate at 16. Three years later, while studying sociology at Harvard, she became National Youth Poet Laureate.\nShe published her first book, The One for Whom Food Is Not Enough, in 2015 and will publish a picture book, Change Sings, later this year.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

I'm pleased that 110 medically-trained personnel from our Armed Forces will support health and social care teams across Northern Ireland in their vital work on the frontline against coronavirus.\"\nThe move has been welcomed by the Democratic Unionist Party.\nWhen it was announced last April that the health minster had made requests for military help, Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill said Mr Swann had taken that decision unilaterally.\nHowever, she later said her party would not rule out any measure necessary to save lives.\nReacting to the latest request for help, Sinn F\u00e9in said its priority throughout the pandemic had been to save lives, keep people safe and protect the health service.\n\"The Minister of Health has made a request for staffing support from the British Ministry of Defence,\" the party said.\n\"We do not rule out any measures to do so, and any effort to make the threat posed by Covid-19 into a green and orange issue is divisive and a distraction.\"\nAs of Wednesday, there were 832 people in hospital in Northern Ireland with coronavirus, of whom 67 were in intensive care, with 57 ventilated.\nA further 22 people with coronavirus died, bringing the Department of Health's total to 1,671 while there were 905 new cases.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, 61 new Covid-19-related deaths were recorded on Wednesday, bringing the country's death toll to 2,768.\nA further 2,488 new cases of the virus were also confirmed by the Irish Department for Health.\nSpeaking at Stormont's press briefing on Wednesday, Mr Swann confirmed the executive would review the current lockdown regulations on Thursday.\nNorthern Ireland began a six-week lockdown on 26 December, in a bid to bring the virus under control.\nMinisters promised to review the regulations after four weeks.\nMr Swann said he would not pre-empt the outcome of Thursday's meeting but confirmed he would bring recommendations from his officials to the meeting.\n\"This is not the time to open floodgates or take premature decisions that would lead to another spike in cases,\" he added.\n\"We must stay the course.\"\nThe minister also provided the latest update on the number of vaccinations - 160,396 doses have now been administered in NI, with 21,690 of those second doses.\nHe said he understood the frustration of some people that they were still waiting to hear when their elderly or vulnerable relatives would receive their vaccine, but he urged patience.\n\"We cannot go faster than supplies allow,\" he said."

      "text": "The education secretary has said he would \"certainly hope\" schools in England could reopen before Easter.\nGavin Williamson said he was \"not able to exactly say\" when pupils would go back but schools would be given two weeks' notice before reopening.\nPrimary and secondary schools remain closed, apart from to vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers.\nDowning Street said the prime minister wanted schools to open as quickly as possible but would follow the evidence.\n\"If we can open them up before Easter then we obviously will do but that is determined by the latest scientific evidence and data,\" the prime minister's official spokesman said.\nThe Downing Street spokesman was also less specific about the promise of two weeks' notice, saying:  \"We want to give schools as much notice as possible.\"\nSchools have been closed to most pupils so far this term, with primary schools closing after one day back, in response to rising Covid levels.\nPupils have been told they will be learning at home until at least half-term in mid-February.\nBut Mr Williamson was pressed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether he could guarantee that schools would reopen at all this term, before the Easter holidays.\n\"I want to see them, as soon as the scientific and health advice is there, open at the earliest possible stage - and I certainly hope that would be certainly before Easter,\" said the education secretary, who's responsible for schools in England.\nHe said schools and parents would have \"absolutely proper notice\" of when children were going to return, which he said would be a \"clear two weeks\" for teachers and families to get ready.\nBy Sean Coughlan, BBC News education and family correspondent\nA lesson from the first lockdown was that it's much harder to reopen schools than to close them.\nParents and teachers have to be persuaded again it's safe to go back, families need advance notice to plan their work  and childcare, schools need to organise their staffing.\nAnd there are other parents who will be pushing for schools to go back as soon as possible, in addition to the vulnerable and key workers' children already attending.\nFor Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, already under pressure, it means a high-stakes balancing act - and it clearly remains uncertain whether this will happen for all schools before the Easter holidays.\nWhat seems likely, from Mr Williamson and England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries, is that this could be a patchwork return beginning after half-term, rather than a single starting date, depending on local levels of the virus.\nThe biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, said schools and parents needed certainty and not a \"stop-start approach\".\nLast week Mr Williamson indicated to the Commons education committee that schools in some parts of the country might stay closed at the end of the lockdown, with a return to the \"contingency\" arrangements, under which schools in areas of high infection would be shut.\nOn Tuesday, England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries also said schools might reopen region by region in a phased return after half-term.\nLabour has accused the education secretary of causing \"chaos and confusion\" and called on him to resign.\nParty leader Sir Keir Starmer said providing two weeks' advance notice of opening was \"good news coming from an education secretary who normally gives them about 24 hours' notice\".\nSir Keir said the government needed to \"give children the ability to learn at home now\" and \"get on with the blindingly obvious\" task of getting testing in place in schools.\nAsked about his own future, Mr Williamson said: \"Our focus is making sure that we get the very best of remote education out to all children across the country, making sure that we return schools at the earliest possible moment.\"\nIn terms of his own achievements, the education secretary said: \"I'll let other people do the grading.\"\nSchools have also been closed by other governments in the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland they will remain closed until at least the middle of February, while in Wales the next review of restrictions will be on 29 January.\nThe government has also paused plans to roll out rapid daily coronavirus testing in all but a small number of secondary schools and colleges, with health officials saying the new variant meant the risk of missing infections had risen.\nBut Mr Williamson emphasised that mass testing in schools would continue, clarifying that it was the daily tests for those who had been in contact with a positive case which had been stopped.\nThe education secretary was also challenged on the fairness of setting tests as part of the replacement for cancelled GCSEs and A-levels, considering pupils will have missed different amounts of time in school.\nMr Williamson said the tests were only \"one element\" for deciding replacement results, which would be based on teachers' grades.\n\"That's why we're asking teachers to make a judgement in the round. We're asking teachers to look at the work they've been doing over the whole period of time they've been studying the course,\" he said."

      "text": "University tuition fees in England will be frozen at a maximum of \u00a39,250 for the next academic year.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) said a longer-term decision on cuts to fees would be delayed until the next Comprehensive Spending Review. \nBut education sector groups said the government \"is wasting an opportunity\" to help university students.\nMinisters also set out plans to improve post-16 vocational education including student loans for adult learners.\nThe DfE also launched a consultation on changing the timetable for applying to university - to a so-called \"post-qualification admissions\" system.\nThis would mean admissions being based on the grades achieve by students, rather than not relying on predictions.\nThe government outlined its plans for higher education reforms for over-18s in response to a landmark review, commissioned by the government from finance expert Philip Augar. Its recommendations were published in May 2019.\nPlanned reforms include making \u00a32.5bn available for technical qualifications for adult learners through the National Skills Fund, a lifelong student loan entitlement for up to four years of higher education and the prioritising of funding for STEM subjects.\nBut the Augar review's recommendations to reduce tuition fees to \u00a37,500, alongside implementing reforms to minimum entry standards and foundation years at universities, were not addressed in this latest response. \nThe DfE said given the pandemic \"now is not the right time to conclude the review in full\". \nAny further reforms are expected to be announced at the next Spending Review.\nMr Augar also suggested the return of maintenance grants for poorer university students as part of his review, but there was not mention of this in the interim response. \nUniversity and College Union general secretary Jo Grady said: \"Sadly this interim response confirms that there will not be a radical change to the current system. \n\"The Westminster government is wasting an opportunity to make a real difference for students and institutions.\"\nProf Julia Buckingham, president of Universities UK , welcomed the prospect of lifelong loans, saying \"it is encouraging to see government's commitment to making lifelong learning opportunities more accessible to all\".\nHowever, Prof Buckingham said \"government should provide maintenance grants for those who need them the most, including those considering studying shorter courses on a modular basis\". \nAs part of its Skills for Jobs White Paper, published alongside higher education reforms, the DfE said it wanted to \"put an end to the illusion that a degree is the only route to success and a good job and that further and technical education is the second-class option\".\nA white paper is a policy document produced by the government to set out their proposals for future legislation.\nThe measures put forward include:\nIn December, the government announced that tens of thousands of adults without an A-level or equivalent would be able to benefit from nearly 400 fully-funded courses from April.\nIt was the first major development in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Lifetime Skills Guarantee (LSG) scheme, which was launched in September.\nMr Johnson said it would mean \"everyone will be given the chance to get the skills they need, right from the very start of their career\".\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said: \"These reforms are at the heart of our plans to build back better, ensuring all technical education and training is based on what employers want and need, whilst providing individuals with the training they need to get a well-paid and secure job.\"\nBritish Chamber of Commerce director general Adam Marshall welcomed the plans to put the skills needs of businesses at the heart of further education. \n\"As local business leaders look to rebuild their firms and communities in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, it is essential to ensure that the right skills and training provision is in place to support growth,\" he added. \nBut organisations representing school and college leaders are also sceptical that there is enough funding for the further education sector to deliver on the proposals.\nIn November, an the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said FE colleges and sixth forms faced significant financial uncertainty. \nChief executive of the Association of Colleges David Hughes said: \"Colleges have been calling for this, after years of being overlooked and underutilised, but government has to not only recognise the vital college role, it also needs to increase funding.\""

      "tags": "Delivery services,Economic effects of Brexit,Brexit,Trade",
      "text": "\"I had no idea at all I was going to be charged any more for deliveries after Brexit. The extra costs were definitely a bit of a shock.\"\nEllie Huddleston, a 26-year-old Londoner, thought she would treat herself to some new work clothes in the January sales. \nHaving spotted a bargain, she placed an order for a coat and a number of blouses from two of her favourite clothes brands based in Europe.\nBut both deliveries were delayed, held up in customs checks for at least a week, she says.\nShe was surprised when she then received a text from courier company DPD, containing a link asking her to pay \u00a358 in customs duties, VAT and additional charges for her \u00a3180 order.\nOn top of that, the UPS courier for the second parcel showed up at her door several days later, asking for an extra payment of \u00a382 for her \u00a3200 coat.\nThese charges, imposed by new government rules, have to be collected by the courier firms on the authorities' behalf.\n\"I didn't even know when the parcels would be coming - so I sent both back without paying the extra fees and won't be ordering anything from Europe again any time soon,\" Ellie says.\nWhen the UK was part of the European Union's customs union, goods could move freely between the country and other member states without import taxes being charged.\nBut Ellie was one of the shoppers caught unaware of the fact that those rules have changed since the UK's official exit.\nEU retailers sending packages to the UK now need to fill out customs declaration forms. Shoppers may also have to pay customs or VAT charges, depending on the value of the product and where it came from.\nHowever, customs charges are the responsibility of the customer, not the retailer, who often has no idea of how much the eventual extra cost might be.\nThey cannot be paid in advance and are levied only when the item reaches the UK.\nAnother unhappy customer, Graeme from Manchester, paid \u00a3300 to buy two pairs of suede winter boots from a German firm online.\n\"You couldn't get them anywhere in the UK, so I had no choice but to order them from Europe,\" he told the BBC.\nThe next thing he knew, courier UPS had sent him a text message saying he had to pay \u00a3147 extra before the boots could be delivered. He paid up, but is still waiting for the goods to arrive.\n\"It was virtually impossible to find out what the charges would be beforehand,\" he says, \"so I had to take a shot in the dark.\n\"I didn't imagine that it would be half as much again.\"\nUnder the new rules, anyone in the UK receiving a gift from the EU worth more than \u00a339 may now face a bill for import VAT - with many items charged at 20%. \nFor goods costing more than \u00a3135, customs duties may also apply, which can range from 0% to 25% of the product you're buying if they have not been paid by the sender already.\nThe extra charges are usually collected by the courier on behalf of the government, with customers asked to pay before they can pick up their package.\nSome specialist European retailers, such as bicycle part firm Dutch Bike Bits and Belgium-based Beer On Web, recently said that they would stop all deliveries to the UK because of the VAT changes, which came into force on 1 January.\nSome firms have started charging additional \"handling fees\" to shoppers to cover costs associated with extra customs checks and paperwork that must be filled out.\nRoyal Mail, for example, is charging an \u00a38 fee it says \"reflects the cost of clearing items through customs and presenting them to Border Force\".\nMeanwhile, delivery firm DHL says it is charging UK customers 2.5% of the amount paid to clear customs, with a minimum charge of \u00a311. \nMail and freight company TNT is also adding \u00a34.31 on all shipments from the UK to the EU and vice versa. It has said this reflects the increased investment it has had to make in adjusting its systems to cope with Brexit.\nA spokeswoman for Logistics UK told the BBC that the handling fees were \"a commercial decision by individual businesses\".\nBut Michelle Dale, senior manager at accountants UHY Hacker Young, said that new charges could present a major problem for firms in the coming weeks.\n\"I think what we'll find is that a lot of trade with the EU from a business-to-customer perspective will come to a stop until some of these rules are eased,\" she said.\nA government spokesperson said: \"The new VAT model ensures goods from EU and non-EU countries are treated in the same way and that UK businesses are not disadvantaged by competition from VAT-free imports.  \n\"The new system also addresses the problem of overseas sellers failing to pay the right amount of VAT when they sell goods in the UK. We anticipate this will bring in \u00a3300m in tax every year, to fund essential UK public services.\" \nThere is speculation the rules may change, but until they do, Ellie says she won't be buying from European firms.\n\"With all that uncertainty around things and whether or not these charges might change, I'd rather just avoid the hassle,\" she says."

      "tags": "Personal finance,UK economy,Office for National Statistics,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nearly nine million people had to borrow more money last year because of the impact of coronavirus, government figures show. \nSince June last year, the proportion of workers borrowing \u00a31,000 or more had increased from 35% to 45%, said the Office for National Statistics. \nSelf-employed people were more likely than employees to borrow  money.\nThere was also a large increase in the proportion of disabled people borrowing similar sums, the ONS added.\nThis was adding to a \"widening financial gap\" between households.\nOverall, young people and low earners have been worst hit by the pandemic, according to the ONS survey.\nThose aged under 30 and those with household incomes of less than \u00a310,000 were about 35% and 60% respectively more likely to be furloughed than the population as a whole.\nMeanwhile, higher-paid workers were more likely to be on full pay if they were unable to work.\nThere has been much focus on a glut of savings ready to be unleashed into the economy when pandemic restrictions are lifted. \nThis ONS report shines a light on the reality of this for many ordinary Britons, having to borrow more, amid a hit to incomes during the recession. \nDisproportionately this has hit the low paid and the young, and this would have been far worse without the government's support package. \nMore homeowners and the over-30s by December expected to be able to save for the year ahead. Fewer renters and under 30s expected to be able to save.\nThough the analysis does not include the latest national lockdown, the economic impact of schools closure is also clear. \nEmployed parents were twice as likely to experience income loss, though that gap closed when schools reopened. The fear is that this trend will have returned over the past month.\nGueorguie Vassilev from the ONS said: \"Many people took a financial hit in the first months of the pandemic, either being furloughed or working fewer hours.\n\"What we are seeing now, though, is a widening financial gap between households, where some people are relying on savings or borrowing to make ends meet. Those hardest hit are people on low pay, young people and parents of dependent children.\"\nParents living with children were almost twice as likely to report a reduction in income as the rest of the population, the ONS added.\nThis gap gradually narrowed throughout the year as schools reopened.  Parents were less likely to have a reduced income during the November lockdown than in the first lockdown, as schools stayed open.\nHave you needed to borrow a substantial amount of money because of the impact of the pandemic?

Some first-year students will be able to return to the classroom from 25 January.\nBut, on Thursday, Mr Macron said all students should be allowed on campus once a week providing certain measures are in place.\n\"Given what your generation has already gone through, we cannot but take into account your right to some on-site presence, to exchange with your teachers, and to meet with other students,\" he said.\nFrance has had a curfew in place since December, but this was tightened on 16 January to the current hours of 18:00-06:00.\nBars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and ski resorts remain shut. Schools, however, are open with extra testing in place."

      "text": "Fashion chain Next has said it will no longer bid to buy Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail brands Topshop and Topman out of administration.\nIt comes after a consortium including the fashion chain was named as frontrunner to buy the brands. \nIn a short statement, Next said the consortium had been \"unable to meet the price expectations of the vendor\".\nSome 13,000 jobs were put at risk when Arcadia, which also owns Burton and Dorothy Perkins, went bust in November. \nIt leaves a clutch of others in the race to buy the 440-store group, including Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, which owns House of Fraser and Sports Direct. \nAccording to reports, Authentic Brands, the US owner of the Barneys department store, and JD Sports have tabled a joint offer, while online retailers Asos and Boohoo are also said to be interested. \nAdministrators Deloitte have been looking for buyers for some or all of Arcadia, after a slump in sales caused by the pandemic triggered its collapse.\nNext, which has 550 UK shops and has weathered the pandemic well, was seen as a good fit to take over the group's assets. \nIt had been bidding in partnership with the US hedge fund Davidson Kempner, which was going to put up most of the money. \nNext said it wished \"the administrator and future owners [of Arcadia] well in their endeavours to preserve an important part of the UK retail sector\".\nExperts expect Arcadia to be broken up, with bidders taking on different parts of the business and brands potentially hived off from their stores. \nIn December, Australian collective City Chic said it would buy Arcadia's Evans brand, commerce and wholesale business for \u00a323m but not its store network.\nLast year was the worst for the High Street in more than 25 years as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR).\nNearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost, up by almost a quarter on the previous year, as shops faced strict curbs and prolonged closures.

      "tags": "Social distancing,Flu,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The new Omicron variant of coronavirus is spreading rapidly. \nBut how can you tell if you have Covid, or a winter cold?\nThe NHS says people should still look out for classic Covid symptoms:\nBut for some people, having Covid can feel \"more like a bad cold\" with symptoms such as a headache, sore throat and a runny nose. \nThe Zoe Covid study app asks hundreds of thousands of people to log their symptoms and investigators have looked at those linked to the dominant Delta variant and the new highly spreadable variant Omicron. \nSo far, the top five symptoms are:\nIf you think you may have Covid, it is important to get tested. Even people who don't feel very ill can put others at risk.\nA high temperature is 37.8C or above. A fever like this can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus. \nIt is best to use a thermometer. But if you don't have one, check if you, or the person you are worried about, feels hot to the touch on the chest or back. \nA high temperature is unlikely with a cold. \nIf you have a fever, arrange a coronavirus test - you can also use the NHS 111 coronavirus service online.\nIf you have a cold or flu you may well have a cough, along with other symptoms. \nFlu usually comes on suddenly and sufferers will often experience muscle aches, chills, headaches, tiredness, a sore throat and a runny or stuffed nose, along with the cough. It feels worse than a heavy cold.\nColds tend to develop more gradually and are less severe, although they do still make you feel unwell. Along with a cough, there may be sneezing and a sore throat and runny nose. Fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches are rare.\nA coronavirus cough means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing fits or \"episodes\" in 24 hours. \nIf you usually have a cough because of a long-standing medical condition like COPD, it may be worse than usual. \nYou should get tested for coronavirus if you develop a new, continuous cough. \nThese are key symptoms of coronavirus and mean you should get a test. \nIt could still be that you have a simple cold. But you need to check, even if you don't feel unwell, to avoid the risk of spreading the virus.\nSneezing is not a classic symptom of coronavirus, and unless you also have a fever, cough or loss of smell and taste, you do not need a test, according to the NHS. \nSneeze droplets can spread infections though, so catch them in a tissue, put it in the bin and then wash your hands. \nTo help stop the spread of coronavirus and other illnesses:\nCurrently, the NHS says a runny nose or a headache is not a reason to get tested for Covid.  \nBut research suggests some people who test positive for Covid do have these symptoms.\nUS guidelines say people with the following symptoms may have Covid: \nPeople with coronavirus have a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe. Some will have none at all, but can still be infectious.\nSymptoms may appear up to two weeks after exposure to coronavirus, but usually around day five.\nFeeling breathless can be a sign of a more serious coronavirus infection.\nIf you are having trouble breathing, contact your doctor online or over the phone, or the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.\nIf you are very worried about sudden shortness of breath ring 999.\nAnd the NHS advises: \nNHS: How to treat coronavirus at home"

      "text": "People have been evacuated from a \"large number\" of homes in South Wales, as Storm Christoph brought widespread flooding across England and Wales.\nAbout 2,000 homes in the Didsbury and Northenden areas of Manchester, Ruthin and Bangor-on-Dee, North Wales, and Maghull, Merseyside, were also affected overnight.\nSevere flood warnings remain in place, and further rain is expected next week.\nPeople have been told Covid rules let them leave their homes in an emergency.\nOne hundred homes are also being evacuated in Skewen, near Neath, in West Glamorgan, because of flooding related to mine works, authorities say.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson visited Didsbury on Thursday morning to see the flood response there, as the severe flood warning was stood down and people evacuated earlier were allowed to return.\nHe said: \"There will be more to come, there will be further rain next week, so it is vital that people who are in potentially affected areas follow the advice.\"\nHe said flooding had a \"huge psychological, emotional and financial\u00a0cost\" for people and said the government was investing \u00a35.2bn in flood defences over six years.\nHeavy rain led to multiple major incidents and flood alerts being declared across England and Wales.\nMany rivers are at \"dangerously high levels\", the Environment Agency said.\nPumps and sandbags had to be brought in to protect supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being held in a warehouse in Wrexham, north-east Wales, which was threatened by floods.\nHomes have also been flooded in Cheshire following heavy rain and snow showers, with roads disrupted and residents warned river levels are still rising.\nAbout 40 residents were evacuated from the Weaver Court care home in Northwich, Cheshire, by fire crews with dinghies. \nNeighbourhood policing inspector for Northwich Jason Murray said residents were taken to a leisure centre before being moved on to alternative accommodation.\nEarlier, Cheshire Fire and Rescue said it was in the process of rescuing 21 people by boat from Lea Court nursing home in the town of Warrington. \nEvacuations have taken also place in Northwich, Chester, Ellesmere Port and Tattenhall, according to Cheshire Constabulary.\nLauren Turner, 27, woke up on Thursday to find three inches (7.5cm) of water in her house in Warrington, Cheshire.\nShe was evacuated with her young children by boat at 11:30 GMT, but she told BBC News her dog was still in the house on the sofa and was \"scared of water\". She is hoping the RSPCA can rescue him.\nDidsbury resident Fari Iravani told BBC News his family had been told to evacuate but \"during corona where do you evacuate to? You don't want to impose yourself on other people.\"\nHe added: \"We are trying to hold on as long as we can, and hopefully it will pass... If there is a continuation of the rain and the storm, that's going to be a problem.\"\nNelson Vasconcelos, 37, said he could not leave his home in Didsbury with his two small children because he had no family nearby. \"We spent all night moving things to the second floor and trying to keep the kids safe,\" he said.\nLee Rawlinson, of the Environment Agency, said flood basins on the River Mersey at Didsbury had protected properties in the area overnight.\n\"The top of the river came within centimetres of the top of the river bank but our defences there have served their purpose and kept those properties dry. But it was very close,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\nSevere flood warnings - meaning there is a risk to life - have been issued by the Environment Agency for the River Bollin at Heatley and Little Bollington, and the River Dee at Farndon, Cheshire.\nNatural Resources Wales has issued severe flood warnings for the River Dee at Bangor-on-Dee, Wrexham, and the Lower Dee Valley from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadows.\nThere are also more than 160 flood warnings - meaning flooding is expected - across England, and 20 in Wales. \nIn other developments:\nby Tom Mullen, BBC News\nThere have been flood warnings in Didsbury before, of course, but nothing on this scale in recent memory.\nCertainly nothing that would see emergency services declare a major incident and evacuate more than 2,000 homes in and around this area of south Manchester.\nBut on Wednesday night the River Mersey rose and plunged thousands of residents into new depths of stress and confusion, coming just centimetres from breaching flood defences.\nAnd while the defences worked as they should - preventing homes from being deluged - the alert caused widespread bewilderment as residents now accustomed to stay-at-home messaging were suddenly ordered to leave.\nAs the night wore on the driving rain turned to thick snow, coating the streets in white and adding an even more surreal backdrop to the drama.\nLife-long Didsbury resident Terry Sheldon lives in the house he was born in 69 years ago, in Darley Avenue, just metres from the river.\n\"The whole thing has been staggering,\" he said. \"I've never seen it like this here in my lifetime.\"\nRead more here.\nNorth Wales Police began evacuating residents of Bangor-on-Dee from their properties in the early hours of the morning. People sheltered for a short time in a church hall and some were now staying with relatives, while others had been found accommodation by the local authority, Wrexham council said.\nEarlier on Wednesday evening, the force had been called to help residents in Ruthin who were being told to leave their homes - but warned resources were being stretched by people who did not live locally driving to witness the floods.\nLabour's shadow floods minister Stephanie Peacock said the government's response to the floods had been \"slow and uncoordinated\".\n\"We must ensure councils are supported to protect people, businesses, and local communities, and that all of the necessary precautions are also in place to protect those fighting the floods in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.\""

      "text": "The education secretary has said he would \"certainly hope\" schools in England could reopen before Easter.\nGavin Williamson said he was \"not able to exactly say\" when pupils would go back but schools would be given two weeks' notice before reopening.\nPrimary and secondary schools remain closed, apart from to vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers.\nDowning Street said the prime minister wanted schools to open as quickly as possible but would follow the evidence.\n\"If we can open them up before Easter then we obviously will do but that is determined by the latest scientific evidence and data,\" the prime minister's official spokesman said.\nThe Downing Street spokesman was also less specific about the promise of two weeks' notice, saying:  \"We want to give schools as much notice as possible.\"\nSchools have been closed to most pupils so far this term, with primary schools closing after one day back, in response to rising Covid levels.\nPupils have been told they will be learning at home until at least half-term in mid-February.\nBut Mr Williamson was pressed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether he could guarantee that schools would reopen at all this term, before the Easter holidays.\n\"I want to see them, as soon as the scientific and health advice is there, open at the earliest possible stage - and I certainly hope that would be certainly before Easter,\" said the education secretary, who's responsible for schools in England.\nHe said schools and parents would have \"absolutely proper notice\" of when children were going to return, which he said would be a \"clear two weeks\" for teachers and families to get ready.\nBy Sean Coughlan, BBC News education and family correspondent\nA lesson from the first lockdown was that it's much harder to reopen schools than to close them.\nParents and teachers have to be persuaded again it's safe to go back, families need advance notice to plan their work  and childcare, schools need to organise their staffing.\nAnd there are other parents who will be pushing for schools to go back as soon as possible, in addition to the vulnerable and key workers' children already attending.\nFor Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, already under pressure, it means a high-stakes balancing act - and it clearly remains uncertain whether this will happen for all schools before the Easter holidays.\nWhat seems likely, from Mr Williamson and England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries, is that this could be a patchwork return beginning after half-term, rather than a single starting date, depending on local levels of the virus.\nThe biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, said schools and parents needed certainty and not a \"stop-start approach\".\nLast week Mr Williamson indicated to the Commons education committee that schools in some parts of the country might stay closed at the end of the lockdown, with a return to the \"contingency\" arrangements, under which schools in areas of high infection would be shut.\nOn Tuesday, England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries also said schools might reopen region by region in a phased return after half-term.\nLabour has accused the education secretary of causing \"chaos and confusion\" and called on him to resign.\nParty leader Sir Keir Starmer said providing two weeks' advance notice of opening was \"good news coming from an education secretary who normally gives them about 24 hours' notice\".\nSir Keir said the government needed to \"give children the ability to learn at home now\" and \"get on with the blindingly obvious\" task of getting testing in place in schools.\nAsked about his own future, Mr Williamson said: \"Our focus is making sure that we get the very best of remote education out to all children across the country, making sure that we return schools at the earliest possible moment.\"\nIn terms of his own achievements, the education secretary said: \"I'll let other people do the grading.\"\nSchools have also been closed by other governments in the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland they will remain closed until at least the middle of February, while in Wales the next review of restrictions will be on 29 January.\nThe government has also paused plans to roll out rapid daily coronavirus testing in all but a small number of secondary schools and colleges, with health officials saying the new variant meant the risk of missing infections had risen.\nBut Mr Williamson emphasised that mass testing in schools would continue, clarifying that it was the daily tests for those who had been in contact with a positive case which had been stopped.\nThe education secretary was also challenged on the fairness of setting tests as part of the replacement for cancelled GCSEs and A-levels, considering pupils will have missed different amounts of time in school.\nMr Williamson said the tests were only \"one element\" for deciding replacement results, which would be based on teachers' grades.\n\"That's why we're asking teachers to make a judgement in the round. We're asking teachers to look at the work they've been doing over the whole period of time they've been studying the course,\" he said."
