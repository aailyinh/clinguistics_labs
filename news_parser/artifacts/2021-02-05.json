      "text": "MPs have called on the RAF to make changes to training aircraft after complaints about noise from residents.\nArfon MP Hywel Williams said he was given assurances over a year ago safety equipment would be added so more flights could be made over the sea.\nThe Texan T1 has been operating from RAF Valley on Anglesey for almost two years, but the changes have not been made.\nThe RAF said making the modifications was a priority.\nThey can currently only conduct limited flight over water due to issues with the onboard life raft, harness, and life jacket.\n\"The RAF need to train their pilots of course,\" said Mr Williams.\n\"But it is high time for them to act and give proper attention to the impact on local people and the future visitor economy in Snowdonia, already struggling due to the pandemic. \n\"The Ministry of Defence concedes that these aircraft are currently unable to fully operate over water. This prompts the obvious question, why on earth did they buy them like this in the first place, especially given that their main base is on an island that is surrounded by water.\"\nResidents in parts of Gwynedd have described hearing \"a constant howling noise\" when the aircraft are in flight.\nBoth Mr Williams and Dwyfor Meirionydd MP Liz Saville Roberts say complaints \"have soared\" recently, with more people working from home during lockdown.\nHuw Jones, who lives in Llanllechid, near Bethesda, Gwynedd, said: \"It's got worse recently. I think we're noticing it more during lockdown.\n\"If we open the window, we hear the noise all day, a couple of times a week.\"\nThe RAF said that making the modifications to the aircraft was \"a priority\" but could not say when the work would be carried out.\nA spokesman said: \"When practicable, RAF Valley distributes Texan training to as many areas as possible.\n\"We are also continuing to work hard to remove remaining restrictions that reduce overwater activity.\" "

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.\nAll adults in the UK aged 50 and over should have been offered a coronavirus vaccine by May, Downing Street has confirmed. Previously ministers had said it was their \"ambition\" to vaccinate the first nine priority groups by the spring. The UK had given a first jab to almost 11 million people as of Thursday and is aiming to reach 15 million vaccinations by 15 February.\nLevels of coronavirus are showing clear signs of coming down throughout most of the UK, more evidence suggests. After at least a month of lockdown, figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest positive tests are falling in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The UK's reproduction, or R, number is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1 - anything below one means the epidemic is shrinking.\nPolice handed out \u00a334,000 in fines after breaking up a student party attended by more than 150 \"incredibly selfish\" revellers. Some partygoers fled through fire exits and set off alarms when officers were called to the Ranmoor Student Village in Sheffield. South Yorkshire Police said one officer was injured amid the rush to leave. \nMore than \u00a340bn has been lent to struggling firms though the government\u2019s bounce back loan scheme. Worth up to \u00a350,000 per application, the loans offer a lifeline to companies on the edge. But financial crime experts fear many billions may have been lost to fraud and mistakes - the BBC has exclusive access to the unit tracking down the fraudsters.\nWe've just about got used to things being done virtually during the pandemic. But things still go awry. A woman at the centre of a social media storm after a virtual parish council meeting spiralled into chaos has been left surprised by her fame. Jackie Weaver has had \"nothing but positive support\" after remaining calm on the Zoom call, which saw insults, laughter and members kicked out. She told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour she was trying to \"support\" councillors at Handforth Parish Council in Cheshire.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nIf you're wondering when lockdown will end, we round up what's been announced for each part of the UK.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "title": "Brexit: 71 pages of paperwork for 1 lorry of fish",
      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Fishing,Economic effects of Brexit,Brexit,Fishing industry",
      "text": "\"It's slow, it's outdated, it's challenging in a number of ways we never expected,\" says Charlie Samways.\nHis grandfather founded Dorset-based fish merchant Samways 60 years ago, selling fish from a wooden barrow.\nToday, with Charlie as sales director, the firm promises to get its fish and seafood \"from port to plate\" in 24 hours. \nBut extensive paperwork, rising costs and border delays following the end of the Brexit transition period have put that pledge under threat.\nSamways buys seafood from 150 local fishermen who operate in Lyme Bay.\nIts most popular products are Dover sole, lemon sole, cuttlefish and plaice - about 90% of which is exported to France, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy on its fleet of lorries. \nThis Monday, Mr Samways is overseeing the shipment of several tonnes of these fish, as well as scallops and seabass, to the EU on one truck.\nBefore the end of the Brexit transition period, the process was simple, he says. Each shipment needed a delivery note, made up of just one or two forms and invoices.\nBut the UK is now outside the EU - and its customs union and single market - so exporters face a very different set of requirements.\nTo begin with, British exporters need an ID number (called an EORI number). They must also make sure the fishermen they work with have a licence to sell sea fish and register their own premises as an \"approved establishment\" to do business with the EU.\nThe firm had taken these steps ahead of time and felt \"ready to go on day one\" when the new trade rules came in, Mr Samways says. But the day-to-day reality is different.\nTwo employees out of eight in the Samways office now focus on Brexit-related administration. \nChris Sheath and Katie Smith start filling out the new necessary forms for the lorry at 08:00. For each shipment, they must fill out and submit a catch certificate, which proves that the fish was caught legally. \nThat involves manually entering on a government website 149 different lines of data that was not previously required, such as the name of the vessel that caught the fish and the type of species being exported. The certificate for this shipment is 27 pages long.\nThey also have to get an export health certificate for each consignment to prove that the fish meet EU health standards. Information on the products, such as species and the weight of the fish, is uploaded and sent to an approved vet, who has to inspect the goods on-site later.\nMr Samways is considering recruiting a new employee to tackle the extra forms, which take until 13:00 to complete. That would cost the firm \u00a330,000-\u00a340,000 per year.\n\"We are a family business and you get used to the fact that you do long hours. But Brexit means we have to put an unholy amount of pressure onto every member of the team.\"\nThroughout the morning, Chris and Katie are also talking to a customs agent that Samways has hired.\nThe customs agent handles the new paperwork requirements on the import side, and produces a \"statement of value\", which is two pages. Samways pays them roughly \u00a3200 per shipment to do this, which will work out to about \u00a351,000 this year. \nThey input similar information on the fish and upload the catch certificate to an EU system (Traces NT). They also notify French authorities that animal products will soon be arriving at a border control post, which must be done at least one working day in advance.\nAt 14:00, a vet from Sherbourne arrives to inspect the fish. They sign, stamp and number each page of an export health certificate, which for this truck is 20 pages long, after checking the products.\nOnce the vet has watched the truck being loaded and sealed, there are a few final hurdles before the driver can set off.\nThe agent must upload all of the signed-off documents to a UK government system to obtain a customs barcode, which takes about an hour to arrive and is printed out. \nIt is bundled together as part of an \"export pack\" for the shipment, which includes the catch certificates, export health certificates (in English and French), the statement of value and 22 invoices to show at the checkpoint. \nFor this one truck it totals 71 pages.\nAt this point, the driver gets ready to go - provided they have a Kent Access Permit, which confirms they have the correct documents for EU import controls before they enter Kent. Each one lasts 24 hours and they need a new one each time they travel to the EU via the Port of Dover.\nDue to the pandemic, they also need proof of a negative Covid test taken in the last 72 hours.\nThe driver sets off from the depot in Bridport at 17:00 on his way to Dover. Seven or eight 44-tonne Samways' trucks make the same journey each week.\nAt the ferry port, the driver must show the customs barcode that was printed off. No barcode and they may face a fine and severe delays.\nAfter the 22:00 ferry crossing through to Dunkirk in France, the driver heads to the border control post. French customs officials there inspect the fish and all of the paperwork.\nSamways has faced major hold-ups at the French border, with lorries stuck for six or seven hours at a time while forms are examined. The firm's transport manager has had to take urgent phone calls in the middle of the night with updates.\nA small mistake, or an omission, on one form can also mean a consignment is held. But Mr Samways says their customs agent gets little feedback as to what, if anything, is wrong with the papers.\nOnce any problems are resolved, the French authorities update EU systems with the outcome of the inspection.\nThe fish are approved for release, the driver continues to their destination. Samways' plaice, scallops and sea bass will reach European dinner plates on Wednesday evening - 24 hours longer than was typical before the end of the Brexit transition period.\nMr Samways says he initially felt \"extremely prepared\" for Brexit, but was surprised by the \"excessive\" amount of paperwork required. \nThe government says that it is aware of a \"small number of issues\" since 1 January and that the recent announcement of a \u00a323m fund for fishing firms should help those \"experiencing export delays\".\nBut Mr Samways dismisses the suggestion that these are just teething problems.\nHe has concerns that delays and extra costs could mean UK fishermen will take their catch directly to ports on the Continent, cutting out exporters like him.\n\"That's something we cannot afford.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Welsh government,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Primary school children could begin a phased return to school just after half-term if Covid rates continue to fall, Wales' first minister has said.\nMinisters have been under pressure to set out plans for a return to face-to-face teaching after weeks of lockdown.\nMark Drakeford said the tough \"alert level four\" restrictions would remain for another three weeks.\nHowever, from Saturday people will be able to meet one other person from another household to exercise.\nAnd changes to rules on bubbles would allow people \"to dissolve the bubble they're in at the moment and reform it with another household, provided there's a 10-day gap between the two,\" he added.\nMr Drakeford told the Welsh Government's Friday coronavirus briefing if infections continued to fall the youngest primary school pupils may be able to return from 22 February.\nThe BBC was later told this would be children in the foundation phase of primary school.\n\"Our children and young people have had a torrid time, over the last 12 months, they are missing out on education, every week,\" said Mr Drakeford.\nHe added he hoped older pupils and college students who had to do vocational examinations could also have a phased return to schools and colleges after half-term.\nMr Drakeford said he wanted \"everything to be on the table\", including whether having smaller groups of children in school - or having pupils go in for part-weeks - would be possible.\nHowever, he warned things could still change, adding \"things we don't know about today could emerge, even before half-term\".\nFor mum-of-two Charlotte Harding, from Ferndale, Rhondda Cynon Taf, the possibility of the youngest years returning to school is \"positive\" news.\nShe said home-schooling her sons, six-year-old Harrison and eight-year-old Ethan, has been \"hard to navigate\" and \"difficult\".\n\"My eight-year-old has been emotionally drained, I think it is related to having a lack of routine and structure,\" she said.\n\"It is the fact they aren't integrating with children their own age, that they are mentally missing out.\"\nHowever, Tasha Hughes, from Neath Port Talbot, who has a six-year-old child, said she did not understand the decision.\n\"I'm just not understanding, one minute it's not safe and the next it is but as far as children and teachers are concerned nothing has changed,\" she said.\n\"Why are teachers not getting the vaccine if they are made to open back up? They also have families to protect.\"\nMother-of-four Jo Herschell from Swansea, who has eight-year-old twins, a six-year-old and 11-year-old, said that although it was \"devastating they've missed so much school\", it feels too soon to be going back.\n\"I also feel that we've made these sacrifices and if we go back too soon we'll just keep repeating the cycle over and over,\" she said. \n\"It's more disruptive, I feel, in the long term than if we kept it a few more weeks, we were a bit more sure and then we had a chance of it being the last time that schools are going to have to close.\"\nWith two of her children having been diagnosed with additional learning needs, routine is essential, she added.\n\"Every time they go back to school that's really difficult and every time they're off that's difficult. Last term, between different isolations, they only attended seven days of school from October 22 'til Christmas and so that's really disruptive for the children and for myself and as a family,\" she added.\nThe first minister told Friday's briefing he wanted to give \"two clear weeks' notice\" about plans for a phased return.\nHe added that while the situation in Wales was improving, lockdown restrictions must continue for another three weeks \"to allow the NHS to recover\".\nWales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton said on Wednesday the headroom to relax restrictions was \"really quite limited\".\nThe Welsh Government decided to close schools to the majority of pupils as concerns grew about the new variant of coronavirus, which was blamed for the rise in cases seen before Christmas.\nSchools remained closed except to vulnerable children, and those whose parents are key workers.\nMr Drakeford said he \"understands the anxieties\" teaching staff might have in returning back to the classroom.\nHe told Friday's briefing the Welsh Government would do everything it could to work with teachers and unions to ensure the workplace was \"as safe as it can be\" before they return to school. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said 8 March was the earliest date schools in England could reopen and that \"depends on lots of things going right\".\nIn Northern Ireland pupils will not return to school until 8 March at the earliest, while rules on lockdown restrictions in Scotland are to be reviewed on 2 February.\nWith regard to a four nations approach to schools reopening, Mr Drakeford said the falling numbers of Covid cases in Wales had allowed him to make the move.\nMr Drakeford told Friday's briefing there was \"unlikely to be much headroom\" for further coronavirus restrictions in Wales to be lifted at the time of the next review. \nHe said: \"If things were to continue in the direction they are now, where things are going well, then more headroom may emerge in the month of March.\"\nAlert level three would allow the reopening of schools, higher education, pubs and hospitality businesses - with rules on alcohol sales and opening times - and non-essential retail, among others.\nHe told the briefing that his government would not rely on a \"crude\" single piece of data to decide whether to confirm the plans for schools.\nMr Drakeford said a \"combination of factors\" would be considered before children could begin returning to schools in Wales including the rate of cases per 100,000 people, Covid test positivity rate, hospital numbers and \"the mitigation measures that we are able to put in place in schools\".\n\"The key thing is the trend - those numbers need to continue to fall,\" he said.\nWhen asked whether the Welsh Government would prioritise vaccinating teachers and school staff, after the first four priority groups set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) have been vaccinated, he said he would \"follow the advice of the JCVI\".\nDeputy head teacher Rachel Antoniazzi, at Thornhill Primary School in Cardiff, said the announcement was a \"welcome return\" and parents in Wales would be \"breathing a huge sigh of relief\".\n\"The bigger concern is that parents take this seriously and that when children return to school, that it's not like a return to normality, so they don't begin play dates and sleepovers, thinking it's normal,\" she said.\nLaura Doel, director of school leaders' union NAHT Cymru, said there were \"still too many unknowns\" - such as vaccine efficacy and infection rates - to put the 22 February date \"firmly in the diary yet\". \nMs Doel added the teaching workforce should also be prioritised for vaccinations.\nEithne Hughes, director of the association of schools, colleges and leaders in Wales (ASCL Cymru), described the plan to allow the youngest school pupils to return as a \"sensible first step\" as school learning is \"so important to their development\".\nSally Holland, the children's commissioner for Wales, urged ministers to set out the \"milestones\" needed to be reached before children returned.\nOn Wednesday, Dr Atherton said the outbreak was \"shrinking rather than growing\", but rates were still \"way too high\".\nHowever, Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast there would be \"minor adjustments\" to lockdown rules - including bubbles and exercise.\nFrom Saturday people will be allowed to meet one person from another household to exercise in a public outdoor place.\nRunner Michelle Graham from Cardiff said: \"This is such good news. It's been really, really hard to keep training, just to keep running, when all you can do is go out and run on your own.\n\"I'm supposed to be training for an ultramarathon in June and a couple of marathons later on in the year, fingers crossed, if everything goes ahead. \n\"But just getting out there on your own, day in day out - it's going to be so great to be able to run with someone else. Really, really excited about today's news.\"\nIn Friday's briefing, Mr Drakeford said the change was in response to \"messages we've heard from women about not feeling safe\" when exercising at this time of year.\nHe added they would still have to leave from \"your own front door and return to your own front door\".\nThe Welsh Government said social distancing must be maintained and children under 11 were allowed to accompany adults.\nMr Drakeford said changes to rules on bubbles from tomorrow would allow people \"to dissolve the bubble they're in at the moment and reform it with another household, provided there's a 10-day gap between the two\".\nHe said \"weeks into this some people will have moved, some relationships will have changed.\"\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies has called for a \"route map out of lockdown\" which included \"crucial targets concerning the roll-out of coronavirus jabs, falling numbers of infections and the reopening of schools and businesses\".\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price urged a raft of new measures, including making medical grade masks compulsory for everyone and increasing the level and flexibility of the self-isolation support.\nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nThe postcode search has been updated to replace data for health boards in Scotland with data for local councils.

      "title": "Covid: Five reasons to be (cautiously) hopeful",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Flu,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The past few months have been awful. A surge in infections, tens of thousands of deaths and a damaging lockdown.\nBut there are now plenty of reasons to be, at least cautiously, hopeful that we are on the road to recovery. So what are they?\nInfection levels have been falling since early January and, in recent weeks, that has translated into fewer people being admitted to hospital. \nAnd now there are the first signs of the number of deaths coming down, albeit from a very high level, prompting UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty to acknowledge this week that the peak has been passed.\nAt the current rate, there could be fewer than 10,000 infections being reported a day in a couple of weeks. That would put the UK back to where it was in early October. \nAnd by that stage, the drop-off in deaths and serious illness could start to become even more marked.\nThe UK has vaccinated more than 10 million people - more per head of population than almost anywhere in the world.\nThis puts the government well on track to hitting its mid-February target of offering all over-70s, health and care staff and the extremely clinically vulnerable a jab.\nMost importantly about 90% of people over the age of 75 have been vaccinated. Given that three-quarters of Covid deaths have been in this group, that should soon start having an impact on serious illness and deaths.\nBut challenges do remain. There are signs that uptake in certain communities, particularly ethnic minorities, may be lower. And from the start of March, large numbers of people will start needing their second dose, which will result in a slowdown in the rate of people being vaccinated, unless supply increases. \nThat is possible. Pfizer, the manufacturer of one of the two jabs currently being used in the UK, is expecting to increase its speed of production after a slowdown in recent weeks. \nThe UK should also start to get its first supplies of the third jab approved for use, the one made by US firm Moderna, in April. But, as always, supply is fragile. Vaccine production is, after all, a biological process that requires vaccine to be grown. There are no guarantees.\nAs well as protecting the individual who has been vaccinated from developing Covid, there are growing signs the immunisation programme will also slow the spread of the virus between people. \nIn one of the trials - run by Oxford-AstraZeneca - participants were tested for the virus regularly after being vaccinated, rather than just relying on the development or not of symptoms as a sign of the vaccine working. This found that positive tests - so including those who were asymptomatic - reduced by 67%, suggesting the onward transmission of the virus would be significantly curtailed.\nScientists had always suspected this would be the case. But having some data means there can be greater confidence the spread of Covid should be dramatically reduced as the vaccination programme is rolled out.\nAnother factor that will help reduce the burden of Covid is that so many people have now been exposed to the virus - and the latest research suggests they should have lasting protection.\nA study by UK Biobank has been tracking the level of antibodies people have after infection. These help the immune system fight the virus and the research found 88% of people had them at least six months after catching the virus. \nProf Naomi Allen, the chief scientist who has been leading the research, described it as \"really good news\" as it suggested there was some degree of natural immunity. She said they would keep doing follow-ups to see just how much longer this lasted.\nWith estimates suggesting close to one in five people has been infected in the UK, that could mean there is a significant number of people with natural immunity - although even if you have been infected you are still advised to get vaccinated.\nThere has been a lot of concern about how the virus is mutating. The new UK variant is more transmissible than the virus last spring. And the South African variant, which now appears to be circulating in the UK, seems to weaken the effect of the vaccines.\nBut this does not mean the vaccinations are ineffective. Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, said this week she was still \"happy\" with the level of protection the vaccines appeared to give against the new variants, pointing to data showing 60% effectiveness rather than 80% or 90%. In other words, the vaccines still offer good protection, just not quite as good. \nThe other point worth bearing in mind is that when we talk about effectiveness we are talking about stopping symptoms developing. If we judge the vaccines by their ability to stop serious illness and death, the performance is much, much higher.\nWhat is more, the Oxford-AstraZeneca team said they were confident updating their vaccine to make it work better against the mutations would be \"very, very quick\" and any trials needed would be small. So, from start to finish a new vaccine could be ready for rollout within months.\nBut this is only if it is needed. Viruses mutate so what is happening is not terribly surprising. Coronaviruses tend to be more stable than say flu, of which we see different strains circulating every winter. This is why some vaccine experts are saying there's no need to panic - a new vaccine may not even be needed.\nThe next few weeks are bound to see a frenzied debate about how quickly the UK should unlock. This week it was reported Chancellor Rishi Sunak felt the aim of lockdown had been shifted from needing to protect the NHS to having to drive down infections close to zero.\nCertainly early March will not signal a rapid return to normal. If nothing else, the NHS is likely to remain under quite some pressure. While cases are falling, the numbers in hospital are still 50% above what they were in the peak of the first wave. \nOn top of that, people in their 60s, who account for a significant number of hospitalisations, will still largely remain unvaccinated. \nSo what will be a more open question is what happens after that and how quickly - both in the short and long term. \nBy the end of March or early April, if all goes well, people in their 60s, and younger adults with health conditions, will have been offered a vaccine. Those in their 50s will follow soon afterwards. It means the groups where almost all the Covid deaths have happened will have had the chance of protection.\nThe seasons will also start working in our favour - respiratory viruses thrive in the colder, winter months. The unlocking could come quickly.\nThen, looking beyond that, what about next winter? By autumn the whole adult population will have had the chance to get the jab. That won't mean the virus disappears. Not everyone will have taken up the option of a vaccine. And the jab won't have worked for everyone. \nThat is why, in the words of Prof Whitty, Covid will remain a \"residual threat\" for winters to come. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, predicts we will see a rise in cases in the autumn - and says some measures, such as masks and maybe restrictions on crowded places, will be needed. But it will be nothing like what we have seen over the past year.\nThe war is not over, but the worst of Covid should be.\nFollow Nick on Twitter\nRead more from Nick"

      "text": "Levels of coronavirus are showing clear signs of coming down throughout most of the UK, more evidence suggests. \nAfter at least a month of lockdown, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest positive tests are falling in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nThe UK's reproduction or R number is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.\nMeanwhile, Downing Street confirmed all adults aged 50 and over should receive a coronavirus vaccine by May.\nA spokesman said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would set out a \"precise timeline\" for vaccinations when he publishes the government's roadmap for lifting lockdown restrictions in England on 22 February.\nMinisters had previously refused to discuss the date by which the over-50s would be offered a Covid jab.\nSwab tests from people signed up to the Covid symptom app suggest cases are down 70% from their peak.\nBut experts warn that infection levels still remain high. \nAn estimated one in 65 people in both England and Northern Ireland had the virus, one in 70 in Wales and one in 115 in Scotland.\nCases fell in every UK nation apart from Wales where infections remained stable.\nThe ONS's data is slightly out of date - covering the week up to 30 January - so may not reflect the situation right now.\nSimilarly, the R number takes information from lots of different sources to provide a \"consensus view of what the epidemic is doing\", according to scientist advising government, Graham Medley. \nBut all of these different sources are slightly \"behind the curve\" because \"we never observe the exact moment when somebody is infected but have to wait until they develop symptoms, get tested, go to hospital and die,\" he said. \nTaken altogether, though, along with other sources like local authorities' reports of outbreaks in their areas, they give a good sense of roughly what's going on.  \nIn theory the R number represents how many extra people each infected person gives the virus to.  \nBut in reality, it is a calculation based on infections, hospitalisations and deaths, and is used to give a sense of whether the epidemic - including its impact on the health service - is broadly growing or shrinking. \nAside from the ONS, tother surveillance studies - where random samples of people are swabbed whether or not they have symptoms - also show cases coming down, starting somewhere around the second week of January. \nThe confirmed cases published on the government's daily dashboard should in theory be the most up to date, but they are skewed by who comes forward for testing. \nFollow Rachel on Twitter"

      "tags": "GDP,UK economy,Bank of England,Andrew Bailey",
      "text": "The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccination programme will help the economy bounce back strongly this year, according to the Bank of England.\nThe economy is expected to shrink 4.2% in the first three months of 2021, amid tighter lockdown restrictions to slow the spread of the virus.\nBut policymakers expect a rebound this spring as consumer confidence returns.\nThe Bank also told High Street lenders to prepare for negative interest rates, even as it ruled out an imminent move.\nThe UK economy is expected to \"recover rapidly\" in 2021, with a successful vaccination programme supporting a \"material recovery in household spending\".\nAndrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, described the vaccine rollout as \"excellent news\" that would speed up a return to normal life.\n\"We do think that that is going to support a sustained recovery throughout the rest of the year,\" he said.\nIts latest Monetary Policy Report said the positive vaccine news had driven an increase in UK holiday bookings later this year, although overseas bookings remained muted.\nWhile government support schemes are expected to limit any immediate increase in unemployment, the jobless rate is still projected to rise to 7.8% later this year as the furlough scheme winds down.  \nThe most recent unemployment rate - for September to November - was 5.0%, \nHowever, policymakers said the outlook for the economy remained \"unusually uncertain\".\nThe Bank said the rebound in economic activity would depend on controlling any new strains of the virus, as well as households' willingness to spend.\nIt said most people now expect \"life to return to normal\" within a year.\nBut some voluntary social distancing was likely to persist, as it has done in economies where restrictions have already been eased substantially.\nIn New Zealand, for example, spending on restaurants and hotels has still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\nThe Bank said: \"The Covid vaccination programme would be expected to lead to an easing of social distancing restrictions, reduced economic uncertainty and higher activity, although the timing of those effects is hard to predict.\"\nMillions of workers remain on the government's furlough scheme, while redundancies increased sharply at the end of last year.\nHowever, many high earners working from home have saved more during the pandemic.\nThe Bank said \u00a3125bn more was squirrelled away in UK savings accounts last year.\n\"That figure is likely to rise substantially further over the first half of 2021,\" the Bank said.\nPolicymakers believe retired households, which have received vaccines sooner, will start spending first.\nGreater job security is also expected to lead to higher spending.\nHowever, the Bank noted that 70% of the people it surveyed planned to keep their extra money in savings instead of spending it.\nSales of new cars are also expected to remain subdued, though concerns about using public transport have pushed up sales of second-hand vehicles.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held interest rates at a record low of 0.1% on Thursday.\nFollowing a review, it has also asked High Street banks to get ready for the possibility that they could fall below zero in the future.\nThe term \"interest rates\" is often used interchangeably with the Bank of England base rate.\nDescribed as the \"single most important interest rate in the UK\", the base rate determines how much interest the Bank of England pays to financial institutions that hold money with it, and what it charges them to borrow.\nHigh Street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers, as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage.\nThe Bank of England usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less.\nIn theory, taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect. But in practice, it's a bit more complicated.\nAfter all, why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money, when they can keep the cash at home for free?\nThe Bank stressed that commercial lenders needed at least six months to prepare and this did not mean that negative rates were \"imminent, or indeed in prospect at any time\". \nMr Bailey added: \"My message to the markets is you really should not try to read the future behaviour of the MPC from these decisions and these actions we're taking on the toolbox.\n\"Nobody should take any signal from this.\"\nThe Bank of England is not just counting jobs and prices, but vaccinations too. \nOn this basis, despite the current three months seeing a lockdown-inflicted fall in the economy, policymakers are more confident about the timing of recovery, in the middle of this year. \nIndeed, that recovery will be mathematically sharper than previously predicted, because of the further drop right now. As the Bank concludes in its forecast \"GDP picks up strongly\" as restrictions are assumed to ease between April and September.\nIn terms of its decisions, that means the Bank has held fire, leaving interest rates at historic lows. Not one of the nine panel members deciding rates voted for the much-hyped \"negative rates\" seen in Europe. \nCommercial banks will be asked to prepare in the next months, so the lever is an option, but the Bank of England was at pains to say this was not a signal of intentions. \nThe Bank was also clear that the post-Brexit trading rules will hit the economy, and that there are new \"barriers\" likely to lower trade between the UK and EU, some which are yet to emerge. This goes beyond the government's repeated claims that such changes are \"teething problems\".\nThe big message, though, is a more confident assertion that the economy, as well as the people, will be inoculated by the summer."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK government,Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),Graham Brady,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK government should avoid \"setting dates\" for when to lift lockdown and instead react to changing circumstances, a scientist has warned.\nProf Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said leaders should not be \"driven by a calendar\".\nMeanwhile, the government has said all over-50s should be vaccinated by May.\nAnd a senior Conservative MP has told the BBC that Downing Street should be \"looking to open up\" society.\nSir Graham Brady, who leads the 1922 Committee of Conservative Party backbenchers, cited the falling infection level and success of the vaccine rollout, telling the BBC the situation was \"optimistic\".\nThe government estimate of the R rate - the average number of people someone with Covid will go on to infect - has dropped slightly to between 0.7 and 1, from between 0.7 and 1.1 for the week before.\nBut Prof Medley - who chairs the modelling group SPI-M, which advises Sage - told the BBC's Today programme that the epidemic could still go in two directions, up or down, and \"it's up to the government to decide which of those paths it takes\".\nHe urged a strategy of \"adaptive management so you actually change the control of the epidemic as it goes along rather than setting dates, for example\". \nThis means rather than setting dates of when rules could ease, there would be some sort of threshold of what the government would do if certain criteria are met.\n\"To actually make decisions dependent on the circumstances, rather than being driven by a calendar of wanting to do things,\" Prof Medley added.\nThe government has always insisted it is guided by the science - but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has often given dates when expressing hope about the future of the pandemic, for example saying things will be better by Easter and being hopeful about summer holidays.\nAsked what type of circumstances the decisions could be based on, Prof Medley said case numbers were important.\n\"Vaccination offers a way out and it does reduce the impact of infection, but it doesn't remove it completely,\" he said. \"And so case numbers are still important because they represent the risk of having to go back into some kind of national measures.\n\"At the moment, we're in a relatively good position in a sense that the number of cases are falling, but they're still very high. So we only need one more doubling time, one more return to exponential growth, and we could be back in the same position we were in the beginning of January within two weeks.\"\n\"The lower the numbers of cases, the more time you will have to react if they start to increase.\"\nInfection levels have been falling since early January, and newly-released data shows that cases are down in every UK nation apart from Wales.\nNearly 10.5 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine so far. And on Friday, the Cabinet Office issued a press release saying it plans to vaccinate all of the first nine priority groups - including the over 50s - by May, giving it confidence to press ahead with the local elections.\nThe government also announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac, which Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said would allow the UK to \"swiftly tweak and roll out\" existing vaccines to combat new variants, with 50 million doses placed in an initial order for later this year.\nThe latest figures show the UK recorded another 20,632 coronavirus cases on Thursday. A further 915 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported, taking the total by that measure to 110,250.\nAnd around one in 65 people in private households in England and Northern Ireland had Covid last week, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics. In Wales, that figure was one in 70, while in Scotland it was one in 115.\nThe ONS also found that almost six in 10 adults say they are following \"stay at home\" lockdown rules by only leaving home for their basic needs. The figure is less than during the first national lockdown, when around 81% of people said they obeyed, and higher than in November.\nBy Philippa Roxby, health reporter\nNow that more than 10 million of the UK's most vulnerable have been vaccinated, daily cases of the virus are falling, fewer people are being admitted to hospital and there are early signs of deaths coming down, there is pressure to start the process of returning to normal.\nBut what will that process look like? Relax restrictions too quickly and there's the risk that cases could start to rise again in the unvaccinated. Move too slowly and the economy, jobs, children's education and people's mental health could suffer unnecessarily.\nSome advocate a responsive approach - keeping a close eye on infection levels, which experts warn are still worryingly high, and other data, then reacting quickly when relaxations appear to be making things worse.\nThis is in contrast to, for example, setting fixed dates for schools to open which may then have to be changed nearer the time.\nReopening schools has always been the priority. Making that happen safely while carefully opening up other parts of society is now the greatest challenge. \nSir Graham - who has previously opposed lockdown rules - told the BBC the argument for going into a third national lockdown was to stop the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed. \n\"The NHS has actually coped spectacularly well,\" he said. \"Now that that threat is receding, we ought to be - and indeed we are, and the government says we are - looking to open up.\"\nOther politicians are urging a cautious approach to lifting lockdown. \nFormer Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's World at One the country had to target getting cases \"down significantly from their current levels\", making a comparison with South Korea, which he said had about 400 cases per day.\nHe said: \"If we really want to avoid going into a fourth lockdown, we're going to have to be much better at isolating and quarantining anyone who has the new variants.\"\nMr Hunt added he thought the \"end of the pandemic is within sight\" - but that the country needed to keep a \"weathered eye one these vaccines and variants\".\nEarlier this week, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also warned against lifting restrictions too early.\nOn Friday, government minister James Cleverly said he was not able to give a timetable of restrictions easing, but said plans will take into consideration \"the needs of the economy, people's mental health, the education of our children\".\n\"The decisions will be based on the assessment of what is safe, as well as effective,\" he said.\nA spokesman for the Department of Health said the government continues to follow advice from scientific and medical experts.\n\"As the prime minister has said, the government will set out a plan for taking the country out of lockdown during the week beginning 22 February, with the clear aim of taking a gradual, phase approach that is sustainable.\""

He was given a federal summons for trespassing and handed over to local law enforcement. No personnel were harmed during the breach. \nThe intruder had two outstanding warrants, but no further details were provided.\nJoint Base Andrews is located about 15 miles (24km) from the White House in Washington, DC, and is frequently used by the president, vice-president and other US leaders. \nPresident Joe Biden flew from the base to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, on Friday evening. \nThe Air Force's inspector general will conduct an investigation into the break-in, the Air Force said in its statement. It will also conduct a \"comprehensive review of installation security and trends\" on its bases around the world. \n\"The security of our installation is paramount,\" said Col Roy Oberhaus, a commander at Joint Base Andrews in a statement. \"This was a serious breach of security\". \nThe break-in comes nearly one month after the 6 January riots at the US Capitol, which has left stricter security protocols in place.

It is therefore important that as a community we all continue to try our best to work together through these challenges.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in policing board member Gerry Kelly said he was \"shocked and appalled\" by the arrest.\nHe said family members of the victims had gathered at the scene of the attack to call for the publication of a delayed Police Ombudsman's report into the murder of their loved ones.\nHe criticised police actions and compared it to the PSNI's response when a large group of masked men gathered in east Belfast on Tuesday night.\nThat east Belfast incident was linked to an internal row within the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).

Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on.\"\nThen Mr Tolver, who refused to recognise the legitimacy of the meeting, was removed from the meeting and placed in a virtual waiting room after saying: \"You have no authority here Jackie Weaver.\" \nCouncillor Aled Brewerton waded in as vice-chairman saying he should take charge of the meeting and shouted: \"Read the standing orders - read them and understand them!\"\nHe was also sent to the waiting room.\nAll Ms Weaver, chief officer of the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, was meant to be doing was giving \"support\" to parish councillors to hold meetings.\nShe said she had received \"nothing but positive support\" since the clip went viral and \"99.9% of council meetings are just not like that, they are often less exciting than we might hope they are\".\n\"I'm passionate about the fact that local government is the mechanism by which people can engage with their communities,\" she said.\nMs Weaver said while parts of the meeting were funny in principle, it was a \"bit harsh\" to make fun of someone who had \"lost it\".\nShe said the meeting also showed an element of \"bullying and bad behaviour\" in local councils.\n\"A lot of us are working very hard - and that includes central government - to try to do something about that,\" she said.\nMr Tolver said he did not regret how he had acted in the meeting.\nHe said Ms Weaver was just present as a member of the public and \"had no status to speak other than when invited\".\n\"If you look at the first meeting you will see I have reason to be angry,\" he said.\nFormer Chancellor George Osborne tweeted that Handforth Parish Council had not been \"quite so lively\" when he was a Tatton MP, which covered that area. \nManchester Central MP Lucy Powell tweeted Handforth's previous claim to fame was a big Marks and Spencer, now it is \"people looking for Jackie Weaver\". \nShe said the footage was \"like 2020/2021 best bits made into a sitcom\".  \nDuring the meeting, another councillor Susan Moore called for civility, but this led to semi-hysterical laughter and another participant being removed.\nAs Ms Weaver acknowledged on the video: \"It is nothing if not lively in Handforth.\"\nAsked how others can follow her example and stay calm and collected on heated Zoom meetings, she told the BBC: \"Never wear your pyjamas.\"\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "No contracts have yet been awarded to hotels to take part in England's new quarantine scheme, No 10 has said.\nFrom 15 February, all those arriving from 33 Covid variant hotspots will have to stay in a hotel for 10 nights.\nDowning Street said discussions were continuing but it was important to get arrangements right \"from the start\". \nBut government scientific advisers have warned nothing short of quarantining all visitors or closing borders will \"get close\" to excluding new variants.\nNewly-released minutes from a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on 21 January, conclude that only a \"complete, pre-emptive closure of borders or the mandatory quarantine of all visitors upon arrival in designated facilities, irrespective of testing history, can get close to fully preventing the importation of cases or new variants\".\nResponding to media reports earlier this week about Sage's views, No 10 said the committee put forward policy options rather than recommendations and it believed its discussions would show that existing measures, including pre-departure testing were \"effective in mitigating risks\".\nThe hotel quarantine requirements are being introduced in an effort to control the spread of new variants of coronavirus first identified in South Africa and Brazil, which scientists believe may be more infectious and may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines.\nThe rules affect UK residents and Irish nationals travelling from 33 countries on the \"red list\" - which covers much of South America, southern Africa, the United Arab Emirates and Portugal. \nThe majority of non-UK nationals from these locations are currently banned from entering the UK anyway, so will not be affected, but those with residents' rights, as well as those holding long-term visas, will be covered.\nHotels near airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen are expected to be booked up for quarantine.\nDowning Street said the government had had discussions with more than 60 companies in the hotel and travel industries and a \"commercial specification\" had been sent out to hotels located near ports and airports.\nBut a No 10 spokesman said no \"formal contracts\" had been agreed yet and it was \"vital\" that the government got this \"right from the start\".\nThe government expects more than 1,000 UK residents a day to return from places where new variants are prevalent - but sources say the prospect of paying for secure accommodation could see this number reduce.\nAsked why quarantine was not being imposed on all arrivals, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said the logistics would be \"difficult to implement\" and would affect people from low-risk countries. \nBut Labour said the government was doing \"too little, too late\".\n\"Currently 21,000 people are entering the country every day, with an ineffective quarantine system, as a result of Conservative incompetence,\" said shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon. \nQuarantined travellers will be served three meals a day in their rooms, with hot and cold options. Tea, coffee, fruit and water will be available.\nThe hotels would also be required to work with government-approved security staff, according to documents seen by the BBC. \nThese security guards will patrol inside and outside the hotel to \"prevent unauthorised access\". Anyone wanting to smoke outside or get fresh air will also be escorted by security staff.\nAn industry source said the government estimated quarantine could cost about \u00a380 a night. \n\"If they are taking rooms for 1,425 [newly-arrived] passengers per night until 31 March, that is a bill of \u00a355m,\" the source added.\nMany hotels have said they are keen to take part in the scheme but want more details from the government, although some have expressed concerns about their staff being exposed to Covid and potential reputational damage.\nHotels in and around airports have lost bookings from holidaying customers who typically book in for a night to be near the airport for early-morning departures. \nThat means they may be more likely to agree to the government's main requirement that quarantine hotels agree to turn away all other customers and have their premises used solely by quarantining travellers.

It protects the financial industry in London as we learn how to deal with this regulation, and it makes the bank safer.\"\nHe does admit that money and jobs have moved from the UK as a result of Brexit, but says the impact has been modest. \n\"Yes, there are some jobs that are going to Europe, that otherwise would have been in the UK, but it's in the hundreds. Barclays employs some 50,000 people in the United Kingdom, roughly 20,000 outside of the UK and 10,000 in the US. \n\"Some amount of capital has moved but London is still obviously the main centre for Barclays.\"\nHis message is that the UK should do everything it can to foster trust and good relations with the EU, but not at the cost of the UK becoming uncompetitive with the bigger fish in the global capital pool. \nIt's not everyone's favourite industry, but the financial services sector employs 1.1 million people, with two-thirds of them outside London. It is nearly 100 times more economically important than fishing and pays a whopping 11% of all taxes. \nIt was also almost totally ignored in the Brexit negotiations - access to EU markets enjoyed for decades ended in January. About \u00a31 trillion in capital and assets and up to 10,000 jobs left the UK industry as firms set up EU subsidiaries. Big numbers, but in global financial terms, erosion rather than exodus. \nCatherine McGuinness, head of policy at the City of London Corporation, said that while financial services didn't get much air time in Brexit negotiations, they were better placed because they started preparing years ago. \n\"We have been disappointed in the lack of focus on the financial professional services sector - this is a critical part of our economy, a critical part in itself for the jobs and tax that it generates. \n\"But the minute the referendum result was announced, the institutions started planning how they would be able to serve their customers in whatever circumstances developed\"\nShe also agreed with Mr Staley that there is no need or desire for widespread deregulation to create what some have styled a Singapore-on-Thames. \n\"One reason why people want to come and do business here is because they trust the regulation. We're not hearing any great demand for a bonfire of regulation but we do need to look at how can we keep influencing and working with global standards to meet global challenges.\"\nOne of those global challenges is surely climate change and Mr Staley is convinced London can become a major global hub for green finance. He says these ideas are currently where the understanding of the impact of the internet was nearly 30 years ago. \n\"Climate today is like technology was in 1995. If you think about it\u2026 all the Amazons, the Googles, didn't really exist in 1995 and now it dominates 40% of the economy, I think it's a fair argument that dealing with climate and dealing with the environment is in the same position now.\" \nConfident and controversial words for the boss of a bank that counts climate change activists as regular attendees at its annual shareholder meeting thanks to its involvement in financing fossil fuel projects. \nBut that's the curious thing about money. You would think it's hard to create new products out of it, but it happens. \nThe ability to raise money in dollars on EU markets was the key new thing that propelled London to worldwide significance in the post-war period. \nCreating new products out of pools of sub-prime mortgages almost destroyed the world's financial system. \nHarnessing the international demand for financing climate-based projects could be the next big - and hopefully good - thing. \nIt's harder to reinvent a fish or a sheep. Unlike fishing and farming, which got a lot of political attention, and whose businesses are really struggling to adjust, UK financial firms like Barclays seem confident they can adapt to a post-Brexit future. \nAs Mr Staley says, \"you can't tax good ideas\". \nThe UK government thought the powerful financial sector could look after itself. On this evidence, it seems they might have been right. \nRishi Sunak will certainly hope so. No Chancellor of the Exchequer in living memory has needed the tax revenue more. "

      "text": "People wishing to travel out of the UK will first be required to declare their reason for travel and prove it is essential, the home secretary has said.\nPriti Patel said declarations would be checked by carriers and there would be increased police at airports and ports.\nThe PM said earlier that UK nationals and residents returning from \"red list\" Covid hotspots would have to quarantine in government-provided hotels.\nBut Labour described the measures as \"too little, too late\".\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said protecting the UK's borders was one of the key areas where the government had \"fallen short\" and he was \"deeply concerned\" the latest measures were \"yet another example of this - too little, too late\".\nHe added proposals to limit hotel quarantine to the specific \"red list\" of countries did \"not go anywhere near far enough\", adding the measures left \"huge gaps\" in the UK's defences against emerging variants of the virus.\nIt comes as a further 1,725 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK on Wednesday, as well another 25,308 new infections, according to the government dashboard.\nThe data also shows that up to and including 26 January, more than seven million people have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\nIn a statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday, Ms Patel said England's lockdown rules were \"clear [that] people should be staying at home unless they have a valid reason to leave. Going on holiday is not a valid reason.\"\nShe said the new rule would require people wishing to leave the UK to go abroad to first \"make a declaration for why they need to travel\", which would then be \"checked by carriers prior to departure\".\nMs Patel said: \"Anyone who doesn't have a valid reason for travel will be directed to return home or they will face a fine.\"\nUnder the national lockdown, people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. \nThese are the same as the \"reasonable excuses\" for domestic travel, including:\nShe said it was \"clear that there are still too many people coming in and out of our country each day\" and other border measures would be toughened up to \"reduce passenger flow\" and protect the UK's \"world-leading\" vaccination programme.\nPolice checks at home addresses will be increased to ensure arrivals are complying with self-isolation rules, and the UK will continue to refuse entry to non-UK citizens from \"red list\" countries which were already subject to the travel ban.\nThe list of travel exemptions would also be \"urgently\" reviewed, she added, to make sure \"only the most important and with exceptional reasons are included\".\nEarlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that UK nationals and residents returning from 30 high-risk countries would have to quarantine in government-provided hotels.\nThe measures will apply to people coming from most of South America, southern Africa and Portugal, amid concern over new variants of the virus. Most overseas visitors from those countries are already barred from entering the UK. \nBritish nationals and those with residency rights who arrive from high-risk countries will be required to quarantine in a hotel at their own expense for up to 10 days, in a bid to improve compliance with self-isolation rules. \nKeri McMenamin was returning to the country with her husband and two children after securing a job offer - leaving the UK in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic last year.\n\"It is literally luck of the draw,\" the 38-year-old said after securing her family's place in Australia's 14-day quarantine system. \"You didn't know what to expect.\" Having done some research, Keri discovered Facebook groups busy with people relaying their experiences of quarantine.\n\"A lot of people were saying, 'Look, just expect the worst and then whatever you get is a bonus.'\"\nIn the end, the family was given an interconnecting room. But the windows were sealed and their time outside limited to 20-minute stints every two to three days.\nMr Johnson told the House of Commons on Wednesday that arrivals who could not be refused entry would be required to isolate in government provided accommodation, such as hotels, \"without exception\".\nThese arrivals would be escorted from the airport and \"transported directly into quarantine\", with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) working to set up these facilities \"as quickly as possible\", he said.\nMs Patel said the DHSC would \"set out further details\" on the hotel quarantine policy next week.\nIan Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, told the Commons that the Scottish and Welsh governments wanted \"to go further\" than what the UK government was proposing on quarantine measures, and challenged the PM to \"stop his half measures\" and bring in \"stricter enforcement on international travel\".\nA spokesman for the Welsh government said \"the need for a joint approach\" to border measures had been agreed between the UK's four nations and the Republic of Ireland, but it did not believe the approach outlined by the UK government went \"far enough\".\n\"Further discussions on the details of the proposals will take place as soon as possible,\" he added.\nIn response to the government's announcement, Airport Operators Association chief executive Karen Dee welcomed the news that the new hotel quarantine policy would only apply to a limited number of countries, but questioned what \"additional public health benefit\" it would have, given strict travel rules were recently introduced.\nShe called on the government to set out \"when and how we can ease all these measures safely and provide people with reassurance that travel will be possible again in the future\".\nAt the moment, incoming travellers have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test on departure, taken in the previous 72 hours. Then they still have to quarantine for up to 10 days, although this can be done at home.\nThose who do not comply will face a fine of \u00a3500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks. \nIn England, the self-isolation period can be cut short with a second negative test after five days. \nQuarantine rules are set separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but have tended to differ only slightly.\nHotel quarantine is already in use in countries including New Zealand and Australia. \nAre you a UK national in one of the countries affected?

      "tags": "GDP,UK economy,Bank of England,Andrew Bailey",
      "text": "The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccination programme will help the economy bounce back strongly this year, according to the Bank of England.\nThe economy is expected to shrink 4.2% in the first three months of 2021, amid tighter lockdown restrictions to slow the spread of the virus.\nBut policymakers expect a rebound this spring as consumer confidence returns.\nThe Bank also told High Street lenders to prepare for negative interest rates, even as it ruled out an imminent move.\nThe UK economy is expected to \"recover rapidly\" in 2021, with a successful vaccination programme supporting a \"material recovery in household spending\".\nAndrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, described the vaccine rollout as \"excellent news\" that would speed up a return to normal life.\n\"We do think that that is going to support a sustained recovery throughout the rest of the year,\" he said.\nIts latest Monetary Policy Report said the positive vaccine news had driven an increase in UK holiday bookings later this year, although overseas bookings remained muted.\nWhile government support schemes are expected to limit any immediate increase in unemployment, the jobless rate is still projected to rise to 7.8% later this year as the furlough scheme winds down.  \nThe most recent unemployment rate - for September to November - was 5.0%, \nHowever, policymakers said the outlook for the economy remained \"unusually uncertain\".\nThe Bank said the rebound in economic activity would depend on controlling any new strains of the virus, as well as households' willingness to spend.\nIt said most people now expect \"life to return to normal\" within a year.\nBut some voluntary social distancing was likely to persist, as it has done in economies where restrictions have already been eased substantially.\nIn New Zealand, for example, spending on restaurants and hotels has still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\nThe Bank said: \"The Covid vaccination programme would be expected to lead to an easing of social distancing restrictions, reduced economic uncertainty and higher activity, although the timing of those effects is hard to predict.\"\nMillions of workers remain on the government's furlough scheme, while redundancies increased sharply at the end of last year.\nHowever, many high earners working from home have saved more during the pandemic.\nThe Bank said \u00a3125bn more was squirrelled away in UK savings accounts last year.\n\"That figure is likely to rise substantially further over the first half of 2021,\" the Bank said.\nPolicymakers believe retired households, which have received vaccines sooner, will start spending first.\nGreater job security is also expected to lead to higher spending.\nHowever, the Bank noted that 70% of the people it surveyed planned to keep their extra money in savings instead of spending it.\nSales of new cars are also expected to remain subdued, though concerns about using public transport have pushed up sales of second-hand vehicles.\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held interest rates at a record low of 0.1% on Thursday.\nFollowing a review, it has also asked High Street banks to get ready for the possibility that they could fall below zero in the future.\nThe term \"interest rates\" is often used interchangeably with the Bank of England base rate.\nDescribed as the \"single most important interest rate in the UK\", the base rate determines how much interest the Bank of England pays to financial institutions that hold money with it, and what it charges them to borrow.\nHigh Street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers, as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage.\nThe Bank of England usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less.\nIn theory, taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect. But in practice, it's a bit more complicated.\nAfter all, why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money, when they can keep the cash at home for free?\nThe Bank stressed that commercial lenders needed at least six months to prepare and this did not mean that negative rates were \"imminent, or indeed in prospect at any time\". \nMr Bailey added: \"My message to the markets is you really should not try to read the future behaviour of the MPC from these decisions and these actions we're taking on the toolbox.\n\"Nobody should take any signal from this.\"\nThe Bank of England is not just counting jobs and prices, but vaccinations too. \nOn this basis, despite the current three months seeing a lockdown-inflicted fall in the economy, policymakers are more confident about the timing of recovery, in the middle of this year. \nIndeed, that recovery will be mathematically sharper than previously predicted, because of the further drop right now. As the Bank concludes in its forecast \"GDP picks up strongly\" as restrictions are assumed to ease between April and September.\nIn terms of its decisions, that means the Bank has held fire, leaving interest rates at historic lows. Not one of the nine panel members deciding rates voted for the much-hyped \"negative rates\" seen in Europe. \nCommercial banks will be asked to prepare in the next months, so the lever is an option, but the Bank of England was at pains to say this was not a signal of intentions. \nThe Bank was also clear that the post-Brexit trading rules will hit the economy, and that there are new \"barriers\" likely to lower trade between the UK and EU, some which are yet to emerge. This goes beyond the government's repeated claims that such changes are \"teething problems\".\nThe big message, though, is a more confident assertion that the economy, as well as the people, will be inoculated by the summer."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

We will also work with the Design and Delivery Advisory Group to develop a quality assurance process to support schools and college,\" he said.\nIn England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said grades would be decided by schools and colleges but pupils could be asked to sit mini-exams to help teachers with their assessments.\nCarys, an A-level student from Ysgol Bro Edern in Cardiff, said before the announcement she wished students had been given a clearer picture about what they would be facing.   \n\"It has been very confusing for us,\" she said.\n\"I feel like we're all asking the teachers what's happening, what's going on, and they're just as much as in the dark as we are.\"\nCarys said she and her friends had struggled to see how the external assessments would be different to their cancelled exams.  \n\"It is causing a large concern to us all and we're not quite sure what we're aiming towards,\" she said.\n \"I just want all our hard work to be credited.\"\nBetsy, a GCSE pupil also at Ysgol Bro Edern, said she felt the fairest way to grade pupils this year was to let teachers decide on grades. \n\"It has been very challenging,\" she said.\n\"I know many pupils who have been off school for weeks, or months even.\"\n\"I feel like the most fair way to do this is to just collect loads of coursework and trust the teachers to give us predicted grades,\" she said.\n\"They know the effort we've put in through the lockdown and through the online learning.\n\"I know that we will always be classed as the coronavirus year that didn't do exams.\n\"Universities hopefully will take that into consideration.\"\nThe NASUWT union, which represents some teachers in Wales, said \"the devil will be in the detail\" and full consultation with teachers is needed as there were concerns over fairness and staff workloads.\n\"How is this going to be achieved and what are the workload implications going to be on already hard pressed teachers?\" said Neil Butler of the NASUWT.\nUCAC, another teaching union, said it was \"the only realistic solution under the current circumstances\".\nBut their general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young added he would like to see external standardisation between schools.\nThe school leaders' union NAHT Cymru said they were pleased to get clarity - but are \"concerned about the proposed processes for appeals.\n\"The suggestion that initial appeals are made directly to the school or college is misguided in principle, and logistically unworkable,\" said director Laura Doel.\nExecutive members of the National Education Union Cymru said they were pleased to be moving to a system \"with more trust in teachers and lecturers\" and were keen there was \"no repeat of the position we all found ourselves in last summer\".\nThe director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, Eithne Hughes, said it was a \"pragmatic solution\" but more detail is needed regarding quality control.  \nThe announcement does not include vocational and technical qualifications, which are being considered separately.\nQualifications Wales said it would work with the awarding bodies offering Wales-only vocational qualifications \"to reflect these arrangements in those qualifications\".\nIt added it would \"continue to work with our fellow regulators to determine the arrangements for vocational and technical qualifications offered across the UK.

      "text": "An attempt to stop prosecutors using messages from hundreds of phones that were part of the Encrochat secret communications network in court has been rejected by the Appeal Court.\nJudges ruled the messages, obtained by French police by hacking the phones, were not gained by \"interception\".\nUnder British law, evidence from interception cannot be used in court.\nThe National Crime Agency believes Encrochat was mainly used by criminals, often to trade drugs and guns.\nThe judgement will have major implications for cases against suspected organised criminals around the country.\nDue to legal restrictions, it is the first time the BBC can report the detail of arguments surrounding Encrochat, which was penetrated by police last summer resulting in more than 1,000 arrests.\nThe NCA, which obtained the evidence from France, said it was the biggest breakthrough ever in the fight against organised crime.\nSenior officers described it \"as akin to cracking the enigma code\".\nThe messages, sent by suspects who did not know they were being monitored, detail alleged drug dealing and murder plots, and include images and videos.\nMany of the cases based on \"Encro\" evidence are now going to court, and if this judgement had ruled the messages couldn't be used, some trials may have been abandoned.\nUnder long-standing British law, designed to protect intelligence techniques from scrutiny and make criminal trials manageable, intercepted evidence can't be used in court.\nIn 2016, Parliament passed the Investigatory Powers Act in a massive overhaul of surveillance law. The act introduced a \"double lock\" that requires interception warrants to be authorised by a secretary of state and approved by a judge.\nIn a 2015 factsheet on the bill before it became law, the Home Office defined interception as \"making available the content of a communication to someone other than the sender or intended recipient during the course of its transmission. In practice that means listening to a phone call or reading an email\".\nBut the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, Lord Justice Edis, and Mrs Justice Whipple dismissed an appeal by lawyers for Encrochat defendants.\nThe key legal argument centred on a piece of \"malware\" placed by French experts on Encrochat phones worldwide. It sent copies of every message to a police server.\nFrance has refused to say how, what it called \"the implant\", worked, creating legal uncertainty in British courts.\nEncrochat was a private messaging service that promised its users secure and secretive communications.\nAs well as the Encrochat messaging app, the company developed a modified version of the Android operating system and sold altered smartphones known as \"carbon units\" to run its software.\nSwitched on by pressing just the power button, the phones would load a \"dummy\" Android homescreen.\nBut activated another way they would boot into Encrochat mode.\nGetting hold of an Encrochat phone was not cheap, and the subscription charges were more than \u00a3200 a month.\nMessages sent between handsets were end-to-end encrypted: scrambled as they travelled across the internet, making them practically impossible to decode if intercepted.\nBut in June 2020, the company warned its users that an attack had comprised its handsets and advised them to \"physically dispose of your device immediately\".\nIf the implant had collected the messages as they were being transmitted, this would amount to interception of the communications.\nThe defence lawyers claimed the implant was taking messages from the phones' memory, milliseconds before being sent to their wifi or mobile data transmitters and therefore the data was \"in transmission\".\nBut the judges decided the data was in fact being stored temporarily on the devices as it was processed, before being transmitted.\nThey said this was evident because during the actual transmission the message were encrypted, and therefore couldn't have been read, as they were by the police.\nThe data collected also included crucial username information from the phone's storage memory, which is not sent as part of the transmission.\nIn Friday's judgement they compared the process with that of sending a letter: \"The process involves the letter being written, put in an envelope, a stamp being attached and then the letter being placed in the post box.  \n\"Only the last act involves the letter being transmitted by a system, but all the acts are essential to that transmission.\"\nFamilies of those arrested during the fall-out from the Encrochat penetration have been arguing online that the NCA broke the law by accessing and reading messages \"in real time\", as they were being sent.\nThey say British law enforcement agencies effectively allowed a foreign power, France, to hack the phones of 9,000 UK Encrochat users.\nPolice claimed that in general, using an Encrochat phone, which cost thousands of pounds to own and operate, demonstrated a likely involvement in criminal activity.\nBut suspects' supporters say innocent family members were caught up in a race to make use of the Encro messages, because police feared they would be criticised if they were not seen to take action.\nHowever the decision of the Appeal Court was that the evidence was collected lawfully."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All adults aged 50 and over should have been offered a coronavirus vaccine by May, Downing Street has confirmed.\nPreviously ministers had said it was their \"ambition\" to vaccinate the first nine priority groups by the spring.\nThe UK had given a first jab to nearly 11 million people as of Thursday and is aiming to reach 15 million vaccinations by 15 February.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said a lot of things would \"have to go right\" to hit the May target for all over-50s.\nHe said supply was the \"most difficult\" limiting factor in the roll out. \nBut he said the government was on track to vaccinate the first four priority groups by the middle of the month, these include the over-70s, frontline health and care workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable.\nThe top nine priority vaccination groups - which are set by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - also includes people aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions.\nMr Hancock also said it was \"still too early to say\" when restrictions could be lifted and warned the health service was still under pressure. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said, in a Twitter video, that on 22 February he would \"set out the beginnings of our roadmap for a way forward for the whole country as the vaccine programme intensifies and, as more and more people acquire immunity, a steady programme for beginning to unlock\".\nHe also warned that these were still \"early days\" and rates of infection in the country were \"still very high\".\nIt comes after Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group made up of Conservative MPs who want lockdown to be eased, said it would be \"almost impossible to justify having any restrictions in place\" once the over-50s had been vaccinated.\nProf Graham Medley, who is a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, earlier said the government should avoid \"setting dates\" for lifting lockdown and focus on criteria, such as case rates, rather than a calendar.\nA further 1,014 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Friday, taking the total by that measure to 111,264. \nThere have been 19,114 more positive cases of coronavirus recorded, while another 480,560 people received their first dose of a vaccine - taking the total to 10,971,047 across the UK.\nCoronavirus cases are showing clear signs of falling across the UK, the latest figures suggest, and the R number - the average number of people that someone with Covid will go on to infect - has dropped slightly to between 0.7 and 1.\nIn a press release confirming May's local elections will go ahead, the Cabinet Office said: \"The UK's vaccination programme is planned to have reached all nine priority cohorts by May, meaning that the government can commit to go ahead with these polls with confidence.\"\nBBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said, while the NHS has the staff, volunteers and clinics needed to vaccinate the 15 million people in the next priority groups, vaccine production was a biological process so there were no guarantees about how much could be grown.\nBut our correspondent said there was growing confidence in the UK supply chain, with the bulk of supplies now coming from UK-based plants, while the first batches of the Moderna vaccine - of which the UK has ordered 17 million doses - would start to arrive before Easter.\nBy Rachel Schraer, BBC health correspondent\nSo far, the falls in Covid cases and hospital admissions (about a fifth in a week respectively) are pretty much exclusively down to the effects of lockdown restrictions. \nBut soon, we'll start to see the impact of vaccination too - and we will expect to see more good news, particularly falls in deaths which are heavily concentrated in the over-80s.\nWhile deaths mainly occur in the over-80s, about 20% of hospital admissions are in 45-64-year-olds and another 20% in 65 to 74-year-olds. The latest commitment to vaccinate all over 50s could have a massive impact on severe illness and the strain it puts on the health service, too.\nBut the situation will remain precarious for a while. Cases, though falling, are still high - and despite a so-far successful vaccination campaign, large swathes of the country may still be unprotected come spring.\nThough much rarer, a proportion of younger, healthy people will end up in hospital with Covid, and we're only just beginning to learn about the burden of long Covid on the previously well young. \nSo once the groups at highest risk of ending up in hospital and dying have been vaccinated, the government will face difficult questions about what level of risk it is willing to stomach to ease restrictions, while a prolonged lockdown carries its own risks that might be currently difficult to measure. \nThe UK's drugs regulator, the MHRA, said the vaccines being distributed in the country were extremely safe, while new research shows the AstraZeneca jab protects well against the new \"Kent\" variant of Covid.\nEarlier on Friday, the government also announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac, which Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said would allow the UK to \"swiftly tweak and roll out\" existing vaccines to combat new variants, with 50 million doses placed in an initial order for later this year.\nThe government also said no contracts had yet been awarded to hotels to take part in England's new quarantine scheme, which will see all those arriving from 33 Covid hotspots have to stay in a hotel for 10 nights."

      "text": "Up to 87 million pints of beer will be thrown away as a result of pub closures during Covid lockdowns around the UK, an industry body has calculated.\nThe British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) called the waste - equivalent to \u00a3331m in sales - \"heartbreaking\".\nChief executive Emma McClarkin urged the government to give publicans more help in the Budget, including extending the VAT cut for the hospitality sector.\nThe Treasury said keeping businesses going was its \"priority\".\nBarrelled beer not sold by its best-before date has to be returned to breweries and disposed of.\nFor pasteurised beers - including most lagers - this is usually about three to four months after delivery to pubs.\nFor real ales and other unpasteurised beer, the timescale is normally around six to nine weeks.\nThe BBPA has worked out, from industry feedback, that 70 million pints of beer were thrown away during the first lockdown.\nWith publicans more alert to the risk of wastage - and amid ongoing restrictions imposed on large parts of the UK - they bought less stock after reopening.\nThis meant that, when further lockdowns occurred around the UK last autumn, seven million pints were wasted, with another 10 million expected to go the same way during the current one, the BBPA found.\nSources: New South Wales Irrigators' Council, bestkettles.co.uk, Bathbarn.co.uk\nBefore the pandemic, the number of pubs in the UK had started rising slightly, following many years of decline.\nBut the difficulties since then mean many of the 39,000 premises operating at that point have closed or are \"struggling\", Ms McClarkin told the BBC.\n\"Pubs and breweries are effectively having to pour their businesses down the drain,\" she said.\nThe licensed trade was \"in limbo\", with \"no idea or clarity from government on when we can reopen again\", she added.\nGarry Tallent, landlord of the Red Lion in Chobham, Surrey, did up his pub at a cost of around \u00a3330,000 last year and estimates he has lost \u00a320,000 in stock during lockdowns, \u00a36,000 of that in beer.\n\"The government has got to give some real fiscal stimulation to get us through this,\" he said.\n\"We're all fighters in this trade but we've been through a year of grief through no fault of our own.\"\nMr Tennant employs 16 staff, whose pension contributions he has continued to pay. His total losses since the pandemic could total \u00a3130,000 by the time pubs reopen, he said.\nMs McClarkin asked Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep the current 5% VAT rate for the hospitality industry - down from the usual 20% - in place after pubs reopen, arguing that venues closed during lockdowns have not been able to benefit from it yet.\nThe business rates holiday - due to finish at the end of this financial year - should also be extended in the Budget, on 3 March, she added.\nA Treasury statement said the hospitality sector was receiving \"significant support\", including one-off grants worth up to \u00a39,000, monthly grants of up to \u00a33,000, and a \u00a31,000 grant that was provided to pubs not serving food at the time during tiered restrictions when so-called \"wet pubs\" were forced to close. \n''We've also extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, provided 100% relief on business rates, and have cut VAT for hospitality businesses,\" they added.\n\"At the upcoming Budget we'll outline the next stages of our plan for jobs to support businesses and families across the UK. That has been our priority throughout the past year and it will be the priority for the year to come.\""

      "text": "Failing to extend a \u00a320 lockdown benefit boost will harm the health of millions of people for decades, leading health organisations have told Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a letter. \nIntroduced last year, the \u00a320-a-week uplift is due to end in April.\nClaimants say it has been a lifeline and dread losing it.  \nWork and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has hinted the government could be moving closer to extending the rise but says there is no decision yet.\nNow, groups representing doctors, nurses and social workers, say health inequalities laid bare by Covid will worsen if the uplift to universal credit is scrapped. \nTheir comments echo those of campaigners and claimants - such as single mother Rebecca, from the east of England, who told BBC News withdrawing the extra cash would be \"cruel\".\nRebecca, who asked the BBC not to use her full name, has an eight-year-old daughter and relies on universal credit to supplement her earnings from working 14 hours a week for a charity.\nShe has been receiving the benefit for two years, the first of which, before the extra payment was introduced, she describes as \"brutal\".\nAnd by October 2019, \"we had no money for food\".\n\"I put a post on Facebook, asking where I could go safely with a kid for free food,\" she said.\nIn the end, it was gifts from friends and food parcels from a local church that saw them through. \nThe introduction of the \u00a320 boost had provided a buffer, said Rebecca.\n\"At least I had something coming in,\" she said. \n\"The \u00a320 is mostly food for her - I eat whatever I can.\n\"Obviously we will find a way to survive, because we have to, but it's a lot lot harder.\"\nThe letter calls on the prime minister to make the temporary increase to universal credit and working tax credit permanent from April and provide the same uplift to other key benefits. \n\"As organisations working across health and care, we see the irrefutable evidence that poverty has significant negative impacts on individuals, their families and society more widely,\" it says. \nThe signatories include:\nThe letter calls the extra \u00a320 \"an investment in our nation's health, ensuring many of those on the lowest incomes have access to essentials like food or heating\".\n\"In a year marked by worry and uncertainty, the uplift has been a preventative lifeline keeping many afloat, protecting them from financial instability, debt and worsening mental health,\" it says.\nAnd if it is discontinued, \"overnight 6.2 million families will face a \u00a31,040 cut to their incomes\".\n\"We cannot plan for the UK's economic recovery only to face another escalating health crisis for those on the lowest incomes,\" the letter says.\nOn Wednesday, Ms Coffey told MPs: \"We have the effects of this pandemic that are ongoing.\n\"And we recognise the need to continue to support people.\"\nShe rejected the idea the extra \u00a320 \"reduces work incentives\", telling the Work and Pensions Committee this \"steady stream of money would be more beneficial to claimants\" than an alternative option of a one-off payment. \nThe \u00a320 boost, which costs about \u00a36bn, came after years of cuts to benefits. \nChanges since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, initially in coalition, mean spending on working-age benefits  is about \u00a332bn lower this year than it would have been, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated.\nAnd even with the extra \u00a320, a single person with no children who loses their job in the UK this year will receive just 17% of average earnings in benefit payments, the lowest figure among high-income economies.   \nThe cuts to welfare have also been blamed by campaigners and charities for the increase in child poverty since 2010.  \nAnother think tank, the Resolution Foundation, has calculated even if the \u00a320 boost is made permanent, child poverty will continue to rise.\nAnd by 2024, one third of children will be living in poverty.  \nRebecca said she knew how to budget but still struggled to make ends meet, even with the extra \u00a320 a week.\nWithout it, \"every day is stress because you don't know how you're going to make it for the next month\".\n\"You're always living on your toes,\" she said.\n\"And you're always having to budget minute by minute and budget to the very penny.\"\n\"When already you are scraping for money, \u00a320 is masses.\" \nA government spokesman said: \"We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond to ensure that nobody is left behind.\" \nHe said support had been targeted at those most in need, including \"raising the living wage, spending hundreds of billions to safeguard jobs, boosting welfare support by billions and introducing the \u00a3170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme\"."

Welsh local council elections are scheduled to take place next year. \nScottish Parliament and Welsh Senedd elections are also scheduled to take place this May - with the devolved governments responsible for running them.\nThe government had previously said the local elections for England, scheduled for 6 May, were under review amid uncertainty about lockdown restrictions.\nBut Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith confirmed on Friday they will go ahead, arguing \"democracy should not be cancelled because of Covid\".\nMay will see a bumper crop of voting, with local elections that were postponed last year combined with those originally scheduled to take place in 2021.\nIt means around 5,000 council seats will be contested in 149 local authorities in England, alongside 25 seats in the London Assembly, and some mayoral races. \nParticipation in local elections varies between years depending on which seats are up for grabs - around 7.5 million took part in England's elections in 2018, and 6.5 million in 2017.\nAs well as being asked to bring their own pen or pencil to mark their ballots, those voting in a polling station this year will have to wear a mask. \nCandidates are also being asked not to give voters a lift to polling stations in their cars - a common practice at election time.\nPolling booths must also be designed to ensure \"maximum ventilation\", the government says.\nRules on proxy voting - where people designate someone else to vote on their behalf - will also be changed to allow people who need to self-isolate to request an emergency proxy vote up until 5pm on polling day.\nHowever, the government said it had decided against postal ballot-only elections \"as this could increase fraud risk and reduce choice for voters\".\nAn extra \u00a315m will be given to English councils to hold their elections, with an estimated additional \u00a316m for PCC elections in England and Wales. \nIn a break with tradition, councils are also being asked not to use schools as polling stations in a bid to minimise any further disruption to pupils' education. \nThere's been growing expectation that the government would stick to May for these elections after ministers signalled they were reluctant to move them. \nThe government's action plan, the extension to proxy voting, and the extra funding have all been welcomed - but they haven't allayed all concerns.  \nLogistically, there are still questions over whether enough suitable polling stations can be found, whether PPE should be supplied to staff who man them, and whether all the extra costs incurred by councils will be covered. \nPolitically, the big worry is the impact on campaigning. \nWith door-to-door visits limited, there's concern about how to engage voters, and what the effect of a shift to online campaigns might mean. \nCouncils are saying they'll crack on now and make these elections happen safely, but that's not without its challenges.  \nCouncillor John Fuller, Conservative leader of South Norfolk Council and chairman of the District Councils Network, said delaying the elections would have been the best option. \n\"It would have been better to have a poll conducted when everyone was vaccinated rather than a campaign started in lockdown, but we'll all pull together to make this work,\" he said.\nHe added that going ahead with elections in May would be \"challenging,\" but said he was \"relieved\" that the need for extra costs had been recognised by the government. \nLabour accused the government of being \"woefully unprepared,\" warning \"cash-strapped\" local councils were not being given necessary support. \nThe party's shadow minister for democracy, Cat Smith, called for dedicated funding to help local authorities sign people up to vote by post. \n\"Ministers are yet to respond to the challenge of recruiting polling and count staff, with so many workers needed as Covid marshals and for additional cleaning,\" she added. \nThe Liberal Democrats have complained about government guidance that it is not \"permissible\" for party activists to knock on doors or post leaflets during lockdown.\nA spokesman for the party accused ministers of trying to ban volunteer campaigning ahead of the polls, and called on them to \"urgently retract\" it.\n\"It cannot be right that it is legal for pizza delivery leaflets to come through your letterbox, but leaflets that criticise the government are not,\" they added.\n\"If putting your case to neighbours is banned, the election isn't fair.\"\nMinisters say they will publish specific guidance on face-to-face campaigning after consulting political parties."

      "text": "A mother and daughter have been killed in linked attacks in Ayrshire before a man died in a road crash.\nEmma Robertson Coupland, 39, was found injured in the car park of University Hospital Crosshouse in Kilmarnock at 19:45 on Thursday.\nAround 20 minutes later the NHS worker's daughter, Nicole Anderson, 24, was fatally stabbed on Portland Street, about two miles away.\nSteven Robertson, 40, died in a road crash south of the town, at 20:30.\nPolice Scotland said officers were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incidents - which led to a three-hour lockdown of the hospital - and there was no ongoing threat to the public. \nCh Supt Faroque Hussain said: \"A number of locations remain cordoned off as officers continue to conduct inquiries.  \n\"We are working to confirm the full circumstances of what has happened.\"\nHe urged anyone with information about the incidents, which unfolded over a 45-minute period, to come forward.\nCh Supt Hussain added: \"Understandably, people will be shocked by what has happened. \n\"We are still in the process of establishing the full circumstances, however, I would like to reassure people that there is no wider threat to the community.\"\nMs Coupland was treated in the hospital car park but died at the scene.\nHer daughter was attacked about 20 minutes later and was taken to University Hospital Crosshouse but later died from her injuries.\nThe fatal road crash occurred on the C50, a minor road between the B7036 and the A76, about 12 miles south of Kilmarnock. \nMr Robertson was pronounced dead at the scene.\nAmbulances were diverted to University Hospital Ayr as police dealt with the unfolding events until the three-hour lockdown was lifted shortly before 23:00. \nA statement from Ms Coupland's colleagues read: \"Emma was a valued member of the NHS, a wonderful friend, colleague and loving mother. We are all deeply saddened by the loss.\" \nOn Friday morning, the hospital's A&E department and main entrance were open and running as normal while two police vans full of officers remained outside with police tape around part of the car park.\nDr Crawford McGuffie, the medical director of NHS Ayrshire and Arran, said police had confirmed the risk to patients, staff and visitors to the hospital was minimal. \nJohn Burns, the health board's chief executive, acknowledged the professionalism of those who responded to the attacks.\nHe said: \"This was a particularly challenging incident, and our staff reacted with care and compassion.\" \nMr Burns added that the car park at the physiotherapy department will remain closed until police have concluded their investigations. \nRev Jim McNaughtan, of St Andrew's and St Marnock's Parish Church, said the reaction in the town has been one of disbelief.\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"The staff at Crosshouse Hospital have been working hard this wee while dealing with the Covid outbreak. \n\"For something like this to happen in the grounds of the hospital is tragic and shocking and there is great concern for all involved.\"\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"Dreadful news. My thoughts are with the bereaved. Thinking too of everyone at Crosshouse Hospital, already dealing with the tough circumstances of Covid. I'm also grateful to our emergency services. Please continue to follow @policescotland advice.\"\nDuring the Scottish government's daily coronavirus briefing, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said his thoughts were also with the family and friends of those who died.\nHe added: \"A tragedy like this would be impossible to understand at any time but, after the events of the past year, it is particularly shocking that such an incident has taken place at an NHS hospital.\"\nDowning Street said Boris Johnson also offered his sympathies.\nA Number 10 spokesman said: \"The prime minister's thoughts are with all those involved and he thanks the police and the healthcare staff for their response.\" \nEast Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Reid said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the tragic events.\nHe added: \"In East Ayrshire we are proud of our community spirit and community resilience, but I know the events of last night will have had a devastating impact on several families in our communities and our heartfelt thoughts go out to them this morning.\""

      "title": "Energy prices to rise for millions of households",
      "tags": "Electricity pricing,Ofgem,Personal finance,Energy industry",
      "text": "Energy prices will rise for millions of people across the UK in April, at a time when finances are squeezed.\nRegulator Ofgem said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs.\nThe typical gas and electricity customer is likely to see their bill go up by \u00a396 to \u00a31,138 a year.\nCharities say the timing is a \"double whammy\", coming at a time when the government's Covid-related support schemes are due to be wound down.\nOfgem said rising wholesale costs were behind the increase, adding that the existence of the price cap meant households saved \u00a3100 a year, and they could also switch to a better deal.\nJonathan Brearley, chief executive of the regulator, said:\u202f \"Energy bill increases are never welcome, especially as many households are struggling with the impact of the pandemic. We have carefully scrutinised these changes to ensure that customers only pay a fair price for their energy.  \n\"As the UK still faces challenges around Covid-19, during this exceptional time I expect suppliers to set their prices competitively, treat all customers fairly and ensure that any household in financial distress is given access to the support they need.\"\nHe said a rise in spring, when less energy was used, was better than waiting until the autumn.\nPeter Earl, head of energy at price comparison website Comparethemarket.com, said: \"Raising energy costs for millions of households by an average of \u00a396 is an extraordinary move in the current environment. \n\"It calls into question the whole point of a price cap which was designed to protect the most vulnerable households.\"\nThe price cap, set twice a year by the regulator, affects 11 million households in England, Wales and Scotland who have never switched suppliers or whose discounted deals have expired. Northern Ireland sets its own cap.\nThat accounts for about half of all UK households. The remainder are on so-called fixed deals, which will not be affected.\nThe cap for prepayment meter customers will go up by \u00a387\u202f to \u00a31,156, affecting another four million customers.\nThe caps set the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, but that does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. The more gas and electricity you use, the higher the bill.\nLockdown life means Lyn Clark, like so many others, has been spending a lot more time at home. Her energy bills have been rising as a result.\n\"I'm trying not to switch on heaters in the rooms that are not being used,\" she said.\nWhile prices are capped on default tariffs, the amount people pay in total is likely to have risen during more time at home.\nMrs Clark said she had been doing her best to keep the costs down.\n\"I find myself putting on extra layers,\" she said. \"I also go for a walk each lunchtime to make sure I'm warmer.\"\nIn October, Ofgem lowered the price cap by \u00a384, but it has now more than reversed that with the rise scheduled for April.\nThe extra allowance for suppliers to raise prices is the result of greater costs on the wholesale markets.\nIt also includes an allowance to charge an extra \u00a323 a year to cover bills that have not been paid. Ofgem said a further delay in recouping these costs would only create greater costs next winter.\nCharities point out that raising prices for everyone on these tariffs is likely to increase the number of people unable to pay.\nCitizens Advice said its research in December indicated that 2.1 million households were behind on their energy bills, a rise of 600,000 compared with before the pandemic.\nIt was concerned that the planned removing of assistance for recipients of universal credit, as well as other government financial support schemes being wound down, meant there were serious worries over debt.\nAlistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"This increase will be a heavy blow to a lot of households. For many people on universal credit it will come at the same time as the \u00a320 a week increase to the benefit is set to end.\n\"With a tough jobs market and essential bills rising, now is not the time for the government to cut this vital lifeline\". \nAdam Scorer, of National Energy Action, which has also warned of financial pressures on households, said: \"People on the lowest incomes and in the worst housing are always hit hardest. \n\"Heating a poorly insulated home costs around \u00a350 a month more than a decent home. If bills rise by \u00a396, millions of households have two stark choices; stay cold or fall further into debt.\"\nHe argued that prepayment meter customers should not have been included in the cap as they found it difficult to switch.\nEven if households do switch, the cost of so-called fixed-rate deals has also been rising. The cheapest on the market rose by more than \u00a350 in the last three months of the year to \u00a3851.\nEmma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, a trade body for energy suppliers, said the price cap was set to be fair to customers and suppliers.\n\"Today's rise reflects that the cost of buying energy - by far the biggest part of the bill - has risen significantly over the last few months,\" she said.\n\"It also includes a greater allowance for debt given the difficulties many customers are facing in paying bills at present.\""

      "tags": "Storm Darcy,Met Office,Snow",
      "text": "People are being urged to check in on the elderly and vulnerable as cold and snowy weather threatens disruption.\nAn amber snow warning - meaning travel issues and power cuts are likely - is in place for parts of east and south-east England until Monday morning.\nYellow snow and ice warnings are also in force for much of England, Scotland and eastern Wales.\nMet Office weather expert Steven Keates said there would be \"many similarities\" with the Beast from the East in 2018.\nIt is due to a combination of cold air from Scandinavia and Russia plus Storm Darcy bringing winds and snow, he said.\nAsked whether he thought it was fair to call it the Beast from the East Two, the meteorologist said: \"I think so. The air mass is not quite as cold as it was then, so it's not quite as extreme, but nonetheless this is probably the coldest weather we'll see across the UK as a whole since then. \n\"And if you're stepping outside at all through the next few days, it really is going to feel cold. Temperatures [will be] barely above freezing on a thermometer, and when you factor in a strong easterly wind, you'll be feeling many degrees below freezing.\"\nParts of Scotland have already seen heavy snowfall in the past few days, with up to 50cm in some places - but Scotland's amber warning for snow has now expired.\nMore snow is expected in eastern parts of Scotland later, with 10 to 15cm possible in some areas, especially above 200m. \nOne amber warning is now in place for parts of London, the south-east and the east of England until 09:00 GMT on Monday.\nThose areas could see between five and 10cm of snow on Sunday - with up to 20cm in some places, the BBC Weather Centre said.\nYellow warnings - which mean there could be travel disruption and a slight chance of power cuts or communities being cut off - are also in place for:\nMet Office forecasters have warned of \"significant disruptive snowfall\" and gale force winds in the south-east of England, saying up to 30cm of snow is possible in the Kent Downs and more widely on the North Downs. \nMeteorologist Sarah Kent said: \"It is a small chance, but the threat is there, up to a foot of snow potentially combined with extremely strong easterly winds. Even inland in that area, gusting could be 45mph and higher than that on the coasts.\n\"This could lead to significant drifting of any lying snow and obviously blizzards for the snow coming past you for anyone who is attempting to travel.\n\"Sadly there will be people who have to make journeys for the emergency services and there are still lorries that have to go to the ports. It is going to be really disruptive.\n\"With that sort of snowfall, you would expect some roads to be closed or blocked by the drifting snow, and long delays or some cancellations of public transport.\"\nPublic Health England's Dr Owen Landeg said it was \"crucial\" people looked out for those who may be vulnerable during the current cold snap.\nHe called on the public to make sure those at-risk have enough food and drink to stay warm and well.\nThe conditions are caused by cold air spreading east from the Arctic Circle, tracking across the relatively mild North Sea to form showers that bring snow and a significant wind chill.\nStorm Darcy, which was named by the Netherlands, is bringing an area of low pressure, adding moisture to the cold air to help form the snow.\nIn Scotland, parts of which have seen heavy snow and ice since the end of last year, road clearing will be prioritised around Covid vaccination centres, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said.\nHe said it was possible weather conditions would create challenges for the vaccination programme.\nOn Friday, about 20 vehicles were stranded in snow at Loch Droma, north west of Inverness, and emergency services have been assisting a rescue operation, Highland Council said.\nThe vehicles became stranded in two-metre snow drifts, said road management organisation Bear Scotland.\nNetwork Rail said services have been disrupted on the Highland Mainline despite plough trains being used to clear snow.\nAside from icy conditions, there were 52 flood warnings in place as of Sunday morning across parts of England, along the River Severn and the River Thames, according to the Environment Agency.\nIn Berkshire, parts of Cookham were left submerged after heavy rain caused flooding at Widbrook Common.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has issued a flood warning for Greenlaw to Allanton in the Borders.\nDrivers are advised to make sure their vehicle is ready for the cold weather amid predictions of an increase in breakdowns.\nRAC spokesman Ben Aldous said: \"This means checking oil, coolant and screen wash levels, as well as ensuring the tyres have plenty of tread and are inflated properly.\n\"Large amounts of snow on vehicles should be cleared before setting off to avoid it falling on to other road users. And never attempt to use the windscreen wipers to clear an icy or snowy windscreen - you risk damaging not only the wipers but the linkages too, which could be a more costly repair.\""

      "text": "Boris Johnson's senior adviser on ethnic minorities resigned complaining of \"unbearable\" tension within Downing Street - but then decided to stay on.\nIn a letter to the prime minister, seen by the BBC, Samuel Kasumu accused the Conservative Party of pursuing \"a politics steeped in division\".\nBut he retracted his resignation on Thursday night after talks with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi.\nNo 10 said the government was the most ethnically diverse in UK history.\nMr Kasumu, an entrepreneur who has worked for the government since 2019, said in his letter that he wanted to step down as an adviser by May.\nHe argued that black and Asian voters were now less likely to choose the Conservatives than they had been under former Prime Minister David Cameron.\nMr Kasumu also suggested Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch may have broken the ministerial code when she publicly criticised a HuffPost journalist last week for asking why she had not appeared in a social media video featuring black MPs encouraging take-up of vaccines.\nAnd he criticised the government's response to Ms Badenoch's actions, saying: \"It was not OK or justifiable, but somehow nothing was said. I waited, and waited, for something from the senior leadership team to even point to an expected standard, but it did not materialise.\"\nThe Cabinet Office has been considering whether Ms Badenoch had broken the rules, but it is thought officials did not consider her behaviour to be a breach, and no official investigation has been set up.  \nFor Labour, shadow equalities minister Marsha de Cordova said: \"It is disgraceful that the equalities minister has not been held to account for her behaviour last week. The prime minister must condemn her actions.\" \nIn his letter, Mr Kasumu said the Conservatives had built a coalition of voters to win a majority at the last general election, but added: \"I fear for what may become of the party in the future by choosing to pursue a politics steeped in division.\"\nHe claimed the government's culture was not \"conducive\" to \"empathy\" and \"the damage that is often caused by our actions is not much considered\".\n\"As someone that has spent his whole adult life serving others, that tension has been at times unbearable,\" he said.\nA Downing Street spokesman declined to comment on individual staff members, but said: \"This government is committed to inclusion and bringing communities together and is the most ethnically diverse in this country's history.\"\nThe government had set up a Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities to tackle inequality and discrimination and it is due to report shortly, they added."

      "text": "Dozens of environmental groups have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for a public inquiry into plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria.  \nThey say it is \"mystifying\" that No 10 has not stopped the mine from going ahead, when the UK is hosting the COP26 climate summit later this year.\nA top climate scientist has warned the PM risks \"humiliation\" over the plans.\nNo 10 said the UK is a world leader in climate policy and it would not reverse the decision.\nThe letter, signed by groups including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Cumbria Wildlife Trust, criticises the decision not to intervene in the approval of the mine, when the UK's credibility - as summit host - is \"at stake\".\nThe letter to Mr Johnson describes the summit, which takes place in Glasgow in November, as \"the largest global climate talks since the signing of the Paris Agreement\".\nThe signatories acknowledge that whilst \"new jobs need to be created\", the government should \"lead the way with low-carbon technologies, rather than looking to the polluting industries of the past\".\nThe \u00a3165m West Cumbria Mining plan in Whitehaven was approved by Cumbria County Council in October. It would be the UK's first deep coal mine in 30 years.\nThe council said the government could have \"called in\" the plans for a public inquiry, but had chosen not to do so.\nIn an interview with the BBC, the local mayor welcomed the proposals.\nMike Starkie, the Conservative mayor of Copeland Borough Council, said: \"I think the project is absolutely fantastic, it'll bring huge amounts of jobs and prosperity into the area.  \n\"It's been broadly welcomed across Copeland. I've never known a project that has carried so much public support.\"\nBut the campaigners say \"time is of the essence\" for the government to act, before Cumbria County Council issues its final decision on the mine \"very soon\".\nIn the letter, they urge Robert Jenrick, the secretary of state for Housing, Communities and Local Government, to refer the plans to a public inquiry.\nThey write: \"Reversing this decision would help restore confidence in the UK government's climate leadership both internationally and at home.\"\nStanley Johnson, the prime minister's father, told the BBC it was a \"massive mistake in public relations terms\".\nHe said: \"How can we ask other countries to bring in their climate change reduction programmes when we are now reopening the whole coal argument here in Britain?\"\nIt comes as Dr James Hansen, formerly Nasa's leading global warming researcher, urged Mr Johnson in a letter to halt production of the mine - or risk being \"vilified\".\nDowning Street has previously defended the decision over the mine as a local planning matter and insisted the UK is cutting emissions faster than any major economy and would end the use of coal for electricity by 2025.\nJustin Rowlatt, the BBC's chief environment correspondent, says when it comes to decarbonisation, the UK is a world leader.\nOur correspondent says the UK's coal consumption has decreased by 90% in the last five years and just four power stations still burn coal.\nDr Hansen's letter follows earlier criticism from the government's advisory body on global warming, the Climate Change Committee (CCC).\nIt warned the mine would increase global emissions and compromise the UK's legally binding carbon budgets.\nThe CCC said: \"The decision to award planning permission [for the mine] to 2049 will commit the UK to emissions from coking coal.\" The body said coking coal will have to stop by 2035 if the country is to meet its climate change targets.\nCORRECTION 7 February 2021: An earlier version of this story wrongly stated that the Conservative Environment Network opposes the proposed mine. Stanley Johnson is an ambassador for the group but was not speaking on its behalf."

      "text": "UK residents returning from coronavirus hotspots abroad will have to quarantine in hotels from 15 February, the government has confirmed.\nHotel owners will be asked to provide rooms for more than 1,000 new people every day, documents suggest.\nPassengers will have to stay in their rooms for 10 nights, with security guards accompanying if they go outside.\nLabour called the measures \"too little, too late\" to deal properly with new overseas strains of Covid.\n\"It is beyond comprehension that these measures won't even start until 15 February,\" said shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds.\nQuarantine hotels are expected to be set up near airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. \nThe rules will apply to UK nationals and residents returning to the country from 33 \"red list\" Covid-19 hotspots - including several South American and African countries where new Covid variants have been detected in large numbers of people - and passengers will be expected to pay for the cost of the accommodation.\nMost foreign nationals from high-risk countries already face UK travel bans.\nMinisters are also likely to increase the fines for people who break the rules. Home Office sources have said they expect fines will have a deterrent effect so traveller numbers are likely to fall from 1000 a day swiftly.\nAccording to documents seen by the BBC, the government wants quarantine hotels to be made available \"on an exclusive basis\".\nGuests will have three meals a day in their rooms, with tea, coffee, fruit and water being available.\nSecurity will \"accompany any of the arrived individuals to access outside space should they need to smoke or get fresh air\", one document says.\nOne hospitality industry source said the government estimated the cost at about \u00a380 per night per person.\n\"If they are taking rooms for 1,425 passengers per night until 31 March, that is a bill of \u00a355m,\" they added.\nA Department of Health spokesperson said it was working \"at pace\" to roll out managed quarantine facilities in the run-up to 15 February.\n\"In the face of new variants, it is important that the government continues to take the necessary steps to protect people and save lives,\" they said. \nThe department says it sent commercial specifications on Thursday evening to hotels near air and sea ports asking for proposals on delivering quarantine facilities ahead of formal contracts being awarded.\nThe government is expected to set out further details next week on how passengers will be able to book into the designated hotels.\nIt has also been announced that Mr Hancock will chair a new Cabinet sub-committee to oversee efforts to implement mandatory quarantine and enhanced testing aimed at preventing the spread of new Covid variants. \nMr Thomas-Symonds said: \"We are in a race against time to protect our borders against new Covid strains. Yet hotel quarantine will come in to force more than 50 days after the South African strain was discovered.\"\nLabour has called on the government to extend hotel quarantining to those returning to the UK from all countries, not just the areas on the \"red list\".\nBut the Conservatives described the plan as \"implausible\", arguing it would mean putting around 20,000 people in hotels every day.\nA further 915 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to the government's daily figures.\nThis brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 110,250.\nHave you recently entered the UK from a hotspot such as South Africa?

      "text": "The Department for Education should have sought better value for money from a private contract for vouchers to replace free school meals in England during the pandemic, MPs have warned.\nThe Public Accounts Committee spending watchdog warned of \"missed potential opportunities\" for savings in the \u00a3425m deal with voucher firm Edenred.\nMPs said the DfE seemed \"surprisingly unconcerned\" about the firm's profits.\nBut Edenred rejected \"entirely any suggestion of profiteering\".\nA DfE statement also dismissed accusations of profiteering, adding: \"In its investigation the National Audit Office acknowledged the rapid action this government took to deliver free school meals for eligible pupils, the significant improvements that were made to the scheme and our oversight of it.\"\nA total of \u00a3380m worth of food vouchers were issued to disadvantaged families in England between March and August 2020, when children could not get free meals in school.\nBut in the early stages, there were \"serious problems\" and \"unacceptable delays\" with the scheme, according to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report.\nBoth the DfE and Edenred took over a month to realise 40,000 order codes for conversion into vouchers had not been delivered to families, say MPs.\nEdenred's website was also difficult to navigate and its systems failed to cope with the volume of calls and emails from families struggling to access the scheme. \nMeanwhile, the DfE extended the contract with Edenred on two occasions, which was originally worth \u00a378m, but did not seek to renegotiate any of the terms.\nThe DfE was \"surprisingly unconcerned about whether Edenred was profiting from the voucher scheme at taxpayers' expense,\" said the report, \"and missed potential opportunities to reduce the cost or share in the profits.\"\nThe Edenred voucher scheme was relaunched in January this year to provide vouchers worth \u00a315 a week to disadvantaged children in England.\nMeg Hillier, the committee's chairwoman, said: \"Government's failure to learn from its repeated contracting mistakes, over and over, large and small, is costing this nation too dear.\n\"After the initial urgency we have seen the government continuing to play catch up on how to support families whose children are entitled to free school meals and despite the contract with Edenred growing more than five-fold there was no discussion about tendering the contract or even renegotiating it.\"\nThe Association of School and College Leaders' general secretary, Geoff Barton, called the service provided by Edenred \"an absolute shambles\", adding that \"it adds insult to injury\" to find out that opportunities to reduced costs were \"missed\".\n\"The DfE is constantly lecturing schools about the importance of running efficiently and saving costs wherever possible, but appears not to have brought the same rigour to bear on its own management of this scheme,\" said Mr Barton.\nEdenred's profits from the scheme are not in the public domain but the DfE has previously said it's \"very comfortable\" with the money the French-owned company made. \nOne per cent of the contract's value has been handed back to the government as part of a rebate, according to a spokesman for the firm.\nThe spokesman said: \"With 95% of families saying [the scheme] has worked well for them and a contract which has ensured that every pound of public money was passed on to the children and families who needed it, with no charges to the DfE or the taxpayer, Edenred has delivered a programme which has provided vital support for families through the pandemic and value for money for the DfE.\"\nHowever, the PAC report called on the government to learn lessons \"to secure better value for the taxpayer\" in the future. \nThe report also criticised the DfE's failure to hold Edenred to the terms of the contract, including a requirement that Edenred answer 90% of telephone enquiries within 30 seconds, which it failed to meet, with many calls unanswered. \nIt also said DfE should have done more to ensure supermarket chains taking part in the scheme were accessible to families, as early on almost 2,500 schools were more than 5km from a participating shop. \nAlison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: \"The scheme came up short not least because the Department for Education had insufficient understanding of the real-world needs of low income parents.\n\"We know that cash payments work best for families as they allow flexibility, safety and choice - and give parents confidence that they can reliably feed their children -  since every shop takes cash and everyone knows how it works.\"\nA DfE statement said: \"We have already made further improvements to the scheme which take account of the recommendations in [the PAC] report, including improving the terms of the contract to ensure the better value for money for taxpayers.\""

      "text": "Scientists believe they may have discovered the smallest reptile on earth - a chameleon subspecies that is the size of a seed. \nTwo of the tiny lizards were discovered by a German-Madagascan expedition team in Madagascar.\nThe male Brookesia nana, or nano-chameleon, has a body of just 13.5mm.\nThis makes it the smallest of about 11,500 known species of reptiles, according to the Bavarian State collection of Zoology in Munich.\nIts length from top to tail is 22mm (0.86in). \nThe female is far bigger at around 29mm, the institute said, adding that other specimens were yet to be located, despite \"great effort\".\n\"The new chameleon is only known from a degraded montane rainforest in northern Madagascar and might be threatened by extinction,\" said the Scientific Reports journal. \nOliver Hawlitschek, a scientist at the Center of Natural History in Hamburg, said: \"The nano-chameleon's habitat has unfortunately been subject to deforestation, but the area was placed under protection recently, so the species will survive.\"\nResearchers found that it hunts for mites on the rainforest floor and hides from predators at night in blades of grass.\nIn a blog post, Dr Mark Scherz, one of the researchers involved in the discovery, called it \"a spectacular case of extreme miniaturisation\".\nThe forests where the Brookesia were located are still well connected with others across the north of the island, he said. \n\"So this tiny new chameleon violates the pattern of the smallest species being found on small islands. That suggests that something else is allowing/causing these chameleons to miniaturise,\" he added.\nIn their report, scientists recommended that the chameleon be listed as critically endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species to help protect it and its habitat."

      "text": "People are being urged to check in on the elderly and vulnerable as cold and snowy weather threatens disruption.\nAn amber snow warning - meaning travel issues and power cuts are likely - is in place for parts of east and south-east England until Monday morning.\nYellow snow and ice warnings are also in force for much of England, Scotland and eastern Wales.\nMet Office weather expert Steven Keates said there would be \"many similarities\" with the Beast from the East in 2018.\nIt is due to a combination of cold air from Scandinavia and Russia plus Storm Darcy bringing winds and snow, he said.\nAsked whether he thought it was fair to call it the Beast from the East Two, the meteorologist said: \"I think so. The air mass is not quite as cold as it was then, so it's not quite as extreme, but nonetheless this is probably the coldest weather we'll see across the UK as a whole since then. \n\"And if you're stepping outside at all through the next few days, it really is going to feel cold. Temperatures [will be] barely above freezing on a thermometer, and when you factor in a strong easterly wind, you'll be feeling many degrees below freezing.\"\nParts of Scotland have already seen heavy snowfall in the past few days, with up to 50cm in some places - but Scotland's amber warning for snow has now expired.\nMore snow is expected in eastern parts of Scotland later, with 10 to 15cm possible in some areas, especially above 200m. \nOne amber warning is now in place for parts of London, the south-east and the east of England until 09:00 GMT on Monday.\nThose areas could see between five and 10cm of snow on Sunday - with up to 20cm in some places, the BBC Weather Centre said.\nYellow warnings - which mean there could be travel disruption and a slight chance of power cuts or communities being cut off - are also in place for:\nMet Office forecasters have warned of \"significant disruptive snowfall\" and gale force winds in the south-east of England, saying up to 30cm of snow is possible in the Kent Downs and more widely on the North Downs. \nMeteorologist Sarah Kent said: \"It is a small chance, but the threat is there, up to a foot of snow potentially combined with extremely strong easterly winds. Even inland in that area, gusting could be 45mph and higher than that on the coasts.\n\"This could lead to significant drifting of any lying snow and obviously blizzards for the snow coming past you for anyone who is attempting to travel.\n\"Sadly there will be people who have to make journeys for the emergency services and there are still lorries that have to go to the ports. It is going to be really disruptive.\n\"With that sort of snowfall, you would expect some roads to be closed or blocked by the drifting snow, and long delays or some cancellations of public transport.\"\nPublic Health England's Dr Owen Landeg said it was \"crucial\" people looked out for those who may be vulnerable during the current cold snap.\nHe called on the public to make sure those at-risk have enough food and drink to stay warm and well.\nThe conditions are caused by cold air spreading east from the Arctic Circle, tracking across the relatively mild North Sea to form showers that bring snow and a significant wind chill.\nStorm Darcy, which was named by the Netherlands, is bringing an area of low pressure, adding moisture to the cold air to help form the snow.\nIn Scotland, parts of which have seen heavy snow and ice since the end of last year, road clearing will be prioritised around Covid vaccination centres, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said.\nHe said it was possible weather conditions would create challenges for the vaccination programme.\nOn Friday, about 20 vehicles were stranded in snow at Loch Droma, north west of Inverness, and emergency services have been assisting a rescue operation, Highland Council said.\nThe vehicles became stranded in two-metre snow drifts, said road management organisation Bear Scotland.\nNetwork Rail said services have been disrupted on the Highland Mainline despite plough trains being used to clear snow.\nAside from icy conditions, there were 52 flood warnings in place as of Sunday morning across parts of England, along the River Severn and the River Thames, according to the Environment Agency.\nIn Berkshire, parts of Cookham were left submerged after heavy rain caused flooding at Widbrook Common.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has issued a flood warning for Greenlaw to Allanton in the Borders.\nDrivers are advised to make sure their vehicle is ready for the cold weather amid predictions of an increase in breakdowns.\nRAC spokesman Ben Aldous said: \"This means checking oil, coolant and screen wash levels, as well as ensuring the tyres have plenty of tread and are inflated properly.\n\"Large amounts of snow on vehicles should be cleared before setting off to avoid it falling on to other road users. And never attempt to use the windscreen wipers to clear an icy or snowy windscreen - you risk damaging not only the wipers but the linkages too, which could be a more costly repair.\""

      "text": "The death of a six-week-old baby hours after a baptism ceremony in Romania has prompted an Orthodox archbishop to say such rituals will be analysed to avoid further tragedy.\nThe baby had a cardiac arrest after he was immersed three times in holy water. He had a violent death and liquid was found in his lungs, an autopsy found.\nSome 60,000 people have signed a petition calling for change.\nArchbishop Calinic is the most senior member of the clergy to back reform.\nHe told Romanian website Adevarul that he believed in the future the practice of immersing a baby would be reviewed and \"the most appropriate decision taken to respect [Church] ordinances and carefully avoid unwanted accidents\". \nA manslaughter inquiry has been opened by prosecutors into the priest who carried out the baptism in the north-eastern city of Suceava. \nBy Stephen McGrath, Romania\nIf the baby's death leads to reform in the way baptism rituals are carried out then it would cause a rift within Romania's Orthodox Church.\nBecause while some Church figures have suggested an inclination toward change, others have been clear about wanting to keep this archaic ritual of immersing the baby's head into water.\nEminence Calinic, the Archbishop of Arges, is the most prominent voice so far who appears open to change. \"In other icons, Jesus stands in the water up to his neck, and with his head bowed he receives baptism by pouring water over the top of his head,\" he was quoted as saying.\nThe Archbishop of Tomis, however, took a more belligerent stance. \"We will never change the ritual. The canons of this religion have been in place for over 1,000 years,\" he said. \"That is why we won't change. We are not intimidated.\"\nRomania's powerful Orthodox Church is not known for reform, but this baptism tragedy may lead to change. \nArchbishop Calinic himself recently conducted the high-profile baptism of the daughter of the former prince Nicholas of Romania and said in his interview that while immersion in holy water was appropriate for adults, other ways were available. \nWhen he was a priest years ago in Transylvania, he said he would dip a baby's feet into holy water and sprinkle its head.\nThe petition calling for reform had attracted 60,000 signatures by Friday. The man behind it, Vladimir Dumitru, said baptisms had to be regulated to prevent unnecessary risks and the petition was aimed at being moderate and constructive.\nThe Orthodox Church in Romania is widely respected, but it has already come under scrutiny for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. \nIn March last year, as Romanians were about to go into lockdown, priests in the northern city of Cluj gave communion using one shared spoon among a large group of worshippers.\nYou may also be interested in:"

      "tags": "Medicine,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer",
      "text": "Covid vaccines being given to millions of people in the UK are extremely safe, with mild expected side-effects, says the country's drugs regulator. \nIt assessed safety reports from nearly seven million doses given up to 24 January - mostly with the Pfizer jab.\nSome 22,820 suspected reactions were reported. Almost all were mild, such as a sore arm or flu-like illness.\nMeanwhile, new research shows the AstraZeneca jab protects well against the new 'Kent' variant of Covid.\nThis more contagious version of the virus is now dominant in much of the UK. \nHow worrying are the new coronavirus variants?\nOxford Scientists and AstraZeneca, like many other Covid vaccine developers, are working on updating their shots to make sure they are a good match as the virus continues to mutate. The UK Government has announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants.\nVaccines are seen as the way out of the pandemic, and all of the evidence so far suggests they are safe and effective.\nSide effects do occur, but overwhelmingly, are mild. They are not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. They usually get better within a couple of days, says the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.   \nSevere allergic reactions to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine can happen but are very rare - between one and two cases per 100,000 doses administered, experts estimate. The MHRA received received 101 allergy-related reports. \nDoctors already say people with a history of significant allergic reactions to ingredients in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should not receive it.  \nIn the UK, people can report concerns after having the vaccine to the MHRA's Yellow Card scheme.\nThe ones received by the agency - affecting around three in every 1,000 people vaccinated - so far reveal no unexpected serious reactions, which experts say should help reassure anyone who may be anxious about getting immunised. There is strong evidence that the vaccines will save lives and prevent severe illness. \nProf Sir Munir Pirmohamed, a doctor who has been assessing vaccine safety on behalf of the UK, said: \"It is extremely safe. The benefits far outweigh the risks. I say that to my family as well.\"\nMHRA chief executive Dr June Raine said: \"Safety is our watchword. It is vital that people continue to get their jab when they get the invitation.\"\nThe Yellow Card scheme is designed to pick up anything serious and some people might not report very mild symptoms.\nCommon reactions that may affect up to one in 10 people and typically get better within days include: \nAs expected when you track any population over time, there were some deaths - 143 were recorded among the millions vaccinated. This is not alarming or worrying, says the MHRA, or in any way linked to the vaccine. \nThe regulator also received 75 reports of facial paralysis or weakness, but this condition can occur naturally. The MHRA said: \"The number of reports of facial paralysis received so far is similar to the expected natural rate and does not currently suggest an increased risk following the vaccines. We will continue to monitor these events.\" \nIt will be publishing weekly updates on all the vaccine safety data it receives. "

      "tags": "Donald Trump,QAnon,United States",
      "text": "The US House of Representatives has voted to expel a Republican congresswoman from two committees over incendiary remarks she made before being elected last November. \nMarjorie Taylor Greene had promoted baseless QAnon conspiracy theories and endorsed violence against Democrats. \nBefore the vote, she said she regretted her views, which included claims that school shootings and 9/11 were staged.\nEleven Republicans joined the Democrats to pass the motion by 230-199. \nIt means the representative - who was elected in November, representing a district in the southern state of Georgia - cannot take up her place on the education and budget committees. \nThis would limit her ability to shape policy as most legislation goes through a committee before reaching the House floor. Committee positions can determine the influence of individual lawmakers in their party.\nIt is highly unusual for one party to intervene in another party's House committee assignments.   \nOn Friday, Mrs Greene said that she woke up \"laughing\" at the situation.\n\"I woke up early this morning literally laughing thinking about what a bunch of morons the Democrats (+11) are for giving some one like me free time,\" she tweeted, referencing the 11 Republicans who also voted to remove her.\nAt a news conference in Washington hours later, Mrs Greene said that Democrats had \"stripped my district of their voice\" by removing her from the committees.\nShe described the Democratic-run government as \"tyrannically controlled\" and denounced the upcoming Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump - over his role in the 6 January riot - as a \"circus\". \nThe lawmaker also criticised the media for \"addicting people to hate\". \nAccording to The Hill, a political news outlet, Mrs Greene received a standing ovation at a closed-doors meeting with members of her party on Wednesday after she apologised for her past remarks, and on Thursday before the vote, she expressed regret for her past comments.\nOn the floor of the House, she said her controversial remarks had been made before she ran for office last year. \n\"These were words of the past. These things do not represent me,\" she said. \nMrs Greene said she had been \"upset about things\" happening in the US and did not trust the government when she came upon conspiracy theories online in 2018. \nThe 46-year-old also sought to pin blame on the media, saying they were \"just as guilty as QAnon for promoting lies\". \nBut she did not address a series of past inflammatory remarks:\nAsked by a reporter on Friday whether or not she was \"sorry\" for some of these additional remarks, Mrs Greene said she was \"sorry for saying all those things that are wrong and offensive\". \nShe added that she was \"not sorry\" for speaking to Mr Hogg about gun rights, saying that \"he was an adult when I spoke to him\". \nAfter an afternoon of procedural manoeuvres and debate, a majority of the House of Representatives took the unprecedented step of voting to strip one of its members of her committee assignments because of what it deemed dangerous and toxic speech she made before she was elected.\nRepublicans warned that sanctioning Marjorie Taylor Greene set a dangerous precedent, where the majority party in the chamber could tell the minority how to allocate its committee seats. \nDemocrats countered that the real precedent would be if a member of the chamber made threats against her future colleagues - and the House did nothing. Because the Republicans refused to punish one of their own, the majority said they had to step in.\nThe House has sanctioned the conspiracy-minded Mrs Greene, but it may have started a new cycle of political retribution.\nAhead of the vote, Mrs Pelosi said she was \"profoundly concerned\" by Republicans accepting \"an extreme conspiracy theorist\".\nChuy Garcia, of Illinois, said Mrs Greene's floor speech had come across as \"premeditated\".\n\"I did not hear remorse and I didn't hear an apology,\" Mr Garcia said. \"It's all about spin and I think she'll probably try to raise a lot of money from it. I think it's disgraceful.\"\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said before the vote: \"I have never encountered a situation like the one before us now, where a member has made such vile and hurtful statements, engaged in the harassment of colleagues and expressed support for political violence.\"\nJimmy Gomez, of California, vowed to press ahead with a resolution to expel Mrs Greene from Congress altogether. \nUnder section five of the US Constitution, a house can expel a member with a two-thirds majority, meaning that there would have to be significant support from Republicans in the narrowly divided House of Representatives. \nAnalysis by Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring\nMarjorie Taylor Greene has said that she stopped believing in the QAnon conspiracy in 2018\nHowever, she continued to allude to ideas pushed by QAnon believers.\nIn a 2019 video she claimed that then-Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg was being played by a body double.\nThe idea stemmed from the macabre conspiracy theory that Ginsburg's death - which actually did occur, later, in September 2020 - was somehow being covered up. \nOdd as it sounds, in feverish QAnon groups where the rumour was born, whispers about imposters and political \"body doubles\" are fairly common.\nIn December 2020, she insisted in a now-deleted social media post that the QAnon community was \"exposing truth\".\nAnd somewhat prophetically, in a February 2019 video post she called for people to flood the US Capitol building to demonstrate against Democrats. The month before, she \"liked\" a post saying that it would be quicker to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"with a bullet to the head\".\nShe refused to address these issues when questioned Friday. Mrs Greene may have left overt support for QAnon behind, but it appears she's still paying attention to what's being said in conspiracy-minded groups.\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy vowed retribution whenever his party next controls the lower chamber of Congress.\nAccusing Democrats of a double standard, he referred to the 2019 anti-Semitism furore when Minnesota lawmaker Ilhan Omar implied US politicians only supported Israel because of lobby money, and Mrs Pelosi appeared with her that same month on a magazine cover.\nOn Wednesday, Mr McCarthy condemned Mrs Greene's past remarks, but refused to punish her.\nJim Jordan of Ohio told the floor: \"So who's next? Who will the cancel culture attack next?\"\nHe assailed Democrats for stoking unsubstantiated claims that Mr Trump secretly plotted with Russia to win the 2016 election.\n\"I've heard several times today from the Democrats: conspiracy theory. The Democrats peddled the biggest conspiracy theory of all time - the Russia hoax!\""

I think it's testament to the over-80s group, their relatives, carers and those vaccination teams.\"\nProf Leitch said anyone over 80 who still had not been invited should make themselves known.\nHe added: \"If you are over 80 and you don't know when you are getting the vaccine and you want one, please get in touch with your GP.\"\nIn a vaccine statement later, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman issued further advice.\nShe said: \"We appreciate that some people may have changed address and/or their phone number and may not have received a letter or phone call.\n\"If you are 80 or over or housebound and have not had a phone call or letter, you should contact your local GP.\n\"We are on track to make sure that those aged 70-79 and people aged 16 and over who are on the shielding list will have received their first dose of the vaccine by the middle of February - supplies permitting. \n\"If you are in these groups and have not received an invite for your first vaccination appointment by the end of this week, you should call the national Covid Vaccine helpline on 0800 030 8013.\"\nDuring the briefing Mr Swinney said the uptake so far had been \"really quite extraordinary\".\nHe said that there would be some people who could not be vaccinated for clinical reasons, and added that others would be getting their first injection on Friday - although he said it \"takes time\" to get out to those elderly people who are house-bound.\nBut he said: \"I think the performance on over-80s is tremendously reassuring, and it is indicative of the breadth and the depth of the vaccination programme around the country.\"\nHe said that expected severe weather this weekend could possibly affect the vaccination programme. \nThe Met Office has issued amber warnings for snow in parts of Scotland in the coming days. \nThe deputy first minster said that road clearing would be prioritised around vaccination centres to ensure disruption is kept to a minimum.\nMr Swinney said: \"We're prioritising the clearance of roads in and around vaccination centres. That is standard practice around NHS facilities wherever there is snow or ice.\n\"These measures should help to ensure that people are able to meet their destinations.\"\nIf the weather prevents anyone from travelling to a vaccination appointment, they have been advised to rebook.\nThe deputy first minister also revealed that a community testing centre for asymptomatic people would open on Wednesday next week in Cowdenbeath, Fife.\nMr Swinney said proposals for similar centres from 19 local authorities were expected to be agreed by the end of Friday, and further agreements are due to be reached next week.\nLateral flow tests will be used at the centres, but any positive cases will be confirmed using the more sensitive PCR tests.\nMr Swinney said: \"The targeted expansion of testing in these communities will help more people find out if they have Covid, even if they don't have symptoms.\n\"It will help them to know if they or their contacts need to self-isolate and will therefore play an important part in helping us to stop the spread of the virus.\""

We'll have another update for you this evening. \nThe government says it's working \"at pace\" to secure hotel rooms for the 10-day quarantine of UK residents arriving back from 33 coronavirus hotspots abroad. Ministers plan for more than 1,000 UK residents a day to return from places where new variants are prevalent, and say the regime will begin on 15 February. Labour is accusing ministers of \"putting lives at risk\" by not acting sooner.\nEnergy prices will rise for millions of people across the UK in April, with the typical gas and electricity customer likely to see their bill go up by \u00a396 to \u00a31,138 a year. Regulator Ofgem says the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs. But charities say the timing is a \"double whammy\", coming at a time when the government's Covid-related support schemes are due to be wound down.\nThe past few months have seen a surge in infections, tens of thousands of deaths and a damaging lockdown. But according to BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle, there are now plenty of reasons to be hopeful - cautiously, at least - that we are now on the road to recovery. Here's his analysis.\nFor landlords it's \"heartbreaking\", and those hankering after a pint in their local might agree. The British Beer and Pub Association calculates that by the time the current lockdowns end, up to 87 million pints of beer - equivalent to \u00a3331m in sales - will have been thrown away as a result of UK pub closures since last March. It's calling for more support for the hospitality industry.\nWhat have you been doing to pass the time during lockdown?

And on Thursday night, the first arrival was announced, with Jenni Parkinson giving birth to daughter Summer.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nIf you're wondering when lockdown will end, we round up what's been announced for each part of the UK.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar",
      "text": "A civil disobedience movement in Myanmar is gaining momentum, with teachers and students protesting against Monday's military coup.\nDemonstrators at a university in the biggest city, Yangon, chanted support for jailed leader Aung San Suu Kyi and wore red ribbons, her party's colour.\nMs Suu Kyi and other leaders have been held since the coup on Monday. \nEarlier, the military detained another senior leader from her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.\nMs Suu Kyi, who has not been seen in public since Monday, is under house arrest, according to her lawyer. He said he was seeking her unconditional release and that of the president, who was also detained, but he had been unable to meet them. \nMyanmar, which is also known as Burma, has remained mostly calm in the aftermath of the coup, which has plunged the South East Asian country into uncertainty.\nOn Friday afternoon, hundreds of teachers and students gathered outside Dagon University in Yangon, where they displayed the three-finger salute - a sign that has been adopted by protesters in the region to show their opposition to authoritarian rule. \nThey chanted their support for Ms Suu Kyi and carried red flags. \n\"We will not let our generation suffer under this kind of military dictatorship,\" Min Sithu, a student, told the AFP news agency. \nBy Nyein Chan, BBC Burmese, Yangon\nThe first reaction to the coup was shock and horror. But now people have had time to digest what is happening and are finding different ways to fight back.\nAs the regime takes more steps to tighten its control, an increasing number of people are joining the leaderless civil disobedience campaign demanding a return of the democratically elected government.\nThe military has blocked the most popular social media platform, Facebook, but most people are still able to access it using virtual private networks - VPNs - and that's where lots of the protests are taking place. \nPeople here know very well the violent crackdowns the military is capable of, so that's why for now there are no widespread street protests. But there are other ways people can make their voices heard.\nThe lecturers who took part in Friday's campus protests said they were doing it for the next generation.\nI have an 18-month-old child. I grew up under military rule and the economic sanctions that came as a result of it. I prayed that my son would grow up in a very different Burma.  Now I am not so sure what his future will be like.\nThere have been a number of demonstrations in different parts of Myanmar - the first large-scale street protests seen in the country since the coup. \nResidents in some cities, including Yangon, have conducted nightly protests from their homes, banging pots and pans and singing revolutionary songs. There have also been daytime flash mobs.\nAbout 70 MPs are said to have held an insurgent parliament, to replicate the parliamentary session that was supposed to take place this week. \nIn a pre-dawn phone call with BBC Burmese, Win Htein, a 79-year-old patron of the NLD and strong supporter of Ms Suu Kyi, said he was being taken to the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, by members of the police and the military.\nHe said he was being detained under sedition laws - which carry a maximum punishment of life imprisonment -  although he was not told the exact charge.\n\"They don't like what I've been talking about. They are afraid of what I'm saying,\" he said.\nMany have also gone online to protest against the coup, but the military has now extended its temporary ban on Facebook to cover Twitter and Instagram too. \nTwitter declined to comment when asked by the BBC if it had seen a spike in new users or tweets from Myanmar.\nThe military overthrew Ms Suu Kyi's government after it claimed a November election won by the NLD was fraudulent, though the country's election commission said there was no evidence to back up these allegations. \nThe move has been met with global outrage. On Thursday, US President Joe Biden called on the military to \"relinquish power\" and release detained officials and activists. The US had already threatened severe sanctions on Myanmar.\nHowever, the military is seemingly undeterred, continuing down its path of consolidating power and appointing new ministers, says the BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head.\nThe UN Security Council also called on the military authorities in Myanmar to release Ms Suu Kyi and other detained leaders - but stopped short of condemning the coup.\nIn doing so, it has brought China and Russia behind a call for her release, in what our correspondent has described as a rare show of international unity.\nMyanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos.\nIt was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, leading to international condemnation and sanctions.\nAung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence.\nA government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh. \nIt triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community after she refused to condemn the crackdown or describe it as ethnic cleansing. \nShe has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the November 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.\nHave you been affected by recent events in Myanmar?

      "title": "Covid-19: Pub closures 'will waste 87 million pints of beer'",
      "text": "Up to 87 million pints of beer will be thrown away as a result of pub closures during Covid lockdowns around the UK, an industry body has calculated.\nThe British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) called the waste - equivalent to \u00a3331m in sales - \"heartbreaking\".\nChief executive Emma McClarkin urged the government to give publicans more help in the Budget, including extending the VAT cut for the hospitality sector.\nThe Treasury said keeping businesses going was its \"priority\".\nBarrelled beer not sold by its best-before date has to be returned to breweries and disposed of.\nFor pasteurised beers - including most lagers - this is usually about three to four months after delivery to pubs.\nFor real ales and other unpasteurised beer, the timescale is normally around six to nine weeks.\nThe BBPA has worked out, from industry feedback, that 70 million pints of beer were thrown away during the first lockdown.\nWith publicans more alert to the risk of wastage - and amid ongoing restrictions imposed on large parts of the UK - they bought less stock after reopening.\nThis meant that, when further lockdowns occurred around the UK last autumn, seven million pints were wasted, with another 10 million expected to go the same way during the current one, the BBPA found.\nSources: New South Wales Irrigators' Council, bestkettles.co.uk, Bathbarn.co.uk\nBefore the pandemic, the number of pubs in the UK had started rising slightly, following many years of decline.\nBut the difficulties since then mean many of the 39,000 premises operating at that point have closed or are \"struggling\", Ms McClarkin told the BBC.\n\"Pubs and breweries are effectively having to pour their businesses down the drain,\" she said.\nThe licensed trade was \"in limbo\", with \"no idea or clarity from government on when we can reopen again\", she added.\nGarry Tallent, landlord of the Red Lion in Chobham, Surrey, did up his pub at a cost of around \u00a3330,000 last year and estimates he has lost \u00a320,000 in stock during lockdowns, \u00a36,000 of that in beer.\n\"The government has got to give some real fiscal stimulation to get us through this,\" he said.\n\"We're all fighters in this trade but we've been through a year of grief through no fault of our own.\"\nMr Tennant employs 16 staff, whose pension contributions he has continued to pay. His total losses since the pandemic could total \u00a3130,000 by the time pubs reopen, he said.\nMs McClarkin asked Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep the current 5% VAT rate for the hospitality industry - down from the usual 20% - in place after pubs reopen, arguing that venues closed during lockdowns have not been able to benefit from it yet.\nThe business rates holiday - due to finish at the end of this financial year - should also be extended in the Budget, on 3 March, she added.\nA Treasury statement said the hospitality sector was receiving \"significant support\", including one-off grants worth up to \u00a39,000, monthly grants of up to \u00a33,000, and a \u00a31,000 grant that was provided to pubs not serving food at the time during tiered restrictions when so-called \"wet pubs\" were forced to close. \n''We've also extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, provided 100% relief on business rates, and have cut VAT for hospitality businesses,\" they added.\n\"At the upcoming Budget we'll outline the next stages of our plan for jobs to support businesses and families across the UK. That has been our priority throughout the past year and it will be the priority for the year to come.\""

      "text": "All Piers says he wants to do is go to school every day. He does not even want a holiday -  just school, school and more school.\nBut Piers, who lives with a form of autism, has not been able to finish the final year of his maths GCSE full-time in the classroom with his friends and teachers because of lockdown.\n\"I really love school,\" said the 18-year-old. \"It's my favourite thing.\"\nBut Piers, like some of his friends, has only been in class one day a week.\nThe head teacher at his south Wales school, for children with special educational needs, says that while missing large parts of their education has the \"biggest impact\" on children with additional needs, school is a \"safety net\" for both pupils and their families.\nAnd how Piers, who also has learning difficulties and sensory issues, has missed being in the classroom and around familiar faces.\n\"I don't want a holiday at all this year,\" he said.\n\"I just wanted to go to school every day. I only get to do one day a week as it is my final year.\"\nHe has struggled with home-schooling because of his \"sleeping issues\" - and the strict lockdowns in Wales have not just affected Piers' education but his mood too.\n\"I'm not able to go out and my mental health is deteriorating,\" said Piers, who lives in Monmouth.\n\"I've been very upset and sobbing every day. I've a sweet tooth and wanting to eat lots of chocolate.\n\"I love going to school because it is learning - you are made to do work - because when I'm at home I want to sleep all of the time. I'd rather be kept on my toes and be busy.\"\nPiers' story is one of how a student with additional educational needs is dealing with the uncertain challenges of a global health emergency.\n\"School for some of our children is the safety net, not only for the children but for the families,\" said Bethan Moore, acting head of Crownbridge Special School in Cwmbran.\n\"Sometimes it's just a bit of respite for the children to come to school.\"\nAbout 20 of Crownbridge's 116 pupils have been going into school during lockdown while the rest remain at home and have been offered remote learning.\n\"It was kind of annoying at first, with the mask and because of Covid you can't do things,\" added Piers' school friend Amy, 19, who is also studying for a GCSE in maths.\n\"But I haven't found it that bad as we've done some fun things.\"\nAmy's mum Caroline, from Monmouth, said her daughter, who has autism, \"thrived\" in school as it \"brings out the best in her\".\n\"Since lockdown it has been particularly difficult,\" she said.\n\"But the school has made great efforts to engage with Amy at home and in school which is really important because Amy needs that routine, the teachers have made it fun.\n\"The online learning experience is new but it has taught her some new skills so the blended-learning approach has been positive.\"\nCrownbridge, like all schools across the UK, has had to rapidly adapt to challenge of continuing education and mitigating the risks of Covid-19.\n\"Our teacher will send learning packs home each week with targets,\" said teaching assistant Megan Israel.\n\"The parents then send the work back and we put it in the children's folders to ensure the children are not missing out.\"\nThe \"blended learning approach\" is also applied to physio and exercise targets for pupils with more acute and physical needs.\nBut Ms Israel said it was important some pupils could attend school to use the specialist equipment \"to meet their needs\".\nTeachers have worked closely with physiotherapists and speech and language therapists to ensure support is provided to families at home.\n\"We are concerned about the dip in their progress,\" added Ms Moore.\n\"But as far as Crownbridge concerned, we've been really good at working as a tight team, providing support for pupils and families who are blended learning at home.\"\nWelsh Government guidance on Covid measures allows for \"a practical and flexible approach\" for children with special educational needs.\nThe school has established small contact groups and intensified cleaning on site and some facilities are shut, like their hydro pool or the hall where pupils would undergo physiotherapy.\nSocial distancing, masks and other coronavirus prevention measures can be more difficult to implement in schools like Crownbridge where many children have difficulty communicating and need physical interaction.\nStaff wear face coverings around the school but Ms Moore says it becomes more difficult when they interact with the children \"who rely on the mouth and the speech and language to communicate\". \nThe Welsh Government has pledged to vaccinate special school staff who provide intimate personal care for children - and Crownbridge's staff are waiting for their Covid jabs.\nWhile there are limited numbers of children coming into school, they also provide opportunities for their pupils to learn from home, whatever their needs.\nTeacher Bethan Stokes has teenagers Elliot and Shay in class doing some sensory maths by singing a song about numbers and asking them to use a fly swat to splat piles of cream with different amounts of cherries on the top.\nAfter the excitement of making a mess in the classroom, they go to the sensory room to let off some steam.\n\"We try to keep it as normal as possible,\" said Ms Stokes.\n\"It's really difficult because obviously the children know things aren't normal because of the circumstances. I'm so proud of how they're coping.\""

      "tags": "Germany,Sweden,Russia,Alexei Navalny,Vladimir Putin,Poland",
      "text": "Russia has expelled three diplomats from Germany, Sweden and Poland for joining protests in support of opposition activist Alexei Navalny, who was jailed earlier this week. \nThe Russian foreign ministry said the three took part in \"illegal demonstrations\" on 23 January. \nThe diplomats' home countries have condemned the expulsions, as have the UK, France and the EU. \nMr Navalny is a vociferous critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nThe expulsions were announced just a few hours after EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. \nHundreds of thousands of people took part in protests in support of Mr Navalny across Russia on 23 and 31 January. Thousands were arrested.\nGermany denounced the expulsion as being \"in no way justified\" and said it would not \"go unanswered\" if Russia did not reconsider. \nSweden said the claim that its diplomat took part in the protest on 23 January was unfounded and said it reserved the right to an appropriate response. \nPoland said the expulsion could lead to the \"further deepening of the crisis in bilateral relations\".\nMr Borrell, on behalf of the EU, said he \"strongly condemned this decision and rejected the allegations that they conducted activities incompatible with their status as foreign diplomats\".        \nHowever, Mr Lavrov said any European sanctions over Mr Navalny's treatment would be illegitimate. \nBoth Germany and Poland said they had summoned their respective Russian ambassadors to express concern over the expulsions - a move that could possibly lead to tit-for-tat measures and more diplomats being sent home. \nRussia could have expelled these European diplomats any day: the pro-Navalny protest they supposedly joined was two weeks ago. But the foreign ministry chose to make the announcement with Josep Borrell in town. \nThe timing was clearly meant to send a message: you can lecture us on human rights and freedom, but we'll do what we want and really don't care what you think. The ministry even had a prepared riposte to condemnation of the mass arrests of protesters: it handed over a video compilation of police violence in the US and Europe. \nSergei Lavrov is an old hand at this. He's been communicating indifference and defiance since the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the sanctions that followed. International pressure didn't alter Russia's behaviour there. It's preparing to handle the \"Navalny issue\" the same way.\nMr Navalny, 44, is a political activist who has campaigned against corruption and Mr Putin since 2011. \nLast August he was poisoned with a nerve agent in eastern Russia and taken to Germany for treatment. He returned home at the end of January, despite warnings from the Russian government that he would be arrested. \nHe was then jailed for three-and-a-half years for what prosecutors said was a violation of the terms of a suspended sentence for fraud in 2014. A year was later deducted from his sentence for time served under house arrest.\nMr Navalny accuses Mr Putin of running an administration riddled with corruption and of organising the poison attack that nearly killed him. \nShortly after his return to Russia, Mr Navalny released a YouTube video featuring an opulent Black Sea palace which, he alleged, was a Russian billionaires' gift to the president. More than 100 million people have watched the video.\nMr Putin has denied ownership. Last week Arkady Rotenberg, a billionaire businessman close to Mr Putin, came forward to say he bought the palace two years ago.\nMr Navalny will be back in court on 12 February on charges of defaming a World War Two veteran.

Properties that were perfect a year ago are often no longer what people want as work and life priorities have been turned upside down.\"\nLucy Pendleton, of estate agent James Pendleton, said it was sellers, not buyers, who were a little quieter at the moment. \n\"A lot of people with children have decided against listing their property for sale while they're home-schooling and their home looks like a bomb has hit it.\"\nBut she said there were still plenty of first-time buyers looking and \"we always see a rush of activity after spring has sprung when people's gardens start to look better\"."

Snow carried by high winds built up around the vehicles and filled the road. \nRoads company Bear NW Trunk Roads said there were drifts of snow 2m (6ft) deep on the A835.\nRoads crews, emergency services and Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Team assisted in the rescue effort.\nThe road was cleared enough to allow the vehicles to be moved on Friday morning. No-one was injured.\nA driver and five passengers on a coach were among those caught up in the incident.\nCoach passenger Andy Pyott, who was trying to return home from work, said it became clear by about 22:00 that the bus would not be able to make it through the snow to Inverness.\nHe said: \"The snow building up around the bus was quite remarkable. There must have been about three feet of snow in front of the bus.\n\"All praise to the driver. He really kept everyone's spirits up.\"\nJordan Clark, from Renfrew, who was in the Highlands working, was in another vehicle trapped in snow for 14 hours.\nMountain rescuers, assisted by excavators, dug Mr Clark's vehicle free and he was able to get to Ullapool.\nHe said: \"The wind was blowing 55mph and I've never seen snow so thick.\"\nMr Clark praised welfare centre volunteers for the help they had given him and others.\nThe Met Office has an amber warning for snow in place until Saturday morning. It also has yellow \"be aware\" warnings for snow and ice for the weekend and Monday.\nThere were concerns earlier this week about the impact of the poor weather on Covid-19 vaccinations.\nOn Friday, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said roads around vaccination centres would be treated as a priority. He said he did not anticipate the weather would have a serious effect on the vaccination programme.\nPolice said \"multi-agency efforts\" ensured people in communities affected by the A835 closure were able to attend vaccination appointments.\nA number of homes have been left without power due supply faults in parts of Skye, Lewis, north west and central Sutherland, and near Inverness.\nSSEN said the problems affected about 100 properties and engineers were working to restore supplies. \nNetwork Rail Scotland said drifting snow had caused disruption to services on the Highland Mainline on Friday morning despite snow ploughs operating overnight. \nThe Met Office said the deepest accumulations of snow would be over high ground, with as much as 50cm (19in) of new snow in some places.\nThe Scottish Avalanche Information Service has rated the potential avalanche hazard in the Northern and Southern Cairngorms as \"high\".\nThe avalanche hazard in four other areas - Lochaber, Torridon, Creag Meagaidh and Glen Coe - has been rated \"considerable\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Welsh government,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales is \"not yet in a position\" to allow all pupils to return to school, the education minister has said. \nKirsty Williams confirmed three-to-seven year olds would be back from 22 February, along with some older children on vocational courses. \nBut no timetable has yet been given for the return of other children.\nHowever, Anglesey council's leader said schools on the island could remain shut unless \"frightening\" Covid transmission rates reduced significantly.\nMs Williams added there were no plans to vaccinate teachers ahead of other priority groups, as Wales recorded its highest daily jab total.\n\"Sadly, we are not yet in a position to be able to see a full return to school for every learner,\" Ms Williams said. \nShe said the fall in Covid-19 case numbers since December meant there was \"sufficient headroom for us to bring back some of our learners in a phased, flexible and progressive way\".\nThe announcement also means apprentices and \"licence to practice\" vocational learners will also be allowed to return to college.\nThe case rate for Wales has fallen to 130 cases per 100,000 people, according to the latest Public Health Wales figures. \nThe reproduction (R) number, which is the estimated number of people subsequently infected by each new coronavirus case, was between 0.7 and 0.9, Dr Chris Jones, Wales' deputy chief medical officer said.\nHe said cases were lower now than at any time when schools were open.  \nTeaching staff will now be tested twice weekly for Covid, and \u00a35m will be spent on face coverings and other equipment.\nMs Williams added: \"We have prioritised our youngest learners because of the favourable evidence on transmission in younger children, and also because we know they find it difficult to learn remotely.\n\"I must be absolutely clear - we are told time and time again that our education premises are safe, but it is the added movement around them that contributes to the R number.\"\n\"[But] by following the guidance restricting contact with others, we are ensuring children and young people are able to do what we all want, which is to be back learning with their friends.\"\nShe also urged parents to stick to all social-distancing rules when they took their children to and from school.\nDr Jones added \"the evidence is still very strong\" that transmission rates among young children were low.\n\"They do not get severe forms of the disease and they do not tend to transmit it as much as adults or even older teenagers,\" he said.\nMs Williams said she hoped to give details about when older students could return at the next review of Wales' coronavirus restrictions on 19 February.\nThe seven-day Covid-19 case rates up to 30 January showed rates falling in every Welsh council area apart from Anglesey, where the rate of new cases per 100,000 people rose from 139.9 to 141.3.\nAnglesey council leader Llinos Medi told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS): \"Last summer we decided not to open schools at the same time as the rest of Wales following an outbreak at 2Sisters in Llangefni and I will do the same thing again if we're not comfortable that it's safe to do so.\n\"I want everyone to know that the safety of children and the school sector is at the forefront of our minds.\"\nThe Welsh Government said it expected to see pupils returning from 22 February but it would be \"done in a phased and progressive way\".\nIt said schools \"may want to be flexible in organising their timetable\" for children and would consult parents.\nIt said it expected all foundation-aged children to have been in school before 26 February.\nThe Welsh Government said under the current circumstances punitive measures, including fines, would not be appropriate.\nIt said some authorities might deem it necessary to pursue \"a small number of cases relating to persistent absence\" which were unrelated to the pandemic and where there were concerns about the welfare of the child. \nEithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: \"Allowing the youngest pupils to return to the school environment that is so important to their development is a sensible first step towards seeing schools in Wales fully reopen.\n\"We do remain concerned that, although the overall figures are positive, there are still parts of Wales with significantly higher rates of infection than others and urgent consideration should be given to a more nuanced approach to bringing pupils back in those areas.\"\nMeanwhile, the NEU Cymru union said it expected to meet the Welsh Government next week to \"ensure robust mitigation measures are put in place\" to protect staff. \nMs Williams said the Welsh Government would also outline further plans in the \"short, medium and long term\" to help pupils catch up on lost education. \nShe said the government was \"particularly worried about our more disadvantaged children\" but did not provide any further detail or timescales.\nShe said more than 1,000 teachers and teaching assistants had already been hired \"as extra members of staff supporting our children\".\nSally Holland, Children's Commissioner for Wales, said she was \"relieved that the country is now able to take the first step on the road to recovery\".\n\"Within the last two weeks, we've consulted with nearly 20,000 children and young people. Every age group - from three to 18 - have expressed strong negative feelings about the impact of the pandemic on their lives,\" she said.\nMs Williams said teachers and local authorities had done an \"excellent job\" in making sure school premises were safe. \nDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of teachers union NASUWT said enhanced safety measures had to be in place for any wider school reopening in Wales.\nHe added current measures did \"not go far enough\" and recommended measures, such as the use of rotas, to help with social distancing, using face coverings more in schools and more protection for vulnerable staff.\nHe also called for all staff expected to be teaching from 22 February to be given priority access to vaccinations.\nMs Williams said teachers would not be vaccinated ahead of other priority groups, despite calls for them to moved up the queue. \nExperts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended nine groups go first, starting with NHS staff and the over-80s.\nMs Williams said it would be \"strange\" for the Welsh Government to ignore the advice of the JVCI. \nMore than 523,000 people have now received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Wales - which is about one in six people. \nAllyson Whitticase, head teacher at Rhiw-bechan Primary in Powys, said: \"We have to have a phased return so we can get our risk assessments in place, so wherever you start [in age], we have to start at some place.\"\nMs Whitticase said that with 350 pupils of key workers or in vulnerable categories already back at school, \"staff anxiety is really high at the moment\".\nShe added: \"Obviously staff would like vaccinations but at the end of the day none of us want a vaccination above other vulnerable individuals. But I think we would like to be reassured we are safe.\"\nHowever, the teacher, who is also mother to three secondary-aged children, said she would have preferred to hear children preparing for exams to return first.\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there was \"absolutely nowhere near enough\" extra teachers being hired. \n\"We know from the evidence that the potential impact on this Covid generation will last potentially through their entire lives,\" he said.\n\"So we need to get those new teachers and new teaching assistants into schools now, and we need to be creative - why not volunteers, suitably accredited, as part of a national mission on literacy and numeracy?\"\nWelsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said ministers should clarify if unions had agreed it was safe for their members to return. \nHe said: \"We've been here before back in the summer term, when schools were reopening - the minister had one ambition, and unions had another ambition, and in the end the schools stayed shut.\n\"We don't want to see that being repeated after February half-term.\""

      "text": "US country singer-songwriter Jim Weatherly, best known for writing 1970s hit Midnight Train to Georgia, has died aged 77.\nWeatherly passed away at his home near Nashville, Tennessee, on Wednesday.\nMusic publisher and friend Charlie Monk said the family attributed his death to natural causes.\nSinger Gladys Knight, who had a number one hit with Midnight Train to Georgia with her backing group The Pips, said he had been \"a sweetheart\".\nBorn in Mississippi in 1943, Weatherly released nearly a dozen studio albums during his five-decade career.\nIn his student years, the singer was a gifted quarterback for the University of Mississippi's American football team.\nBut later in the 1960s he decided to leave sport and focus on music in Los Angeles.\nMidnight Train to Georgia was recorded by Gladys Knight and the Pips in 1973. It went on to win a Grammy Award, and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.\nA number of American artists, including Aretha Franklin, later recorded their own versions of the popular song.\nWeatherly's biggest solo success was 1975's I'll Still Love You. He also penned more Gladys Knight hits, including Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye) and You're the Best Thing (That Ever Happened to Me).\nHe recorded with a range of high-profile stars, including Neil Diamond, Kenny Rogers, Garth Brooks and Kenny Chesney.\nWeatherly was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2006 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\"I'm missing him already,\" Gladys Knight said in a statement published by the Jackson Clarion Ledger. \"I love him and always will. He was about life and love and he wrote it so simply, he grew my love for country music.\n\"When we were with him it was like we'd always been together, we fit together. He started playing his guitar, and I started humming and it was magic.\n\"His music propelled us to a whole different level,\" Knight continued. \"I loved him and his music, he was a sweetheart and so gentle.\n\"We were just made for each other. At that time African Americans weren't into country music and he really helped us know it and love it.\"\nCountry singer Bryan White paid his own tribute on Twitter, remembering Weatherly as \"a HoF [Hall of Fame] songwriter with a massive catalogue of hit songs spanning 4 decades\".\nSinger BJ Thomas echoed those sentiments, saying he had been \"one of the great ones\" and had \"wrote some beauties\".\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The owner of Cadbury is set to return more of its Dairy Milk production to its historic Bournville factory.\nMondelez International - which owns the chocolate brand - said some production in continental Europe would return to the UK.\nAnnouncing a \u00a315m investment at the Birmingham site, the company said from 2022, 125 million more Dairy Milk bars would be manufactured there.\nBournville village was built by the Cadbury brothers in the 1870s. \nMondelez' UK managing director Louise Stigant said Bournville was still considered the \"heart of Cadbury\" and bringing more Dairy milk production back \"home\" offered an opportunity to invest in the plant. \nUntil now, about two thirds of Cadbury's chocolate has been made in Birmingham, and the company said the new investment would see \"almost all\" of its products made at Bournville.\nAbout \u00a311m of the new funding will go towards a new production line.\nThe remaining \u00a34m will be spent increasing its chocolate-making capacity.\nLast year, Bournville produced 35,000 tonnes of Cadbury Dairy Milk tablets - about 234 million bars - and this investment will allow them to make an additional 12,000 tonnes of chocolate.\nSome production will remain overseas, Mondelez said, and the firm also confirmed the investment would not lead to the creation of any new jobs.\n \"At a time when manufacturing in the UK is facing significant challenges, it has never been more vital to secure the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of our business,\" Ms Stigant added.\nJoe Clarke, national officer for Unite, said the decision meant the long-term security of the site was now \"very positive\".\n\"It's exceptional news as a proud Brummie who's looked after the site Cadbury site for a number of years, it's always good to see job security, investment and more products coming back to the UK and in particular Birmingham,\" he said.\n\"It's the home of Cadbury Dairy Milk and I think it's welcome to be having this increase in volumes with the increase in demand for chocolate under the present times we are enduring.\"\nMondelez, which owns other brands including Toblerone and Milka, is one of the largest chocolate, biscuit and coffee producers in the EU.\n\"Bournville is now much more competitive across our manufacturing network, particularly when it comes to producing high volume products such as Cadbury Dairy Milk tablets,\" Bournville manufacturing director, Roberto Gambaccini, said.\n\"It's important that we continue this journey and this investment will see us take full advantage of the efficiencies that modernisation, and upskilling can create to continue the growth and success of the Bournville site.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination",
      "text": "Hundreds of teachers in London have been able to book Covid vaccine slots despite not being in the top priority groups, after they were forwarded messages intended for NHS workers.\nA booking link and passcode meant for staff at Barts Health NHS Trust were circulated via Whatsapp to staff at local schools, teachers told the BBC.\nSome have received a jab as a result.\nThe trust said it was investigating and will take steps to improve the security of its booking system.\nThe government told the BBC's Newscast podcast in a statement it was \"absolutely critical that vaccines are offered in the priority order\".\nTeachers at schools in north and east London - including in Hackney, Camden and Barnet - said the messages had been sent via school management and were spreading in WhatsApp groups with dozens of members.\nNewscast found that it was still possible to book an appointment using the information in the messages on Thursday evening.\nOne teacher who booked an appointment, and who asked to remain anonymous, said it was \"not a case of trying to jump the queue\".\n\"When the appointment was confirmed I was surprised, thinking that it would have been refused if teachers were not actually entitled to these vaccines,\" they said.\n\"The conflicting and changing guidance from the government made me feel like it was possible that this was a genuine offer for teachers that had just not been passed on.\"\nThey added: \"Obviously, teachers will only have the vaccine when it is made available to us.\"\nAnother teacher said they, too, were surprised to find they could book an appointment.\n\"I thought this must be a local ad hoc way of avoiding wasting vaccines that hadn't been taken up. But I did some research and concluded this wasn't right,\" the teacher said.\n\"I think the problem is that people think this is genuine and don't think it's a loophole, but a local policy. It's not malicious or about queue-jumping.\"\nBarts Health NHS Trust confirmed that a booking link for its own employees was forwarded to local school staff and that this should not have happened.\nIt said it was investigating the source of the messages and measures were being put in place to make the booking system more secure.\nIt said anyone attending an appointment who is ineligible to do so would be turned away and that members of the public should not book an appointment until they have been contacted directly by the NHS.\nIn a statement, the trust said that it was vaccinating frontline staff and their relatives - where relevant - in line with national guidance.\n\"To avoid waste, any unfilled vaccination slots are offered to other staff working within our hospitals,\" it said.\nIt comes after reports that Rochdale Borough Council in Greater Manchester wrote to head teachers accusing some school staff of trying to get jabs via an \"inappropriately shared\" email.\nVaccination centres in Rochdale will now require people to show proof of employment in order to prevent people from being able to circumnavigate the system.\nThe leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, warned that anyone who had received a vaccine under those circumstances would be investigated and appropriate action taken to ensure that vaccines are given to those in greatest need.\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday, Sir Richard said some people were \"fiddling the system, using other people's links to get access\".\n\"People should not go before they are called to go as you are taking a slot away from someone in greater need,\" he said.\n\"If people are gaming the system, if they are using other people's names, and they are not in priority groups, they are denying somebody at greater risk a vaccine and given the primary objective of this first half of the first phase is to save lives and take the pressure off our hospitals, they are also undermining our efforts to do that.\"\nHe added: \"We will eventually be able to identify anyone who has had a vaccine ahead of their eligibility criteria.\"\nThe NHS is currently only offering vaccines to people within England's first four priority groups, in line with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidelines. \nThis does not include teachers, unless they also meet age or health-related criteria.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care said: \"It is absolutely critical that vaccines are offered in the priority order, as determined by the JCVI, and we expect everyone involved in vaccinations to follow this guidance closely.\"\n \"Vaccinating these groups first will save the most lives and provide the quickest and safest route out of the pandemic.\"\n Almost 10.5 million people in the UK have now received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the government's coronavirus dashboard, and more than 500,000 have received their second dose."

      "tags": "England local elections 2021,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "May's local and mayoral elections in England are going ahead - but voters will be asked to bring their own pens to help combat coronavirus.\nThe government is giving councils an extra \u00a331m for plastic screens in polling stations and hand sanitiser in an effort to make the polls Covid-safe. \nAnd people who are shielding will be encouraged to vote by post.\nBut an all-postal ballot has been ruled out, despite local fears the elections will be too difficult to organise.\nThe Cabinet Office has said the government plans to vaccinate all of the first nine priority groups - including the over 50s - by May, giving it confidence to press ahead with the elections.\nPolice and crime commissioner (PCC) elections will also go ahead on 6 May in both England and Wales. Welsh local council elections are scheduled to take place next year. \nScottish Parliament and Welsh Senedd elections are also scheduled to take place this May - with the devolved governments responsible for running them.\nThe government had previously said the local elections for England, scheduled for 6 May, were under review amid uncertainty about lockdown restrictions.\nBut Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith confirmed on Friday they will go ahead, arguing \"democracy should not be cancelled because of Covid\".\nMay will see a bumper crop of voting, with local elections that were postponed last year combined with those originally scheduled to take place in 2021.\nIt means around 5,000 council seats will be contested in 149 local authorities in England, alongside 25 seats in the London Assembly, and some mayoral races. \nParticipation in local elections varies between years depending on which seats are up for grabs - around 7.5 million took part in England's elections in 2018, and 6.5 million in 2017.\nAs well as being asked to bring their own pen or pencil to mark their ballots, those voting in a polling station this year will have to wear a mask. \nCandidates are also being asked not to give voters a lift to polling stations in their cars - a common practice at election time.\nPolling booths must also be designed to ensure \"maximum ventilation\", the government says.\nRules on proxy voting - where people designate someone else to vote on their behalf - will also be changed to allow people who need to self-isolate to request an emergency proxy vote up until 5pm on polling day.\nHowever, the government said it had decided against postal ballot-only elections \"as this could increase fraud risk and reduce choice for voters\".\nAn extra \u00a315m will be given to English councils to hold their elections, with an estimated additional \u00a316m for PCC elections in England and Wales. \nIn a break with tradition, councils are also being asked not to use schools as polling stations in a bid to minimise any further disruption to pupils' education. \nThere's been growing expectation that the government would stick to May for these elections after ministers signalled they were reluctant to move them. \nThe government's action plan, the extension to proxy voting, and the extra funding have all been welcomed - but they haven't allayed all concerns.  \nLogistically, there are still questions over whether enough suitable polling stations can be found, whether PPE should be supplied to staff who man them, and whether all the extra costs incurred by councils will be covered. \nPolitically, the big worry is the impact on campaigning. \nWith door-to-door visits limited, there's concern about how to engage voters, and what the effect of a shift to online campaigns might mean. \nCouncils are saying they'll crack on now and make these elections happen safely, but that's not without its challenges.  \nCouncillor John Fuller, Conservative leader of South Norfolk Council and chairman of the District Councils Network, said delaying the elections would have been the best option. \n\"It would have been better to have a poll conducted when everyone was vaccinated rather than a campaign started in lockdown, but we'll all pull together to make this work,\" he said.\nHe added that going ahead with elections in May would be \"challenging,\" but said he was \"relieved\" that the need for extra costs had been recognised by the government. \nLabour accused the government of being \"woefully unprepared,\" warning \"cash-strapped\" local councils were not being given necessary support. \nThe party's shadow minister for democracy, Cat Smith, called for dedicated funding to help local authorities sign people up to vote by post. \n\"Ministers are yet to respond to the challenge of recruiting polling and count staff, with so many workers needed as Covid marshals and for additional cleaning,\" she added. \nThe Liberal Democrats have complained about government guidance that it is not \"permissible\" for party activists to knock on doors or post leaflets during lockdown.\nA spokesman for the party accused ministers of trying to ban volunteer campaigning ahead of the polls, and called on them to \"urgently retract\" it.\n\"It cannot be right that it is legal for pizza delivery leaflets to come through your letterbox, but leaflets that criticise the government are not,\" they added.\n\"If putting your case to neighbours is banned, the election isn't fair.\"\nMinisters say they will publish specific guidance on face-to-face campaigning after consulting political parties."

Properties that were perfect a year ago are often no longer what people want as work and life priorities have been turned upside down.\"\nLucy Pendleton, of estate agent James Pendleton, said it was sellers, not buyers, who were a little quieter at the moment. \n\"A lot of people with children have decided against listing their property for sale while they're home-schooling and their home looks like a bomb has hit it.\"\nBut she said there were still plenty of first-time buyers looking and \"we always see a rush of activity after spring has sprung when people's gardens start to look better\"."

      "text": "The government is to update the law so that the attorney general can take six months' maternity leave.\nSuella Braverman, the government's chief law officer, announced in November she was expecting her second child \"early next year\".\nShe would be one of the most senior government ministers to give birth in office.\nUnder current laws, she would have to resign if she wanted to take time off following the birth.\nThe government has announced a new law to formalise the process for ministerial maternity leave, which until now has been at the discretion of the prime minister.\nThe Ministerial and other Maternity Allowances Bill will allow cabinet ministers to receive up to six months' leave on full pay. \nAt the moment, legislation from the 1970s means the prime minister does not normally have the flexibility to pay a cabinet minister maternity leave alongside paying a salary to their temporary replacement. \nThe bill would allow Ms Braverman and other cabinet ministers to take six months' leave on full pay - similar to more junior government roles and the civil service. \nSeveral female politicians serving as junior ministers have taken maternity leave in the past, including Conservative MPs Tracey Crouch and Kemi Badenoch.  \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would back the bill, adding the change \"should have been brought in a long time ago\".\nThe party's shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said the measures were a \"small but significant step forward\" but the government needed to go further and make provision for paternity, adoption and shared parental leave. \nIntroducing the new measures in a written statement, the prime minister said: \"The choice between taking leave to recover from childbirth and care for a new-born child or resigning from office is not acceptable in modern times.\"\nBoris Johnson acknowledged that provisions needed to be made for leave for adoption, sickness and other circumstances.\nMinisters aren't subject to normal employee rights because they're appointed, and fired, by the prime minister. \nMany will be surprised to learn that Suella Braverman will become the first cabinet minister to take paid maternity leave. \nIt's a generous scheme which will grant six months of full pay - under current rules, she would have had to resign or be demoted to qualify. \nThe bill is being rushed through Parliament because she's due to give birth soon, but Labour wants to revisit the issue later to include paternity leave.  \nThe years of muddling through on an informal basis will end next Thursday.                      \nMs Braverman, the Conservative MP for Fareham, became the second-ever woman to be appointed attorney general for England and Wales in February 2020. \nShe had previously served as a junior Brexit minister under Theresa May, before resigning in November 2018 in protest at the former PM's Brexit plans. \nShe went on to take maternity leave whilst serving as a backbench MP after the birth of her first child in July 2019, with a \"proxy MP\" taking part in parliamentary debates and votes on her behalf. \nAll MPs are paid in full while on maternity, paternity or adoption leave. But not all their duties in Parliament are covered during their absence:\nResponding to the change, Ms Creasy said: \"In no other workplace would guaranteed paid maternity leave and cover be only the preserve of the management.\n\"The introduction of cover for ministers is long overdue, and this legislation reveals the lie I was told when I asked for maternity cover that MPs employment status made it impossible.\"\nMs Creasy added: \"What message does it send to the thousands of pregnant women facing redundancy and job insecurity in the pandemic or any of those considering entering public life at any level, if parliament treats maternity leave as a bonus like a company car to be given only to those at the top?\""

we are told time and time again that our education premises are safe, but it is the added movement around them that contributes to the R number.\"\n\"[But] by following the guidance restricting contact with others, we are ensuring children and young people are able to do what we all want, which is to be back learning with their friends.\"\nShe also urged parents to stick to all social-distancing rules when they took their children to and from school.\nDr Jones added \"the evidence is still very strong\" that transmission rates among young children were low.\n\"They do not get severe forms of the disease and they do not tend to transmit it as much as adults or even older teenagers,\" he said.\nMs Williams said she hoped to give details about when older students could return at the next review of Wales' coronavirus restrictions on 19 February.\nThe seven-day Covid-19 case rates up to 30 January showed rates falling in every Welsh council area apart from Anglesey, where the rate of new cases per 100,000 people rose from 139.9 to 141.3.\nAnglesey council leader Llinos Medi told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS): \"Last summer we decided not to open schools at the same time as the rest of Wales following an outbreak at 2Sisters in Llangefni and I will do the same thing again if we're not comfortable that it's safe to do so.\n\"I want everyone to know that the safety of children and the school sector is at the forefront of our minds.\"\nThe Welsh Government said it expected to see pupils returning from 22 February but it would be \"done in a phased and progressive way\".\nIt said schools \"may want to be flexible in organising their timetable\" for children and would consult parents.\nIt said it expected all foundation-aged children to have been in school before 26 February.\nThe Welsh Government said under the current circumstances punitive measures, including fines, would not be appropriate.\nIt said some authorities might deem it necessary to pursue \"a small number of cases relating to persistent absence\" which were unrelated to the pandemic and where there were concerns about the welfare of the child. \nEithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: \"Allowing the youngest pupils to return to the school environment that is so important to their development is a sensible first step towards seeing schools in Wales fully reopen.\n\"We do remain concerned that, although the overall figures are positive, there are still parts of Wales with significantly higher rates of infection than others and urgent consideration should be given to a more nuanced approach to bringing pupils back in those areas.\"\nMeanwhile, the NEU Cymru union said it expected to meet the Welsh Government next week to \"ensure robust mitigation measures are put in place\" to protect staff. \nMs Williams said the Welsh Government would also outline further plans in the \"short, medium and long term\" to help pupils catch up on lost education. \nShe said the government was \"particularly worried about our more disadvantaged children\" but did not provide any further detail or timescales.\nShe said more than 1,000 teachers and teaching assistants had already been hired \"as extra members of staff supporting our children\".\nSally Holland, Children's Commissioner for Wales, said she was \"relieved that the country is now able to take the first step on the road to recovery\".\n\"Within the last two weeks, we've consulted with nearly 20,000 children and young people. Every age group - from three to 18 - have expressed strong negative feelings about the impact of the pandemic on their lives,\" she said.\nMs Williams said teachers and local authorities had done an \"excellent job\" in making sure school premises were safe. \nDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of teachers union NASUWT said enhanced safety measures had to be in place for any wider school reopening in Wales.\nHe added current measures did \"not go far enough\" and recommended measures, such as the use of rotas, to help with social distancing, using face coverings more in schools and more protection for vulnerable staff.\nHe also called for all staff expected to be teaching from 22 February to be given priority access to vaccinations.\nMs Williams said teachers would not be vaccinated ahead of other priority groups, despite calls for them to moved up the queue. \nExperts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended nine groups go first, starting with NHS staff and the over-80s.\nMs Williams said it would be \"strange\" for the Welsh Government to ignore the advice of the JVCI. \nMore than 523,000 people have now received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Wales - which is about one in six people. \nAllyson Whitticase, head teacher at Rhiw-bechan Primary in Powys, said: \"We have to have a phased return so we can get our risk assessments in place, so wherever you start [in age], we have to start at some place.\"\nMs Whitticase said that with 350 pupils of key workers or in vulnerable categories already back at school, \"staff anxiety is really high at the moment\".\nShe added: \"Obviously staff would like vaccinations but at the end of the day none of us want a vaccination above other vulnerable individuals. But I think we would like to be reassured we are safe.\"\nHowever, the teacher, who is also mother to three secondary-aged children, said she would have preferred to hear children preparing for exams to return first.\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there was \"absolutely nowhere near enough\" extra teachers being hired. \n\"We know from the evidence that the potential impact on this Covid generation will last potentially through their entire lives,\" he said.\n\"So we need to get those new teachers and new teaching assistants into schools now, and we need to be creative - why not volunteers, suitably accredited, as part of a national mission on literacy and numeracy?\"\nWelsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said ministers should clarify if unions had agreed it was safe for their members to return. \nHe said: \"We've been here before back in the summer term, when schools were reopening - the minister had one ambition, and unions had another ambition, and in the end the schools stayed shut.\n\"We don't want to see that being repeated after February half-term.\""

      "text": "Hundreds of people have turned out for the funeral of a 13-year-old boy who was stabbed to death.\nOliver Stephens, known as Olly, died from his injuries on 3 January after being stabbed in Emmer Green in Reading. \nMourners threw roses as the funeral cortege made its way through Emmer Green past Olly's old schools and St Barnabas Church.\nA service has taken place at Reading Crematorium. \nSpeaking during the service Stuart Stephens, Olly's father, said it \"was the stuff of nightmares\" when \"a knock on the door shattered our lives\". \n\"No-one should have to receive news like this or deal with a situation as horrific,\" he said. \"But we are blessed, the time we shared with Oliver is our most precious gift.\" \nHe added: \"Oliver touched so many lives without either us or himself knowing it, we now know.\" \nA fundraising appeal for the teenager, who was autistic, has raised just over \u00a321,000. The money will go towards Olly's family, and partly towards knife crime charities, the appeal said. \nIn a statement, Highdown School, where Olly was a pupil, said the \"shock and disbelief continues to be felt\", and added many staff and students had received counselling arranged by the school. \n\"We know that many will need to continue to access these services in the weeks and months come,\" it added. \nSpeaking to the BBC Matt Rodda, MP for Reading East, described the day \"as very, very moving\". \nHe said: \"This has been the most awful tragedy both for Olly's family and to the wider community here.\n\"People have been genuinely deeply shocked by this awful incident.\" \nNikki Mitchell, BBC South home affairs correspondent \nMany of the hundreds of people who came out of their homes to pay their respects to Olly Stephens were children; his friends and his neighbours. \nMost wore red and were holding single red roses. Red was Olly's favourite colour. \nThe funeral cortege left his family's home just before 11:00, first passing his school, then driving along the local streets, and through Caversham Park Village.\nOlly's coffin was colourfully decorated. A floral rainbow, a cuddly toy and a packet of sweets could be seen through the back window of the hearse as it passed. \nAs the cortege approached Reading crematorium people threw single red roses onto the bonnet and clapped in his memory. There were tears and hugs.\nOfficers were called just before 16:00 GMT on 3 January to reports of a stabbing at the fields on the boundary of Emmer Green and Caversham Heights.\nThree teenagers have been charged with murder and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.\nThey all remain in youth detention custody and are due to face trial in June.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Parenting,Bristol,Pregnancy",
      "text": "A street that has been experiencing a lockdown baby boom with six women who are pregnant at the same time has welcomed its first new arrival.\nJenni Parkinson, from Bristol, gave birth earlier to daughter Summer.\nThe women all lived on the same side of Clouds Hill Avenue in St George, when they discovered they were pregnant.\nOne mother-to-be joked \"there must be something in the water\", while another said the road would be \"like a little festival\" when the babies were born.\nMs Parkinson's due date of 1 February was the earliest of the group, and she gave birth to Summer at Cossham Birth Centre in Bristol.\nIt is her second child with partner Ric Ventura. The couple's first child Skye is two-and-a-half. \nThe 37-year-old, who runs a community music organisation, said Clouds Hill Avenue now has its own \"ready-made community.\" \n\"There are lots of young couples starting families in the street because it's an amazing location. \n\"I think it's maybe a massive coincidence [so many women are pregnant]. Or maybe I started a trend?\" \nAilie Tam, the expectant mothers' yoga teacher, is due to give birth to her second child in August. She and her husband Ben already have a daughter, Eni. \nThe 36-year-old said: \"We feel very lucky because we only moved here last March and we were really hoping that the community would [be friendly] but until you move in you don't know.\n\"The decibels will be increasing in the springtime and the summertime when hopefully restrictions are lifted a bit more. It's going to be really fun.\" \nCatherine Gilmore, 31, is expecting her first baby with her partner Michael Malay.\nShe said there was a \"slow dawning\" on Clouds Hill Avenue that women were expecting, with hers due in May. \n\"There were women popping up every day - or it felt like it - saying they were pregnant. \n\"It's really lovely, particularly as a first-time mum, not having any of the baby groups or anything that would normally be happening at the time. \n\"It's really good having these families on the street and the babies that will be hanging out at the park. It'll be like a little festival out there, it's going to be great.\" \nCaroline Hardman, a 33-year-old physiotherapist, has a one-and-a-half year-old daughter called Ruth. She is expecting her second child with her husband Matt. \n\"We have been running, we have been baking bread, and we have been making babies\", he said of their lockdown.\nMs Hardman added: \"It started with just a couple [of expectant mothers] and then we found out we were expecting, and then I told Jenni and she said, 'that's really exciting, there's four of us!'\n\"Every time I spoke to one the number increased. \n\"So it was funny that every time you said I'm expecting a baby, it was: 'oh yeah, this person down the road is.'\" \nVictoria Bromley said she thought there was \"something in the water\" and said the good news contrasted with the harsh realities of the pandemic. \nShe is due to give birth in July and she and her husband David Hume already have a two-year-old son called Freddie. \n\"I think everyone came into 2021 hoping that it would be different, that there would be more positivity. And it certainly feels like that for us\", the 36-year-old said. \n\"I really feel for people who have had babies over the course of the last year. \n\"I think every mum would say maternity leave, even in normal times, can be very isolating. So I just can't even imagine those people who have had to go through it during lockdown.\"\nEllie Shipman found out she was pregnant while living on the street.\nShe said: \"You can't go out, you can't really see people as much, so maybe it's a time to settle down?\" \nThe 31-year-old artist has since moved but is still part of the community and is expecting her first baby with husband Alex Blogg. \n\"I think it's just a message of life going on amongst the bleakness of the situation we are in\", she said. \n\"We'll be really excited to meet all the little ones as they arrive throughout the year.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "All adults aged 50 and over should have been offered a coronavirus vaccine by May, Downing Street has confirmed.\nPreviously ministers had said it was their \"ambition\" to vaccinate the first nine priority groups by the spring.\nThe UK had given a first jab to nearly 11 million people as of Thursday and is aiming to reach 15 million vaccinations by 15 February.\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said a lot of things would \"have to go right\" to hit the May target for all over-50s.\nHe said supply was the \"most difficult\" limiting factor in the roll out. \nBut he said the government was on track to vaccinate the first four priority groups by the middle of the month, these include the over-70s, frontline health and care workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable.\nThe top nine priority vaccination groups - which are set by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - also includes people aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions.\nMr Hancock also said it was \"still too early to say\" when restrictions could be lifted and warned the health service was still under pressure. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said, in a Twitter video, that on 22 February he would \"set out the beginnings of our roadmap for a way forward for the whole country as the vaccine programme intensifies and, as more and more people acquire immunity, a steady programme for beginning to unlock\".\nHe also warned that these were still \"early days\" and rates of infection in the country were \"still very high\".\nIt comes after Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group made up of Conservative MPs who want lockdown to be eased, said it would be \"almost impossible to justify having any restrictions in place\" once the over-50s had been vaccinated.\nProf Graham Medley, who is a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, earlier said the government should avoid \"setting dates\" for lifting lockdown and focus on criteria, such as case rates, rather than a calendar.\nA further 1,014 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Friday, taking the total by that measure to 111,264. \nThere have been 19,114 more positive cases of coronavirus recorded, while another 480,560 people received their first dose of a vaccine - taking the total to 10,971,047 across the UK.\nCoronavirus cases are showing clear signs of falling across the UK, the latest figures suggest, and the R number - the average number of people that someone with Covid will go on to infect - has dropped slightly to between 0.7 and 1.\nIn a press release confirming May's local elections will go ahead, the Cabinet Office said: \"The UK's vaccination programme is planned to have reached all nine priority cohorts by May, meaning that the government can commit to go ahead with these polls with confidence.\"\nBBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said, while the NHS has the staff, volunteers and clinics needed to vaccinate the 15 million people in the next priority groups, vaccine production was a biological process so there were no guarantees about how much could be grown.\nBut our correspondent said there was growing confidence in the UK supply chain, with the bulk of supplies now coming from UK-based plants, while the first batches of the Moderna vaccine - of which the UK has ordered 17 million doses - would start to arrive before Easter.\nBy Rachel Schraer, BBC health correspondent\nSo far, the falls in Covid cases and hospital admissions (about a fifth in a week respectively) are pretty much exclusively down to the effects of lockdown restrictions. \nBut soon, we'll start to see the impact of vaccination too - and we will expect to see more good news, particularly falls in deaths which are heavily concentrated in the over-80s.\nWhile deaths mainly occur in the over-80s, about 20% of hospital admissions are in 45-64-year-olds and another 20% in 65 to 74-year-olds. The latest commitment to vaccinate all over 50s could have a massive impact on severe illness and the strain it puts on the health service, too.\nBut the situation will remain precarious for a while. Cases, though falling, are still high - and despite a so-far successful vaccination campaign, large swathes of the country may still be unprotected come spring.\nThough much rarer, a proportion of younger, healthy people will end up in hospital with Covid, and we're only just beginning to learn about the burden of long Covid on the previously well young. \nSo once the groups at highest risk of ending up in hospital and dying have been vaccinated, the government will face difficult questions about what level of risk it is willing to stomach to ease restrictions, while a prolonged lockdown carries its own risks that might be currently difficult to measure. \nThe UK's drugs regulator, the MHRA, said the vaccines being distributed in the country were extremely safe, while new research shows the AstraZeneca jab protects well against the new \"Kent\" variant of Covid.\nEarlier on Friday, the government also announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac, which Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said would allow the UK to \"swiftly tweak and roll out\" existing vaccines to combat new variants, with 50 million doses placed in an initial order for later this year.\nThe government also said no contracts had yet been awarded to hotels to take part in England's new quarantine scheme, which will see all those arriving from 33 Covid hotspots have to stay in a hotel for 10 nights."

      "text": "Christopher Plummer, the distinguished Canadian actor best known for his role as Captain Von Trapp in The Sound of Music, has died at the age of 91.\nHe won an Oscar in 2012 for the film Beginners and was also nominated for The Last Station in 2010 and All the Money in the World in 2018.\nIn the latter film he replaced Kevin Spacey, whose performance as billionaire J Paul Getty was removed.\nHis many other films included The Man Who Would Be King and Knives Out.\nHe was a memorably villainous Klingon in the sixth Star Trek film and played TV anchorman Mike Wallace in 1999's The Insider.\nHe also played Sherlock Holmes in Murder By Decree and appeared with Peter Sellers in The Return of the Pink Panther.\nAccording to reports, Plummer died peacefully at his home in Connecticut with his wife Elaine Taylor at his side.\nLou Pitt, his long-time friend and manager of 46 years, remembered him as \"an extraordinary man who deeply loved and respected his profession\".\n\"He was a national treasure who deeply relished his Canadian roots,\" he continued. \"Through his art and humanity, he touched all of our hearts and his legendary life will endure for all generations to come.\n\"He will forever be with us.\"\nSound of Music co-star Dame Julie Andrews said in a statement to the PA news agency: \"The world has lost a consummate actor today and I have lost a cherished friend. \n\"I treasure the memories of our work together and all the humour and fun we shared through the years.\"\nThe Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, said he \"beguiled audiences across generations\".\nBafta added its condolences, praising his \"amazing work since the 50s\". \nThe official Twitter account for The Sound of Music posted its condolences:\nStar Trek actor George Takei called the actor a \"giant of stage and screen\", adding: \"Rest in eternal music, Captain Von Trapp.\"\nActor Eddie Marsan worked with Plummer on the 2016 film The Exception and said: \"It was like watching a master class. He had nothing to prove anymore so he was completely free, kind, funny mischievous and beautiful to watch. RIP.\"\nLord of the Rings star Elijah Wood, who worked alongside Plummer on animated film 9, expressed his condolences, adding: \"What a legend.\"\nPlummer had a varied career across film, television and theatre, starring in productions on Broadway and with the Royal Shakespeare Company.\nYet he will be forever known and loved for The Sound of Music, adapted from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. \nPlummer had ambivalent feelings towards his best-known film, which he famously renamed The Sound of Mucus in interviews.\nHe also likened working with Andrews to \"being hit over the head with a big Valentine's Day card, every day\", though they later became great friends.\nHe also became reconciled to the film itself, describing it in his 2008 memoir In Spite of Myself as being \"warm, touching, joyous and absolutely timeless\".\nBorn Arthur Christopher Orme Plummer in Toronto in December 1929, Plummer grew up in Montreal as an only child and was exposed to the arts by his mother at an early age.\nHe first studied the piano before devoting himself to acting, having decided that playing the piano professionally \"was very lonely and very hard work\".\nHe made his debut on the New York stage role in 1954's The Starcross Story alongside the actress Mary Astor. It ran for just one performance - but did not stop him landing more stage work and then leading roles.\nPlummer made his film debut in 1958's Stage Struck, directed by Sidney Lumet. He was nominated for a Tony the following year and eventually won the award in 1974 for playing Cyrano de Bergerac.\nHe won his second in 1997 for playing fellow actor John Barrymore in Barrymore.\nIn 2017 Plummer was asked by Ridley Scott to appear in All the Money in the World, which he had already completed with Spacey.\nFollowing the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Spacey, the film's makers decided against releasing the film with his original performance.\nPlummer shot his scenes in a matter of days and was subsequently nominated for an Oscar, a Bafta and a Golden Globe.\nScott and his wife Giannina paid tribute to Plummer, telling The Hollywood Reporter: \"What a guy. What a talent. What a life. And I was fortunate enough to work with him less than two years ago and had a wonderful experience. My heartfelt condolences go to [his wife] Elaine. He will be really missed.\"\nThe actor was married three times. He and his first wife Tammy Grimes, are the parents of actress Amanda Plummer.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Yemen,Houthis ,Saudi Arabia,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The US is to end its support for offensive operations by its allies in Yemen, which has been devastated by a six-year war in which more than 110,000 people are believed to have died. \n\"The war in Yemen must end,\" President Joe Biden said in his first major foreign policy speech.\nUnder Mr Biden's two predecessors, the US backed a coalition led by Saudi Arabia against Houthi rebels in Yemen. \nThe conflict has left millions of Yemenis on the brink of starvation. \nFighting began in 2014 between a weak Yemeni government and the Houthi rebel movement. It escalated a year later, when Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states - backed by the US, the UK and France - began air strikes against the Houthis.\nMr Biden announced other changes to US foreign policy, such as a significant increase in the number of refugees accepted by the US.\nHis speech marks a sharp break with the policies of former President Donald Trump, who left office last month. \nOn Russia, for instance, the new US leader said: \"I made it clear to President [Vladimir] Putin, in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions\u2026 are over.\"\nThe comments drew fierce criticism from the Kremlin. \"This is very aggressive, unconstructive rhetoric, to our regret,\" Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.\nThe US has been backing the Yemeni government and its Saudi-led allies in their war against the Houthis. As a result of Thursday's announcement, the US will stop supporting offensive operations, including the sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). \nThis will not affect operations against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. \nThe Biden administration had already put a temporary halt on arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. \nMr Biden is expected to name his new Yemen envoy as Tim Lenderking, an experienced diplomat and Middle East specialist.\nThis marks a change of tack from Mr Trump's administration, which increased support for the Saudi-led coalition. Last month Mr Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, announced that the Houthis were being designated a \"terrorist organisation\". \nHe said the aim was to hold the Houthis accountable for cross-border attacks and deter \"malign activity\" by their backer Iran.\nAid organisations criticised the move, warning that it could prevent them from operating in areas where millions are in urgent need of food aid. \nLast week, the Biden administration said it would exempt certain transactions involving the Houthis from sanctions. That exemption will expire on 26 February.\nThe United Nations says Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the population in need of aid or protection.\nThese announcements confirm President Biden's pledge to end Yemen's destructive war. Halting US support to the Saudi-led coalition's offensive operations won't close this bloody chapter, but it sends a strong signal to leaders in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi - they've also been trying to find ways to extricate themselves from this quagmire. \nAchieving peace among Yemen's bitter enemies will be a monumental challenge. Tim Lenderking is set to be the first US envoy for Yemen since this war was unleashed nearly six years ago. He's worked on this file for years and is known to everyone who matters. \nWestern diplomats, as well as Yemenis, have welcomed this new US engagement. In 2015, President Obama gave a green light to the Saudi-led campaign, partly to ease the Kingdom's anger over the Iran nuclear deal. Now new US envoys on Yemen, and Iran, are tasked with ending this war, and the regional rivalries which still fuel it.  \nThe US will raise the cap on refugee admissions from 15,000 to 125,000 for the fiscal year. \nThe withdrawal of US troops from Germany will be frozen and forces will remain at their current level of about 36,000. Under Mr Trump, the US was going to reduce its presence by 12,000, with about 5,600 to be deployed elsewhere in Europe. \nMr Biden called on Myanmar's military rulers to release civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and restore democracy. \nHe also promised to engage diplomatically with Russia but to be tougher on Moscow than Mr Trump, saying the US would not \"roll over\".

      "text": "The UK has ramped up its Covid vaccine booster campaign - part of an attempt to reduce the impact of the new Omicron variant, currently spreading rapidly across the world.\nWith nine in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK having had a single jab and eight in 10 having had a second, the country has shifted its focus to boosters, which have been shown to offer significant protection from hospitalisation.\nAlthough more than 37 million boosters, or third doses, have been given so far, the government is urging more people to come forward to help the country \"ride out\" the Omicron wave.\nThe vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two doses.\nIf you can't see the lookup, click here\nA booster campaign, originally targeted at people over 40 or belonging to a number of other vulnerable groups, has been extended to all over-16s. \nThe minimum gap between the second jab and booster dose has also been reduced from six to three months, to speed up the booster rollout process.\nThe government has begun easing \"Plan B\" restrictions in England, putting the reason for the move down to the success of the booster programme. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also begun rolling back measures, but people in all nations will still have to isolate after testing positive.\n Ministers are urging anyone who has not had a third, top-up jab to come forward.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises on vaccine policy, says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still have about 90% protection against hospitalisation.\nSo far, the UK has approved four vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen; three of which require two doses for maximum protection.\nThose receiving boosters will get one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna.\nThere is no vaccine currently approved for use in the under-12s.\nSo far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses.\nWhile uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. \nMore than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far.\nOverall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands.\nThe aim of the vaccination programme is to protect as many people as possible from serious illness through developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19.\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more than nine in 10 adults in the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine.\nHowever, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population.\nAcross the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme.\nScotland has vaccinated 92% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while Wales and England have reached 91% and Northern Ireland 89%.\nSecond doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far.\nAcross the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 86% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 69%.\nWhen looking at boosters, the South West has reached 67% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 44%.\nThere have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas.\nAnalysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine.\nThe study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.\nIn addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas.\nCurrently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. \nOthers, such as those produced by Novavax and Valneva, have not yet been given the green light.\nThe UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. \nIn addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. \nFrench vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved."

      "text": "Children aged three to seven will return to school after the February half-term, the Welsh Government is expected to confirm on Friday.\nMost pupils have been learning from home after a surge in Covid cases led to a Welsh lockdown.\nThe decision would mean the foundation phase of primary schools returning from 22 February.\nBut the head of one teaching union said they would not support the move without assurances about teacher safety. \nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams is expected to make the announcement at a lunchtime press conference on Friday.\nIt follows a fall in the number of infections, and negotiations with teaching trade unions, who have called for teachers to be in the priority list for vaccinations.\nThe Welsh Government had been under pressure to set out plans for a return to face-to-face teaching after weeks of lockdown.\nIt comes as other parts of the UK consider when children can return to face-to-face teaching.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said 8 March was the earliest date schools in England could reopen and that \"depends on lots of things going right\".\nIn Northern Ireland pupils will not return to school until 8 March at the earliest while Scotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 February as schools start a phased reopening.\nThe Covid case rate in Wales is currently the lowest of the UK nations.\nIt now stands at 126 per 100,000 people over seven days - a fall from about 700 before Christmas.\nEarlier, teachers' union NASUWT said a joint group of unions had given the Welsh Government a list of \"mitigations\" they wanted to see put in place.\nThey include strict social distancing, medical grade masks for teachers in the foundation phase and a \"further consideration of a flexible and phased return\".\nNeil Butler, its national officer in Wales, said on Friday the union would not support the return to school unless a number of those mitigations were taken on board. \nHe told BBC Radio Wales: \"We've got no indication of what's going to be changed in the operational guidance which fits into those mitigations that we want to see.\n\"If the operational guidance has taken nothing on board in terms of the joint union mitigation list then we're not going to be able to support this return on the 22nd.\"\nUcac general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young said there needed to be \"local flexibility to stagger the return of foundation phase children\".\n\"We'll also need clear guidelines about social distancing, the use of face-coverings, sufficient ventilation, and which staff are exempt from return and can continue to work from home.\n\"Above all, school staff need to hear that they figure in the government's priority list for vaccination, particularly those in the foundation phase where it is almost impossible to ensure social distancing.\"\nAll schools and colleges in Wales were told to move to online learning before the start of this term in an effort to \"suppress the virus\", Ms Williams said at the start of January.\nSome schools had been due to open in the new year but unions called for the return to be delayed amid concerns about a variant of coronavirus blamed for a rise in cases before Christmas.\nSchools and colleges have remained open for children of critical workers and vulnerable pupils, as well as for children who needed to complete essential exams or assessments.\nVictoria Rosser, a mother of four from Cwmbran, is on the shielding list and is yet to receive her first dose of the Covid vaccine. \nShe said she wants to be able to make the decision over whether it is safe for her children to return to the classroom. \n\"I have mixed emotions towards the decision being announced today,\" she said. \n\"I do not feel it's safe for parents and guardians, who've been placed on the shielding list like me, to send their children until phase one of the priority list are post-three weeks of receiving their vaccine. \n\"Parents are being crippled with having to balance their children's education, work and running a home. This is not home schooling, it's trying to accommodate three jobs at the same time, which is impossible in the long-term.\"\nMeanwhile, Chris Lawrence, who lives in Cardiff and has three children, said it was \"really important\" children get back to school as soon as possible. \nHe said: \"From my perspective what we've been doing in terms of shutting schools, we were always told it would be the last resort, but at the moment it's been adopted as the thing that we do. If your kids are at home then pretty much all parents have to be at home as well.\"\nSamantha Pearce from Blaenau Gwent, who's daughter Hazel is 10, said she didn't want to see year groups rushed back.\nBut she added: \"The prolonged closure of the schools is having a huge detrimental effect. Schools for us here in Blaenau Gwent have been already been closed for two months now - and children are bored an unengaged with the work.\"\nRachel Antoniazzi, who is deputy head at Thornhill Primary School in Cardiff, said getting children back into school would be a \"relief\" for parents and teachers, but there were also some concerns for staff. \nShe said: \"I do really honestly believe that the type of learning that foundation phase children are expected to do doesn't work very well from home. It puts a lot of pressure on parents, it's not conducive to the way foundation phase learners are expected to learn.\"\nMs Antoniazzi's school has been operating as a hub for children of key workers during the lockdown, and will continue to do so for the children in the upper years of the school, alongside reopening for the youngest pupils. \n\"In an ideal world we would love to welcome the whole school back but we have to be really careful,\" she said. \n\"I think the biggest fear, and the government have to be really clear on this, is that it's a necessity to reopen schools, but it doesn't mean we're back to normal. \n\"It's better than being at home but I do want parents to get the message that doesn't mean you can go to playdates.\"\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Si\u00e2n Gwenllian called for school staff and other key workers to be moved to the top of the list in each vaccination priority group.\n\"Parents, learners and staff need reassurance that the school environment is safe, and there are certainly things that can be done to give them confidence, such as more extensive use of ventilation, school workers moved to the top of their vaccine priority group, and schools must be given all options to enable adequate social distancing in classrooms. \n\"With a year of hindsight, it pains me to think how much more face-to-face education our children and young people could have had, if Welsh Government had used all the tools in their gift earlier.\"\nEducation spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives Suzy Davies welcomed the return but questioned the staggered approach.\nShe added: \"It's been a tough period for children, parents and teachers, and it makes sense for primaries to go back to catch up with each other; these youngest pupils have lost most in terms of learning and vital early-years socialisation.\n\"We need a can-do, will-do approach from ministers as teachers on the front line want to return to the classroom so long as it's safe to do so. \n\"They must now put plans in place for those critical secondary years, and to get in the maximum amount of learning to prepare our older learners for college and university with an even more dynamic, innovative, flexible and ultimately safe approach to secondary schools.\"\nThe first minister said the youngest pupils would be back in school if virus rates carried on falling.\nA week later, the indicators are going in the right direction, suggesting three to seven-year-olds will be back in classes on or soon after 22 February.\nBut this process feels different to the return after the summer or after the first lockdown.\nThe virus variants have added another layer of anxiety, and the approach is even more cautious.\nOlder primary pupils may have to learn from home for a while longer, and a return for secondary and college pupils, apart from those doing practical qualifications, still seems to be some way off.\nThe first easing of the strictest lockdown rules was last Saturday, when people were able to meet one other person from another household to exercise outside.\nBut people in Wales have been warned they are unlikely to see a \"radical and significant\" easing of the restrictions this month.\nThe health minister said there would need to \"continued\" reductions before the rules can be eased.\nVaughan Gething added any \"available headroom\" would be used to help children go back to school.\nThe next Welsh lockdown review is scheduled for 19 February."

      "tags": "Wind power,Denmark,Climate change,Wind turbines,European Union,Renewable energy",
      "text": "A project to build a giant island providing enough energy for three million households has been given the green light by Denmark's politicians.\nThe world's first energy island will be as big as 18 football pitches (120,000sq m), but there are hopes to make it three times that size. \nIt will serve as a hub for 200 giant offshore wind turbines.\nIt is the biggest construction project in Danish history, costing an estimated 210bn kroner (\u00a324bn; \u20ac28bn: $34bn).\nSituated 80km (50 miles) out to sea, the artificial island would be at least half-owned by the state but partly by the private sector. \nIt will not just supply electricity for Danes but for other, neighbouring countries' electricity grids too. Although those countries have not yet been detailed, Prof Jacob Ostergaard of the Technical University of Denmark told the BBC that the UK could benefit, as well as Germany or the Netherlands. Green hydrogen would also be provided for use in shipping, aviation, industry and heavy transport. \nUnder Denmark's Climate Act, the country has committed to an ambitious 70% reduction in 1990 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and to becoming CO2 neutral by 2050. Last December it announced it was ending all new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.\nEnergy Minister Dan Jorgensen said the country was simply \"changing the map\".\n\"This is gigantic,\" Prof Ostergaard told the BBC. \"It's the next big step for the Danish wind turbine industry. We were leading on land, then we took the step offshore and now we are taking the step with energy islands, so it'll keep the Danish industry in a pioneering position.\"\nGreen group Dansk Energi said that while the \"dream was on the way to becoming a reality\" it doubted the North Sea island would be up and running by the planned 2033 start date. \nBut Danish politicians across the spectrum have given their backing to the plan. Former energy minister Rasmus Helveg Petersen of the Social Liberal party said energy islands had begun \"as a radical vision\" but there was now a broad agreement to turn it into a reality.\nA smaller energy island is already being planned off Bornholm in the Baltic Sea, to the east of mainland Denmark. Agreements have already been signed for electricity to be provided from there to Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nLast November the European Union announced plans for a 25-fold increase in offshore wind capacity by 2050, with a five-fold increase by 2030. Renewable energy provides around a third of the bloc's current electricity needs:\nWhile there is some secrecy over where the new island will be built, it is known that it will be 80km into the North Sea. Danish TV said that a Danish Energy Agency study last year had marked two areas west of the Jutland coast and that both had a relatively shallow sea depth of 26-27m.\nFind out more about Denmark's wind power:"

      "tags": "Medicine,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer",
      "text": "Covid vaccines being given to millions of people in the UK are extremely safe, with mild expected side-effects, says the country's drugs regulator. \nIt assessed safety reports from nearly seven million doses given up to 24 January - mostly with the Pfizer jab.\nSome 22,820 suspected reactions were reported. Almost all were mild, such as a sore arm or flu-like illness.\nMeanwhile, new research shows the AstraZeneca jab protects well against the new 'Kent' variant of Covid.\nThis more contagious version of the virus is now dominant in much of the UK. \nHow worrying are the new coronavirus variants?\nOxford Scientists and AstraZeneca, like many other Covid vaccine developers, are working on updating their shots to make sure they are a good match as the virus continues to mutate. The UK Government has announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants.\nVaccines are seen as the way out of the pandemic, and all of the evidence so far suggests they are safe and effective.\nSide effects do occur, but overwhelmingly, are mild. They are not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. They usually get better within a couple of days, says the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.   \nSevere allergic reactions to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine can happen but are very rare - between one and two cases per 100,000 doses administered, experts estimate. The MHRA received received 101 allergy-related reports. \nDoctors already say people with a history of significant allergic reactions to ingredients in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should not receive it.  \nIn the UK, people can report concerns after having the vaccine to the MHRA's Yellow Card scheme.\nThe ones received by the agency - affecting around three in every 1,000 people vaccinated - so far reveal no unexpected serious reactions, which experts say should help reassure anyone who may be anxious about getting immunised. There is strong evidence that the vaccines will save lives and prevent severe illness. \nProf Sir Munir Pirmohamed, a doctor who has been assessing vaccine safety on behalf of the UK, said: \"It is extremely safe. The benefits far outweigh the risks. I say that to my family as well.\"\nMHRA chief executive Dr June Raine said: \"Safety is our watchword. It is vital that people continue to get their jab when they get the invitation.\"\nThe Yellow Card scheme is designed to pick up anything serious and some people might not report very mild symptoms.\nCommon reactions that may affect up to one in 10 people and typically get better within days include: \nAs expected when you track any population over time, there were some deaths - 143 were recorded among the millions vaccinated. This is not alarming or worrying, says the MHRA, or in any way linked to the vaccine. \nThe regulator also received 75 reports of facial paralysis or weakness, but this condition can occur naturally. The MHRA said: \"The number of reports of facial paralysis received so far is similar to the expected natural rate and does not currently suggest an increased risk following the vaccines. We will continue to monitor these events.\" \nIt will be publishing weekly updates on all the vaccine safety data it receives. "

      "tags": "China,Beijing,Uighurs",
      "text": "A senior member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has rejected criticism of its decision to host next year's Winter Games in China.\nMore than 180 organisations have called on governments to boycott Beijing 2022 because of reported human rights abuses against ethnic minorities.\nThe World Uyghur Congress described the event as \"a genocide Olympics\".\nChina's treatment of its own citizens has been the subject of mounting criticism across the world.\nBut Canadian Dick Pound - the longest serving member of the IOC - said barring athletes from participating in the event would be \"a gesture that we know will have no impact whatsoever.\"\n\"The Games are not Chinese Games, the Games are the IOC Games,\" he told the BBC. \"The decision on hosting is not made with a view to signalling approval of a government policy.\"\nComposed of groups representing Tibetans, Uighurs, residents of Hong Kong and others, the coalition of campaigners has issued a joint open letter calling for a boycott of the Games to \"ensure they are not used to embolden the Chinese government's appalling rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent\".\nHuman rights groups say the Chinese government has gradually stripped away the religious and other freedoms of the Uighurs - a Muslim minority group which lives mostly in the province of Xinjiang province in northwestern China - culminating in an oppressive system of mass surveillance, detention, indoctrination, and even forced sterilisation.\nChina has consistently denied allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, insisting camps were not detention camps, but \"vocational educational and training centres\". \n\"It is unfortunate that history is repeating what happened 82 years ago with the Nazi Olympics in 1936\" said Dorjee Tseten of Students for a Free Tibet, one of the groups that signed the letter. \n\"Hosting the Games in Berlin helped legitimise Hitler's genocide against the Jewish people and bolstered the Nazi regime. Governments and the international community must boycott the Beijing 2022 Games and take a stand to uphold the values of democracy, freedom, and human rights.\"\nZumretay Arkin of World Uyghur Congress said: \"Our sufferings were completely dismissed by the IOC. It's now up to the governments to act on it, and show some decent humanity by boycotting a genocide Olympics.''\nBut IOC Vice-President Pound dismissed the criticism. \n\"Our perspective on all of this is that no matter how complex and how conflicting views may exist among countries, we're trying to steer a middle course here using sport as a means of communication even in the worst of times\" he said.\nRights groups have also called for the IOC to find an alternative host for the Olympics, which start less than six months after the delayed Tokyo summer Games. \nWhen asked whether the event should have been awarded to China - which also staged the 2008 Summer Games - Pound said, \"Where would you celebrate the Olympic Games if you take that kind of attitude?\" \nHe accepted some countries may consider a diplomatic boycott, but insisted it should not extend to athletes. \n\"You can withdraw ambassadors during the Games\u2026you could suspend consular functions, there are all kinds of ways that states can signal disapproval. But cancelling a sport competition really doesn't make sense, either philosophically from the sport perspective or as a determinate of state conduct.\"\nThe US blocked American athletes from attending the 1980 Summer Games in the former Soviet Union, with the USSR then leading a boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics in retaliation. \n\"When people sit down and think what it means\u2026they will look and say 'it's not going to be effective', we know that from the [1980 and 1984] boycotts\" Pound said. \n\"It does not change the conduct, so why would we sacrifice our athletes and their dreams in a gesture that we know will have no impact whatsoever?\"\nThe IOC's \"rule 50\" forbids athletes from protesting at Olympic venues, and critics say Beijing 2022 will put competitors in a difficult position. \n\"Athletes have no say on the rules of Olympic engagement, but will be the ones blamed for attending,\" said Rob Koehler, general secretary of advocacy group Global Athlete. \n\"National Olympic Committees must demand that the IOC align the Olympic Charter with the UN Declaration of Human Rights, and demand that athletes are never placed in this position again.\n\"Athletes need to be given a say and a voice, that is why we are demanding that rule 50 be rescinded.\"\nWhen asked about the letter, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said he was \"fully confident the Beijing Winter Olympics will be a splendid event. \n\"It is highly irresponsible for some parties to try and disrupt, intervene, and sabotage the preparation and holding of the Games to serve their political interests. Such actions will not be supported by the international community and will never succeed.\""

      "tags": "Financial services,Barclays,City of London,Economic effects of Brexit,Brexit",
      "text": "The UK financial services industry should focus on competing with the US and Asia rather than the EU.\nThat's the view of the boss of Barclays for the City after Brexit. \nJes Staley told the BBC that although jobs that would have been created here have been moved to the EU, Brexit gives one of the UK's most important sectors the chance to define its own agenda. \n\"I think Brexit is more than likely on the positive side than on the negative side,\" he said.\n\"What the UK needs and London needs, is to make sure that the City is one of the best places, whether [it is in terms of] regulation or law or language, or talent.\n\"I think what London needs to be focused on is not Frankfurt or Paris, [it] needs to be focused on New York and Singapore.\"\nHowever, he said he was not a fan of widespread deregulation to achieve that - no regulatory bonfire for him. \n\"I wouldn't burn one piece of regulation.\"\nIn fact, he said the UK's robust regulation was a major strength, not weakness, and referred to the recent clampdown on firms offering buy now, pay later schemes as reassuring. \n\"You see what's happening right now with buy now, pay later, you know, the FCA is going to come in and start to increase the regulation of that marketplace. That's the right thing to do. \n\"And, in a funny way we've gotten pretty good at working inside the regulatory framework that is here. It protects the financial industry in London as we learn how to deal with this regulation, and it makes the bank safer.\"\nHe does admit that money and jobs have moved from the UK as a result of Brexit, but says the impact has been modest. \n\"Yes, there are some jobs that are going to Europe, that otherwise would have been in the UK, but it's in the hundreds. Barclays employs some 50,000 people in the United Kingdom, roughly 20,000 outside of the UK and 10,000 in the US. \n\"Some amount of capital has moved but London is still obviously the main centre for Barclays.\"\nHis message is that the UK should do everything it can to foster trust and good relations with the EU, but not at the cost of the UK becoming uncompetitive with the bigger fish in the global capital pool. \nIt's not everyone's favourite industry, but the financial services sector employs 1.1 million people, with two-thirds of them outside London. It is nearly 100 times more economically important than fishing and pays a whopping 11% of all taxes. \nIt was also almost totally ignored in the Brexit negotiations - access to EU markets enjoyed for decades ended in January. About \u00a31 trillion in capital and assets and up to 10,000 jobs left the UK industry as firms set up EU subsidiaries. Big numbers, but in global financial terms, erosion rather than exodus. \nCatherine McGuinness, head of policy at the City of London Corporation, said that while financial services didn't get much air time in Brexit negotiations, they were better placed because they started preparing years ago. \n\"We have been disappointed in the lack of focus on the financial professional services sector - this is a critical part of our economy, a critical part in itself for the jobs and tax that it generates. \n\"But the minute the referendum result was announced, the institutions started planning how they would be able to serve their customers in whatever circumstances developed\"\nShe also agreed with Mr Staley that there is no need or desire for widespread deregulation to create what some have styled a Singapore-on-Thames. \n\"One reason why people want to come and do business here is because they trust the regulation. We're not hearing any great demand for a bonfire of regulation but we do need to look at how can we keep influencing and working with global standards to meet global challenges.\"\nOne of those global challenges is surely climate change and Mr Staley is convinced London can become a major global hub for green finance. He says these ideas are currently where the understanding of the impact of the internet was nearly 30 years ago. \n\"Climate today is like technology was in 1995. If you think about it\u2026 all the Amazons, the Googles, didn't really exist in 1995 and now it dominates 40% of the economy, I think it's a fair argument that dealing with climate and dealing with the environment is in the same position now.\" \nConfident and controversial words for the boss of a bank that counts climate change activists as regular attendees at its annual shareholder meeting thanks to its involvement in financing fossil fuel projects. \nBut that's the curious thing about money. You would think it's hard to create new products out of it, but it happens. \nThe ability to raise money in dollars on EU markets was the key new thing that propelled London to worldwide significance in the post-war period. \nCreating new products out of pools of sub-prime mortgages almost destroyed the world's financial system. \nHarnessing the international demand for financing climate-based projects could be the next big - and hopefully good - thing. \nIt's harder to reinvent a fish or a sheep. Unlike fishing and farming, which got a lot of political attention, and whose businesses are really struggling to adjust, UK financial firms like Barclays seem confident they can adapt to a post-Brexit future. \nAs Mr Staley says, \"you can't tax good ideas\". \nThe UK government thought the powerful financial sector could look after itself. On this evidence, it seems they might have been right. \nRishi Sunak will certainly hope so. No Chancellor of the Exchequer in living memory has needed the tax revenue more. "

      "text": "A BBC Panorama team has been threatened following a programme about a suspected crime boss's influence in world boxing.\nNorthern Ireland police have warned of an unspecified threat from unnamed criminal elements.\nThe programme investigated the role played by Daniel Kinahan, named in the Irish courts as the head of one of Europe's most prominent drug cartels.\nIt led to calls for tighter regulation but some in boxing defend his involvement.\nJo Carr, the BBC's head of current affairs, said: \"The BBC places the utmost priority on the safety of our teams, whose journalism plays a vital role in a free society. It is despicable and intolerable if thugs think they can muzzle a free press through intimidation.\n\"We will continue to throw light into even the murkiest of corners.\"\nThe courts in Ireland have accepted that an organised crime group linked to Mr Kinahan is involved in drug trafficking and execution-style murders.\nThe group is also suspected of involvement in a feud with a rival Dublin gang that has resulted in 18 people being murdered.\nMr Kinahan's lawyer told the programme he has no criminal record or convictions and the allegations about him being a crime boss are false and have no evidential basis.\nThe lawyer said: \"In so far as our client's record in boxing is concerned, he is proud of his record in boxing to date.\"\nMr Kinahan's involvement in boxing caused an outcry last summer when world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury publicly thanked him for setting up a much anticipated title fight with fellow British champion Anthony Joshua.\nThe criticism died down after it was announced that Mr Kinahan would no longer negotiate Mr Fury's fights and he was stepping away from boxing.\nBut Panorama's Boxing and the Mob programme discovered the suspected crime boss was still advising top fighters in world boxing.\nMr Fury did not respond to questions about whether Mr Kinahan was still acting as his personal adviser."

      "text": "The father of two climate change activists fears they could die inside a network of tunnels they helped to dig in protest at the HS2 rail project.\nRoc Sandford's children Blue and Lazer have been in the tunnels, near Euston station, for the past nine days.\nThe 63-year-old said he was \"scared he may never see them again\" and criticised efforts made to remove them.\nHS2 has rejected claims by Mr Sandford that Lazer has been subjected to an assault by those trying to evict him.\nBailiffs discovered earlier that the 20-year-old had locked his arm and ankle inside the tunnel network, where seasoned activist Daniel Hooper - better known as Swampy - and his son have also taken up residence.\n\"Lazer, who is locked in the downshaft, keeps getting things dropped on him, choked, put in wrist locks or being stood or sat on,\" Mr Sandford said.\nA spokeswoman for HS2 said the safety of staff, protesters and emergency services was of \"paramount importance\".\n\"We are doing all we can to end this illegal action safely, and progress has been made with access secured to the underground tunnel,\" she said.\n\"As has been reported this [Friday] morning, the illegal trespassers have attached themselves underground, which increases the danger to themselves, but also to our team and the emergency services.\"\nBlue, 18, and Lazer are among nine protesters burrowed underground - something their father supports, despite the risks involved.\n\"I was really scared they would die down there and I would never see them again,\" Mr Sandford said.\nOne of the other protesters has since been arrested after voluntarily leaving the tunnel and has been taken to hospital as a precaution. \nIn August, HS2 Rebellion campaigners started occupying a site on Euston Square Gardens, which is where the entrance to the tunnel is located. \nThey are on land that HS2 requires so it can build a temporary taxi rank, as part of the high-speed rail project.\nTo thwart eviction attempts, activists spent two months digging a secret tunnel, which they have been in since 26 January.\nEngineers have been drafted in to prevent activists being drowned or suffocated - the protesters have tunnelled near water and gas pipes.\nThe underground protest has drawn criticism from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who said the activists' actions were \"reckless, irresponsible and deeply concerning\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whose constituency includes Euston, said the most important thing was to make sure lives were not at risk.\nMr Sandford argues that his children have been left with \"no choice\" but to protest in the way they have been.\nHe added: \"They shouldn't have to be doing this. They should be studying.\n\"My children and their fellow tunnellers are fighting for all our lives and I'm really proud of them.\"\nBlue and Lazer were privately educated at King Alfred School, in Hampstead, north London, as there are no schools on the remote Hebridean island of Gometra - which Mr Sandford owns.\nPreviously, Blue said she was on a \"school strike\" for climate change, while Mr Sandford said his son started protesting once he left school.\nSpeaking from his remote island home, Mr Sandford said he had been able to remain in contact with his children.\nAs well as the allegations he has made about the treatment of his son, Mr Sandford said the protesters were being denied the right to monitor oxygen levels in the depths of the tunnel network.\nHowever, the HS2 spokeswoman said there was no evidence to support Mr Sandford's allegations.\nEarlier this week, High Court judge Mr Justice Robin Knowles refused an application by one of the protesters, Larch Maxey, who was trying to stop bailiffs from trying to remove them.\nThe judge said the activists' predicament was \"very dangerous\" and that Dr Maxey should inform the authorities about the number of people in the tunnels and cease any further digging.\nIt is an order he has not complied with, the HS2 spokeswoman said.\nShe said: \"The High Court this week issued an order which required another illegal occupant of the tunnel, Dr Maxey, to leave the tunnel and encourage others, including Mr Sandford's children, to also do so. \n\"Continuing to ignore the court order compounds the illegality and risk of their actions. \n\"Mr Sandford should urge his children to remove themselves from the tunnel as soon as possible - for their safety and the safety of the other activists and HS2 staff and agents tasked with removing them from the danger they in which they have placed themselves.\"\nThe campaigners say that HS2 is using \"huge amounts of high-carbon steel\" in the rail project, something they say \"will only make the climate emergency worse\".\nAn HS2 report published last February said the project would not reduce CO2 overall for more than 100 years, largely because of the emissions created during tunnelling and construction.\nHowever, HS2 now says that forecast is out of date. It also points to measures it has taken to reduce construction emissions by using less steel, although it has not produced any new figures.\nHS2 is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. It is hoped the 20-year project will reduce rail passenger overcrowding and help to rebalance the UK's economy.\nThe campaign group alleges HS2 is the \"most expensive, wasteful and destructive project in UK history\" and that it is \"set to destroy or irreparably damage 108 ancient woodlands and 693 wildlife sites\".\nHowever, HS2 bosses have said seven million trees will be planted during phase one of the project.\nThey also say that much ancient woodland will \"remain intact\"."

      "tags": "Tourism,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Travel,UK government,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic,New Zealand,Australia",
      "text": "UK nationals and residents returning from \"red list\" countries will be made to quarantine in accommodation such as hotels for 10 days, Boris Johnson has said. While exact details of the policy remain unclear, similar schemes are already in place elsewhere, including in Australia and New Zealand. So how does it work?\nAfter finally securing her family's place in Australia's quarantine system, Keri McMenamin prepared for the worst - and ordered a vacuum cleaner.\nThe 38-year-old was returning to the country with her husband and two children after securing a job offer - leaving the UK in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic last year.\n\"It is literally luck of the draw,\" she says of where her family would spend 14 days together once they arrived. \"You didn't know what to expect.\" Having done some research, Keri discovered Facebook groups busy with people relaying their experiences of quarantine.\n\"A lot of people were saying, 'Look, just expect the worst and then whatever you get is a bonus.'\"\n\"There were people who had, like, filthy hotel rooms, appalling food, you know, really sort of tiny spaces, no opening windows, no balconies,\" she adds.\nThat's when she ordered the vacuum for a friend to deliver when the time came.\nIn the end, the family was taken to a hotel in Surfers' Paradise on the Gold Coast and given an interconnecting room. But still, the windows were sealed and their only time outside was 20-minute stints every two to three days.\n\"I think what kept us sane was having a routine,\" she adds. \"Joe Wicks in the morning and our yoga in the evening and sort of keeping up your 12,000 steps a day walking around in loops.\" The vacuum came in useful.\nThere are strict caps on the numbers travelling to countries using hotels to quarantine arrivals.\nBetween July and October 2019, 7.5m people arrived into Australia to live, work and visit. But over the same period last year, when enforced quarantine was in place, just 72,111 people arrived, according to government figures.\nPeople like Keri who have been through quarantine in Australia told BBC News that airlines will only confirm seats once a spot in a hotel is secured - leading to last-minute scrambles.\nOnline forums suggest expats desperate to get home are facing months of delays, cancellations and uncertainty - around 39,000 have said they want to return.\nQuarantine hotel stays themselves are costly - with fees paid for by travellers.\nIn New South Wales, it costs the equivalent of around \u00a31,700 per adult and \u00a32,800 for a family of two adults and two children - billed after the quarantine is completed.\nArrivals into New Zealand are charged \u00a31,630 for the first adult, with an extra \u00a3500 for each additional adult and \u00a3250 for each child.\nThe costs include the accommodation and a basic food service and even more basic cleaning - perhaps once per week, or not at all, with one change of linen and towels, depending on the facility.\nBut it comes on top of airfares, which have increased due to the pandemic. Fees can be waived for those who cannot pay and there are some exemptions.\nEach region has its own rules. In Australia, packages can be brought in from outside, and in New Zealand some of those in quarantine are taken to fields to exercise.\nMark Dickinson, from Liverpool, has lived in New Zealand with his wife Lisa for four years but returned to the UK to see their newborn granddaughter in December - he spoke to the BBC 10 days into a 14-day isolation near Auckland.\n\"We had to have a test on day zero, then day three, then we're having a test tomorrow on day 11,\" Mark says.\n\"The area at the front of the hotel is surrounded by a double-guarded fence. It may have cost us \u00a32,000 but if that means New Zealand stays safe, then we're happy doing it.\"\nMany of those isolating found life does not stop in quarantine. Australian Brad Thiele started a new job and celebrated his 51st birthday alone in a 300 sq ft room at the Novotel in central Sydney. \nAfter being asked by a person wearing a full hazmat suit at Sydney airport whether he had any concerns about being held in a room for 14 days, Brad was taken to the hotel with a blue-light police escort. On arrival, the military were on hand to ensure he checked in.\n\"I quite like practising meditation. So I was able to just sort of just sit and be at peace with the fact this was the first two weeks of the rest of my life having lived abroad in Britain for the past 23 years,\" he says.\n\"I had some regimen, it was important to get up in the morning, make the bed, shower, iron a shirt and be smart casual for work. Just finding a rhythm and a pattern in the day.\"\nHe's yet to decide whether to take the Novotel up on an offer of a 30% discount on a future stay.\nOther countries' experience of setting up a hotel quarantine system provides an insight into the sort of challenges politicians and civil servants in the UK may soon be grappling with. \nInitially those in quarantine across the world complained about the quality of food being provided.\nThen outbreaks at just two hotels in the Australian state of Victoria were traced to 99% of cases in a second wave across Melbourne that led to around 750 deaths.\nA public inquiry found a lack of training, cleaning and contact tracing seeded infections into the local community. \nReports at the time suggested encounters between private security staff and those staying in quarantine caused the virus to spread. The inquiry did not find evidence to back up the claims.\nBut former judge Jennifer Coate criticised a lack of \"health focus\" in the quarantine system in Melbourne, saying risks \"were foreseeable and may have actually been foreseen\".\nMeanwhile, New Zealand is investigating after a woman who had served 14 days in quarantine and tested negative twice went on to develop symptoms which were confirmed to be the South Africa variant of Covid-19.\nThe 56-year-old woman had recently returned from Europe and is said to have visited almost 30 places in New Zealand before her case was detected. Local officials say she is likely to have been infected by a fellow returnee.\nBack in Australia, knowing why the quarantine system is in place and the benefits it brings - the country has largely eradicated the virus - helps motivate people to keep to the rules, Keri McMenamin says.\nShe has just spent a public holiday going about the sort of activities many of us in the UK can but dream of - and her children will be in school this week.\n\"We went to a local gym and had a group workout with 30 people,\" she says. \n\"And then we went to the countryside, and the kids built little boats out of wood and mingled around and there were families picnicking.\n\"I almost feel guilty for having gone through this process and now living a normal life,\" she adds. \"I feel like I don't want to talk to my friends in the UK about how easy our life here is and how normal it is.\""

      "text": "Three journalists who were allegedly working as spies for China were asked to leave the UK last year. \nTheir departure, first reported by the Daily Telegraph, came because they had arrived under journalism visas but were believed to be working for the Ministry of State Security, part of China's intelligence apparatus. \nTheir departure was low-key and did not come in the past few months. \nThe Home Office declined to comment on the reports. \nIt is not clear which media organisations they worked for. The Chinese Embassy in London has been contacted for comment. \nThe revelation came after Ofcom on Thursday revoked the licence of the Chinese state broadcaster CGTN to operate in the UK.\nThe broadcasting regulator said the company that had the licence did not have day-to-day control over the channel which was against the rules. \nThe decision was not linked to the reports about the three Chinese journalists.\nChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was \"firmly opposed\" to Ofcom's ruling.\nMeanwhile, the US government has said it was \"deeply disturbed\" by a BBC report detailing allegations of systematic rape of Uighur women in Chinese camps.\n\"These atrocities shock the conscience and must be met with serious consequences,\" a spokesperson said.\nUK government minister, Nigel Adams, told parliament on Thursday that the report showed \"clearly evil acts\".\nAccording to estimates, more than a million Uighurs and other minorities have been detained in camps in China.\nAn investigation published by the BBC on Wednesday contained first-hand testimony of systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture of women detainees by police and guards."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,UK government,Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),Graham Brady,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The UK government should avoid \"setting dates\" for when to lift lockdown and instead react to changing circumstances, a scientist has warned.\nProf Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said leaders should not be \"driven by a calendar\".\nMeanwhile, the government has said all over-50s should be vaccinated by May.\nAnd a senior Conservative MP has told the BBC that Downing Street should be \"looking to open up\" society.\nSir Graham Brady, who leads the 1922 Committee of Conservative Party backbenchers, cited the falling infection level and success of the vaccine rollout, telling the BBC the situation was \"optimistic\".\nThe government estimate of the R rate - the average number of people someone with Covid will go on to infect - has dropped slightly to between 0.7 and 1, from between 0.7 and 1.1 for the week before.\nBut Prof Medley - who chairs the modelling group SPI-M, which advises Sage - told the BBC's Today programme that the epidemic could still go in two directions, up or down, and \"it's up to the government to decide which of those paths it takes\".\nHe urged a strategy of \"adaptive management so you actually change the control of the epidemic as it goes along rather than setting dates, for example\". \nThis means rather than setting dates of when rules could ease, there would be some sort of threshold of what the government would do if certain criteria are met.\n\"To actually make decisions dependent on the circumstances, rather than being driven by a calendar of wanting to do things,\" Prof Medley added.\nThe government has always insisted it is guided by the science - but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has often given dates when expressing hope about the future of the pandemic, for example saying things will be better by Easter and being hopeful about summer holidays.\nAsked what type of circumstances the decisions could be based on, Prof Medley said case numbers were important.\n\"Vaccination offers a way out and it does reduce the impact of infection, but it doesn't remove it completely,\" he said. \"And so case numbers are still important because they represent the risk of having to go back into some kind of national measures.\n\"At the moment, we're in a relatively good position in a sense that the number of cases are falling, but they're still very high. So we only need one more doubling time, one more return to exponential growth, and we could be back in the same position we were in the beginning of January within two weeks.\"\n\"The lower the numbers of cases, the more time you will have to react if they start to increase.\"\nInfection levels have been falling since early January, and newly-released data shows that cases are down in every UK nation apart from Wales.\nNearly 10.5 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine so far. And on Friday, the Cabinet Office issued a press release saying it plans to vaccinate all of the first nine priority groups - including the over 50s - by May, giving it confidence to press ahead with the local elections.\nThe government also announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac, which Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said would allow the UK to \"swiftly tweak and roll out\" existing vaccines to combat new variants, with 50 million doses placed in an initial order for later this year.\nThe latest figures show the UK recorded another 20,632 coronavirus cases on Thursday. A further 915 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported, taking the total by that measure to 110,250.\nAnd around one in 65 people in private households in England and Northern Ireland had Covid last week, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics. In Wales, that figure was one in 70, while in Scotland it was one in 115.\nThe ONS also found that almost six in 10 adults say they are following \"stay at home\" lockdown rules by only leaving home for their basic needs. The figure is less than during the first national lockdown, when around 81% of people said they obeyed, and higher than in November.\nBy Philippa Roxby, health reporter\nNow that more than 10 million of the UK's most vulnerable have been vaccinated, daily cases of the virus are falling, fewer people are being admitted to hospital and there are early signs of deaths coming down, there is pressure to start the process of returning to normal.\nBut what will that process look like? Relax restrictions too quickly and there's the risk that cases could start to rise again in the unvaccinated. Move too slowly and the economy, jobs, children's education and people's mental health could suffer unnecessarily.\nSome advocate a responsive approach - keeping a close eye on infection levels, which experts warn are still worryingly high, and other data, then reacting quickly when relaxations appear to be making things worse.\nThis is in contrast to, for example, setting fixed dates for schools to open which may then have to be changed nearer the time.\nReopening schools has always been the priority. Making that happen safely while carefully opening up other parts of society is now the greatest challenge. \nSir Graham - who has previously opposed lockdown rules - told the BBC the argument for going into a third national lockdown was to stop the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed. \n\"The NHS has actually coped spectacularly well,\" he said. \"Now that that threat is receding, we ought to be - and indeed we are, and the government says we are - looking to open up.\"\nOther politicians are urging a cautious approach to lifting lockdown. \nFormer Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's World at One the country had to target getting cases \"down significantly from their current levels\", making a comparison with South Korea, which he said had about 400 cases per day.\nHe said: \"If we really want to avoid going into a fourth lockdown, we're going to have to be much better at isolating and quarantining anyone who has the new variants.\"\nMr Hunt added he thought the \"end of the pandemic is within sight\" - but that the country needed to keep a \"weathered eye one these vaccines and variants\".\nEarlier this week, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also warned against lifting restrictions too early.\nOn Friday, government minister James Cleverly said he was not able to give a timetable of restrictions easing, but said plans will take into consideration \"the needs of the economy, people's mental health, the education of our children\".\n\"The decisions will be based on the assessment of what is safe, as well as effective,\" he said.\nA spokesman for the Department of Health said the government continues to follow advice from scientific and medical experts.\n\"As the prime minister has said, the government will set out a plan for taking the country out of lockdown during the week beginning 22 February, with the clear aim of taking a gradual, phase approach that is sustainable.\""

      "text": "The barriers facing British musicians who want to tour in the EU are \"absurd and self-defeating\", UK culture secretary Oliver Dowden has said.\nSince Brexit, British musicians face costly bills to obtain visas if they wish to play in some EU countries.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Mr Dowden said the situation \"could have been solved\" before 1 January, and laid the blame with the European Union.\nSeveral MPs urged the government to return to the negotiating table. \n\"I know that the EU walked away from our offer, but it must be brought back to the table,\" said Conservative MP Giles Watling. \n\"Touring performers will be left with a double whammy of an industry devastated by Covid and the loss of an entire continent as a venue. Will he please bang the table and get the EU back to talk on this?\"\nCulture minister Nigel Huddleston replied that the \"door always remains open\" for further talks.\n\"A working group has been set up by the secretary of state to look at any obstacles which might face British performers seeking to tour,\" he said.\nThe EU has previously said the UK government turned down its standard proposal of a visa waiver for musicians during Brexit negotiations. \nThe UK has insisted this offer \"would not have worked for musicians\" and was incompatible with the government's \"commitment to take back control of our borders\".\nThe EU also rejected a counter-proposal from the UK, the details of which have not been revealed. \nA petition on the issue is also due to be debated in Parliament on Monday. \nBacked by musicians including Dua Lipa, Biffy Clyro and Laura Marling, it calls for the government to \"negotiate a free cultural work permit\" that would allow bands and their crews to travel freely in the EU's 27 member states.\nOn Thursday, in preparation for the debate, the House of Commons petitions committee heard evidence from artists and touring professionals about the impact of Brexit on their livelihoods.\nOpera singer Anna Patalong said that, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, working in other European countries accounted for \"50% of my income\" - earnings which are now at risk.\nShe said the lack of a visa waiver meant \"all the artists in the UK are now in a worse position than musicians in the Congo and Columbia\".\nDance musician Yousef said it was \"pretty standard\" for DJs like himself to play in two or three European countries in one weekend. Having to arrange permits for each gig would make his career \"near impossible and unbelievably expensive\", he said.\nHe felt musicians were \"just not taken seriously\" by the government, adding: \"We're treated as if we're children playing in the toy room, but that's not the case at all. \n\"It's a very serious business run by hard-working music enthusiasts who don't ask for any support under normal circumstances.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Climate change,Mark Carney,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The world is heading for mortality rates equivalent to the Covid crisis every year by mid-century unless action is taken, according to Mark Carney.\nThe former central banker said the investment needed to avert millions of deaths was double current rates.\nBut with governments ploughing billions into keeping economies afloat, a question mark hangs over whether the recovery will be green enough.\nThe answer lies in smarter investment, Mr Carney said.\nMr Carney, who was the Bank of England governor up until last year, and the head of the Bank of Canada before that, is now the United Nations envoy for climate action and finance.\nHe told the BBC that while there were parallels between the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change, damage to the environment and ecosystems has the potential to cause many more deaths.\n\"One of the biggest issues is you cannot self-isolate from climate,\" he said. \"That is not an option. We cannot retreat in and wait out climate change, it will just get worse,\" he told Talking Business Asia: The Climate Change Challenge.\n\"When you look at climate change from a human mortality perspective, it will be the equivalent of a coronavirus crisis every year from the middle of this century, and every year, not just a one-off event. So it is an issue that needs to be addressed now.\"\nBut governments pouring trillions of dollars into stimulus plans to rescue their ailing economies are mainly addressing job losses and the economic damage inflicted from lockdowns.\nVery little of that cash is heading towards reducing carbon emissions, although emissions have fallen in the past year because people aren't travelling as much.\nMr Carney, who is tasked with persuading policymakers, chief executives, bankers and investors to focus on the environment, said: \"The scale of investment in energy, sustainable energy and sustainable infrastructure needs to double.\n\"Every year, for the course of the next three decades, $3.5 trillion (\u00a32.5tn) a year, for 30 years. It is an enormous investment opportunity.\"\nHe said the answer lies in a global pot of $170tn of private capital which, he says, \"is looking for disclosure\".\nBanks, investment funds and individuals increasingly want to know how their money will be used.\nIt is not just about disclosing the carbon position of companies, he says, but \"where it's going to go tomorrow in order to make these kinds of investment and lending decisions\". \nThat pot is bigger than the total economic output of the world for a year, he said. \"The issue is about putting that money to work.\"\nMr Carney said that as the US returns to the world stage in the battle against climate change, there's renewed momentum to the issue, especially as last year China, the world's largest polluter, aimed to become carbon neutral by 2060.\nAlthough China continues to build coal-fired power plants, and draws about 70% of its power from fossil fuel, the country is a crucial part of the solution.\n\"There clearly are issues in terms of coal in China, and the sooner China moves on that, the better for them and for the world.\n\"But China also produces 60% of the global solar photovoltaic panels. It is also the largest producer of electric vehicles. So China has many sides to this.\"\nThe US has the \"largest and most sophisticated financial sector\" along with the \"engineering and technological expertise\" to get to net zero emissions, he said.\nPart of his role at the UN is to tap into this financial sector.\nIt is the \"power of money\" that will ultimately play the biggest role in combating climate change, he said.\n\"We're getting the system in a position where, whether it's a bank, or somebody who's investing a small amount of savings in the market, or your pension, they can choose [how it is invested].\n\"They have the information and they can choose to be part of the solution, transitioning to net zero, or be part of the problem.\"\nYou can watch the full interview with Mark Carney on Talking Business Asia on BBC World News this weekend."

      "text": "Donald Trump has quit America's Screen Actors Guild after it launched a disciplinary hearing into him, citing the US Capitol attack.\n\"Who cares!\" the former US president wrote in a letter, adding that the union had \"done nothing for me\".\n\"Thank you,\" was the Guild's brief response.\nMr Trump has appeared in a number of films, including Home Alone 2 and Zoolander. He also hosted the US version of The Apprentice TV show.\nLast month, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) said its disciplinary committee would meet to decide what action should be taken regarding Mr Trump's role in the Capitol riot in Washington DC on 6 January.\nFive people died and dozens were injured during the pro-Trump siege.\n\"Donald Trump attacked the values that this union holds most sacred - democracy, truth, respect for our fellow Americans of all races and faiths, and the sanctity of the free press,\" said SAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris. \n\"There's a straight line from his wanton disregard for the truth to the attacks on journalists perpetrated by his followers,\" she said.\nSAG-AFTRA represents about 160,000 actors, journalists and other media professionals in the US.\nMr Trump, a Guild member for more than 30 years, was expected to be expelled at a forthcoming disciplinary meeting.\nThe union shared his resignation letter, which was addressed to its president, a former star of Beverly Hills, 90210, on its website. \n\"I write to you today regarding the so-called Disciplinary Committee hearing aimed at revoking my union membership. Who cares!\" Mr Trump wrote.\n\"While I'm not familiar with your work, I'm very proud of my work on movies such as Home Alone 2, Zoolander and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps; and television shows including The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air, Saturday Night Live, and of course, one of the most successful shows in television history, The Apprentice - to name just a few!\"\nMr Trump added that he had \"greatly helped\" the cable news business, which he described as a \"dying platform with not much time left\" before he took to politics. He then branded the disciplinary action a \"blatant attempt at free media attention to distract from your dismal record\".\nOn 13 January, Mr Trump became the first president in US history to be impeached twice, after the US House of Representatives accused him of encouraging violence with false claims of election fraud.\nHe now faces a trial in the Senate."

      "text": "Children aged three to seven will return to school after the February half-term, the Welsh Government is expected to confirm on Friday.\nMost pupils have been learning from home after a surge in Covid cases led to a Welsh lockdown.\nThe decision would mean the foundation phase of primary schools returning from 22 February.\nBut the head of one teaching union said they would not support the move without assurances about teacher safety. \nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams is expected to make the announcement at a lunchtime press conference on Friday.\nIt follows a fall in the number of infections, and negotiations with teaching trade unions, who have called for teachers to be in the priority list for vaccinations.\nThe Welsh Government had been under pressure to set out plans for a return to face-to-face teaching after weeks of lockdown.\nIt comes as other parts of the UK consider when children can return to face-to-face teaching.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said 8 March was the earliest date schools in England could reopen and that \"depends on lots of things going right\".\nIn Northern Ireland pupils will not return to school until 8 March at the earliest while Scotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 February as schools start a phased reopening.\nThe Covid case rate in Wales is currently the lowest of the UK nations.\nIt now stands at 126 per 100,000 people over seven days - a fall from about 700 before Christmas.\nEarlier, teachers' union NASUWT said a joint group of unions had given the Welsh Government a list of \"mitigations\" they wanted to see put in place.\nThey include strict social distancing, medical grade masks for teachers in the foundation phase and a \"further consideration of a flexible and phased return\".\nNeil Butler, its national officer in Wales, said on Friday the union would not support the return to school unless a number of those mitigations were taken on board. \nHe told BBC Radio Wales: \"We've got no indication of what's going to be changed in the operational guidance which fits into those mitigations that we want to see.\n\"If the operational guidance has taken nothing on board in terms of the joint union mitigation list then we're not going to be able to support this return on the 22nd.\"\nUcac general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young said there needed to be \"local flexibility to stagger the return of foundation phase children\".\n\"We'll also need clear guidelines about social distancing, the use of face-coverings, sufficient ventilation, and which staff are exempt from return and can continue to work from home.\n\"Above all, school staff need to hear that they figure in the government's priority list for vaccination, particularly those in the foundation phase where it is almost impossible to ensure social distancing.\"\nAll schools and colleges in Wales were told to move to online learning before the start of this term in an effort to \"suppress the virus\", Ms Williams said at the start of January.\nSome schools had been due to open in the new year but unions called for the return to be delayed amid concerns about a variant of coronavirus blamed for a rise in cases before Christmas.\nSchools and colleges have remained open for children of critical workers and vulnerable pupils, as well as for children who needed to complete essential exams or assessments.\nVictoria Rosser, a mother of four from Cwmbran, is on the shielding list and is yet to receive her first dose of the Covid vaccine. \nShe said she wants to be able to make the decision over whether it is safe for her children to return to the classroom. \n\"I have mixed emotions towards the decision being announced today,\" she said. \n\"I do not feel it's safe for parents and guardians, who've been placed on the shielding list like me, to send their children until phase one of the priority list are post-three weeks of receiving their vaccine. \n\"Parents are being crippled with having to balance their children's education, work and running a home. This is not home schooling, it's trying to accommodate three jobs at the same time, which is impossible in the long-term.\"\nMeanwhile, Chris Lawrence, who lives in Cardiff and has three children, said it was \"really important\" children get back to school as soon as possible. \nHe said: \"From my perspective what we've been doing in terms of shutting schools, we were always told it would be the last resort, but at the moment it's been adopted as the thing that we do. If your kids are at home then pretty much all parents have to be at home as well.\"\nSamantha Pearce from Blaenau Gwent, who's daughter Hazel is 10, said she didn't want to see year groups rushed back.\nBut she added: \"The prolonged closure of the schools is having a huge detrimental effect. Schools for us here in Blaenau Gwent have been already been closed for two months now - and children are bored an unengaged with the work.\"\nRachel Antoniazzi, who is deputy head at Thornhill Primary School in Cardiff, said getting children back into school would be a \"relief\" for parents and teachers, but there were also some concerns for staff. \nShe said: \"I do really honestly believe that the type of learning that foundation phase children are expected to do doesn't work very well from home. It puts a lot of pressure on parents, it's not conducive to the way foundation phase learners are expected to learn.\"\nMs Antoniazzi's school has been operating as a hub for children of key workers during the lockdown, and will continue to do so for the children in the upper years of the school, alongside reopening for the youngest pupils. \n\"In an ideal world we would love to welcome the whole school back but we have to be really careful,\" she said. \n\"I think the biggest fear, and the government have to be really clear on this, is that it's a necessity to reopen schools, but it doesn't mean we're back to normal. \n\"It's better than being at home but I do want parents to get the message that doesn't mean you can go to playdates.\"\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Si\u00e2n Gwenllian called for school staff and other key workers to be moved to the top of the list in each vaccination priority group.\n\"Parents, learners and staff need reassurance that the school environment is safe, and there are certainly things that can be done to give them confidence, such as more extensive use of ventilation, school workers moved to the top of their vaccine priority group, and schools must be given all options to enable adequate social distancing in classrooms. \n\"With a year of hindsight, it pains me to think how much more face-to-face education our children and young people could have had, if Welsh Government had used all the tools in their gift earlier.\"\nEducation spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives Suzy Davies welcomed the return but questioned the staggered approach.\nShe added: \"It's been a tough period for children, parents and teachers, and it makes sense for primaries to go back to catch up with each other; these youngest pupils have lost most in terms of learning and vital early-years socialisation.\n\"We need a can-do, will-do approach from ministers as teachers on the front line want to return to the classroom so long as it's safe to do so. \n\"They must now put plans in place for those critical secondary years, and to get in the maximum amount of learning to prepare our older learners for college and university with an even more dynamic, innovative, flexible and ultimately safe approach to secondary schools.\"\nThe first minister said the youngest pupils would be back in school if virus rates carried on falling.\nA week later, the indicators are going in the right direction, suggesting three to seven-year-olds will be back in classes on or soon after 22 February.\nBut this process feels different to the return after the summer or after the first lockdown.\nThe virus variants have added another layer of anxiety, and the approach is even more cautious.\nOlder primary pupils may have to learn from home for a while longer, and a return for secondary and college pupils, apart from those doing practical qualifications, still seems to be some way off.\nThe first easing of the strictest lockdown rules was last Saturday, when people were able to meet one other person from another household to exercise outside.\nBut people in Wales have been warned they are unlikely to see a \"radical and significant\" easing of the restrictions this month.\nThe health minister said there would need to \"continued\" reductions before the rules can be eased.\nVaughan Gething added any \"available headroom\" would be used to help children go back to school.\nThe next Welsh lockdown review is scheduled for 19 February."

      "text": "Hospital staff have been praised for the care they showed a County Londonderry couple who died within six minutes of each other.\nBarney and Sarah McGlinchey from Greysteel died on 20 January with Covid-19 after spending almost two weeks in Altnagelvin Hospital. \nThey were in separate wards, but staff brought them together to be with each other in their final moments.\nOnly one of their daughters was with them due to coronavirus restrictions.\nBarney, passed away first at 16:55 GMT, while Sarah, known affectionately as Blossom, passed away shortly after at 17:01.\nThe couple were holding hands.\nBarney, 81, and 78-year-old Blossom, who had five children and seven grandchildren, were absolutely devoted to each other, their daughter Lynne Gray said.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, Mrs Gray praised the outstanding care provided to her parents by hospital staff during their family's \"most difficult time\". \n\"As much as we respected the restrictions and the reason they are in place to protect the wider community, it was really, really hard to think that your parents are alone in a sealed off room,\" she said.\n\"That they are with strangers and that you can't be with them in their final hours.\"\nMrs Gray said the family had mostly been corresponding with the couple through letters while they were in hospital.\n\"When they were fit enough they would read their own letters, but when they weren't the nurses would read them for them.\n\"We knew they weren't returning, but we wanted to keep their hope.\"\nShe said the family received a phone call on 20 January to say her parents' condition had drastically deteriorated and \"were soon to be on their final journey\".\nThe consultant on her father's ward said they would like to bring her father from his ward to be with his wife. \n\"We know that they (hospital staff) wanted us as a family to be with our parents, but the restrictions prevented that for the betterment for the wider community,\" she said.\n\"As difficult as it was for us, we know it was equally as difficult for the nursing and caring staff at Altnagelvin Hospital.\"\nMrs Gray said the family's biggest fear was for them to die alone in hospital and said knowing they spent their last moments together in the company of her older sister Libby was of huge comfort. \nShe urged people to take the virus more seriously and to follow public health guidance.\n\"Listen to the professionals, trust the experts that we need to guide us through this pandemic.\"\nMrs Gray added her lasting memory of her mum and dad would be their love for one another, their love of family and their faith.
