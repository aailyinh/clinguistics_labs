      "text": "A man who was injured while caving in the Brecon Beacons on Saturday has been rescued.\nAfter he was lifted to the surface on a stretcher, he was clapped and cheered by rescuers before being taken to a waiting ambulance.\nSouth and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team (SMWCRT) said he fell in the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu cave system near Penwyllt, Powys.\nHe has multiple injuries but was said to be in good spirits.\nGary Evans, emergency services liaison officer and one of the incident controllers, said: \"The casualty's doing remarkably well when you consider how long he's been in the cave, how long he's been in the stretcher, he's doing very well indeed.\n\"He's being assessed at the moment and we'll know more in a short while.\"\nAbout 250 people were involved in the rescue effort.  \nOne of the rescuers, Peter Francis said the man was \"an experienced, fit caver\" and \"it was a matter of putting his foot in the wrong place\".\nHe added: \"It's just something moved from under him.\"\nFoggy and wet conditions in the Brecon Beacons meant an air ambulance helicopter was unable to land.\nInstead, the man, had to be moved on a stretcher by specialist crews working in shifts.\nThis was the longest cave rescue undertaken in Wales.  The longest had been a 41 hour rescue, and this operation took more than 53 hours.\nAnother caver, who had been caving with the man, notified police about the incident.\nThe complex Ogof Ffynnon Ddu cave system is about 902ft (275m) at its deepest point.\nIt is the second largest in Wales and one of the deepest in the UK.\nSome of the cave rescuers who helped are internationally renowned, and some have travelled from as far as North Yorkshire.\nSome were also involved in the Thai cave rescue in 2018. \nThe caves were discovered by the South Wales Caving Club in 1946, according to Natural Resources Wales, and contain a number of underground streams and waterfalls.\nThey can only be accessed by cavers with a permit from the caving club.\nThe caving club's website describes Ogof Ffynnon Ddu:\n\"The through trip from the top to the bottom entrance remains a classic in the UK, and its approx 61km [38 miles] of passages provide everything from huge chambers, beautiful formations, to yawning chasms and thundering river passages,\" it said.\n\"The routes through the cave are too numerous to mention.\"\nIt adds: \"Be aware that the mainstream and some other parts of the cave are prone to flooding, and in any event a journey down the mainstream is long and cold and wet, so go prepared.\""

      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Despite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows.\nIt calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to.\nCOP26 \"has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap\", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT).\nThe Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change.\nBut the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements that included a vow to stop deforestation.\nCOP26 is expected to finish this week.\nThe projection comes as the UK's Met Office warns that a billion people could be affected by fatal heat and humidity if the global average temperature rises by 2C above pre-industrial levels.\nThe report by Climate Action Tracker looks at promises made by governments before and during COP26. \nIt concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree.\nScientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening.\nThe COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included \"pursuing efforts\" to keep warming under 1.5C.\nBut when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.\n\"This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,\" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan.\nHowever, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C.\nClimate Action Tracker blames \"stalled momentum\" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\nIt says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low.\nReaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere.\nMore than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions.\nBut Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated \"acceptable\", covering a fraction of the world's emissions.\n\"If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,\" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker.\nThe main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes.\nWith one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference. \nFor days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C.\nThat seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference. \nSo how has the confusion come about?\nThe problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050. \nMore than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070.\nAccording to the CAT, these goals are giving \"false hope\". \nBased on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C.\nIf every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible.\nBut the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised.\nThat's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years. \nAny deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure. \nThe summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week:"

      "text": "It's the end of week one at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, and world leaders have already made some big commitments.\nMore than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. \nThe US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions.\nBBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries.\nChinese social media has not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26, writes Stephen McDonell in Beijing.\nThe response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed.\nPerhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level.\nAlso, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to.\nOf course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up.\nBut Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued.\nPerhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it.\nIt's all about domestic politics, writes Laura Trevelyan in New York\nPresident Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise.\nSince President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that \"put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day. \nThe US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025.\nThe conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as \"isolated holdouts\" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge.\nAt home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention.\nMr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: \"Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator.\"\nThere is no sense of a climate emergency in Russia, writes Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.\nGo compare. \nA British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet.\nRussia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming?\nIt concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are \"positive consequences of global warming\" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes.\nThere's no sense here of a climate emergency. \nNot that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average. \nIt sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only. \nStill, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030.\nBut it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a \"smooth\" (longer) transition to greener energy.\n\"Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible,\" Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me. \n\"I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet.\" \nIndia's 2070 net zero pledge has won Narendra Modi applause in a growing nation balancing economic and environmental needs, writes Rajini Vaidyanathan in Delhi.\nAlthough India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses.\nBut on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note. \nMr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs. \nThey were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, \"India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions\" - a line that many here applauded. \nThe First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a \"bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West\". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant.\nAustralia's part in the Cop26 summit is overshadowed by politics writes Shaimaa Khalil in Sydney.\nPart of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines.  \nOn Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept \"sledging\" or \"slurs\". \nAnd so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically.\n\"Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic,\" wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. \"And it was never more on show than this week as he sold \"the Australian Way\" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France.\"\nAustralia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad.  \nThe verdict from Australia's ABC News? A \"terribly messy week\" for the prime minister.\nThe climate conference in Scotland feels a long way from the reality of most Brazilians, writes Katy Watson in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nMuch is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here. \nYes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland. \nIt's not that Brazilians don't care.\n\"People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute,\" says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics.\nBut since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. \"What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life,\" Ms Cervellini says. \nAnd that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP.\n\"If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat,\" she says. \"We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this.\"\nMany in Iran believe that it is unfair to expect the country to make any climate commitments while the sanctions remain, writes BBC Persian Service correspondent Siavash Ardalan.\nIran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year, resulting in severe water shortages and electricity blackouts.\nUS sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems.\nOne member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, \"there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions\".\nHowever, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas.\nAlthough the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets.\nA few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26. \nPublic opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence. \nCOP26 is not front page news in Nigeria, writes Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja.\nNigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060.\nThe big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria. \nOn Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed \"persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,\" pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as \"enough evidence\".\nBut he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil.\nThe president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality.\nNo-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate.\nClimate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms.\nEven as Saudi Arabia seeks to achieve net zero by 2060, the country is boosting its oil production, writes Middle East Business Correspondent Sameer Hashmi.\nFor a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions. \nThen last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060. \nBut, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand.\nThe country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by \"demonising\" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables.\nMost officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries. The response by environmental activists though was more muted."

      "text": "There is a very long way to go before all eligible people have received the Covid booster, the Welsh health minister has said.\nEluned Morgan's comments came as around a quarter of those eligible in Wales have had the injection so far. \nBooster jab rates in Wales are currently the highest in the UK.\nBut there are concerns about delays in some areas, and people have said vaccination centres are difficult to travel to.\nThe Welsh government's target is to vaccinate the majority of the most vulnerable groups before the end of the year.\nEurfron Jones, 93, who is housebound, says she contacted the NHS to find out when she could expect it.\n\"They've said it would be up to five weeks before I can have one,\" she said. \n\"What can you do except stand back and wait for it?\"\nHealth boards have been prioritising health and care workers, people with serious health conditions, and those over 80. \nOn 2 November 17.6 % of people aged 12 and over in Wales had been given a third vaccine dose compared with 15% in England, 16.6% in Scotland, and 6.7% in Northern Ireland.\nAccording to official figures, 45.5% of people aged 70 to 74 have received the additional vaccine.\nThe figures are 57.5% for people aged 75 to 79, and over 61% for people over 80.\nMore than 70% of care home residents have received the booster.\nThe procedure with the third dose is different from the first and second vaccines. The Pfizer vaccine must be stored in temperature controlled conditions which makes it less suitable for some locations.\nDr Eilir Hughes, from the Ll\u0177n Peninsula, Gwynedd, said: \"With the Pfizer we have to make sure people stay 15 minutes after getting the booster, and of course with space in some surgeries that's not always easy. \n\"But I think we should use every single resource we have to make sure the booster comes faster to our communities.\"\nThe concerns were raised in the Senedd on Wednesday.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said: \"I'm pleased to say that our booster vaccination rates are among the highest in the UK at the moment.\n\"But of course we have a long way to go again.\"\nMs Morgan went on to say that health boards should make it easier for people to get to the centres.\n\"I know in the Hywel Dda area, for example, there is an opportunity for people to call for transport to go to the [vaccination] centres so I think it's worth checking to see if that service is available in the Betsi Cadwaladr [area].\" \nConcern about delays is not unique to north Wales, with delays in other areas as well.\nBetsi Cadwaladr University Health Board says reaching the housebound takes longer because of all the resources needed to carry the Pfizer vaccine.\nGill Harris, executive director of nursing and midwifery, said over 104,000 boosters had been given since mid-September.\n\"We remain committed to offering the booster to 90% of those eligible by mid-December,\" she said.\n\"We ask people to be patient as they will automatically be invited by letter when it is their turn. There is no need to contact the health board or their GP surgery.\u00a0\n\"Due to the resources involved, it will take longer for us to get booster injections into the arms of housebound patients than those who can travel to the Covid-19 vaccination centre.\"\nShe said vaccination centre staff can give boosters to about 100 people a day, while only about 10 housebound patients can be vaccinated by a team of two nurses in the same time period.\nThe Welsh government said the booster vaccine campaign began as soon as possible after medical advice to do so in mid-September.\u00a0\n\"We are working through the priority groups as quickly and safely as possible,\" said a spokesman."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change,Barack Obama",
      "text": "Barack Obama has called on young people to \"stay angry\" in the fight against climate change at the COP26 summit.\nThe former US president urged them to apply political pressure to make a change, but warned they would need to accept compromises along the way.\nMr Obama said the world is \"nowhere near where we need to be\" to avoid a future climate catastrophe.\nHe criticised Donald Trump's \"active hostility toward climate science\", but said the US is ready to lead again.\nMr Obama also scolded China and Russia's leaders for not physically attending the COP26 summit.\nSpeaking in Glasgow, Mr Obama received rapturous applause when he took to the stage and a standing ovation at the end of his speech - but there was pushback from activists.\nHe called out nations for failing to meet the pledges they made in the 2015 Paris Agreement, when he was in the White House. \nHowever, activists were quick to point out those broken by his own administration, including the failure of a key promise by developed countries to deliver $100bn (\u00a373bn) a year in climate finance to poorer nations.\nPerhaps a little unsure of his location in Scotland, Obama referred to being in the \"Emerald Isles\", seemingly a mistaken reference to Ireland, which is known poetically as the Emerald Isle. He also quoted Shakespeare, who was English.\nHe admitted there is still a lot of hard and messy work to do to reduce the effects of climate change, but said some promising progress had been made in the six years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, which he helped spearhead.\nMr Obama dedicated much of his speech to young activists, who he said were \"right to be frustrated\".\nAddressing young people directly, he said they \"can't ignore politics\" and that while protesting and hashtags raise awareness, they should get involved in politics at some level.\n\"You don't have to be happy about it, but you can't ignore it. You can't be too pure for [politics].\"\nReferencing his own daughters' shopping habits, he also called on young people to support businesses that were committed to sustainability, and boycott those that were not.\nObama's catchphrase of the night was telling young activists to \"stay angry\".\n\"To all the young people out there - I want you to stay angry. I want you to stay frustrated,\" he said.\n\"But channel that anger. Harness that frustration. Keep pushing harder and harder for more and more. Because that's what's required to meet that challenge. Gird yourself for a marathon, not a sprint.\"\nHe honoured the dedication of activists such as Greta Thunberg who are \"forming movements across borders\", and urged young people to at least get out and vote for politicians who will stand against climate change.\n\"Vote like your life depends on it, because it does\", he said.\nThe former president insisted that despite political divisions in the US and the country's absence from global climate efforts for four years during the Trump administration, America was now back on track and committed to change.\nMr Obama made a number of comments about his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, who once called climate change \"an expensive hoax\" and controversially pulled out of the Paris climate accord when he took office. The US rejoined it under Joe Biden.\nMr Obama reserved some of his strongest criticism for the Republican Party. He accused its members of stalling progress by \"sitting on the sidelines\" and making climate change a partisan issue with \"four years of active hostility toward climate science\".\nHe said Republicans who take climate change seriously are \"a rare breed right now.\" This is the first year a delegation of Republicans has attended a UN climate summit.\nMr Obama also blamed the pandemic, rise of US nationalism and a lack of cooperation from the Trump administration for a breakdown in international relations that has affected the climate crisis.\nTaking a swipe at Russia and China, Mr Obama also said it was \"particularly discouraging\" that the leaders of \"two of the world's largest emitters\" had not attended the climate summit in person.\nWhile more than 120 leaders turned up at the conference, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, who have both avoided international travel since the start of the pandemic, opted to take part remotely instead.\nMr Obama said they were showing a \"dangerous lack of urgency\".\nThe 44th US president closed by telling the crowd that fighting climate change will be hard and messy with \"every victory incomplete\".\n\"The thing we have going for us is that humanity has done hard things before,\" he said, adding: \"I believe we can do hard things again.\"\nBarack Obama's speech to COP26 was a study in hope and doubt. \nHe touted the work his administration and that of Joe Biden have accomplished in addressing climate change, while acknowledging he wasn't \"real happy\" about what the Trump administration had done in the intervening four years. \nHe lamented the fierce opposition Republicans have mounted toward addressing climate change in the US and the rise of tribalism and nationalism around the world, but pointed to efforts by states, local governments and private citizens to fill the policy void. \nHe heralded the international co-operation evident during the Paris climate negotiations and in Glasgow over the past week, but said much more needs to be done. He even acknowledged that he doesn't have all the answers and at times gets discouraged, but he said the energy and efforts of young people give him faith in the future.\nIt was a delicate balance for a former president who made \"hope and change\" his trademark line. \nBut the rhetoric was reflective of the tenuous nature of current US climate polices, which are dependent on Democratic majorities that could vanish in coming elections even though, Mr Obama said, there is still much work left to do.

      "text": "Thousands of phone boxes around the UK will be protected from closure.\nOfcom, the UK telecoms regulator, said it will stop BT from closing down 5,000 phone boxes in areas with poor mobile signals or high accident rates, if they are still needed by local communities. \nThe watchdog said that without such protection, some - which are considered \"vital\" - would still have been closed.\nFor the past few years BT has been decommissioning unused payphones.\nNow a phone box will be saved if:\nAt their peak, there were around 92,000 phone boxes in the UK, but now 96% of UK adults own a mobile phone.\nAbout 6,000 of the kiosks have been adopted by local authorities for other purposes, such as book exchanges. \nNow, if no payphone is needed, communities will be able to purchase them for \u00a31 and use them for other purposes.\nSelina Chadha, Ofcom's Director of Connectivity, said: \"Some of the call boxes we plan to protect are used to make relatively low numbers of calls. But if one of those calls is from a distressed child, an accident victim or someone contemplating suicide, that public phone line can be a lifeline at a time of great need.  \n\"We also want to make sure that people without mobile coverage, often in rural areas, can still make calls. At the same time, we're planning to support the rollout of new phone boxes with free Wi-Fi and charging. \n\"Under our plans, BT and KCOM - which operates Hull's unique white phone boxes - must also install batteries in some payphones, so they can still be used during a power cut.\"\nThere are currently about 21,000 call boxes across the country. For people without a mobile, or for those in areas with poor mobile coverage, these can be a lifeline for making calls to friends and family, helpline services and accessing emergency services. \nAlmost 150,000 calls were made to emergency services from phone boxes in the year to May 2020, while 25,000 calls were made to Childline, and 20,000 to the Samaritans.

      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Despite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows.\nIt calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to.\nCOP26 \"has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap\", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT).\nThe Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change.\nBut the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements that included a vow to stop deforestation.\nCOP26 is expected to finish this week.\nThe projection comes as the UK's Met Office warns that a billion people could be affected by fatal heat and humidity if the global average temperature rises by 2C above pre-industrial levels.\nThe report by Climate Action Tracker looks at promises made by governments before and during COP26. \nIt concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree.\nScientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening.\nThe COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included \"pursuing efforts\" to keep warming under 1.5C.\nBut when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.\n\"This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,\" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan.\nHowever, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C.\nClimate Action Tracker blames \"stalled momentum\" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\nIt says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low.\nReaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere.\nMore than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions.\nBut Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated \"acceptable\", covering a fraction of the world's emissions.\n\"If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,\" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker.\nThe main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes.\nWith one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference. \nFor days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C.\nThat seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference. \nSo how has the confusion come about?\nThe problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050. \nMore than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070.\nAccording to the CAT, these goals are giving \"false hope\". \nBased on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C.\nIf every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible.\nBut the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised.\nThat's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years. \nAny deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure. \nThe summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week:"

      "tags": "Fertility,Frimley,LGBT,NHS",
      "text": "A lesbian couple are launching a landmark judicial review against their NHS Clinical Commissioning Group for its \"discriminatory\" fertility policy. \nInfluencers Megan and Whitney Bacon-Evans say they are required to undergo 12 rounds of costly private treatment before they can get NHS support.\nHeterosexual couples have to try to conceive for two years before becoming eligible for NHS-funded treatment. \nCCG Frimley, the subject of the review, says its policies comply with guidance.\nThe social media stars, who were featured on TV show Say Yes To The Dress, and run a lifestyle and travel blog, have been together for 13 years and married for four. \nThey say they were \"shocked and devastated to discover the discrimination that lesbian couples, bisexual women and individuals with wombs face in starting their family\".\n\"For many years we have been talking about wanting to create our family - we've had our children's names picked out for a decade,\" Megan told the BBC. \n\"There isn't much information out there so everything was new for us, and as we went along we found out there were a lot of barriers and discrimination. \n\"With equal marriage coming in, we thought we were equal in the eyes of the law, but not when it comes to starting a family.\"\nThe Bacon-Evans have launched the suit with the law firm Leigh Day, which is applying to proceed with the judicial review on Tuesday.\n\"Our clients believe that Frimley CCG's policy is blatantly discriminatory on grounds of their sexual orientation and puts them at a huge financial disadvantage by treating them less favourably than heterosexual couples in a comparable situation,\" solicitor Anna Dews said.\nRecommendations as to who can have NHS-funded fertility treatment in England and Wales are set by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  guidelines. \nNICE suggests women aged under 40 should be offered three cycles of IVF treatment on the NHS, which otherwise costs between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000 a round, if:\nHowever, it is up to individual CCGs to set the policy for their local area, and their criteria can vary. \nThe couple say it was so difficult to discover the fertility treatment policy for LGBT couples in their local area that they submitted a Freedom of Information request to find out.\nThey eventually managed to book an appointment with a fertility doctor who told them they must go through six rounds of private treatment, but later found out that the minimum number was 12, which could cost up to \u00a326,000.\nThe couple estimate that the true cost of having a child as a female same-sex couple, or as a single woman, is between \u00a330,000 and \u00a350,000 once the private treatment, cost of sperm and storage are factored in.\nMore than one in four CCGs in England require couples to pay for 10 to 12 cycles of treatment before they become eligible for NHS help, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS).\n\"Our research has found that female same-sex couples and single women are disproportionately impacted by policies which require that they self-finance costly, and less effective, artificial insemination, in some cases for at least two years, before becoming eligible for funded IVF,\" says Marta Jansa Perez, director of embryology at BPAS Fertility.\n\"These restrictions amount to a tax on LGBT+ families, and the impact can be truly devastating.\"\nThe couple say they hope the precedents set by their case will help thousands of other same-sex couples to have a family. \nThey have launched a crowdfunding appeal to raise \u00a310,000 to help cover the cost of the case, and have pledged to donate the money to charity or to others fighting similar legal battles if they win.\nIn 2019, then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged that \"sexual orientation should not be a factor in access to IVF\".\nBut research from the UK fertility regulator found 14% of female same-sex couples had received NHS-funded IVF cycles, compared with 39% of heterosexual patients. Only 6% of single patients had been given NHS-funded treatments.\nThe Stonewall charity is supporting the launch of the Bacon-Evans' case and calling for all prospective parents to have access to six rounds of funded IUI, and then to three rounds of IVF if that is unsuccessful.\n\"Being lesbian, bisexual or LGBTQ+ is a social rather than medical infertility and everyone - regardless of where they live and who they love - should be able to start a family if they want,\" Stonewall's associate director of policy and research, Eloise Stonborough, said.\n\"There is a huge variation and inequality in the system for everyone, but LGBTQ couples are disproportionally affected, meaning many are faced with either pursuing costly private treatment or risky personal deals such as going online to find private donors.\"\nA spokesperson for NHS Frimley CCG said: \"The fertility services we provide are based on NICE guidance. While we can't comment on individual cases we will fully engage with any legal proceedings,\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It will become compulsory for frontline NHS staff in England to be fully vaccinated against Covid, the health secretary has confirmed.\nSajid Javid told MPs that he expected to set a deadline for the beginning of April to give 103,000 unvaccinated workers time to get both jabs.\nHe said the move would help protect patients and the NHS as a whole.\nBut concerns have been raised that it could lead some workers to leave, adding to healthcare staffing issues.\nMore than 93% of NHS frontline staff have had their first dose and 90% are fully vaccinated, Javid said. That is higher than the general working-age population, where about 81% have had both doses.\nThe government's decision follows a consultation which considered whether both the Covid and flu jabs should be compulsory.\nMr Javid said the flu vaccine would not be made mandatory. \nThose with a medical reason not to have the Covid jab would be exempt, he said, as would those who do not have face-to-face contact with patients.\nIn a Commons statement, Mr Javid said compulsory vaccination would \"protect patients in the NHS, protect colleagues in the NHS and, of course, protect the NHS itself\". \nHe said the requirement would be enforced 12 weeks after parliamentary approval - likely to be from April. \nNo unvaccinated worker should be \"scapegoated or shamed\", said Mr Javid, and should instead be supported to make \"a positive choice\".\nThursday is the deadline for care home workers in England to get vaccinated.\nEach of the four UK nations makes its own decisions on the issue. \nScotland and Wales have not made any proposals to make Covid jabs compulsory for NHS workers or care home staff, while in Northern Ireland there is to be a public consultation.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents England's NHS trusts, said: \"We understand why people are vaccine-hesitant. We need to win the argument with them rather than beat them around the head.\"\nThe possibility of losing staff was a \"real problem\" as the NHS runs on fine margins and already relies on staff to work extra shifts, he added.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged Mr Javid to proceed with caution - pointing to waiting lists \"close to six million\" and more than 90,000 job vacancies across the NHS.\nThere will be anxiety that chronic understaffing problems could be exacerbated, he said. \"We simply cannot afford to lose thousands of NHS staff overnight.\"\nThe logic behind this move is obvious - the virus presents a real risk to vulnerable people in hospital and the vaccine reduces the chances of infection and transmission.\nSo it's not hard to understand why insisting on jabs for staff who have contact with patients will, in theory, help protect patients.\nBut if it causes more staffing shortages that simply increases risk in another way.\nThere are already more than 90,000 vacancies in the NHS in England. It is a number that has actually fallen during the pandemic after staff put off retiring to help out.\nIf those staff take up their option to retire and mandatory vaccination forces others out, the NHS could find itself severely short of staff come the spring.\nMandatory vaccination comes into force for the care sector this week. Since it was announced, only two-thirds of the unvaccinated have come forward.\nIf a similar trend is seen for the NHS, vacancies would likely balloon to unprecedented levels.\nUnison head of health Sara Gorton said she feared the move might knock staff morale further and prompt workers to leave - or lose their job.\nThe government should consider alternatives like daily testing, she said, and not risk making the same mistake made with mandatory jabs in social care - which she said had led to an unprecedented staffing crisis.\nFrom Thursday, care homes will be required to refuse entry to workers who have not been fully vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption or there is an emergency.\nMr Javid said that since announcing the requirement for care staff, the number of unvaccinated workers in the sector has fallen from 88,000 to 32,000 in the last month.\nDouglas Ferguson, a surgeon at Exeter Hospital, said it was the government's responsibility to protect the population, describing the policy as \"quite sensible\". \n\"I think, to be honest, if people who don't want to be vaccinated feel that an injection, which is very well scientifically researched, is something that they decide they're going to change their entire career for, it seems unwise, I would say.\" \nOverall, Mr Ferguson thought the move was likely to be welcomed by staff.\n\"If all the staff know everybody else is vaccinated - I mean the majority are already anyway - I think it would give further confidence in you doing your job and potentially from those members of staff also.\" \nHe added that he only knew of one colleague who had chosen not to be vaccinated. \nThe latest NHS figures show vaccination rates vary hugely: among hospitals, Dorset County hospital has the highest at 94.6%, while Barts Health NHS Trust has the lowest rate of fully vaccinated staff, at 79.7%.\nAt Southampton General Hospital, frontline workers were told by letter in September they would face redeployment if they did not get vaccinated.\nOne worker, who has been redeployed after refusing to get the vaccine, said it was \"disappointing\" but not unexpected that jabs would be made compulsory for NHS workers.\nShe said she felt it was against her human rights to be forced to take the vaccination and said it should be her decision.\n\"I'm angry,\" she said. \"Probably I will just go and get it, what other options have I got?\"\nUniversity Hospital Southampton Trust, which runs the hospital, said a \"small number\" of staff had been redeployed to jobs away from patients as part of its strategy to prevent infection. \nThey were being offered advice and guidance about the vaccine and their permanent jobs and pay were protected, it said.\nSome countries have already introduced compulsory vaccination - including France, which had to suspend 3,000 unvaccinated healthcare workers in September.\nMore than 45.8 million people in the UK have had two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, meaning 79.8% of people aged over 12 are fully vaccinated, while 87.5% have had a first dose.\nVaccinated people have a lower risk of catching Covid and are less likely to become seriously ill or need to go to hospital, but there is still a chance they can transmit the virus.\nThe number of daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 remains high but Tuesday was the sixth day in a row that the figure came in under 40,000, with 33,559 cases reported. A further 262 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, down from 293 for the same day last week.\nCorrection: This story has been amended to make clear that Barts Health NHS Trust has the lowest vaccine take-up rate among trusts running hospitals in England, and not Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust as previously stated."

I think we need to look at those laws again and actually make them fit for purpose.\"\nThere have been numerous prosecutions of pimping and sex trafficking involving people who have used Vivastreet to advertise the women they are exploiting.\nIn one case in the north-west of England, a man - Catalin Mihailescu - spent \u00a325,000 placing adverts on Vivastreet in 2017. The website even gave him his own personal account manager.\nDet Sgt Stuart Peall, who runs the exploitation team at Lancashire Police, told Panorama that the cases he has worked on all involve Vivastreet.\n\"Every single job is Vivastreet, they advertise over Vivastreet,\" he said. \"It is very common knowledge that if you need sexual services, Vivastreet is the place that you will find it. You can arrange what you want the girl to look like - it's like a takeaway menu.\" \nPanorama investigated a man in Northern Ireland who was running at least three brothels in Belfast and advertising the women on Vivastreet.\nThe programme tracked him as he picked up three different women from the airport and transported them to his brothels.\nPanorama's evidence suggested he was trafficking women and that they were also being advertised on Vivastreet. \nThe website says it proactively reports suspicious content to police forces around the country and assists with prosecutions. \n\"We take any allegations of exploitation extremely seriously and have a range of stringent measures in place to detect criminality, remove bad actors and block users identified as high risk,\" says Vivastreet. \n\"This year alone, more than 29,000 ads have been rejected outright and not allowed on the site.\"\nThe company says its staff have been trained so they are alert to the signs of exploitation and know what steps to take if they suspect trafficking.\nIt says it is working with the National Crime Agency and the Home Office to develop an industry-wide approach to preventing exploitation and online trafficking."

We love you so much our sweet, sweet boy.\"\nPolice have not yet been able to confirm the breed of the dog which has been described as \"large and powerful\".\nGwent Police said the animal belonged to the occupant of the house where Jack was killed.\nA neighbour said someone had gone running to intervene and wrestle the dog off at the house in Pentwyn, Penyrheol.\nJack was a pupil at Cwm Ifor Primary School in Caerphilly, whose head teacher, Gareth Rees, said the whole school community \"has been rocked by the tragic events of the past 24 hours\".\nOfficers were called to the house at 15:55 GMT on Monday following reports of a dog attack. \nCh Supt Mark Hobrough, of Gwent Police, confirmed the attack \"did not happen in the house owned by Jack's family, but inside another property on a nearby street\". \nHe said the dog had been acting \"extremely aggressively\".\nThe force is waiting for an expert witness to formally identify the traits of the dog.\nCh Supt Hobrough said it was \"no doubt dangerous, hazardous and harrowing\" for both the officers attending and the local community. \nPeople at the scene used a distraction technique to get Jack out at \"the first available opportunity\", he said.\nPeople have started to leave flowers at the house where the attack happened - \"RIP Little One\" is one of the messages.\nMany have described the panic and chaos of the scenes yesterday as police arrived on the scene.\nThose officers remain outside the house today, with forensic officers now in and out gathering evidence.\nThe house is in the middle of a large housing estate, family homes with kids' toys in the gardens of many of the houses. \nToday, the shock and sadness in the community is clear - a murky and wet day in Caerphilly mirrors the mood of many. \nParamedics were also called to the scene, where Jack was pronounced dead.\n\"My condolences and thoughts are with Jack's family, friends, school friends and everyone affected by this within the community,\" Ch Supt Hobrough added.\n\"Officers are continuing to make further inquiries at this time and will remain at the scene as the investigation progresses.\"\nNeighbours described being alerted to \"screaming\" in the street on Monday afternoon. \nResident Lorraine Irvine said: \"The kids - they were hysterical. \n\"And within minutes I've never seen so many police cars in my life.\"\nNeighbour Tracey Lawrence said: \"The little boy that lives there ran over to a neighbour saying the dog was attacking his friend and the neighbour couldn't help and couldn't save the boy.\"\nAnother resident, Ricky Willis, said: \"The first I heard of it my neighbour knocked on my door, it's a big shock.\n\"I've lived on this road for 46 years and I've never seen anything like this happen.\"\nOne neighbour, who asked not to be named, described the scene as \"chaos\".\nWhile another said: \"I feel sick to my stomach thinking about what happened to that boy.\"\nHead teacher Mr Rees described Jack as a \"bright and caring pupil who was popular amongst his peers and the teaching staff\".\n\"Our thoughts are very much with his family at this difficult time and we now need time and space to heal together as a school community.\"\nHe said support was being made available for pupils and staff over the coming days \"as we come to terms with this devastating news\".\nCouncillor Steven Skivens, who represents the Penyrheol ward on Caerphilly council, described it as \"an absolutely devastating incident with the loss of such a young life\".\nHe said Jack's family would need time to grieve and \"will need space to get over this incident, if that's possible\".\nSpeaking at First Minister's Questions, Mark Drakeford said: \"You can just imagine the impact this will have on those very young children who know him and who would have, in some cases, very sadly witnessed those awful events.\"\n\"Members here will be thinking about Jack and his family,\" he said, in response to a question by Hefin David, the Member of the Senedd for Caerphilly.\n\"I'm sure that everyone in this chamber would wish to send their condolences and best thoughts to the family and the community of Penyrheol who undoubtedly will rally round in these circumstances,\" said Mr David.

      "text": "So how much progress has really been made in the opening days of COP26 and what are the main challenges that lie ahead?\nTo paraphrase COP26 president Alok Sharma, this is the moment when the rubber is finally meeting the road. \nAfter a first week dominated by a blizzard of announcements of new initiatives in the real world, the conference is now moving into the critical, behind doors phase of the negotiations.\nThe main focus will still be on devising a plan to bend the temperature curve below 1.5C.\nThere has been quite a bit of speculation that the first week announcements made by countries and the new pledges on methane and coal have already moved the needle on the rise in global temperatures that's likely this century. \nAccording to the head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, the new commitments mean that the mercury rise may be held to 1.8C. \nAt the start of the COP the latest analysis from the UN suggested a rise of 2.7C. \nSo just how real is this large predicted drop?\n\"None of the countries that has a net zero target has implemented sufficient short term policies to put itself on a trajectory towards net zero,\" said Dr Niklas H\u00f6hne, from the New Climate Institute, who monitor and assess national carbon cutting plans.\n\"Right now it's more a vision, or imagination. And it's not matched by action.\"\nAs one participant explained it, the first week of COP26 was all sugar rush, the second will be about sobering up and getting down to business. \nNext week will see ministers fly in from around the world to tackle the tricky issues that negotiators themselves can't resolve. \nThese will encompass a range of technical issues relating to the Paris agreement that have been outstanding for a number of years, including the rules on how carbon markets work, on the need for transparent reporting, and for common time frames on emission cutting plans. \nSome progress has been reported, but there are still wide gaps between the parties across these questions.\nAs deadlines loom, negotiators are getting nervous.\n\"It is tense right now, people are having to take tough decisions, as they should,\" said Archie Young, the UK's lead negotiator in the talks. \n\"I think it is really important that we recognise the hard work that goes into the importance of some of that technical work.\"\nThere will also be detailed and tough discussions around finance, around the question of adaptation, and loss and damage. \nThere is likely to be a real standoff over the question of how cash for climate change is spent. \nDespite repeated calls from developing countries for a larger share of the finance to be used to help them to adapt to higher temperatures, the focus according to observers is still on using the money to help them cut emissions. \nThe cold reality is that investors are more willing to put their money into renewable energy projects where a profit can be made than they are to spend it on sea walls or other adaptive measures that do not guarantee a return.\n\"Rich countries publicly claim they care about adaptation but inside the talks most of the money goes on emission reductions and they undermine efforts to prioritise the adaptation needs of vulnerable nations,\" said Mohamed Adow, from the Power Shift Africa organisation, an observer at these talks. \nThe failure of the richer nations to fulfil their promise of $100bn by 2020 has undoubtedly damaged trust, there is work underway to put in place a new, more substantial payment from 2025. \nWhile the new figure is unlikely to be agreed here, the prospect of a very significant increase could go some way towards ensuring that finance doesn't derail these talks completely.\nFor the UK though the really big question is how to construct a final document that will be agreed collectively by the conference that will keep the 1.5C temperature threshold within reach. \nUK negotiators are taking soundings on what's termed a \"cover decision\", a package of measures that will try to close the gap between what the world's commitments add up to and the 1.5C bar. \nThe key element of that package will be an attempt to get countries to update and improve their carbon cutting plans more regularly than every five years as is presently the case. \nThe most vulnerable want an annual update. There's also a push for countries to come back with new plans in two years time.\nThere is likely to be strong opposition from larger, developing economies. But there is a belief that steps will be agreed.\n\"You clearly want some processes agreed here that give us hope that countries are going to come back and sharpen their pencils and put more ambition on the table,\" said Alden Meyer, a long time participant in climate talks from the E3G think tank.\n\"I think if we get the atmospherics, right and the UK uses the ministers well, by the end of next week, we can get substantial movement.\"\n\"It will offer some hope that over the next couple of years, we can start to really close that gap.\"\nMatt McGrath has been covering climate change for the past 15 years, reporting from 10 COPs along the way.

      "tags": "Christmas,Retailing,Inflation,UK economy,Food",
      "text": "Food prices are rising at their fastest pace since August 2020, figures from data firm Kantar suggest, as supply chain disruption continues.\nGrocery inflation rose to 2.1% in October - the highest rate since last year, when retailers were cutting promotions amid the Covid pandemic.\nLast week, the Bank of England confounded market expectations by holding interest rates.\nBut with overall inflation heading for about 5%, a rate rise is expected soon.\nSupply chains have been under pressure from factors including the pandemic and a shortage of lorry drivers.\nRetail and hospitality groups warned MPs on Tuesday that gaps on shelves and inflationary pressures would continue for the months ahead.\nKantar said that the fastest rising food prices included savoury snacks, canned colas and crisps. \nHowever, prices fell for products such as fresh bacon, vegetables and cat and dog treats.\n\"Grocery prices are rising and this month inflation hit its highest rate since August 2020, when retailers were still cutting promotions to maintain stock on the shelves,\" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.\n\"As prices increase in certain categories, we can expect shoppers to continue to visit several supermarkets and shop around to find the best deals.\"\nOfficial figures showed overall UK inflation dipped slightly in September, with the rate falling to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in October.\nHowever, Shore Capital research analyst Clive Black said that some people were \"struggling to believe\" the inflation numbers from the Office for National Statistics.\nHe said the figures were \"increasingly treated not with scepticism but incredulity as prices from fuel, energy, food, and building materials rise, offset by what?\"\nFuel and oil prices have risen rapidly as economies start to pick up after being battered by the coronavirus pandemic, and as the Opec oil producers' cartel gradually increases output.\nShortages and bottlenecks in goods including building materials and computer chips have also pushed up prices.\nBusinesses are having difficulties recruiting workers to drive lorries, pick and process food and to staff bars, hotels and restaurants.\nThis is partly to do with the pandemic but is being compounded by Brexit, according to international policy forum the OECD.\nHowever, the Bank of England's deputy governor Ben Broadbent stated the pandemic is having a greater impact on labour shortages than Brexit currently.\nMr Broadbent stressed that it's not just a case of losing migrants as workers - but also their spending power in the economy, as many EU workers were younger and economically active.\nHe added the pandemic has led to a fall in the active workforce that is \"not unique\" to the UK, shown by the retirement of HGV drivers and younger restaurant staff choosing to go into education. \nKate Nicholls, chief executive officer of UK Hospitality, warned that prices charged by hospitality businesses such as restaurants, bars and hotels were set to rise after Christmas.\nSpeaking to the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee on Tuesday, she said that many Christmas events offered by her members had been pre-booked, which made it harder to push through price increases to cover higher costs.\n\"You're going to see a really intense squeeze on margins in the run-up to Christmas,\" she said, but then prices were likely to rise in the new year.\n\"Some of our businesses are anticipating three price increases to consumers going through before we get to April.\"\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, told MPs it \"will be Christmas as we know it\" in shops, but the range of products will be reduced, as is already the case in lots of food categories.\nSeveral retailers have reported that customers are planning ahead for Christmas and shopping early amid concerns over shortages of stock.\nKantar data supported this, with the firm saying that 4.7 million households bought mince pies this month.\nFrozen poultry sales are 27% higher compared with last year, with people spending an additional \u00a36.1m in the past four weeks.\nIn addition, 1.6 million households bought their Christmas pudding in October as well, which is 400,000 more than last year, Kantar said.\nCustomers are getting used to seeing gaps on shelves, and menu items missing in restaurants, and we're already shopping differently as a result. \nGone are the days of the Christmas Eve mega-shop where you pile everything you need into an impossible to push trolley. Now we're buying early, freezing more, and throwing in a few extra bits when they are available, just in case.\nIt's almost impossible for businesses to predict what those holes will be from one week to the next, as worker shortages in the supply chain continue to cause problems. \nThat means we'll not only be shopping around to try and save money as prices rise, but we'll also have to try different stores at different moments just to get everything on the list.

      "text": "A man who survived after being shot by a US teenager during racial justice protests in Wisconsin has told a court that he pointed his own gun, but had no intention of firing it.\nGaige Grosskreutz was the third person to be shot by Kyle Rittenhouse in the city of Kenosha on 25 August 2020.\nHe said he thought Mr Rittenhouse was an \"active shooter\" when he drew his own gun and advanced on him.\nMr Rittenhouse then opened fire, shooting him in the arm, he said. \nLawyers for Mr Rittenhouse argue that he was acting in self-defence. The 18-year-old has denied six charges, including reckless homicide, intentional homicide and recklessly endangering safety.\nRiots erupted in Kenosha in August 2020 after police shot a black man. Mr Rittenhouse had travelled to the city from his home in Illinois the day before and, with a semi-automatic rifle in tow, he claimed he sought to help protect property from unrest on the streets.\nMr Grosskreutz, 27, was at the protest volunteering as a medic and said in court that he was affiliated with a social justice group called the People's Revolution Movement, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nUnder tense cross-examination on Monday, the defendant's lawyer, Corey Chirafisi, asked Mr Grosskreutz: \"When you were standing three to five feet from him with your arms up in the air, he never fired, right?\"\n\"Correct,\" Mr Grosskreutz said.\n\"It wasn't until you pointed your gun at him, advanced on him, with your gun, now your hands down pointed at him, that he fired, right?\" Mr Chirafisi continued.\n\"Correct,\" Mr Grosskreutz said.\nHe said he did not mean to point the gun at Mr Rittenhouse and also denied he had been chasing after the teen, who was aged 17 at the time. \nAsked what was going through his mind as he got close to Mr Rittenhouse, he said: \"That I was going to die.\"\n\"I was never trying to kill the defendant. In that moment, I was trying to preserve my own life, but doing so while taking the life of another is not something I am capable or comfortable doing,\" he told the court.  \nArmed with a semi-automatic rifle, Mr Rittenhouse had just fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, who had swung a skateboard at him. Mr Rittenhouse and the men he shot are all white.\nMr Grosskreutz was shot in the right bicep, causing severe damage to his arm. Pictures of his wound were shown to the jury, causing some to look away in discomfort, according to court reporters. \nMr Grosskreutz was the 16th witness to testify for the prosecution. Mr Rittenhouse's defence team are expected to call their own witnesses after the prosecution closes on Tuesday.  \nThe rioting broke out in Kenosha after police shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back on 23 August 2020. A woman had called police to say Mr Blake was at her home in violation of a restraining order. Mr Blake, who had a knife, was getting into a car where his three children were seated when police opened fire. He survived but was paralysed from the waist down.\nBystander video captures Mr Rittenhouse being chased into the car park of a used-car dealership by Mr Rosenbaum.\nMoments later, unseen on video, Mr Rittenhouse fires four times and kills Mr Rosenbaum.\nAs he runs down the street away from the scene, Mr Rittenhouse falls and multiple people converge upon him.\nMr Huber hits Mr Rittenhouse in the head and neck with a skateboard. Mr Rittenhouse kills him with a bullet to the stomach.\nMr Grosskreutz approaches him with a pistol in hand. Mr Rittenhouse wounds him with a shot in the arm.\nIf convicted of the most serious charges, he could spend decades in prison."

      "tags": "Greenhouse gas emissions,Our Planet Now,Carbon dioxide,Extinction,Effects of global warming,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life.\nLeft unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species. \nWe face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.\nClimate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.\nThe rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. \nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nTemperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100. \nHowever, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. A report in 2021 by the Climate Action Tracker group calculated that the world was heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of the century.\nIf nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C in the future, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species. \nExtreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. \nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nPeople in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.\nOur oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.\nWildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather. \nAnd as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\nIn a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.\nScientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken. \nClimate change has different effects in different areas of the world. Some places will warm more than others, some will receive more rainfall and others will face more droughts. \nIf temperature rise cannot be kept within 1.5C:\nCountries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. \nThe UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction plans for 2030. \nMany countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\nExperts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.\nMajor changes need to come from governments and businesses, but scientists say some small changes in our lives can limit our impact on the climate:\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "tags": "Atlantic Ocean,Climate change,Environment",
      "text": "Researchers studying the ocean at depths of up to 6km have found that climate change has a \"worrying\" effect on its ability to lock away carbon. \nThe latest discovery comes from the International \"i-Atlantic\" project. \nIt has revealed that - if global temperatures increase to levels predicted - the ocean will not be able to provide what is currently Earth's largest long-term carbon store.    \nOne third of the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere dissolves in the ocean.\u00a0\nIt therefore acts as an important buffer against rising temperatures.\nCarbon is one of the chemical elements in the key planet-warming gas carbon dioxide (CO2). When that gas dissolves in the ocean, it is taken up by marine plants and animals becomes part of an ocean cycle that results in some of it being locked into the deep ocean mud for centuries.\nBillions of tonnes of carbon is buried in the deep ocean's muddy floor. But this latest research shows that this cycle is disrupted by rising ocean temperatures. \nThe study revealed a \"cycle of warming\"; ocean temperature rise causes more of this buried carbon to be released as CO2, where it can contribute to yet more global warming.\nIn experiments carried out from the Spanish research vessel Sarmiento de Gamboa, scientists used tethered, robotic sample collectors to bring tubes of seafloor mud into their ocean laboratories. \nThey then incubated those samples at deep ocean temperatures that are currently predicted for the end of this century. \n\"This deep 'abyssal' ocean covers 60% of our planet and we're finding that, under higher temperatures, we can store less carbon in these places,\" said Prof Murray Roberts from the University of Edinburgh. \n\"The ecosystems are turning the carbon over faster. They're running at a higher temperature more quickly, and they're going to release more carbon in the future.\"\nProf Roberts said these experiments, which were led by Prof Andrew Sweetman's team at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University, showed that human activity had changed the \"very nature\" of the vast ocean. \n\"As well as our carbon emissions, the ocean has absorbed over 90% of global heating,\" he explained. \"And if we don't understand [the impact of this] well enough, we can't make the most accurate models in the future.\"\nThe need to understand more about the ocean's response to climate change, he added, was being brought into sharp focus by the negotiations at the COP26 climate summit - about how global leaders tackle the crisis. \nThe same research project, funded by the European Commission, recently discovered  a dozen new ocean species in the Atlantic.  \nProfessor Daniela Schmidt, from the University of Bristol, who was not involved in this research, and who studies the causes and effects of climate change in the ocean, told BBC News: \"It's often said that we know more about the surface of the Moon than we do about the deep ocean, and it's true. \n\"It's the largest habitat on Planet Earth.\"\nBecause it's so vast, and so poorly understood, Prof Schmidt added, \"the worry is that we'll start destroying those ecosystems - and perturb all these vital processes - that we really don't understand\".\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "tags": "Companies,Associated British Foods,Retailing,Primark,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Discount fashion chain Primark has said it could face disruption from global supply chain issues into 2023, but it assured customers that \"we are getting the goods we need\".\nChief executive George Weston told the BBC that Primark shops would be properly stocked for Christmas. \nThe chain had prioritised seasonal items, he said.\n\"We do not see any crisis developing as we look forward - it's just more difficult,\" he added.\nStore closures during Covid lockdowns hit the retailer's annual sales, down by 12% on pre-Covid levels.\nIts parent firm, AB Foods, said Primark had lost one-third of its trading days in the 53 weeks to 18 September.\nBut it added that it expected higher profits in the new financial year.\nMr Weston said that despite difficulties with clogged ports and the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, the \"vast majority\" of items stocked by Primark were still available, subject to some minor gaps.\n\"Your size in basic T-shirts might not be available on a certain day, but it might be the next day,\" he said.\nIn its latest results, Primark also announced big expansion plans, with new stores due to open in the US, France, Italy and Spain.\nOverall, it said its total store numbers would grow from 398 to 530 over the next five years, with the number of US outlets set to rise from 13 to 60.\nMr Weston said Primark was now established in the US, adding: \"It's no longer a punt - it's a rollout of a business we understand, to customers we know well.\"\nDespite the negative impact of the pandemic, Primark has found that some habits that became established under lockdown are working to its advantage.\nFor its autumn and winter range, the retailer said it was capitalising on the continued trend for \"comfort living\" and loungewear with the launch of what it called the \"snuddie\" - a \"snuggly oversized hoodie\", designed for \"those lazy days when your comfiest clothes just don't cut it\".\nPrimark said the snuddie was \"attracting a strong response from customers across all markets\", with best-selling versions including an avocado print for men and a Minnie Mouse design for children.\nUnlike most High Street retailers, Primark has no online retail operations.\nIt plans to overhaul its website early next year to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can \"browse online, before they come into our stores\". \nDespite its digital revamp, Mr Weston said Primark still had no plans to allow shoppers to order its products for home delivery.\n\"We've never said never to things like click-and-collect, but we're first and foremost a bricks-and-mortar retailer and we will remain very profitable as that,\" he added.\nAB Foods said its adjusted pre-tax profits had fallen by 1% to \u00a3908m for the year, with the dip in sales at Primark offset by \"strong\" sales in its food business.\nThe firm's chairman, Michael McLintock, said sales and profit were again below pre-Covid levels, but praised the \"agility\" of Primark's management in responding to \"the fast-changing and wide range of trading restrictions applied to our stores over the year\". \n\"The strength of Primark's sales after the reopening of all our stores in the spring demonstrated the relevance and appeal of our value-for-money offering,\" he added.\nMr McLintock said AB Foods - which, as well as running Primark, also owns food brands such as Twinings, Ovaltine and Patak's - was seeing \"significant cost increases in energy, logistics and commodities, in addition to the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations\". \n\"Primark is not immune to the challenges of supply chain, raw material cost and labour rate inflation,\" he said.\n\"Our businesses are working to offset the impact of these through cost savings. Where necessary, our food businesses will also implement price increases,\" he added.\nWhen asked if these cost savings could lead to job losses, Mr Weston said: \"No, we're recruiting staff, not cutting.\"\nHowever, he added that Primark saw opportunities to make existing workers more productive, giving the example of how it had automated a warehouse in the Netherlands while keeping staff levels the same.\nThe pandemic has proved costly for Primark. It lost \u00a32bn in sales last year when its stores had to close. A third of its trading days were lost. But it's weathered the storm. \nAll things being equal, it now hopes to more than make up the lost ground, assuming trading comes back to normal next year. And it has big plans for international expansion, with new stores in the US, France, Italy and Spain over the next five years. \nBut Primark's having to paddle hard to mitigate all the cost pressures now building up. Although AB Foods' food business is putting prices up where necessary, passing costs on to shoppers is less easy to do at its fast-fashion chain.\nPrimark says thanks to the weaker dollar and the steps it's taken to lower store costs, it hopes to broadly offset all the rising supply chain costs and inflationary pressures bearing down on the industry. \nMr Weston said Primark had \"delivered a good performance in the face of continued disruption to trading caused by the pandemic\".\n\"Although the possibility of further trading restrictions cannot be ruled out, we expect Primark to deliver a much-improved margin and profit next year,\" he added.\nAB Foods' share price rose by 6% to \u00a319.67 on Tuesday.

      "tags": "NHS Scotland,Nursing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A nurse who worked in ICU through the pandemic has said she had to leave the profession because the pressure was too much to bear. \nFormer critical care nurse Chloe Burke told BBC Scotland she felt selfish leaving but did not see another option. \nShe said many of her colleagues had told her they would leave too if they had other jobs to go to. \nUnions have warned of the impact of staffing shortages with a 7% nursing and midwifery vacancy rate. \nChloe said other nurses had encouraged her to speak up about the pressures they are currently facing. \nShe said many of them would like to speak up but feel unable to while they still work for the NHS. \nChloe qualified as a nurse four years ago. During the pandemic she worked in intensive care at an Edinburgh hospital, looking after the sickest patients. \nShe said staff shortages, sickness, and ongoing pressures made it harder and harder to do her job.\n\"No-one could help,\" she said. \"Management couldn't help, everyone was trying to do their best in order to cover the shifts, but you don't have the manpower and you see your colleagues are suffering so try and cover more shifts so you are doing more than you should be doing. \n\"You just become more tired, and that goes for most nurses\"\nIn August this year she decided she had to step away. She said: \"I didn't think I would have to come to that decision. I didn't realise how much of an impact it was going to have on me, my mental health and my physical health. \n\"I started to have panic attacks and feel so overwhelmed, there were a few shifts when I came home and I was in tears and I was inconsolable\"\n\"I couldn't sustain things.\"\nRecruiting nurses has been a long-term issue for the NHS.  \nDespite record numbers of staff working for the health service, recent figures from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) show more than 7% of nursing and midwifery posts are vacant - that's a record high and equates to almost 5,000 posts. \nUnions have warned that shortages are compromising patient care. While other unions have accepted a 4% pay offer, the RCN is to announce results of a ballot on industrial action later this week. \nHilary Nelson, a ICU nurse and safety representative with the RCN, said the pay deal was critical for attracting more people to the profession and stopping nurses leaving. \nShe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: \"Nursing is tired. It's suffering a lot of stress and the pressure is not going away.\n\"There are not enough nurses for our members to do the job they are expected to do. We just don't have the workforce to do the job in hand. \n\"If you pay nurses more it will attract people into the profession.\"\nScottish government Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: \"NHS Scotland nurses are the best paid in the UK, and the pay deal, which has been agreed by the majority of unions and NHS staff, is the biggest pay rise in at least 20 years which saw staff receive an average 4% pay increase backdated to 1 December 2020. \n\"Every staff member up to and including Band 7 got an uplift of at least \u00a31,000.\"\nChloe said the public did not appreciate the toll the job takes on nurses - especially during the pandemic, when she said it was \"very scary\" to work in ICU.\nFor example, she said she saw former colleagues have panic attacks as they put on their PPE.\nShe added: \"We have to unfortunately be the hand to hold as someone passes away, that's very, very hard. They are the things people don't know you go through as a nurse.\"\nSometimes she would not see her partner for three weeks because of her shifts. She often felt compelled to do extra shifts because she could see how much her colleagues were struggling when they were short staffed. \nLeaving nursing was not about the money, but she said she did feel undervalued. \nShe's now moved back to the Irish countryside to work in the family business while she studies, before embarking on a new career in the property market. \nShe says she would love to return to nursing - but it would take a big change in working conditions for her to consider it.\n\"I felt so guilty, really really guilty that I was leaving all my colleagues and the profession and guilty as well for the patients.  \n\"And sad because I really, really enjoyed it and the friends I've made there and the people that I worked with were one of a kind, but I had to be selfish unfortunately.\""

      "tags": "NI Brexit,DUP (Democratic Unionist Party),Brexit,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson",
      "text": "Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said little progress appears to have been made in talks between the UK government and EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nHe was speaking after meeting Brexit Minister Lord Frost on Monday.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is the Brexit trade deal aimed at avoiding a hard Irish border.\nSir Jeffrey said the update from Lord Frost revealed that \"significant gaps\" on the issue are yet to be resolved.\n\"I have again reiterated that Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market must be restored and we cannot continue to be subject to laws in Northern Ireland upon which we have no say or input,\" he said.\n\"Decisions will very soon need to be taken on whether they can in fact be concluded successfully.\n\"In the absence of agreement, the UK government must follow through on the commitments made in their command paper.\n\"The protocol continues to damage our economy and the political institutions in Northern Ireland and the status quo is not an option.\"\nThe command paper seeks a renegotiation of the protocol rather than merely tweaking its operation.\nSeparately, the leader of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) Billy Hutchinson has called for \"corrective action\" to restore Northern Ireland's constitutional position within the UK.\nHe said the \"constitutional guarantee\" in the Good Friday Agreement was \"not as was promised to the unionist community\" and he called for a \"rebalancing\" of how the 1998 peace deal was being implemented in relation to the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe remarks by unionist leaders come after a weekend of high-profile criticism of the UK government's position on the protocol from both within the UK and the EU.\nThe protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, unlike the rest of the UK, and led to new checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\nSupporters argue it has created new opportunities for Northern Ireland businesses but opponents say it undermines the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and disrupts supply chains.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol was negotiated between the EU and the UK government in late 2019.\nBut the UK government now wants significant reform of the agreement.\nLord Frost, who helped to negotiate the protocol, argues that the arrangement is now harming the peace process in Northern Ireland.\nLast month, the EU offered new proposals to resolved the long-running dispute, which it said would cut the number of spot checks on goods by about 80%.\nIt also offered to change to laws to ensure no disruption to moving medicines across the Irish Sea.\nHowever, the UK said more fundamental change was required, including removing the European Court of Justice from an oversight role.\nArticle 16 exists to fix difficulties with the Northern Ireland Protocol that are causing serious problems or causing diversion of trade.\nThe UK government says that threshold was reached long ago and so it can be used legitimately.\nBut the EU fears the UK is planning to use Article 16 in an expansive way - to gut the protocol, sweep away the Irish Sea border and open up a potential back door into the single market.\nThe EU may argue that the broader Brexit trade deal only happened because the issue of the Irish border had been sorted out first.\nTherefore if the UK collapses that border solution the EU may give notice that it intends to collapse the trade deal.\nLast week Belgium's Deputy Prime Minister Vincent Van Peteghem suggested that is figuring in the EU's thinking and Simon Coveney alluded to it again on Sunday.\nRead more: What is Article 16 and why does it matter?\nThe DUP leader has previously suggested that his party may quit its role in Northern Ireland's devolved government if its demands over the protocol are not met.\nAt Stormont on Monday, the leader of the SDLP called on Lord Frost and the DUP to \"think very carefully\" about the language used in relation to the protocol.\nColum Eastwood said they were \"creating more and more instability on the streets of Northern Ireland\".\n\"We should take away the threat to these institutions, we should take away the pretence that there's some big battle around the protocol when it's absolutely clear to anybody that the European Union have offered the people of Northern Ireland everything that they asked for,\" he said.\nTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin told Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 that \"nothing is certain\" in relation to the UK's threat to trigger Article 16 but he repeated his view that such a move would be \"reckless and irresponsible\". \nAt the weekend, former Prime Minister Sir John Major was among those who criticised the UK government's stance on the protocol, and said triggering Article 16 would be absurd and \"colossally stupid\".\nEuropean Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic warned it would lead to \"instability and unpredictability\" for Northern Ireland and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney hinted the EU could terminate its post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement in response.\nIn a weekend statement, the UK government said it would prefer to \"settle the issues arising from the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol consensually\".\nHowever, it said its responsibility was \"to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, and we will use Article 16 if necessary\".\nMeanwhile, Mr Hutchinson of the PUP described the protocol as a \"real and present threat\" to the substance of the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nIn a detailed statement posted to the PUP's website, Mr Hutchinson said a recent legal challenge to the protocol had \"exposed the principle of consent to be little more than a deceptive snare\".\nMr Hutchinson was part of the loyalist negotiating team for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.\nHis party's statement said its support for that deal was \"rooted in the purported guarantee provided by the principle of consent\".\n\"We urged support for the agreement on the basis that the union was safe, so long as a majority of persons living here wished it to be so,\" he said.\n\"If, as is currently the case, the constitutional guarantee is not as was promised to the unionist community, then there is no basis for unionist support for the Belfast Agreement.\"\nHowever, Mr Hutchinson told the BBC's Talkback programme the PUP was not withdrawing its support for the deal signed in 1998 but rather campaigning for changes to how that deal was being implemented in relation to the protocol."

      "tags": "Christmas,Retailing,Inflation,UK economy,Food",
      "text": "Food prices are rising at their fastest pace since August 2020, figures from data firm Kantar suggest, as supply chain disruption continues.\nGrocery inflation rose to 2.1% in October - the highest rate since last year, when retailers were cutting promotions amid the Covid pandemic.\nLast week, the Bank of England confounded market expectations by holding interest rates.\nBut with overall inflation heading for about 5%, a rate rise is expected soon.\nSupply chains have been under pressure from factors including the pandemic and a shortage of lorry drivers.\nRetail and hospitality groups warned MPs on Tuesday that gaps on shelves and inflationary pressures would continue for the months ahead.\nKantar said that the fastest rising food prices included savoury snacks, canned colas and crisps. \nHowever, prices fell for products such as fresh bacon, vegetables and cat and dog treats.\n\"Grocery prices are rising and this month inflation hit its highest rate since August 2020, when retailers were still cutting promotions to maintain stock on the shelves,\" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.\n\"As prices increase in certain categories, we can expect shoppers to continue to visit several supermarkets and shop around to find the best deals.\"\nOfficial figures showed overall UK inflation dipped slightly in September, with the rate falling to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in October.\nHowever, Shore Capital research analyst Clive Black said that some people were \"struggling to believe\" the inflation numbers from the Office for National Statistics.\nHe said the figures were \"increasingly treated not with scepticism but incredulity as prices from fuel, energy, food, and building materials rise, offset by what?\"\nFuel and oil prices have risen rapidly as economies start to pick up after being battered by the coronavirus pandemic, and as the Opec oil producers' cartel gradually increases output.\nShortages and bottlenecks in goods including building materials and computer chips have also pushed up prices.\nBusinesses are having difficulties recruiting workers to drive lorries, pick and process food and to staff bars, hotels and restaurants.\nThis is partly to do with the pandemic but is being compounded by Brexit, according to international policy forum the OECD.\nHowever, the Bank of England's deputy governor Ben Broadbent stated the pandemic is having a greater impact on labour shortages than Brexit currently.\nMr Broadbent stressed that it's not just a case of losing migrants as workers - but also their spending power in the economy, as many EU workers were younger and economically active.\nHe added the pandemic has led to a fall in the active workforce that is \"not unique\" to the UK, shown by the retirement of HGV drivers and younger restaurant staff choosing to go into education. \nKate Nicholls, chief executive officer of UK Hospitality, warned that prices charged by hospitality businesses such as restaurants, bars and hotels were set to rise after Christmas.\nSpeaking to the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee on Tuesday, she said that many Christmas events offered by her members had been pre-booked, which made it harder to push through price increases to cover higher costs.\n\"You're going to see a really intense squeeze on margins in the run-up to Christmas,\" she said, but then prices were likely to rise in the new year.\n\"Some of our businesses are anticipating three price increases to consumers going through before we get to April.\"\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, told MPs it \"will be Christmas as we know it\" in shops, but the range of products will be reduced, as is already the case in lots of food categories.\nSeveral retailers have reported that customers are planning ahead for Christmas and shopping early amid concerns over shortages of stock.\nKantar data supported this, with the firm saying that 4.7 million households bought mince pies this month.\nFrozen poultry sales are 27% higher compared with last year, with people spending an additional \u00a36.1m in the past four weeks.\nIn addition, 1.6 million households bought their Christmas pudding in October as well, which is 400,000 more than last year, Kantar said.\nCustomers are getting used to seeing gaps on shelves, and menu items missing in restaurants, and we're already shopping differently as a result. \nGone are the days of the Christmas Eve mega-shop where you pile everything you need into an impossible to push trolley. Now we're buying early, freezing more, and throwing in a few extra bits when they are available, just in case.\nIt's almost impossible for businesses to predict what those holes will be from one week to the next, as worker shortages in the supply chain continue to cause problems. \nThat means we'll not only be shopping around to try and save money as prices rise, but we'll also have to try different stores at different moments just to get everything on the list.

      "text": "There appears to be an optimal bedtime - between 10pm and 11pm - linked to better heart health, say researchers who have studied 88,000 volunteers.\nThe team behind the UK Biobank work believe synchronising sleep to match our internal body clock may explain the association found with a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes.  \nThe body's natural 24-hour rhythm is important for wellbeing and alertness.\nIt can also impact things like blood pressure.\nFor the study, which was published in the European Heart Journal, the researchers collected data on sleep and wake times over seven days using a wristwatch-like device worn by the volunteers. \nAnd they followed up what happened to the volunteers in terms of heart and circulatory health over an average of six years. \nJust over 3,000 of the adults developed cardiovascular disease. \nMany of these cases occurred in people who went to bed later or earlier than the \"ideal\" 10pm to 11pm.\nThe link persisted after adjustments were made for sleep duration and sleep irregularity.\nThe researchers tried to look at other factors known to affect a person's heart risk, such as their age, weight and cholesterol levels, but stress their study cannot prove cause and effect. \nStudy author Dr David Plans, working with the healthtech organisation Huma, said: \"While we cannot conclude causation from our study, the results suggest that early or late bedtimes may be more likely to disrupt the body clock, with adverse consequences for cardiovascular health.\n\"The riskiest time was after midnight, potentially because it may reduce the likelihood of seeing morning light, which resets the body clock.\"\nRegina Giblin, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"This large study suggests that going to sleep between 10 and 11pm could be the sweet spot for most people to keep their heart healthy long-term. \n\"However, it's important to remember that this study can only show an association and can't prove cause and effect. More research is needed into sleep timing and duration as a risk factor for heart and circulatory diseases. \nGetting enough sleep is important for our general wellbeing as well as our heart and circulatory health, and most adults should aim for seven to nine hours of sleep per night, she said.\n\"But sleep isn't the only factor that can impact heart health. It's also important to look at your lifestyle as knowing your numbers such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly, cutting down on salt and alcohol intake, and eating a balanced diet can also help to keep your heart healthy.\""

They did not appreciate the need to transfer Anne for this reason.\"\nMs Clelland was found unconscious in the toilet of her hospital room on Monday 18 May. She was pronounced dead the next day.\nA post mortem determined the cause of death as \"brain injury due to hanging\".\nAn investigation found there was a \"lack of clear and consistent understanding\" of Ms Clelland's risk of suicide. \nIt was also accepted that \"staff did not appreciate that Anne was at a significant risk of self-harm and consequently there was no ligature point risk assessment or observations\".\nThe court heard that following Ms Clelland's death a more robust transfer procedure was put in place at QEUH and rooms were more suitable for patients in similar circumstances.\nVinit Khurana QC, defending, said it was \"a matter of deep regret\" that Ms Clelland could kill herself \"as a result of the organisation's failings.\"\nHe added: \"I am instructed to express the board's deepest sympathies to her family. This was not a deliberate breach and wasn't symptomatic of other failings.\n\"This was an organisation trying its very best to protect patients and it was a failure of communication on that single day which had tragic consequences.\"\nThe court also heard that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde had previous convictions over the suicide of three other patients. \nSentence was deferred until later this month."

      "tags": "IVF,United States,California",
      "text": "A California couple gave birth to a stranger's child after being given the wrong embryo by a fertility clinic during in vitro fertilisation (IVF), says a lawsuit.\nDaphna and Alexander Cardinale say they gave birth in September 2019 to a girl that looked nothing like them.\nAfter a DNA test, they found the couple that carried their daughter to term, and together decided to swap the girls. \nThis is not the first alleged mix-up during an IVF procedure.\nIVF is a procedure during which a woman's eggs are fertilised by man's sperm in a laboratory before the embryos are implanted into a woman's uterus.\nThe Cardinales are suing the Los Angeles-based fertility centre, the California Center for Reproductive Health (CCRH), as well as In VitroTech Labs, an embryology lab.\nThe lawsuit alleges medical malpractice, negligence and fraudulent concealment. Neither company responded to a BBC News request for comment. \nIn an emotional news conference on Monday, Mrs Cardinale said her family's \"heartbreak and confusion can't be understated\".\n\"Our memories of childbirth will always be tainted by the sick reality that our biological child was given to someone else, and the baby that I fought to bring into this world was not mine to keep.\"\nMrs Cardinale said she was \"robbed of the ability to carry my own child\".\nAccording to the lawsuit, the couple sought help from the fertility clinic in the summer of 2018. \nMrs Cardinale gave birth the next year to a child they thought was theirs. \nIn the delivery room, Mr Cardinale had expected \"a fair child\", like their firstborn, but he was surprised to see the baby girl \"came out with much darker skin\", says the lawsuit.\n\"It was so jarring that Alexander actually took several steps away from the birthing table, backing up against the wall,\" reads the legal action.\nNearly two months later the family decided to take at-home DNA tests, which ultimately determined they were not biologically related to the infant. \n\"The room shrank and got really dizzy and everything just went numb,\" Mr Cardinale said, recalling the moment the DNA results came back.  \nThe CCRH then helped them find the California couple who had carried their daughter and had given birth to another healthy girl a week apart. The Cardinales' daughter was around four months old when they first met. After several meetings, the couples agreed to go through the legal process of formally exchanging the babies, which happened in January 2020.\n\"Instead of breastfeeding my own child, I breastfed and bonded with a child I was later forced to give away,\" Mrs Cardinale said at the news conference.\nShe added that the incident has been hardest for the couple's seven-year-old daughter, who has struggled to understand the swap. \n\"The horror of this situation cannot be understated,\" says the lawsuit.\nMrs Cardinale, a licensed therapist, and her husband, a singer-songwriter, have since both sought mental-health treatment for \"symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD\", says the legal action.\nAdam B Wolf, a lawyer representing the Cardinales, said the other family in the mix-up also plans to sue, but will remain anonymous. \nIn 2019, another California family discovered that their child had been born in New York. \nThey sued the birth mother, who reportedly wanted to keep the child. The judge later ruled in favour of the genetic parents.  "

      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A recruitment company wrongly claimed furlough money from the government while its staff were still working, ex-employees have told the BBC.\nSecret recordings obtained by File on 4 and The Times newspaper appear to show managers at Brewster Partners telling staff how to avoid detection while they continued to work.\nThousands of companies are thought to have misused the government's furlough scheme - introduced to support businesses during the pandemic.\nBrewster Partners denies wrongdoing.\nThe company, based in Yorkshire, said it will refer itself to HMRC for investigation following the BBC's programme. \nIn a video call with staff, Lisa Brewster, the company's managing partner at the time, tells colleagues she has been advised they should delete posts from the LinkedIn social networking site which refer to working from home.\nFurlough was introduced in March 2020 after Covid-19 forced large parts of the UK economy to close. Officially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it saw the government pay towards the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nKey to the scheme was that people must not work for their company while furloughed. \n\"So, what he [the company's chief executive] said is, if you can delete them, delete them,\" she tells staff in a Zoom conversation.\n\"If it looks wrong to delete it, don't. We're going to use the excuse that we've got a few people... in control of everyone's LinkedIn, still posting stuff if we get into trouble.\"\nShe then appears to encourage staff to continue working as normal.\n\"Technically, you are not supposed to be working\", she says. \"However, if you choose to work, we can't stop you. Yeah? Does that make sense? So, technically, yes, you're furloughed. You can choose to work, though, which I'm presuming nearly everybody here will be doing...\"\nListen to BBC File on 4's full investigation into furlough fraud here.\nThe BBC showed the secret recordings to employment lawyer Beverley Sunderland. She said: \"It is quite clear that what they are doing is instructing their employees to pretend that - if it comes to it - somebody else has been using their LinkedIn. \n\"They are just creating a false impression to enable them to be able to claim a grant from the government,\" she said.\nThe company's chief executive, Nigel Brewster, is heard telling anxious employees not to worry because he has \"a cunning plan\".\nThe secret recordings come alongside allegations from six former employees, all of whom spoke to BBC File on 4 on condition of anonymity.  \nOne said: \"It didn't feel like I could refuse to work while on furlough\u2026 I just wasn't allowed to question it, and I continued on miserably.\"\nThe government's furlough scheme, officially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), was designed to protect jobs during the Covid pandemic by paying 80% of wages - up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month.\nIt was introduced in April last year, towards the beginning of the UK's first lockdown. The rules said furloughed employees were not allowed to carry out any work for their employer in order to qualify for the help.\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have received around 30,000 calls to their fraud hotline about possible abuses of the scheme.\nLast week, HMRC released new figures estimating that \"error and fraud\" made up 8.7% of the total amount it paid out through the scheme, equating to approximately \u00a36bn.  \nBrewster Partners is just one of many thousands of companies accused of wrongful claims.\nThe allegations have attracted particular attention because the company's non-executive chairman is Sir Nigel Knowles, a lawyer and former CEO of the world's largest business law firm, DLA Piper, as well as a council member of the charity, the Prince's Trust. There is no suggestion he knew anything about alleged breaches of rules. \nIn a statement to the BBC, the company said they \"categorically deny any wrongdoing\", and had already commissioned an independent review which found that \"the company's receipt of [furlough] funds appears lawful and within the rules of the scheme despite comments in Zoom calls by managers\".\nHowever, after exchanging emails with the BBC, the company said: \"Despite the conclusion of the independent report, given questions still persist as to whether Brewster Partners misused the furlough scheme, the company's board has agreed that the business should proactively contact HMRC and invite them to conduct their own investigation.\""

He said he also suffered a blow to the head.\n\"I did not resist arrest once and I felt the response was completely disproportionate in the circumstances,\" he said.\nMr Meekcom, who felt unwell and went to hospital after his release from custody, said he has reported the incident to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.\nWest Mercia Police said officers received a report of indecent exposure on Stourbridge Road at about 13:00 GMT on 5 November and attended a property in Coley Close with the intention of speaking to an individual regarding the incident.\nThe force said on arrival officers attempted to speak to a man, however the situation developed which led to his subsequent arrest on suspicion of indecent exposure and dangerous driving.\nLocal area commander Supt Mark Colquhoun, said: \"We appreciate the footage and commentary circulating around the incident has caused some concern.\n\"The incident was reviewed at the time and, after consideration of the full facts and circumstances, including reviewing officers' body-worn video, I am satisfied that appropriate action was taken by officers.\n\"The incident lasted around 38 minutes from the time of arrival at the address and therefore lasted significantly longer than the footage already in the media.\"\nA 55-year-old man from Kidderminster arrested during the incident had since been released on bail, he added.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson is proposing to ban MPs from acting as paid political consultants.\nThe Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer has been calling for this to happen, saying the ban would help end \"dodgy lobbying\". \nThe planned shake up of the rules comes after Owen Paterson was found to have broken lobbying rules - which led to the issue of MPs' second jobs coming under scrutiny.  \nQuestions have been raised about the Conservative MP and former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox who earned around \u00a3900,000 last year through his work as a lawyer. \nYes, as long as they are not a minister.\nMore than 200 MPs have received earnings in the last year on top of their \u00a381,932 annual salary. The extra earnings range from \u00a350 a year to almost \u00a31m.\nMPs must publicly declare any additional income, along with gifts, donations and shareholdings over 15%.\nThose who leave government must consult the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments about any jobs they want to take up in the two years after leaving their post. They are banned from lobbying the government for two years.\nAll MPs are \"strictly forbidden\" from getting paid \"in return for advocating a particular matter\" in Parliament.\nHaving MPs with second professions has previously been seen as a good thing.\nIn 1995, the standards committee said that not having them would \"not serve the best interests of democracy\". It argued that Parliament needed \"a wide range of current experience which can contribute to its expertise\".\nThe current debate is mainly regarding MPs who earn money as consultants or advisers. Less controversial second jobs range from doctors and nurses, to referees and musicians.\nThe following MPs have registered income from consultancy work on the Register of Members' Financial Interests in the last year. There is no suggestion that any of the MPs listed below have broken any rules.\nMost of the MPs who have second jobs are not consultants.\nSome of the highest earners in the House of Commons are lawyers. \nSir Geoffrey Cox, who was attorney general during the height of the Brexit negotiations, has registered almost \u00a3900,000 in the last year for around 1,000 hours of legal work. \nThis included travelling to the British Virgin Islands (BVI) to advise on a corruption inquiry. He was there for a number of weeks, meaning he was carrying out his work as an MP - including voting - from the Caribbean.\nSir Geoffrey has been referred by Labour to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards for apparently taking part in a virtual meeting for a client while in his Commons office. \nThe Conservative MP has denied breaching the rules.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is also a barrister, has made more than \u00a3100,000 for legal work, writing and making speeches since becoming an MP in 2015. There is no suggestion he has done anything against the rules, and Sir Keir says all the work was carried out before he became leader last year.\nA number of MPs are also employed as doctors and nurses. Some have continued to work on the NHS front line during the pandemic."

That's why we're still here,\" Detective Senior Sgt Cameron Blaine told reporters at the town's airport.\nHe called for any locals who had seen or had any contact with Mr Kelly in recent weeks to come forward.\nAt the time of the rescue, police said they believed Mr Kelly had been acting alone. They have disclosed little information since then.\nOn Tuesday, the Daily Mail Australia reported that police were investigating whether a woman had helped care for Cleo during the abduction - including by helping her to dress and brush her hair. Police have not commented on the report.\nCleo was found safe and well last Wednesday after police smashed their way into the house at night-time, just an hour after arresting Mr Kelly.\nVision of the rescue showed the young girl identifying herself to officers and smiling.\nHer family has since released a statement saying they are \"so thankful that our little girl is back within our arms\".\nMr Kelly was taken to hospital with self-inflicted injuries shortly after he was arrested. \nHe appeared in court last Thursday charged with forcibly or fraudulently taking or enticing a child under the age of 16, among other offences.\nHe is next due to face court in early December."

      "text": "A student who attended the Astroworld concert in Texas at which eight people died, has now been declared brain dead.\nEight people aged between 14 and 27 were killed in a crush during the show last weekend, and hundreds more were injured, including a nine year old boy who is in a coma.\nAnd now doctors say a 22-year-old woman who has been in hospital since the concert, is showing no signs of brain activity.\nThe news comes after a Houston fire chief claimed Rapper Travis Scott should have halted the show more quickly.\nSamuel Pe\u00f1a told NBC: \"Everybody at that event had a responsibility.....From the artist on down.\"\nThe artist said he was \"devastated\" by the incident and was working to help victims' families. \nHis partner, the businesswoman and media personality Kylie Jenner, said they only learned there were fatalities after the event. \nA lawyer for the nine-year-old fighting for his life after he was trampled at the event has also spoken. \n\"This young child and his family will face life-altering trauma from this day forward, a reality that nobody expects when they buy concert tickets,\" a lawyer for the family said in a statement on Tuesday.\nPolice said the victims were crushed in a surge of fans near the stage at around 21:30 local time.\nScott continued to perform for almost 40 minutes longer, eventually ending the set about 15 to 20 minutes ahead of the advertised time.\nIn footage from the concert, he can be seen interrupting his performance to ask for help for a fan who had passed out. But in another video, he asks: \"Who asked you to stop? Y'all know what y'all came to do.\"\n\"At one point there was an ambulance that was trying to make its way through the crowd. The artist has command of that crowd,\" Mr Pe\u00f1a, the chief of the Houston Fire Department, told NBC's Today show.\n\"The artist, if he notices something that's going on, he can certainly pause that performance, turn on the lights and say: 'Hey, we're not going to continue until this thing is resolved',\" he added.\nIn an Instagram video following the event, Scott said he was devastated about what had happened and was \"sending prayers to the ones that were lost\". \n\"My fans really mean the world to me,\" he said. \"Any time I could make out anything that's going on, I just stopped the show and helped them get the help they need... I could just never imagine the severity of the situation.\"\nScott, one of the biggest names in rap music, launched Astroworld with concert promoters Live Nation in 2018. \nOn Monday, lawsuits were filed including allegations that Scott and surprise performer Drake incited the crowd at Friday's event, and that Live Nation failed to provide adequate safety measures. \nPolice have launched an investigation, including looking into separate reports that somebody in the audience was injecting people with drugs. \nSeveral concertgoers had to be revived with anti-drug overdose medicine, including a security officer who police said appeared to have an injection mark in his neck."

      "tags": "Companies,Nuclear power,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Rolls-Royce has been backed by a consortium of private investors and the UK government to develop small nuclear reactors to generate cleaner energy.\nThe creation of the Rolls-Royce Small Modular Reactor (SMR) business was announced following a \u00a3195m cash injection from private firms and a \u00a3210m grant from the government.\nIt is hoped the new company could create up to 40,000 jobs by 2050.\nHowever, critics say the focus should be on renewable power, not new nuclear.\nCurrently, about 16% of UK electricity generation comes from nuclear power.\nSmall modular reactors are nuclear fission reactors but are smaller than conventional ones.\nThe investment by Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources, Exelon Generation and the government will go towards developing Rolls-Royce's SMR design and take it through regulatory processes to assess whether it is suitable to be deployed in the UK.\nIt will also identify sites which will manufacture the reactors' parts and most of the venture's investment is expected to be focused in the north of the UK, where there is existing nuclear expertise.\nRolls-Royce's share price jumped by 4.2% to 147.85p each following the announcement.\nRolls-Royce SMR said one of its power stations would occupy about one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear plant - the equivalent footprint of two football pitches - and power approximately one million homes.\nThe firm said a plant would have the capacity to generate 470MW of power, which it added would be the same produced by more than 150 onshore wind turbines.\nWarren East, Rolls-Royce chief executive, said the company's SMR technology offered a \"clean energy solution\" which help tackle climate change.\nBusiness and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said SMRs offered opportunities to \"cut costs and build more quickly, ensuring we can bring clean electricity to people's homes and cut our already-dwindling use of volatile fossil fuels even further\".\n\"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the UK to deploy more low carbon energy than ever before and ensure greater energy independence\", he added.\nSMRs are thought to be less expensive to build than traditional nuclear power plants because of their smaller size. Due to the nature of Rolls-Royce's reactors, it is understood parts could be produced in factories and transported to sites by road, which would reduce construction time and costs.\nAt an expected cost of around \u00a32bn each, SMRs would cost less than the \u00a320bn each for the larger plant under construction at Hinkley Point and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk.\nIf approved for use in the UK, it is understood Rolls-Royce SMR could build up to 16 reactors across the UK for electricity production.\nTom Samson, chief executive Rolls-Royce SMR, said the company had been established to \"deliver a low cost, deployable, scalable and investable programme of new nuclear power plants\".\n\"Our transformative approach to delivering nuclear power, based on predictable factory-built components, is unique and the nuclear technology is proven,\" he added.\nHowever, Paul Dorfman, chairman of the Nuclear Consulting Group think tank, told the BBC's Today programme there was danger that the money spent on nuclear power would hit funding for other power sources.\n\"If nuclear eats all the pies which it is looking to be doing\u2026 we won't have enough money to do the kind of things we need to do which we know practically and technologically we can do now,\" he said.\nGreenpeace's chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said SMRs were still more expensive than renewable technologies and added there was \"still no solution to dispose of the radioactive waste they leave behind and no consensus on where they should be located\".\n\"What's worse, there's not even a prototype in prospect anytime soon,\" he added. \"The immediate deadline for action is sharp cuts in emissions by 2030, and small reactors will have no role in that.\"\nFriends of the Earth's head of policy, Mike Childs, said government support should be \"aimed at developing the UK's substantial renewable resources, such as offshore wind, tidal and solar, and boosting measures to help householders cut energy waste\".\nAs part of a \"10-point plan\" to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050, the government has said nuclear power provides a \"reliable source of low-carbon electricity\" and that it is \"pursuing large-scale nuclear\", while also looking to invest in SMRs.\nTony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the investment for Rolls-Royce was a \"hugely promising milestone for a technology that can not only boost the economy but help deliver a greener and more secure energy system overall\".\nMeanwhile, Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, added the funding sent a \"huge signal to private investors that the government wants SMRs alongside new large-scale stations to hit net zero\"."

      "text": "Labour has called on the PM to launch an investigation into one of his Tory MPs, who earned almost \u00a3900,000 through jobs outside Parliament.\nSir Geoffrey Cox racked up the wage bill as a lawyer, including travelling to the British Virgin Islands (BVI) to advise on a corruption inquiry.\nLabour chair Anneliese Dodds said he \"took advantage\" of Covid restrictions to work remotely from the Caribbean.\nNo 10 said MPs who don't serve their constituents are \"not doing the job\".\nA spokesman for Boris Johnson said all MPs should be \"visible in their constituencies and available to help constituents with their constituency matters\", adding: \"If they're not doing that, they're not doing their job and will rightly be judged on that by their constituents.\"\nPoliticians are allowed to have second jobs outside Westminster, but the work they do has come under the spotlight since ex-Tory MP Owen Paterson broke lobbying rules when working as a consultant.\nNow Sir Geoffrey is facing questions after declaring on the Register of Members Interests - where MPs publish details of any additional work - he has made nearly \u00a3900,000 over the course of the year working as a lawyer.\nThe Daily Mail revealed one of his contracts saw him travel to the British Virgin Islands in April to work on a corruption investigation into the government of the Overseas Territory, which was launched by the UK Foreign Office in January. \nThe former Attorney General, who represents Torridge and West Devon in Parliament, was there for a number of weeks, meaning he was carrying out his work as an MP - including voting - from the Caribbean.\nThere's no suggestion he has broken any rules.\nBut Labour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, told BBC News it was \"absolutely staggering\" the Tory MP was carrying out all this extra work at a time when \"the vast majority of MPs were working harder than we've ever worked - helping serve our constituents through the toughest times of their lives\". \nIn a letter to the PM, Ms Dodds wrote: \"It seems Sir Geoffrey took advantage of Covid-related parliamentary rules and flew out to the BVI to vote by proxy from the other side of the Atlantic.\n\"The irony is not lost on me that he arrived in the Caribbean on the day that those MPs who actually feel a sense of duty to their constituents were debating global anti-corruption standards.\n\"The people of Torridge and West Devon must be wondering if Geoffrey Cox is a Caribbean-based barrister or a Conservative MP.\" \nSir Geoffrey has not commented on the reports, but broadcasters at his constituency home have been told he is abroad.\nDowning Street has faced torrid headlines for days now. \nWhat started as a story over one MP - Owen Paterson - morphed into one about the government's approach to standards.\nNow, the balance of MPs' work in and out of Parliament is being questioned.\nThere is no suggestion that Geoffrey Cox has broken any rules. Indeed, many MPs have second jobs.\nBut the extent to which he has focused on his legal work - and the fact he appears to have spent a number of weeks in the Caribbean - leaves question marks over whether he has got the balance right.\nNumber 10 haven't explicitly criticised him - but the inference in the comments of a spokesman for PM were clear: MPs should prioritise their work in Parliament and make that work visible to their constituents.\nFrom the start of 2021 until 7 September, all of Sir Geoffrey's votes in Parliament were carried out by a proxy - although many MPs were voting by proxy during this period because of the pandemic. \nHe spoke in a debate in the House on 13 September, but since then he has missed over 30 divisions - where MPs vote - and only voted in one.\nWhen it comes to remuneration, according to the Register of Members' Interests - where MPs have to declare other earnings outside Parliament - Sir Geoffrey was paid \u00a3156,916.08 before VAT for 140 hours work over the period he is understood to have been in the British Virgin Islands for Withers LLP.\nHe also earned over \u00a3280,000 with the same firm for almost 300 hours of work between January and July this year.\nSir Geoffrey also declared on the register that from 1 November he will receive \u00a3400,000 plus VAT annually from Withers LLP for up to 41 hours of work a month.\nIn a statement, the law firm confirmed the MP had worked for them as a consultant global counsel since September 2020, adding: \"As a leading QC, we very much value Sir Geoffrey's huge depth of expertise and experience in domestic and international legal disputes.\"\nEarlier, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab defended his fellow Tory, telling Times Radio, it was \"legitimate\" for the British Virgin Islands to hire Sir Geoffrey, \"as long as it's properly declared\".\nBut he also said it was up to voters to judge if MPs had the \"right priorities\" alongside any additional work they did. \nHowever, the Liberal Democrats said the public would be \"gobsmacked\" by the reports into Sir Geoffrey.\nAnd one of its MPs, Wendy Chamberlain, calling it \"frankly astonishing\" that Mr Raab could defend his Tory colleague.\nThe deputy chair of Sir Geoffrey's local Conservative Association, Debbie Flint, told the BBC the group \"fully supports our MP\".\nDominic Raab says it is up voters to decide if they want to stick with an MP working a second job.\nAnd Geoffrey Cox's local party seem confident that decision would fall in his favour.\nA county councillor in his Devon constituency, Debo Sellis, said the work he did locally was \"phenomenal\" and he was \"passionate about the community\". \nWard councillor Peter Crozier also had no doubt he would win any upcoming vote, saying the MP was \"excellent with his constituents\".\nMr Crozier added: \"He is visible for those in need of help and is probably one of the best MPs with his constituents, and that's probably why he increases his majority every time.\"\nBut a local councillor outside of the Tory Party, independent Steve Hipsey, had his own issues with Sir Geoffrey over the amount of time he spent in Westminster, rather than locally.\n\"If I have any beef with him at all it is about the time he spends in Parliament representing his constituents,\" he told PA. \n\"As a local councillor I am very concerned that we seem to be getting so little value for money out of him in Whitehall.\" \nThe prime minister has come under fire from all sides after trying to overhaul standards rules and block the suspension of his Mr Paterson, only to perform a U-turn less than 24 hours later. \nMr Johnson then faced further criticism for refusing to apologise for the scandal and failing to turn up to an emergency debate on the issue in the Commons on Monday. \nThe leader of the Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer, accused the PM of \"running scared\".\nThe three-hour emergency debate on standards saw Cabinet Office Minister Stephen Barclay expressing his \"regret\" over the \"mistake\" the government made with the vote on Mr Paterson's conduct.\nThe government will now bring forward a motion next week, to unpick the proposal which would have set up a committee to review standards procedures.\nDowning Street said it would also allow for the Commons to approve the standards report into Mr Paterson's conduct, while also recognising he is no longer an MP.

      "text": "For almost 40 years Ken Smith has shunned conventional life and lived without electricity or running water in a hand-made log cabin on the banks of a remote loch in the Scottish Highlands. \n\"It's a nice life,\" says Ken. \"Everybody wishes they could do it but nobody ever does.\"\nNot everyone would agree that Ken's isolated, reclusive lifestyle of foraging and fishing as well as collecting firewood and washing his clothes in an old bath outdoors is the ideal. And even less so at the age of 74.\nHis log cabin is a two-hour walk from the nearest road on the edge of Rannoch Moor, by Loch Treig.\n\"It's known as the lonely loch,\" he says. \"There's no road here but they used to live here before they built the dam.\"\nLooking down on the loch from hillside, he says: \"All their ruins are down there. The score now is one and that's me.\"\nFilmmaker Lizzie McKenzie first made contact with Ken nine years ago and over the past two years she has filmed him for the BBC Scotland documentary The Hermit of Treig.\nKen, who is originally from Derbyshire, tells the programme how he began work at the age of 15, building fire stations.\nBut his life changed at the age of 26 when he was beaten up by a gang of thugs after a night out.\nHe suffered a brain haemorrhage and lost consciousness for 23 days.\n\"They said I would never recover. They said I would never speak again,\" he says. \n\"They said I would never walk again but I did.\n\"That's when I decided I would never live on anyone's terms but my own,\" he says.\nKen began to travel and became interested in the idea of the wilderness.\nIn the Yukon, the Canadian territory that borders Alaska, he wondered what would happen if he just walked off the highway and \"went into nowhere\".\nSo that's what he did, saying he finally walked about 22,000 miles before returning home.\nWhile he was away his parents died and he didn't find out until he came home.\n\"It took a long while to hit me,\" he says. \"I felt nothing.\"\nKen walked the length of Britain and was at Rannoch in the Scottish Highlands when he suddenly thought of his parents and started to cry.\n\"I cried all the way while walking,\" he says. \n\"I thought where is the most isolated place in Britain?\" Ken tells the documentary.\n\"I went around and followed every bay and every Ben where there wasn't a house built. \n\"Hundreds and hundreds of miles of nothingness. I looked across the loch and saw this woodland.\"\nHe knew he had found the place he wanted to stay.\nKen says that was the point when he stopped crying and ended his constant wandering.\nHe set about building a log cabin, having first experimented on the design by using small sticks.\nFour decades on, the cabin has a roaring log fire but no electricity, gas or running water - and definitely no mobile phone signal.\nThe firewood has to be chopped in the forest and carried back to the remote shelter.\nHe grows vegetables and forages for berries but his main source of food comes from the loch. \n\"If you want to learn how to live an independent life what you have to do is learn how to fish,\" he says.\nTen days after film director Lizzie left the cabin, in February 2019, the perils of Ken's isolated existence were brought home when he suffered a stroke while outside in the snow.\nHe used a GPS personal locator beacon, which he had been given days before, to trigger an SOS, which was automatically sent to a response centre in Houston, Texas.\nIt notified the coastguard in the UK and Ken was airlifted to hospital in Fort William where he spent seven weeks recovering.\nStaff did what they could to make sure he could return to living independently and doctors tried to get him to move back to civilisation where he would have a flat and carers. But Ken just wanted to get back to his cabin.\nHowever, the \"double vision\" he suffered after his stroke and his memory loss mean Ken has had to accept more help than he'd had previously.\nThe head stalker of the estate, who looks after the forest where Ken lives, has been bringing him food every couple of weeks, which he pays for from his pension.\n\"People these days have been very good to me,\" Ken says. \nA year after his first rescue, Ken had to be airlifted again after he was injured when a log pile collapsed on him.\nBut he says he is not worried about his future.\n\"We weren't put on earth forever,\" Ken says.\n\"I'll stop here until my final days come, definitely.\"\n\"I have had lots of incidents but I seem to have survived them all.\n\"I am bound to go ill again sometime. Something will happen to me that will take me away one day as it does for everybody else. \n\"But I'm hoping I'll get to 102.\"\nThe Hermit of Treig is on the BBC Scotland channel at 22:00 on Tuesday 9 November and later on iPlayer."

      "text": "There appears to be an optimal bedtime - between 10pm and 11pm - linked to better heart health, say researchers who have studied 88,000 volunteers.\nThe team behind the UK Biobank work believe synchronising sleep to match our internal body clock may explain the association found with a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes.  \nThe body's natural 24-hour rhythm is important for wellbeing and alertness.\nIt can also impact things like blood pressure.\nFor the study, which was published in the European Heart Journal, the researchers collected data on sleep and wake times over seven days using a wristwatch-like device worn by the volunteers. \nAnd they followed up what happened to the volunteers in terms of heart and circulatory health over an average of six years. \nJust over 3,000 of the adults developed cardiovascular disease. \nMany of these cases occurred in people who went to bed later or earlier than the \"ideal\" 10pm to 11pm.\nThe link persisted after adjustments were made for sleep duration and sleep irregularity.\nThe researchers tried to look at other factors known to affect a person's heart risk, such as their age, weight and cholesterol levels, but stress their study cannot prove cause and effect. \nStudy author Dr David Plans, working with the healthtech organisation Huma, said: \"While we cannot conclude causation from our study, the results suggest that early or late bedtimes may be more likely to disrupt the body clock, with adverse consequences for cardiovascular health.\n\"The riskiest time was after midnight, potentially because it may reduce the likelihood of seeing morning light, which resets the body clock.\"\nRegina Giblin, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"This large study suggests that going to sleep between 10 and 11pm could be the sweet spot for most people to keep their heart healthy long-term. \n\"However, it's important to remember that this study can only show an association and can't prove cause and effect. More research is needed into sleep timing and duration as a risk factor for heart and circulatory diseases. \nGetting enough sleep is important for our general wellbeing as well as our heart and circulatory health, and most adults should aim for seven to nine hours of sleep per night, she said.\n\"But sleep isn't the only factor that can impact heart health. It's also important to look at your lifestyle as knowing your numbers such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly, cutting down on salt and alcohol intake, and eating a balanced diet can also help to keep your heart healthy.\""

      "tags": "Romney Marsh,New Romney,Royal Tunbridge Wells,Heathfield",
      "text": "An independent inquiry has been launched by the health secretary after a hospital electrician accessed mortuaries and sexually abused bodies.\nDavid Fuller, 67, filmed himself abusing at least 100 bodies in two Kent hospital morgues over 12 years.\nIt comes after Fuller, of Heathfield, East Sussex, admitted murdering Wendy Knell and Caroline Pierce in 1987.\nSajid Javid told the Commons the inquiry would look at the offences and their \"national implications\".\nHe said: \"It will help us understand how these offences took place without detection in the trust, identify any areas where early action by the trust was necessary, and then consider wider national issues, including for the NHS.\"\nThe inquiry will be split into two parts, an interim report to be published early in the new year and a second final report looking at the broader national picture and wider lessons for the NHS.\n\"I want to apologise to the friends and families of all the victims for the crimes that were perpetrated in the care of the NHS,\" Mr Javid added.\n\"Nothing that we can say will undo the damage that has been done, but we must act to make sure nothing like this can ever happen again.\"\nSir Jonathan Michael, a fellow at the Royal College of Physicians, will chair the inquiry. \nIt will supersede an independent investigation commissioned by the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, Mr Javid told the Commons.\nHe also said penalties available for \"appalling\" sexual offences will be re-examined following the case to ensure they are \"appropriate\".\nFuller kept millions of images and videos of his mortuary crimes on discs and hard drives. \nThey were were dated between 2008 and November 2020, and he labelled some of the folders with names of his victims.\nFuller had worked at hospitals since 1989 and was at the Kent and Sussex Hospital until it closed in September 2011. \nHe was transferred to the Tunbridge Wells Hospital at Pembury, where the offences continued until his arrest in 2020.\nInvestigators said Fuller would work late shifts and go into the morgue when other staff had left.\nBy Catherine Burns, Health Correspondent\nThe first stage of the inquiry will focus largely on the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. It will report back in the new year and try to identify any actions it needs to take.\nThe second part will take longer, because it has a much wider remit. It will look for lessons to be learned across the NHS, but also local authority mortuaries and privately-run funeral directors.\nSajid Javid spoke too about the families of victims. As he put it: \"People who've already experienced such loss and now experience unimaginable pain and anger.\"\nSome of those families have already instructed a lawyer and are considering taking legal action against the trust.\nDavid Fuller's been convicted, but the police investigation is far from over. Officers are still analysing his photos and videos. \nThis is expected to go on for another month or so. They point out that some victims may never be identified. \nMr Javid's announcement comes after eight Kent and Sussex MPs sent a joint letter to the health secretary calling for a public inquiry into mortuary abuse.\nIn the Commons, Tunbridge Wells MP Greg Clark asked Mr Javid to confirm that the inquiry would allow victims' families to give evidence on the impact the crimes have had on them.\nHe also asked if Mr Javid would make public recommendations for the whole of the NHS, not only the local NHS trust, and added: \"Will he publish the assessment of the risks for other sectors in which people have access to human dead bodies?\"\nMr Javid confirmed the inquiry would do all three things.\nKent Police earlier said there have been 403 calls to a police phone line, which was set up for people who have information about the investigation. \nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

      "tags": "Belarus,Russia,European Union,Poland,Migration",
      "text": "Poland's Prime Minister has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being behind a migrant crisis at Belarus's border with Poland.\nMateusz Morawiecki said that Belarus's authoritarian leader, a close ally of Mr Putin, is orchestrating the crisis, but \"it has its mastermind in Moscow\".\nAt least 2,000 migrants are stuck at the border in freezing conditions.\nBelarus's leader Alexander Lukashenko denies claims it is sending people over the border in revenge for EU sanctions.\nVideo footage shows crowds of people on the Belarusian side of a barbed-wire border fence with Poland. Some try to force their way through using bolt cutters, tree trunks and group force, while Polish guards fend them off with what appears to be tear gas.\nMany of the migrants are young men but there are also women and children, mostly from the Middle East and Asia. They are camping in tents just inside Belarus, trapped between Polish guards on one side, and Belarusian guards on the other.\nOvernight temperatures at the border have slumped below zero and several people have already died in recent weeks. \nSpeaking on Tuesday at an emergency parliamentary session after visiting troops on the border, Mr Morawiecki said: \"This attack which Lukashenko is conducting has its mastermind in Moscow, the mastermind is President Putin.\"\nHe accused the Russian and Belarusian leaders of trying to destabilise the European Union - which the two countries are not part of - by allowing migrants to travel through Belarus and enter the bloc.\nMr Morawiecki described the situation as \"a new type of war in which people are used as human shields\", and said Poland was dealing with a \"stage play\" which is designed to create chaos in the EU. \nHe added that it was the first time in 30 years that Poland's border security had been so \"brutally attacked\". \nPoland has deployed extra troops to the border, and warned of a possible \"armed\" escalation, fearing that Belarus might try to provoke an incident.\nPoland, Lithuania and Latvia, which are all part of the EU, have seen a surge in the number of people trying to enter their countries illegally from Belarus in recent months. On Tuesday, Lithuania declared a state of emergency on its border with Belarus, which will come into effect at midnight.\nPoland has seen the most arrivals, especially around its major border crossing at Kuznica.\nPoland has been accused of pushing migrants back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. Journalists and aid agencies have been banned from accessing the area.\n\"Nobody is letting us get in anywhere, Belarus or Poland,\" 33-year-old Shwan Kurd from Iraq told the BBC by video-call.\nHe described how he had arrived in Belarus's capital, Minsk, from Baghdad at the start of November, and was now in a make-shift camp metres from Poland's barbed-wire fence.\n\"There's no way to escape,\" he said. \"Poland won't let us in. Every night they fly helicopters. They don't let us sleep. We are so hungry. There's no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women, and families.\"\nThe EU, Nato and the US all accuse Belarus of coordinating the surge of migrants. The European Commission has accused Mr Lukashenko of luring migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an \"inhuman, gangster-style approach\".\nBrussels says his actions are a retaliation against EU sanctions, which were imposed after his widely discredited re-election and subsequent crackdown on mass protests.\nActivists say the migrants are being used as pawns in a political game between Belarus and its EU neighbours. \nLithuania has also moved troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible influx of migrants. Its government said declaring a state of emergency was a precautionary response.\nAbout two dozen migrants who were detained in Lithuania after illegally crossing over from Belarus were suspected of having links to terrorist organisations, Lithuania's vice interior minister Kestutis Lancinskas told the BBC.\nMost of them presented fake IDs when they were stopped and background checks are still ongoing, Mr Lancinskas said. He could not comment on which terrorist organisations may have links with the migrants, nor when they were detained.\n\"There is always a certain level of risk when there's a large number of people crossing the border,\" Mr Lancinskas said.\n\"All member states have a level of terrorism threat. Our intelligence services are doing their best to prevent those kinds of activities.\"\nIn an interview with the Belarusian state news agency, Mr Lukashenko said he wanted to avoid any military escalation on the border which could draw Russia into a conflict.\nHe said he was \"not a madman\" and knew what was at stake, but remained defiant, saying \"we will not kneel down\".\nThe Belarus defence ministry has accused Warsaw of violating agreements by moving thousands of troops to the border. \nBelarus insists migrants are arriving there legally and that it is merely acting \"as a hospitable country\".\nRussia has praised its ally's \"responsible\" handling of the border row and said it is watching the situation closely.\nAre you in the area?

      "text": "A man who was considered a close relative has been found guilty of murdering a 16-year-old girl at her family's Chinese takeaway.\nWenjing Lin died in Ynyswen, Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, on 5 March.\nChun Xu, 32, of no fixed address, had denied murder but admitted manslaughter at the Blue Sky takeaway.\nDuring the trial at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, jurors heard that he said he \"did not mean to hurt the little girl. I wanted revenge on her mother\".\nHe was also found guilty of the attempted murder of Wenjing's stepfather Yongquan Jiang.\nAfter the verdict, the judge said Xu could expect \"a sentence of life imprisonment\".\nSpeaking afterwards, Wenjing's mother, Meifang Xu, said she still could not comprehend Xu's actions, but was \"so relieved justice has been done\".\nDuring the trial the court heard Xu was regarded as a nephew to the teenager's mother, although there had been disagreements between their families in the past.\nBefore the murder, Xu had stayed with the family overnight, bringing with him a knife from another Chinese restaurant he was working at.\nThe following morning, Wenjing was getting ready for school and messaging friends on Snapchat.\nShe had sent her last message to friends at 09:30, and did not respond after that as she had by then been killed by Xu.\nLater that morning, Mr Jiang heard someone pacing around downstairs and found Xu, who invited him into the basement for a cigarette and to get some fish from the freezer, the court heard.\nAs Mr Jiang opened the freezer, he was stabbed in the neck and body with two knives by Xu, the trial heard.\nDuring the struggle, Mr Jiang asked him why he was attacking him, to which he replied \"money, money, money,\" jurors heard.\nWenjing's mother Meifang Xu, then came down the basement stairs and saw the two fighting. As she tried to ring a friend, Chun Xu bit her.\nMr Jiang managed to get back onto the ground floor where he found his stepdaughter's body on a black mat by the takeaway counter.\nDespite attempts made by the emergency services, the 16-year-old could not be revived.\nAfter the attack, the defendant was found in the kitchen with a self-inflicted injury to his throat.\nSpeaking after the verdict, Wenjing's mother, Meifang Xu, said: \"Our lives have been turned upside down.\n\"I was crying every day... I cannot imagine what my life will be like without her, she was my only child.\n\"The perpetrator has broken our family.\"\nMs Xu also revealed Wenjing passed all of her GCSEs with A grades \"but she will never know the results she had worked so hard for\".\nShe said her partner Mr Jiang was previously a strong, fit man, but since the attack he struggles to work and also has \"nightmares of Wenjing Lin lying on the floor by the counter\".\nShe added that she could \"never forgive\" Xu since her daughter's murder, describing Wenjing as \"my everything - everything of me\".\n\"I hope there won't be any innocent victims like Wenjing,\" she said.\nA statement from Rhiannon Davies, the deputy headmistress at Treorchy Comprehensive school, where Wenjing was a pupil, said she was an \"exceptional student\".\nMs Davies said that on the day of her death, Wenjing had logged on for a maths lesson, adding she would be \"sorely missed\".\nIn December 2020, the family entrusted Xu with \u00a320,000 that he said he would send back to China for them to pay a friend who had loaned them money to start their business in the UK.\nHowever, Xu only sent some of the money back and gambled away \u00a314,000, which he had then begun paying back.\nSentencing is due to take place on Friday."

      "text": "Some bus services in Belfast have been suspended after a double-decker was set on fire on the outskirts of the city.\nPublic transport provider Translink said the disruption to Metro services began at 18:30 GMT on Monday and could continue for several nights.\nSome of Belfast's busiest roads are affected, including routes along the Antrim, Shore and Newtownards roads.\nIt comes after the attack on a bus on Sunday amid rising tensions over the post-Brexit deal for Northern Ireland.\nThe arrangement - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - is opposed by unionist political parties and loyalist groups, who believe it undermines Northern Ireland's position within the UK.\nTranslink said it was suspending evening services on five bus routes and others would be diverted:\nSome bus services in other parts of Northern Ireland were also diverted on Monday evening because of \"recent civil unrest\", said Translink.\nThey include a number of services in Londonderry, Coleraine, Portadown and Ballyclare.\nIan Campbell, director of service operations at Translink, told BBC News NI that the schedule would return to normal on Tuesday morning but the evening services would be kept under daily review.\n\"Our response to these attacks on our services haven't been taken lightly,\" he said.\nTranslink said the situation was \"very changeable\" and it is advising people to check its website or call its customer service line on 028 9066 6630 for more details.\nIn the attack on Sunday night, four masked men, armed with a hammer and bottle of petrol, boarded a bus in Newtownabbey and ordered the driver and the passengers to get off the vehicle before they set it on fire.\nNo-one was injured but police said the incident was frightening for those who were on the bus when it was attacked.\nThe suspects were dressed in black and are believed to be in their 40s, said police.\nThe Unite union, which represents some bus drivers, said the hijackers \"told the driver that this was about the Northern Ireland Protocol\".\nIt was the second such attack in Northern Ireland in the past week.\nLast Monday morning two armed and masked men boarded a =bus in Newtownards, County Down, and ordered the driver to leave before setting it on fire.\nTranslink said the buses destroyed in the recent attacks would cost \"in excess of \u00a3200,000 to replace\".\nAfter the latest incident, Unite said its members would not drive buses through any area where they could be at risk.\nSome Translink staff members staged a walk-out on Monday afternoon and gathered outside Belfast City Hall in solidarity with the drivers whose buses were targeted.\nMichael Dornan of Unite said bus drivers had decided that \"enough is enough\".\nDrivers were not prepared to be \"political punchbags\", nor would they \"run any form of life-threating gauntlet\", he added.\nInfrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said the attack on Sunday was the fourth of its kind this year and came at a huge cost to the public.\nThe SDLP deputy leader said it was \"another extreme act of self-harm consistently rejected by the people of Northern Ireland\".\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson described the attacks on buses as \"reckless\".\n\"This violence, whatever the perceived or believed motivation, is completely wrong,\" he said.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Gerry Kelly said the hijacking of buses \"must stop immediately\".\n\"No one should ever go to work facing intimidation or fearing attack,\" he said.\n\"The leadership of political unionism must stop hyping up tensions with reckless and dangerous rhetoric, and actively work to bring these disgraceful attacks to end.\""

      "text": "Three out of four jobs advertised in the UK still do not offer any kind of flexible work options, according to an annual survey of over five million ads.\nThis is set against a backdrop of vacancies soaring to a 20-year high of 1.1 million between July and September. \nFlexible work consultancy, Timewise, tracked millions of ads for 17 words or phrases, such as job-share. \nFrom this analysis they found that the proportion of ads posted with a flexible component was just 26%.\nOver the last 19 months the coronavirus pandemic has delivered a seismic shake-up in many professions - flipping a large chunk of the workforce to remote-working overnight. \nAround half of employees now work flexibly in some form, while nine in 10 people say they want flexibility in their next position.\nOne of these jobseekers is Carole MacLeod, who before she had her daughter had a high-flying career as a consultant for a major UK telecoms provider. She managed C-suite executives at major events such as the World Economic Forum in Davos. \nNow in her fifties, she's finding it impossible to find similar level work. \n\"Now I cannot find a single good flexible job to apply for,\" she said. \n\"The market is flooded with jobs. But none that offer a decent wage, good enjoyable professional type work and flexibility too,\" she said. \n\"The kind of jobs that are available tend to be in hospitality, offering long poorly paid shifts that are below my skillset. Recruiters won't even answer the phone. I think I have applied for maybe one hundred jobs at various universities and academic institutions in central London. I find it bewildering.\"\nCarole is not alone: there are many mid-career workers who, despite a recent surge in job adverts as Covid restrictions eased, still cannot find work that fits with their need for flexibility and level of experience.\nThe work landscape has shifted but experts say the way roles are advertised suggest bosses have failed to adapt to find the best talent. \"Employers that don't include their flexible working offering within their job ads are making a huge mistake,\" said Professor Sir Cary Cooper, Organisational Psychologist at Alliance Manchester Business School. \n\"The hybrid model is what the majority of people want - and are currently practising.\" \nThe Timewise survey also revealed part-time work and low pay are still synonymous in the UK. Some 19% of the low paid jobs advertised -those paying up to \u00a320,000 full time equivalent -mentioned part-time possibilities. The highest chunk of any salary band.\nProf Cooper explained senior management may be making a conscious decision not to reference the term flexible working in any external communication \"because they fear potential employees will think that they have the automatic right to work remotely 24/7.\"\nHe points out however, that's not the reality for most workers. \"Most people are tired of working in this way. What they're looking for is a mix of being in the office and at home, so they can interact with other colleagues but also have the freedom to take time at home if they need it to juggle other life demands.\" \nEmma Stewart, co-founder of Timewise tells employers to be as explicit as possible about what forms of 'flex' they can offer. For example, 'this role can be offered on a three-day week basis'. \n\"We know nearly half of job seekers click away from roles that say 'open to flexible working'. They seek out ads which reflect the kind of flexible pattern they are looking for. Just as you search for jobs within a set salary range,\" she said. \nJanine Bosak, professor of Organisational Psychology at Dublin City University Business School said there might be several reasons why employers remain hesitant to refer to flexible working in ads. For example, when someone starts a new job, employers might prefer they be physically present to learn the ropes and company culture. \n\"Employers might also be reluctant to mention flexible working in their advertising materials as it might be perceived as a right to flexible working, whereas it might not always be possible to accommodate a desire for flexible working,\" she added.

Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "Minister Stephen Barclay has expressed his \"regret\" over the \"mistake\" the government made with the vote on Owen Paterson's conduct last week.\nGovernment-backed plans to review MP standard rules, after Mr Paterson was found to have broken lobbying rules, were withdrawn following a backlash.\nMr Paterson has since resigned his North Shropshire seat in Parliament.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of \"giving a green light to corruption\".\nNo 10 said the prime minister could not attend an emergency debate on the subject due to a \"long-standing commitment\" to visit a hospital in the north-east of England, but Sir Keir accused him of \"running scared\". \nLiberal Democrat Wendy Chamberlain - who requested the debate - also expressed disappointment that Mr Johnson had not attended, saying: \"You can't help but feel that he thinks the rules don't apply to him.\"\nMeanwhile both the SNP and Plaid Cymru have called for a police investigation into the process of appointing Conservatives to the House of Lords.\nThe SNP's Commons leader Peter Wishart told MPs: \"the price to get into the House of Lords has gone up from \u00a31m from New Labour to \u00a33m from the Conservatives.\"\nHe also urged Labour to \"stop putting people in that place... we just need you guys as the opposition party to say you will abolish it\".\nThe Conservative have denied any link between party donations and the nominations to sit in the Lords.\nAt the beginning of the Commons debate - which lasted three hours - Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said it was essential to \"sort out the mess we're in\".\nHe said any review of the process for investigating MPs had to be done on a cross-party basis.\nLast month, a report by Parliament's standards commissioner Kathryn Stone found that Mr Paterson had repeatedly breached Commons rules banning \"paid advocacy\".\nFollowing her report, the Commons Standards Committee recommended Mr Paterson should be suspended for 30 days.\nHowever, Mr Paterson denied breaking the rules and said the investigation had been unfair. \nThe government supported a proposal to block his suspension until a review of the investigation system had been carried out. \nFollowing an outcry from opposition parties and some Conservative MPs, the government later U-turned on the plan.\nOpening his speech in the Commons, Mr Barclay told MPs: \"I would like first and foremost to express my regret, and that of my ministerial colleagues, over the mistake made last week.\"\nHe said there had been concerns about the investigations system but said that had been \"conflated\" with Mr Paterson's case. \nHowever, despite calls from some MPs, Mr Barclay said the government would not hold a second vote on the suspension of Mr Paterson, arguing such a vote was unnecessary given his resignation from the House of Commons. \nAsked about the row earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not apologise for ordering his MPs to block Mr Paterson's suspension, insisting the government had been trying to reform the standards system. \nHe said it was \"very important\" to get any changes \"right\" and added a hope that Sir Lindsay would help set up talks between the parties on improving the process.\nSpeaking later in the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay did not announce separate talks but instead said he would wait until the Committee on Standards had finished their own review. \nDuring the debate, some Conservative MPs criticised their own government, with former chief whip Mark Harper urging Mr Johnson to apologise.\nAaron Bell - who was elected to the Newcastle-under-Lyme seat in 2019 - voted against the government last week, but said fellow MPs who had followed the party line were \"beating themselves up about that\". \n\"Loyalty to one's party is an admirable trait... but the reality is that my friends should not have been put in such an invidious position,\" he added.\nOwen Paterson had been a paid consultant for clinical diagnostics company Randox since 2015 and to meat distributor Lynn's Country Foods since 2016, earning a total of \u00a3100,000 a year on top of his MP's salary.\nMPs are allowed to have these jobs, but are not allowed to be paid advocates - using their influence in Whitehall for the company's gain.\nThe committee concluded that Mr Paterson had breached this rule on paid advocacy by:\nMr Paterson was also found to have broken conduct rules by:"

      "title": "Covid-19: Vaccines to be compulsory for frontline NHS staff in England",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It will become compulsory for frontline NHS staff in England to be fully vaccinated against Covid, the health secretary has confirmed.\nSajid Javid told MPs that he expected to set a deadline for the beginning of April to give 103,000 unvaccinated workers time to get both jabs.\nHe said the move would help protect patients and the NHS as a whole.\nBut concerns have been raised that it could lead some workers to leave, adding to healthcare staffing issues.\nMore than 93% of NHS frontline staff have had their first dose and 90% are fully vaccinated, Javid said. That is higher than the general working-age population, where about 81% have had both doses.\nThe government's decision follows a consultation which considered whether both the Covid and flu jabs should be compulsory.\nMr Javid said the flu vaccine would not be made mandatory. \nThose with a medical reason not to have the Covid jab would be exempt, he said, as would those who do not have face-to-face contact with patients.\nIn a Commons statement, Mr Javid said compulsory vaccination would \"protect patients in the NHS, protect colleagues in the NHS and, of course, protect the NHS itself\". \nHe said the requirement would be enforced 12 weeks after parliamentary approval - likely to be from April. \nNo unvaccinated worker should be \"scapegoated or shamed\", said Mr Javid, and should instead be supported to make \"a positive choice\".\nThursday is the deadline for care home workers in England to get vaccinated.\nEach of the four UK nations makes its own decisions on the issue. \nScotland and Wales have not made any proposals to make Covid jabs compulsory for NHS workers or care home staff, while in Northern Ireland there is to be a public consultation.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents England's NHS trusts, said: \"We understand why people are vaccine-hesitant. We need to win the argument with them rather than beat them around the head.\"\nThe possibility of losing staff was a \"real problem\" as the NHS runs on fine margins and already relies on staff to work extra shifts, he added.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged Mr Javid to proceed with caution - pointing to waiting lists \"close to six million\" and more than 90,000 job vacancies across the NHS.\nThere will be anxiety that chronic understaffing problems could be exacerbated, he said. \"We simply cannot afford to lose thousands of NHS staff overnight.\"\nThe logic behind this move is obvious - the virus presents a real risk to vulnerable people in hospital and the vaccine reduces the chances of infection and transmission.\nSo it's not hard to understand why insisting on jabs for staff who have contact with patients will, in theory, help protect patients.\nBut if it causes more staffing shortages that simply increases risk in another way.\nThere are already more than 90,000 vacancies in the NHS in England. It is a number that has actually fallen during the pandemic after staff put off retiring to help out.\nIf those staff take up their option to retire and mandatory vaccination forces others out, the NHS could find itself severely short of staff come the spring.\nMandatory vaccination comes into force for the care sector this week. Since it was announced, only two-thirds of the unvaccinated have come forward.\nIf a similar trend is seen for the NHS, vacancies would likely balloon to unprecedented levels.\nUnison head of health Sara Gorton said she feared the move might knock staff morale further and prompt workers to leave - or lose their job.\nThe government should consider alternatives like daily testing, she said, and not risk making the same mistake made with mandatory jabs in social care - which she said had led to an unprecedented staffing crisis.\nFrom Thursday, care homes will be required to refuse entry to workers who have not been fully vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption or there is an emergency.\nMr Javid said that since announcing the requirement for care staff, the number of unvaccinated workers in the sector has fallen from 88,000 to 32,000 in the last month.\nDouglas Ferguson, a surgeon at Exeter Hospital, said it was the government's responsibility to protect the population, describing the policy as \"quite sensible\". \n\"I think, to be honest, if people who don't want to be vaccinated feel that an injection, which is very well scientifically researched, is something that they decide they're going to change their entire career for, it seems unwise, I would say.\" \nOverall, Mr Ferguson thought the move was likely to be welcomed by staff.\n\"If all the staff know everybody else is vaccinated - I mean the majority are already anyway - I think it would give further confidence in you doing your job and potentially from those members of staff also.\" \nHe added that he only knew of one colleague who had chosen not to be vaccinated. \nThe latest NHS figures show vaccination rates vary hugely: among hospitals, Dorset County hospital has the highest at 94.6%, while Barts Health NHS Trust has the lowest rate of fully vaccinated staff, at 79.7%.\nAt Southampton General Hospital, frontline workers were told by letter in September they would face redeployment if they did not get vaccinated.\nOne worker, who has been redeployed after refusing to get the vaccine, said it was \"disappointing\" but not unexpected that jabs would be made compulsory for NHS workers.\nShe said she felt it was against her human rights to be forced to take the vaccination and said it should be her decision.\n\"I'm angry,\" she said. \"Probably I will just go and get it, what other options have I got?\"\nUniversity Hospital Southampton Trust, which runs the hospital, said a \"small number\" of staff had been redeployed to jobs away from patients as part of its strategy to prevent infection. \nThey were being offered advice and guidance about the vaccine and their permanent jobs and pay were protected, it said.\nSome countries have already introduced compulsory vaccination - including France, which had to suspend 3,000 unvaccinated healthcare workers in September.\nMore than 45.8 million people in the UK have had two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, meaning 79.8% of people aged over 12 are fully vaccinated, while 87.5% have had a first dose.\nVaccinated people have a lower risk of catching Covid and are less likely to become seriously ill or need to go to hospital, but there is still a chance they can transmit the virus.\nThe number of daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 remains high but Tuesday was the sixth day in a row that the figure came in under 40,000, with 33,559 cases reported. A further 262 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, down from 293 for the same day last week.\nCorrection: This story has been amended to make clear that Barts Health NHS Trust has the lowest vaccine take-up rate among trusts running hospitals in England, and not Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust as previously stated."

      "tags": "Owen Paterson",
      "text": "Where's the line? Do you think that MPs should be allowed to do anything on top of the day job? \nThey are not allowed to talk directly to ministers or government officials on behalf of firms who are topping up their wages. \nThat rule is crystal clear, and the former minister Owen Paterson was found to have broken it on more than a dozen occasions. \nThat's why the current stink in Parliament has emerged, as the government's botched handling of his case has provoked an angry conversation about what MPs should be allowed to do at all. \nAs the system stands, they are allowed to do work alongside the day job of looking after their constituents. Even being a government minister is technically a second job. \nAnd they have to publish anything extra they do that earns them more than \u00a3100 in a register. \nScrolling through, there's a remarkable variation in what those additional roles might be. \nFor some, it's a few shifts in A&E to keep their hand in their former profession, or to help out. \nFor others, it's offering legal advice that for a handful of MPs can attract eye-watering fees. \nMore commonly, MPs declare a couple of hundred pounds for taking part in a survey, or penning an article for the newspaper. \nOnly a few dozen out of the 650 are earning enormous extra amounts that run to the thousands of pounds. \nYou can read more about what some of them get up to here.\nIt's not the case that most of them are trousering vast amounts of extra cash, yet concern about what MPs get up to on top of their main job applies far and wide. \nBut trying to draw new rules up about what is justified and what is not isn't straightforward, and the suggestion has been tried and defeated before - as in 2015.\nWould all outside activity be banned? What about that doctor-turned-MP who wants to help out at their local hospital? It might be hard to object to that. \nFew constituents might be enthusiastic about the former attorney general, Geoffrey Cox - who the latest register says is earning an extraordinary \u00a3400,000 as a lawyer on top of representing the people of Torridge and West Devon. \nBut what about that lawyer, turned MP, who is doing a few hours here and there for small amounts in needy cases, who must keep doing some practice to keep their qualification fresh? More difficult to say. \nThere's the common suggestion, pay them \"properly\", then MPs who do take on extra work might not feel the need. \nBut \"properly\"? With their basic salary over \u00a380,000, they already earn far, far more than the average salary. \nWho defines what is \"proper\"?  A chunky pay rise, paying to stop a few behaving badly, would be the political equivalent of Parliament punching itself in the face. \nAnd perhaps the focus on second jobs is the less pertinent problem in any case. \nThere is a debate about the rules around outside interests, and whether the process that monitors them should be redrawn. \nBut don't forget that the system did identify what Owen Paterson was up to. And there's no consensus yet on anything that might or should change.  \nBut the question, \"where's the line\" is being asked in Westminster in a different vein. Some Tory MPs are wondering who draws the line on political conduct and decision making in No 10. \nThe reaction from many on the backbenches when the government tried to protect Owen Paterson and change the rules was fast and furious. \nDowning Street screeched into a U-turn quickly. But as much as No 10 may protest, the issue is far from forgotten - and it's stirred up questions again, even among ministers, about Boris Johnson's style in the job - his seeming disregard for rules and convention, and what some see as his reluctance to take much seriously beyond his own political survival. \nIt's not gone unnoticed in some circles that two of his staunchest and genuine backers - Chief Whip Mark Spencer and Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg - have found themselves on the end of briefings about who and what went wrong. \nOne senior Conservative MP branded Boris Johnson today the \"Chesney Hawkes prime minister, who must be the one and only\", accusing Mr Johnson privately of putting his own interests above all else. \nOf course it's easy to whisper in the Commons corridors, but some dissatisfaction has been on public display. \nIn the Commons tonight, former Chief Whip Mark Harper called for more leadership and a prime ministerial apology. \nTwo of the 2019 intake defended their decisions to rebel over the Paterson shenanigans - one suggesting in sorrow that now he'd started voting against his party bosses, it might be easier the next time. \nOver the weekend the former justice secretary, removed at the reshuffle but normally intensely loyal, wrote in The Times that the government's enormous majority was \"irrelevant\" if it didn't have a clear plan for action. \nThat's not to say that there is any significant threat right now to Boris Johnson. He is in possession of that thumping 80 seat majority in the Commons. \nDespite a pandemic, concerns about inflation, and this latest round of shenanigans, he remains politically supreme. \nMany MPs believe they owe their seats and the scale of the Tory advantage to him. And when it comes to sheer force of personality, he has no near rival right now. \nLabour believes that the latest round of allegations about sleaze and cash for cronies is starting to make an impact among the voting public. \nNo 10 can't just shrug off the allegations about alleged sleaze altogether - not least because there's still an ongoing inquiry into the flat in Downing Street itself. The SNP is trying to involve the police in allegations of cash for honours, and each day seems to bring a new demand for answers. \nBut Westminster's worst mistake is often to confuse its echo chamber for the mindset of the public. \nThe opposition parties sniff opportunity. There are plenty of Conservatives who are willing to say privately how unhappy they are about how Mr Johnson behaves. \nBut Sir Keir Starmer doesn't seem quite sure-footed enough yet on this terrain to turn this mess into a solid long-term advantage. \nAnd angry Tories, to their own irritation, can't quite think of anything workable to do now instead.  \nOne frustrated serving minister who is not a fan of Mr Johnson told me \"we're all stuffed until he implodes\". \nBut the last week has shown the prime minister that he can't act with total impunity. Boris Johnson is not the only one who draws the line. "

We'll have another update for you on Wednesday.\nFrontline NHS workers in England will have to be fully vaccinated against Covid, the government has decided. A deadline is expected to be set for 1 April next year to give unvaccinated staff time to get both doses. About 103,000 NHS workers in England have not taken up a jab offer, and Labour is warning about further staff shortages if people choose not to get one and have to leave their jobs. A public consultation on mandatory vaccines in Northern Ireland is expected to be launched while Welsh ministers said there was no need for compulsory jabs for health or social care staff in Wales. \nScotland's vaccine passport scheme could be expanded to more hospitality and leisure venues. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the rules may need to be tightened in order to prevent a return to lockdown. Any changes will be confirmed on 16 November. Covid passes are also set to be extended to cinemas and theatres in Wales. \nA nurse who worked in ICU through the pandemic has been talking about why she felt she had to leave the profession.  Former critical care nurse Chloe Burke said she felt selfish leaving but did not see another option. \"I didn't realise how much of an impact it was going to have on me, my mental health and my physical health,\" she says.\nA majority of workers in Northern Ireland would like to work from home even after pandemic restrictions are lifted, according to a survey. YouGov surveyed 1,000 local workers online in August and the findings suggest that of those working fully from home, only 3% wanted to return to their office full time. \nThe first foreign travellers have been reunited with loved ones as the US border reopened for the first time in nearly two years. Double -jabbed non-US citizens from over 30 countries, including the UK and EU, can now travel to the US.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe morning coronavirus briefing is being paused for two weeks so we can tell you five things you need to know about the COP26 climate summit instead.\nRead up about booster jabs and vaccine rules. \nAnd find further information, advice and guides on our dedicated coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Housing,Grenfell Tower fire,Michael Gove,UK fire safety",
      "text": "Housing Secretary Michael Gove has questioned why flat owners should have to pay anything for dangerous cladding to be removed from their buildings.\nHe said the government had a responsibility to help leaseholders - who were \"innocent parties\" - with the huge costs.\nPlans to make flat owners take out loans to pay for the work would be put on pause, he said.\nMr Gove also said requirements for 24-hour fire patrols were \"a rip-off\".\nIn the wake of the Grenfell fire, which killed 72 people in 2017, flammable cladding and other fire safety defects were discovered in hundreds of blocks of flats across the UK.\nRemoving cladding can cost millions of pounds per block, with the cost often being borne by individual flat owners, under the leasehold system in England and Wales.\nHundreds of thousands of people are still living in dangerous blocks four years on from Grenfell - while many flat owners have been left with spiralling insurance costs, service charges, and requirements for expensive 24-hour \"waking watch\" patrols in case of fire.\nThe government has promised a \u00a35bn Building Safety Fund to remove flammable cladding on high-rise buildings, but MPs estimated the total cost would be \u00a315bn.\nAnd buildings between 11m and 18m are not covered by the Building Safety Fund, so ministers announced a loan scheme, where leaseholders would repay up to \u00a350 a month.\nBut Mr Gove told the House of Commons housing committee on Monday that he would \"pause\" plans for the loans.\n\"I'm still unhappy with the principle of leaseholders having to pay at all, no matter how effective a scheme might be in capping their costs or not hitting them too hard at any one time. \n\"My question is why do they have to pay at all?\nHe said the government should help with the costs faced by leaseholders, who are \"innocent parties in this\" who are being asked to pay \"disproportionate sums\".\nMany of the \"guilty men and women\" responsible for \"this terrible situation\" were still in business and not being made to take responsibility, Mr Gove said.\nAsked if he would apply this approach to the costs of putting right all fire safety issues, not just cladding, the housing secretary said that was his intention.\nMr Gove said that waking watch schemes, which can add thousands to flat owners' annual service charges, were a \"rip-off\".\nHe said: \"I think there have been some organisations and individuals who, instead of making themselves part of the solution, have seen an opportunity to make money for themselves.\"\nThe housing secretary also criticised developers, saying there were questions from the Grenfell inquiry as to whether they had knowingly put \"cost reduction ahead of safety\"."

      "text": "A 10-year-old boy has died after being attacked by a dog, police have said.\nThe incident happened at a house in Pentwyn, Penyrheol, Caerphilly, on Monday at about 16:00 GMT.\nParamedics from the Welsh Ambulance Service went to the scene where the boy was pronounced dead.\nGwent Police said the dog was destroyed by firearms officers and officers would remain in the area while an investigation was carried out.\nOne neighbour said the attack took place at one of the houses on the street. He said he was shocked to hear what had happened. \nThe street is in the middle of a large housing estate and a few police vehicles remained parked at the end of the road on Monday night. \nAnother resident, Lorrine Urvine, said: \"We couldn't see anything other than the screaming. The kids - they were hysterical. \n\"And within minutes I've never seen so many police cars in my life.\"\nNeighbour Tracey Lawrence said: \"The little boy that lives there ran over to a neighbour saying the dog was attacking his friend and the neighbour couldn't help and couldn't save the boy.\"\nThere has been some police presence here where Gwent Police are continuing their investigation this morning.\nAnd we are expecting an update at some point from police as to how their investigation is progressing. \nThey have told the public that there will be an increased presence in the area at the moment as they continue their investigation but not to be alarmed. \nFor a time yesterday evening, this road was cordoned off and I think it has only come down in the early hours of the morning as the police continue their investigation.\nA nearby resident told the PA news agency: \"The dog has been a nuisance on the estate for a bit of a time. \n\"I took our son down to the local shop a few days ago, and he was down there then and he was lunging at my son.\n\"My son is three years old and I had to pick up my son just to move around the dog because of the size on him.\"\nDozens of emergency service vehicles were on the scene on Monday.\nCh Supt Mark Hobrough said: \"Officers will be making further inquiries at this time and will remain at the scene as the investigation progresses.\n\"It is possible that you may see ongoing police activity in Caerphilly as part of this work.\"\nHe urged the public not to be alarmed adding: \"If you have concerns or information then please do stop and talk with us.\"\nMember of the Senedd (MS) for Caerphilly Hefin David said: \"My thoughts tonight are with the families involved. I know the close-knit community will rally round and offer support.\"\nSouth Wales East MS Natasha Asghar added: \"My heart goes out to this little boy and his family in Caerphilly who must be utterly devastated after what's happened today.\""

      "text": "There is \"no need\" for compulsory Covid jabs for health or social care staff in Wales, Welsh ministers have said.\nThe UK government has confirmed it will require frontline health staff in England to be fully vaccinated.\nCare home workers in England have until Thursday to get double jabbed.\nBut the Welsh government said on Tuesday that vaccination rates are high in both groups in Wales and \"we do not see the need for compulsory measures\".\nEngland's Health Secretary, Sajid Javid, said a deadline of 1 April is expected to be set for NHS staff there to get two doses.\nThe Welsh Health Minister, Eluned Morgan, accused the prime minister of \"hypocrisy\" for insisting England's NHS staff be double vaccinated while entering a hospital on Monday \"without even a face mask on\". \nThe UK government's decision on health staff in England followed a consultation which began in September and considered whether both the Covid and flu jabs should be compulsory for frontline NHS and care workers.\nMr Javid told the Commons that the flu vaccine will not be made mandatory in England. \nThere will also be exemptions for the Covid vaccine requirement for medical reasons.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said take up of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales has been high among both health and social care staff and that \"while Covid vaccination rates are at such high levels in these groups, we do not see the need for compulsory measures\".\nSpeaking at a news conference later, Ms Morgan said: \"We know that in Wales 95% of our health care workers have taken the opportunity to have both the doses of the vaccine so we think that those levels are very high, we're content with those levels. \n\"We are still in the business of trying to persuade those final 5%, but there will obviously be amongst them some people who have medical reasons why they can't have those two doses.\"\nThe Welsh health minister went on to launch a fierce attack on Boris Johnson's government, after the prime minister was seen with his face uncovered during a visit to Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland on Monday.\n\"What I find shocking is that you have a situation where you have the UK government insisting on people in the NHS being double vaccinated, and yet the prime minister of the United Kingdom can walk into a hospital without even a face mask on,\" Ms Morgan said.\n\"I do think that this underlines the degree of hypocrisy that's going on amongst the Conservative government.\"\nDeputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, speaking on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, defended Mr Johnson.\n\"I know the prime minister took the advice on the clinical setting he was in and followed all the protocols and procedures that were applied there, and that's what everyone should do,\" he said.\nNHS figures show vaccination rates vary widely in England's health service: among hospitals, Dorset County hospital has the highest at 94.6%, while the trust running Bedford Hospital and Luton and Dunstable University Hospital has the lowest rate of fully vaccinated staff, at 79.7%.\nScotland and Northern Ireland have not made any proposals to make Covid jabs compulsory for NHS workers or care home staff."

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell will challenge claims that she groomed underage girls for the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.\nAccording to a letter by her lawyer, the British socialite's defence will say her accusers might have faulty memories.\nThe letter says that leading experts in psychiatry and memory would be brought in to testify in her defence.\nMs Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against her.\nShe has been in a New York jail since her arrest in July last year, awaiting the trial which will begin on 29 November and last six weeks.\nThe letter, written by Ms Maxwell's lawyer Jeffrey Pagliuca, gives a first glimpse at what her legal team are hoping to use to defend her in court.\nElizabeth Loftus, a psychologist specialising in false memory, is one of the experts they are hoping to call. She has testified in more than 300 trials, including those for high-profile defendants such as Harvey Weinstein, Ted Bundy and OJ Simpson. \nAccording to her profile on the UCI School of Social Ecology, Ms Loftus' research has revealed how memories can be changed by things we are told and information we subtly absorb after an event.\n\"She will describe scientific research showing that false memories can be described with confidence, detail, and emotion, just like true memories,\" the letter reads.\nAnother expert the defence wants to use is leading forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz, who has 40 years experience and has been part of more than 1,000 evaluations of allegations of sexual abuse, according to the letter.\nMr Dietz would testify that building the trust of the accusers did not automatically imply they would be abused.\nHe would also argue that there is no consistent definition for the term \"grooming\", and therefore no empirical evidence that Ms Maxwell committed \"grooming-by-proxy\" by allegedly arranging sexualized massages for Epstein.\nMr Dietz would testify that Epstein, \"like many people who achieve great power and wealth\" created and exploited a \"halo effect to surround himself with people who would serve his needs\". \nA hearing on admitting expert testimony is scheduled for Wednesday.\nMs Maxwell, the daughter of media mogul Robert Maxwell, has been accused of helping to recruit and groom four underage girls for Epstein to abuse from 1994 to 2004, and also charged with sex trafficking. \nEpstein killed himself in a New York prison cell on 10 August as he awaited his trial on sex trafficking charges."

      "text": "A fresh wave of bin strikes could hit Glasgow in the run-up to Christmas after GMB members rejected a new deal put forward by the council.\nIt had been hoped the offer of a 5.8% pay rise plus another 14 extra concessions, would be enough to end the industrial action.\nHowever, the GMB said its members had called for a fresh strike ballot.\nRefuse workers have been on strike for eight days over pay and conditions with the dispute due to end at midnight.\nGlasgow City Council earlier said it had hoped the new offer would improve local workforce relationships and bring unions further into the decision-making process.\nGMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said: \"It's taken a strike to get Glasgow's leadership in the room and acknowledge the council's chronic low pay problems, the waste crisis in our communities, and the toxic management culture in the cleansing department. \n\"Strikes are a consequence of workers feeling undervalued, disrespected, and ignored for too long, and it's clear that a few days of talks and the initial outcomes from this aren't enough to remedy the impact of a decade of cuts.\"\nHe said workers in cleansing, as well as those in home care, school support, parks and gardens, and Glasgow Life, were \"the backbone of the city's workforce\" but were \"struggling on wages that simply do not make ends meet\". \nMr Greenway added: \"Our members have demanded a fresh ballot, which could mean a second wave of strikes in the run-up to Christmas. They want more to be done to properly value key workers and to tackle the significant service and workforce challenges facing their city.\"\nThe council had offered to review the value of pay for all workers on the lowest grades, currently earning less than \u00a320,000 a year, as part of the process to remove pay and grading system.\nIt also offered to pursue investment for cleansing infrastructure and resources to tackle the city's waste crisis, alongside new employee development and well-being measures to address management mistreatment of staff.\nHowever, it refused union demands for a one-off \"Glasgow payment\" for all employees on Grade 1, 2 and 3 as a means of addressing the cost-of-living crisis it said was being faced by many workers.\nEarlier, GMB members held a rally in the city's George Square, which was attended by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nMr Corbyn told BBC Scotland: \"I take my hat off to them. I think they've done an amazing job of educating the public about how important refuse collection is, about explaining that they are getting lower pay than other people working in other neighbouring refuse collection areas and their heads are held high.\n\"I think it's very important that the eyes of the world are on Glasgow and therefore it's very important that workers in Glasgow, such as refuse workers, are properly paid and treated properly.\"\nLocal authority body Cosla had already proposed a pay rise of 5.8% for the lowest paid staff as part of a \u00a31,062 increase for staff earning below \u00a325,000.\nThe deal, for workers at all 32 Scottish councils, involves \u00a330m from the Scottish government and \u00a318.5m from local government. The GMB is also looking for a Glasgow-specific deal. \nThe union denied accusations that its two-week consultation - covering the period of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - was a political stunt. It said the dates were a coincidence.\nCouncillor Allan Casey who joined GMB discussions with council leader Susan Aitken, earlier said the offer would have improved local workforce relationships.\nMr Casey said it would have brought unions further into the decision-making process, offered training and support for a range of staff, and offered overtime to deal with the backlog created by the strike."

      "tags": "Companies,Nuclear power,Carbon neutrality",
      "text": "Rolls-Royce has been backed by a consortium of private investors and the UK government to develop small nuclear reactors to generate cleaner energy.\nThe creation of the Rolls-Royce Small Modular Reactor (SMR) business was announced following a \u00a3195m cash injection from private firms and a \u00a3210m grant from the government.\nIt is hoped the new company could create up to 40,000 jobs by 2050.\nHowever, critics say the focus should be on renewable power, not new nuclear.\nCurrently, about 16% of UK electricity generation comes from nuclear power.\nSmall modular reactors are nuclear fission reactors but are smaller than conventional ones.\nThe investment by Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources, Exelon Generation and the government will go towards developing Rolls-Royce's SMR design and take it through regulatory processes to assess whether it is suitable to be deployed in the UK.\nIt will also identify sites which will manufacture the reactors' parts and most of the venture's investment is expected to be focused in the north of the UK, where there is existing nuclear expertise.\nRolls-Royce's share price jumped by 4.2% to 147.85p each following the announcement.\nRolls-Royce SMR said one of its power stations would occupy about one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear plant - the equivalent footprint of two football pitches - and power approximately one million homes.\nThe firm said a plant would have the capacity to generate 470MW of power, which it added would be the same produced by more than 150 onshore wind turbines.\nWarren East, Rolls-Royce chief executive, said the company's SMR technology offered a \"clean energy solution\" which help tackle climate change.\nBusiness and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said SMRs offered opportunities to \"cut costs and build more quickly, ensuring we can bring clean electricity to people's homes and cut our already-dwindling use of volatile fossil fuels even further\".\n\"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the UK to deploy more low carbon energy than ever before and ensure greater energy independence\", he added.\nSMRs are thought to be less expensive to build than traditional nuclear power plants because of their smaller size. Due to the nature of Rolls-Royce's reactors, it is understood parts could be produced in factories and transported to sites by road, which would reduce construction time and costs.\nAt an expected cost of around \u00a32bn each, SMRs would cost less than the \u00a320bn each for the larger plant under construction at Hinkley Point and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk.\nIf approved for use in the UK, it is understood Rolls-Royce SMR could build up to 16 reactors across the UK for electricity production.\nTom Samson, chief executive Rolls-Royce SMR, said the company had been established to \"deliver a low cost, deployable, scalable and investable programme of new nuclear power plants\".\n\"Our transformative approach to delivering nuclear power, based on predictable factory-built components, is unique and the nuclear technology is proven,\" he added.\nHowever, Paul Dorfman, chairman of the Nuclear Consulting Group think tank, told the BBC's Today programme there was danger that the money spent on nuclear power would hit funding for other power sources.\n\"If nuclear eats all the pies which it is looking to be doing\u2026 we won't have enough money to do the kind of things we need to do which we know practically and technologically we can do now,\" he said.\nGreenpeace's chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said SMRs were still more expensive than renewable technologies and added there was \"still no solution to dispose of the radioactive waste they leave behind and no consensus on where they should be located\".\n\"What's worse, there's not even a prototype in prospect anytime soon,\" he added. \"The immediate deadline for action is sharp cuts in emissions by 2030, and small reactors will have no role in that.\"\nFriends of the Earth's head of policy, Mike Childs, said government support should be \"aimed at developing the UK's substantial renewable resources, such as offshore wind, tidal and solar, and boosting measures to help householders cut energy waste\".\nAs part of a \"10-point plan\" to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050, the government has said nuclear power provides a \"reliable source of low-carbon electricity\" and that it is \"pursuing large-scale nuclear\", while also looking to invest in SMRs.\nTony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the investment for Rolls-Royce was a \"hugely promising milestone for a technology that can not only boost the economy but help deliver a greener and more secure energy system overall\".\nMeanwhile, Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, added the funding sent a \"huge signal to private investors that the government wants SMRs alongside new large-scale stations to hit net zero\"."

Indeed, many MPs have second jobs.\nBut the extent to which he has focused on his legal work - and the fact he appears to have spent a number of weeks in the Caribbean - leaves question marks over whether he has got the balance right.\nNumber 10 haven't explicitly criticised him - but the inference in the comments of a spokesman for the PM were clear: MPs should prioritise their work in Parliament and make that work visible to their constituents.\nThe BBC has established that Sir Geoffrey was in the BVI in April and June this year on at least two separate trips, to work on a corruption investigation into the government of the Overseas Territory, which was launched by the UK Foreign Office in January. \nThe duration of the trips is not known but the Daily Mail, which first reported the story, said he had been there for nearly a month, between April and May.\nA BVI government press release on 26 April, announcing his arrival, said: \"Sir Geoffrey Cox QC, who is currently in quarantine, intends to hold a series of meetings with government ministers in the next few weeks.\"\nSir Geoffrey has not commented on the reports, but broadcasters at his constituency home have been told he is abroad.\nIn a letter to Boris Johnson, Labour Party chair Anneliese Dodds said: \"The people of Torridge and West Devon must be wondering if Geoffrey Cox is a Caribbean-based barrister or a Conservative MP.\" \nThe Liberal Democrats said the public would be \"gobsmacked\" by the reports into Sir Geoffrey's activities.\nBut the deputy chair of the MP's local Conservative Association, Debbie Flint, told the BBC the group \"fully supports our MP\"."

      "text": "Discount fashion chain Primark has said it could face disruption from global supply chain issues into 2023, but it assured customers that \"we are getting the goods we need\".\nChief executive George Weston told the BBC that Primark shops would be properly stocked for Christmas. \nThe chain had prioritised seasonal items, he said.\n\"We do not see any crisis developing as we look forward - it's just more difficult,\" he added.\nStore closures during Covid lockdowns hit the retailer's annual sales, down by 12% on pre-Covid levels.\nIts parent firm, AB Foods, said Primark had lost one-third of its trading days in the 53 weeks to 18 September.\nBut it added that it expected higher profits in the new financial year.\nMr Weston said that despite difficulties with clogged ports and the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, the \"vast majority\" of items stocked by Primark were still available, subject to some minor gaps.\n\"Your size in basic T-shirts might not be available on a certain day, but it might be the next day,\" he said.\nIn its latest results, Primark also announced big expansion plans, with new stores due to open in the US, France, Italy and Spain.\nOverall, it said its total store numbers would grow from 398 to 530 over the next five years, with the number of US outlets set to rise from 13 to 60.\nMr Weston said Primark was now established in the US, adding: \"It's no longer a punt - it's a rollout of a business we understand, to customers we know well.\"\nDespite the negative impact of the pandemic, Primark has found that some habits that became established under lockdown are working to its advantage.\nFor its autumn and winter range, the retailer said it was capitalising on the continued trend for \"comfort living\" and loungewear with the launch of what it called the \"snuddie\" - a \"snuggly oversized hoodie\", designed for \"those lazy days when your comfiest clothes just don't cut it\".\nPrimark said the snuddie was \"attracting a strong response from customers across all markets\", with best-selling versions including an avocado print for men and a Minnie Mouse design for children.\nUnlike most High Street retailers, Primark has no online retail operations.\nIt plans to overhaul its website early next year to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can \"browse online, before they come into our stores\". \nDespite its digital revamp, Mr Weston said Primark still had no plans to allow shoppers to order its products for home delivery.\n\"We've never said never to things like click-and-collect, but we're first and foremost a bricks-and-mortar retailer and we will remain very profitable as that,\" he added.\nAB Foods said its adjusted pre-tax profits had fallen by 1% to \u00a3908m for the year, with the dip in sales at Primark offset by \"strong\" sales in its food business.\nThe firm's chairman, Michael McLintock, said sales and profit were again below pre-Covid levels, but praised the \"agility\" of Primark's management in responding to \"the fast-changing and wide range of trading restrictions applied to our stores over the year\". \n\"The strength of Primark's sales after the reopening of all our stores in the spring demonstrated the relevance and appeal of our value-for-money offering,\" he added.\nMr McLintock said AB Foods - which, as well as running Primark, also owns food brands such as Twinings, Ovaltine and Patak's - was seeing \"significant cost increases in energy, logistics and commodities, in addition to the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations\". \n\"Primark is not immune to the challenges of supply chain, raw material cost and labour rate inflation,\" he said.\n\"Our businesses are working to offset the impact of these through cost savings. Where necessary, our food businesses will also implement price increases,\" he added.\nWhen asked if these cost savings could lead to job losses, Mr Weston said: \"No, we're recruiting staff, not cutting.\"\nHowever, he added that Primark saw opportunities to make existing workers more productive, giving the example of how it had automated a warehouse in the Netherlands while keeping staff levels the same.\nThe pandemic has proved costly for Primark. It lost \u00a32bn in sales last year when its stores had to close. A third of its trading days were lost. But it's weathered the storm. \nAll things being equal, it now hopes to more than make up the lost ground, assuming trading comes back to normal next year. And it has big plans for international expansion, with new stores in the US, France, Italy and Spain over the next five years. \nBut Primark's having to paddle hard to mitigate all the cost pressures now building up. Although AB Foods' food business is putting prices up where necessary, passing costs on to shoppers is less easy to do at its fast-fashion chain.\nPrimark says thanks to the weaker dollar and the steps it's taken to lower store costs, it hopes to broadly offset all the rising supply chain costs and inflationary pressures bearing down on the industry. \nMr Weston said Primark had \"delivered a good performance in the face of continued disruption to trading caused by the pandemic\".\n\"Although the possibility of further trading restrictions cannot be ruled out, we expect Primark to deliver a much-improved margin and profit next year,\" he added.\nAB Foods' share price rose by 6% to \u00a319.67 on Tuesday.

      "text": "Poland says it has repelled attempts by migrants to enter the country at its eastern border with Belarus, warning that thousands more were on the way.\nVideo footage showed hundreds of people near a barbed-wire border fence, which some tried to force their way through.\nThe Polish government called a crisis meeting on Monday and deployed 12,000 troops to the region.\nPoland has accused Belarus of pushing the migrants towards the border, describing it as hostile activity.\nPoland, Lithuania and Latvia say there's been a surge in the number of people trying to enter their countries illegally from Belarus in recent months. Many of them have come from the Middle East and Asia.\nThe European Union has accused Belarus's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko of facilitating the influx in retaliation against sanctions.\nPoland, which has been criticised for pushing back migrants and refugees at its border, has responded to the large number of people arriving there by building a razor-wire fence.\nThe Polish Border Guard also said it was closing its border crossing with Belarus at Kuznica from Tuesday morning. \nConditions for migrants on the border are hostile to the point of being deadly, and fears have been raised for their safety in the region's sub-zero winter.\nAs they are summarily expelled from Poland and Belarus refuses to allow them back in, people are finding themselves stranded and freezing in Poland's forests. Several have died of hypothermia. \nThe BBC's Paul Adams spoke to Barwa Nusreddine Ahmed, the brother of one Iraqi migrant who was at the border with his wife and three children. They arrived in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, last month.\nWith little to eat or drink, the people stuck at the border were suffering, Mr Ahmed said.\nHe said Monday's move to the border post was planned on social media by the migrants themselves, but suggested Belarus was pushing them.\n\"People know they're being used [by Mr Lukashenko], but they have no future,\" Mr Ahmed said.\nOn Monday, the Nato alliance said it was worried about \"escalation\" on the border with Poland and was ready to \"maintain safety and security in the region\".\nMeanwhile in Lithuania, the government there moved troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible influx of migrants and was considering declaring a state of emergency.\nAnalysis by Paul Adams, diplomatic correspondent\nThis is a significant escalation in a crisis that's been rumbling since the middle of the year.\nFor months, Belarus' EU neighbours have been accusing the Lukashenko regime of \"weaponising\" migration, in revenge for successive waves of EU sanctions on Minsk.\nMigrants have told us numerous stories of the role played by Belarussian soldiers in helping them to make illegal crossings into Poland and Lithuania. Some cross in small groups, while others have spoken of being transported to the border in military trucks and shown where to go.\nBut the latest pictures from the Polish border are unprecedented, recalling scenes from the Greek-Macedonian border at the height of the 2015-16 migrant crisis.\nThe sheer concentration of numbers at a single crossing point, along with the presence of Belarussian soldiers, apparently doing nothing to stem the flow of migrants to the border, suggest that once again, this is being orchestrated.\nIt's a charge Belarus denies.\nTensions intensified on Monday when videos posted on social media showed a column of people, including women and children, walking towards the Polish border in Belarus.\nOther videos showed large numbers of migrants being escorted by armed men dressed in khaki.\nPoland's deputy foreign minister, Piotr Wawrzyk, accused Belarus of trying to orchestrate a major incident near Kuznica Bialostocka, a village close to the border, and warned of \"an attempt at a mass border crossing\".\nIn other footage shared on social media, crowds of migrants can be seen attempting to breach a razor wire fence at the border, but being prevented from passing through by Polish border guards.\nThe head of Poland's National Security Council, Pawel Soloch, said he expected \"attacks on our border [to] be renewed by groups of several hundred people\" overnight. \nResponding to Monday's developments, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on EU member states to impose new sanctions against the Belarusian regime, which she accused of \"putting people's lives at risk\". \nMeanwhile, the US urged Mr Lukashenko to \"immediately halt [his] campaign of orchestrating and coercing\" the illegal flow of migrants across his country's border into Europe.\nThe Belarusian border guard agency earlier told state media that more than 2,000 \"refugees\" had amassed in front of Polish barriers. They were heading for the EU \"where they want to apply for protection\", the agency said.\nThe agency accused Poland of using \"unjustified\" means to repel \"people seeking protection\"."

The UK government is set to announce \u00a3165m to tackle climate change while addressing and empowering women to take climate action.

Top of their list is a greater commitment to \"net zero\" emissions targets - in other words not increasing the amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, produced when we burn coal, oil or gas to generate power) in the atmosphere. As Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London puts it: \"The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050.\"\nFormer US President Barack Obama earned a standing ovation for a speech declaring the world \"nowhere near where we need to be\" to avoid a climate catastrophe. He took aim at Donald Trump's \"active hostility toward climate science\" and chided Russia and China for their absence, calling on young people to \"stay angry\" while harnessing their frustration to press for political change. However, some activists pointed out the US had failed to honour key pledges made by Mr Obama's administration.\nWant to shop sustainably but flummoxed by the language around \"eco-friendly\" products?

      "text": "Scotland's vaccine passport scheme could be expanded to more hospitality and leisure venues amid fears of a new wave of Covid-19 cases over winter.\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney said the rules may need to be tightened in order to prevent a return to lockdown.\nThis could also include requiring face coverings to be used in more settings, and more home working.\nOpposition parties said the \"vague\" announcement would be of \"significant concern\" to businesses.\nAny changes will be confirmed at the next review of the restrictions on 16 November.\nPeople over the age of 18 currently need to show proof of vaccination in order to enter nightclubs and large events such as football matches and concerts.\nThe move has been controversial, with all opposition parties at Holyrood voting against it.\nThere was also an unsuccessful legal challenge by the hospitality industry and teething problems with the apps used to administer the scheme.\nMr Swinney told MSPs that the range of venues required to check vaccine status could be expanded in an attempt to head off a \"dangerous\" situation over the winter - and in particular the Christmas period. \nThe deputy first minister said the country was in a \"precarious and unpredictable\" position, with case numbers remaining at a \"concerningly high level\" and \"intense pressure\" on the NHS.\nHe said it was reasonable to suspect case numbers could rise over the winter period, with colder weather increasing the amount of time people spend socialising indoors and concerns about the COP26 conference.\nHowever, the test positivity results for Blue Zone pass-holders at the conference, based on lateral flow tests, was only about 0.1% last week.\nAll entrants to the central area of the climate conference must show proof of a negative lateral flow Covid-19 test, unless exempt, on each day they enter the site.\nMr Swinney said: \"It is because we want to avoid more difficult restrictions that we cannot rule out strengthening the baseline protective measures currently in place as the best way to head off any prospect of future lockdowns.\n\"We have been considering whether we may need to extend the Covid certification scheme to bring more settings into scope, such as further indoor hospitality and leisure settings.\n\"Among other possible interventions, we are exploring how we can help improve ventilation, what we could do to increase home working, and whether changes are needed to extend use of face masks.\n\"I would stress though that we have not yet taken any decisions about strengthening the existing baseline measures, and we will be discussing options with business sector organisations this week.\"\nSome business groups hit out at the suggestion that restrictions could increase ahead of the normally busy festive period.\nLiz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said it was \"essential we don't take a massive step backwards through the introduction of further economic deterrents\".\nShe said ministers should \"urgently get round the table with businesses to demonstrate the evidence for ramping up restrictions and detail what financial support they will make available if they choose to do so\".\nAnd David Lonsdale of the Scottish Retail Consortium said he was \"sceptical of the value\" of Covid passports in stores, coffee shops and restaurants, saying there would be \"practical and operational challenges\".\nHe also said a push for more working from home would impact on shopper footfall for city centre stores, saying this was still significantly below pre-pandemic levels.\nOpposition parties were critical of the lack of detail of Mr Swinney's statement, with Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross pressing for clarity about what venues could be affected.\nHe said: \"How can this government take these plans forward when they know the damage the scheme is already doing to Scottish businesses, and the impact it is having on people's jobs?\n\"Exactly which venues will be impacted by this change? This only brings more uncertainty for businesses sat an extremely difficult time - they need to know if they are on the cusp of being hit by added costs and extra hassle.\"\nScottish Labour MSP Daniel Johnson questioned whether the government would consider allowing a negative test to be submitted in lieu of proof of vaccination, with the deputy first minister saying this was under consideration.\nMr Johnson added: \"It will be of significant concern to all of those running hospitality businesses what the deputy first minister has stated in terms of the prospect of rolling out vaccine passports yet to more contexts, especially given the broad and non-specific nature of his statement.\n\"While nightclubs have door staff and a natural point to check these things, cafes don't tend to - so the practicalities of checking passports in these settings are hugely more challenging.\"\nMeanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said there was \"no evidence base\" for the use of vaccine passports, adding: \"They will not save Christmas.\""

      "text": "Thousands of phone boxes around the UK will be protected from closure.\nOfcom, the UK telecoms regulator, said it will stop BT from closing down 5,000 phone boxes in areas with poor mobile signals or high accident rates, if they are still needed by local communities. \nThe watchdog said that without such protection, some - which are considered \"vital\" - would still have been closed.\nFor the past few years BT has been decommissioning unused payphones.\nNow a phone box will be saved if:\nAt their peak, there were around 92,000 phone boxes in the UK, but now 96% of UK adults own a mobile phone.\nAbout 6,000 of the kiosks have been adopted by local authorities for other purposes, such as book exchanges. \nNow, if no payphone is needed, communities will be able to purchase them for \u00a31 and use them for other purposes.\nSelina Chadha, Ofcom's Director of Connectivity, said: \"Some of the call boxes we plan to protect are used to make relatively low numbers of calls. But if one of those calls is from a distressed child, an accident victim or someone contemplating suicide, that public phone line can be a lifeline at a time of great need.  \n\"We also want to make sure that people without mobile coverage, often in rural areas, can still make calls. At the same time, we're planning to support the rollout of new phone boxes with free Wi-Fi and charging. \n\"Under our plans, BT and KCOM - which operates Hull's unique white phone boxes - must also install batteries in some payphones, so they can still be used during a power cut.\"\nThere are currently about 21,000 call boxes across the country. For people without a mobile, or for those in areas with poor mobile coverage, these can be a lifeline for making calls to friends and family, helpline services and accessing emergency services. \nAlmost 150,000 calls were made to emergency services from phone boxes in the year to May 2020, while 25,000 calls were made to Childline, and 20,000 to the Samaritans.

      "tags": "Belarus,Lithuania,Alexander Lukashenko,Poland,Migration",
      "text": "The European Commission has accused Belarus's authoritarian leader of luring migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an \"inhuman, gangster-style approach\".\nAt least 2,000 migrants are now at the Belarus border with Poland.\n\"Upon arrival they are being pushed to the border and forced to make an illegal entry into the European Union,\" said Commission spokesman Peter Stano.\nBelarus's leader Alexander Lukashenko denies orchestrating the problem.\nEU and Nato members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia have all seen a surge in the number of people trying to enter their countries illegally from Belarus in recent months. Many are young men but they include women and children, largely from the Middle East and Asia.\nPoland has seen the most arrivals, especially around its major border crossing at Kuznica.\nMigrants have described how Belarusian authorities seized their phones and pushed them towards the border fence. Overnight temperatures at the border have slumped below zero and several people have already died in recent weeks. \n\"Nobody is letting us get in anywhere, Belarus or Poland,\" 33-year-old Shwan Kurd from Iraq told the BBC by video-call.\nHe described how he had arrived in Minsk from Baghdad at the start of November, and was now in a make-shift camp metres from Poland's barbed-wire fence.\n\"There's no way to escape,\" he said. \"Poland won't let us in. Every night they fly helicopters. They don't let us sleep. We are so hungry. There's no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women, and families.\"\nPoland has deployed extra troops after desperate crowds tried to cut the border fence on Monday. The border guard said more than 300 attempts had been made to cross illegally. The government warned of a possible \"armed\" escalation on its border with Belarus, fearing its neighbour might try to provoke an incident.\nThe head of Poland's national security department, Stanislaw Zaryn, said the migrants were under the control of Belarusian armed units. \"Belarus wants to cause a major incident, preferably with shots fired and casualties,\" deputy foreign minister Piotr Wawrzyk said on Monday.\nThe EU, Nato and the US all say Belarus is orchestrating the problem. Brussels accuses Belarus's disputed leader, Mr Lukashenko, of provoking the influx in retaliation against EU sanctions.\nThose sanctions were imposed after Mr Lukashenko's widely discredited re-election in August last year and subsequent crackdown on mass protests. \nAddressing parliament on Tuesday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki suggested Russian leader Vladimir Putin - a close ally of Mr Lukashenko - had had a hand in orchestrating the wave of migrants.\nIn an interview with the Belarusian state news agency, Mr Lukashenko said he wanted to avoid any military escalation on the border which could draw Russia into a conflict. \nHe said he was \"not a madman\" but he remained defiant, saying \"we will not kneel down\".\nThe Belarus defence ministry rejected the Polish statements as unfounded and unsubstantiated, and accused Warsaw of violating agreements by moving thousands of troops to the border. \nBelarus insists the migrants are arriving legally there and that it is merely acting \"as a hospitable country\".\nRussia has praised its ally's \"responsible\" handling of the border row and said it is watching the situation closely.\nLater on Tuesday, Lithuania declared a state of emergency in its border region with Belarus, the first time the Baltic nation has done so. Lithuania's interior minister Agne Bilotaite said this was a precautionary measure taken in response to events on the Belarusian-Polish border.\nThe measure was backed by MPs and will come into force at midnight, imposing restrictions on movement in the border region.\nActivists say the migrants are being used as pawns in a political game between non-EU Belarus and its neighbours. Poland has also been accused of pushing migrants back across the border, contrary to international rules of asylum.\nThe UN refugee agency's spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said it was very worried by the latest scenes: \"Using refugees, asylum seekers and migrants to achieve political ends is unacceptable and must stop.\"\nREAD MORE: How Belarus is helping \u2018tourists\u2019 break into the EU\nBBC correspondent Nick Beake who is near the border says Polish authorities are strictly enforcing a state of emergency in the area. It means independently verifying what's happening in this escalating migrant crisis is difficult, he says.\nThe European Commission is now looking to extend sanctions to include \"third-country airlines\" involved in flying migrants to Belarus. It said it was looking at flights to Minsk from a number of countries, including Syria, Iran and Qatar as well as Russia and several North African states. \nGermany on Tuesday urged the EU to \"take action\" to help Poland secure its borders. Lithuania has also moved troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible influx of migrants.\nAre you in the area? Have you been affected by what's been happening?

      "tags": "Carers,Unemployment,Gig economy,Long Covid,Job Retention Scheme,Gender pay gap,Employment,UK economy",
      "text": "Three out of four jobs advertised in the UK still do not offer any kind of flexible work options, according to an annual survey of over five million ads.\nThis is set against a backdrop of vacancies soaring to a 20-year high of 1.1 million between July and September. \nFlexible work consultancy, Timewise, tracked millions of ads for 17 words or phrases, such as job-share. \nFrom this analysis they found that the proportion of ads posted with a flexible component was just 26%.\nOver the last 19 months the coronavirus pandemic has delivered a seismic shake-up in many professions - flipping a large chunk of the workforce to remote-working overnight. \nAround half of employees now work flexibly in some form, while nine in 10 people say they want flexibility in their next position.\nOne of these jobseekers is Carole MacLeod, who before she had her daughter had a high-flying career as a consultant for a major UK telecoms provider. She managed C-suite executives at major events such as the World Economic Forum in Davos. \nNow in her fifties, she's finding it impossible to find similar level work. \n\"Now I cannot find a single good flexible job to apply for,\" she said. \n\"The market is flooded with jobs. But none that offer a decent wage, good enjoyable professional type work and flexibility too,\" she said. \n\"The kind of jobs that are available tend to be in hospitality, offering long poorly paid shifts that are below my skillset. Recruiters won't even answer the phone. I think I have applied for maybe one hundred jobs at various universities and academic institutions in central London. I find it bewildering.\"\nCarole is not alone: there are many mid-career workers who, despite a recent surge in job adverts as Covid restrictions eased, still cannot find work that fits with their need for flexibility and level of experience.\nThe work landscape has shifted but experts say the way roles are advertised suggest bosses have failed to adapt to find the best talent. \"Employers that don't include their flexible working offering within their job ads are making a huge mistake,\" said Professor Sir Cary Cooper, Organisational Psychologist at Alliance Manchester Business School. \n\"The hybrid model is what the majority of people want - and are currently practising.\" \nThe Timewise survey also revealed part-time work and low pay are still synonymous in the UK. Some 19% of the low paid jobs advertised -those paying up to \u00a320,000 full time equivalent -mentioned part-time possibilities. The highest chunk of any salary band.\nProf Cooper explained senior management may be making a conscious decision not to reference the term flexible working in any external communication \"because they fear potential employees will think that they have the automatic right to work remotely 24/7.\"\nHe points out however, that's not the reality for most workers. \"Most people are tired of working in this way. What they're looking for is a mix of being in the office and at home, so they can interact with other colleagues but also have the freedom to take time at home if they need it to juggle other life demands.\" \nEmma Stewart, co-founder of Timewise tells employers to be as explicit as possible about what forms of 'flex' they can offer. For example, 'this role can be offered on a three-day week basis'. \n\"We know nearly half of job seekers click away from roles that say 'open to flexible working'. They seek out ads which reflect the kind of flexible pattern they are looking for. Just as you search for jobs within a set salary range,\" she said. \nJanine Bosak, professor of Organisational Psychology at Dublin City University Business School said there might be several reasons why employers remain hesitant to refer to flexible working in ads. For example, when someone starts a new job, employers might prefer they be physically present to learn the ropes and company culture. \n\"Employers might also be reluctant to mention flexible working in their advertising materials as it might be perceived as a right to flexible working, whereas it might not always be possible to accommodate a desire for flexible working,\" she added.
