      "tags": "Personal finance,UK taxes,Budget 2021,Income tax",
      "text": "More than one million people are set to start paying income tax in the next five years, official forecasts say, due to a move announced in the Budget.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said that the threshold at which the tax starts being paid will be frozen until 2026 after a rise this April.\nIt means getting a pay rise could pull people into a higher rate of tax.\nCommentators have called it an increase in an individual's tax burden \"by stealth\".\nThe chancellor said that he wanted to be honest with the British public about the way in which money would be raised to pay for support schemes during the coronavirus pandemic.\nAt present, people start paying 20% income tax when they earn \u00a312,500 a year, known as the personal allowance.\nThe first \u00a312,500 they earn is tax-free with the 20% rate only being charged on everything they earn above that amount, up to the higher rate tax threshold.\nThe starting point for paying the higher 40% rate is \u00a350,001.\nThese thresholds will go up to \u00a312,570 and \u00a350,270 in April, but will then be frozen until April 2026.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's official but independent forecaster, said this policy would bring 1.3 million more people into paying income tax and one million more into paying at the higher rate. This is known as fiscal drag.\nWhile the Scottish government has the ability to vary tax rates and bands under its devolved powers, the tax free personal allowance threshold is set by the chancellor and applies to the whole of the UK.\nThe OBR said that, when taking the rise in the cost of living into account, it would effectively bring the personal allowance in 2025-2026 to the level it was in 2014-2015.\nThe Budget documents show this hits middle to higher income earners the hardest.\nThe policy will bring an extra \u00a38bn a year into the Treasury coffers, compared with what it would have received if it had raised the thresholds in line with inflation.\nThe Conservative manifesto pledged that the main rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT would not rise, and this does not break that pledge.\n\"The next few years will see the burden of tax on individuals rise quietly by stealth,\" said Jason Hollands, from financial advisers Tilney.\n\"But given pre-Budget fears\u00a0of a potential Viking-like raid on personal wealth, middle-class Britons\u00a0- particularly those with savings and investments - can sleep a little easier tonight.\"\nBecky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor, said: \"Freezing allowances is a back-handed way of raising taxes, as wage inflation and asset price inflation increase the number of people pushed over the thresholds at which they have to pay more tax.\n\"Frozen allowances and thresholds have a habit of remaining fixed for many years, dragging more people into tax charges over time.\" "

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak will reveal the government's tax and spending plans in the Budget later - and the latest announcement before the speech is that the UK furlough scheme will be extended to the end of September. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, as it's officially known, began in March 2020 and was due to finish at the end of April. It pays 80% of an employee's wages when they cannot work during the pandemic. It has protected 11m jobs so far, at a cost of almost \u00a350bn, and has already been extended twice. Under the latest extension, the employer will pay 10% of the furlough in July, and 20% in August and September. Mr Sunak will also announce that a fourth grant from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will be available from April. Our budget preview is here - while the chart below shows how UK public sector net debt has risen.\nTexas will end its mask rules and allow businesses to reopen at full capacity next week, Governor Greg Abbott has announced. \"It is now time to open Texas 100%,\" the Republican said on Tuesday. Texas is the largest US state to end its mask mandate. Similar rules have also been lifted in other states, including Michigan, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The decisions are at odds with US President Joe Biden, who has said restrictions are still necessary. Here's an earlier video on how some US Covid victims are being remembered.\nThe end of the recent lockdown in the Isle of Man was toasted across the island - but restrictions are back after a spike in cases. The 21-day \"circuit breaker\" began at 00:01 on Wednesday. There are currently 52 active cases on the Isle of Man - and more than 40 cases have been linked to a ferry crew member, who tested positive on 18 February.\nSome international arrivals to the UK have waited nine days for Covid test kits that should be taken on day two of a 10-day quarantine. Travellers from countries not on the UK's \"red list\" must purchase a \u00a3210 testing kit, with a test taken on day two and day eight of isolation. Those who do not take the tests may face penalties of up to \u00a32,000.

      "tags": "Personal finance,Housing market,UK economy,Budget 2021,Stamp duty in the United Kingdom",
      "text": "Speculation is rife about a possible extension of the stamp duty holiday in England. Tens of thousands of property buyers have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to offer help. Earlier this month the BBC spoke to some of them.\nWith twin boys approaching the age of two, Simon Ashley and his wife Katie soon realised they needed more space at home.\nSo the family decided to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday and move to a bigger property just outside Harrogate.\nThe chain was quickly settled, and they thought they would be in their new home by Christmas.\nBut, with many thousands of people also planning to move during the pandemic, they now face a race to beat the tax break deadline at the end of March.\n\"The stamp duty holiday is a big thing for us. To put it bluntly, the impact is just over \u00a312,000,\" said Simon, aged 34. \"It is making us nervous.\n\"The problem we have being in a chain is that we don't know how it will affect the people below us. It could stop it all, which will be terrible.\"\nThe tax concession in England and Northern Ireland means no stamp duty is paid on the first \u00a3500,000 of a property sale.\nIn Scotland, where the equivalent levy is called the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, and in Wales, where buyers pay Land Transaction Tax, there have been temporary tax breaks too.\nAll are set to return to their pre-pandemic thresholds on 1 April.\nFor buyers - particularly those in more expensive areas, or buying larger properties - that will mean the end of a tax saving of up to \u00a315,000.\nData from property portal Zoopla, for the BBC, suggests that between 70% and 82% of sales would be stamp duty free if they completed by the end of March.\nThat, and savings at the higher end of the market, created a surge in activity. In turn, that meant professionals in the sector, from surveyors and solicitors, to local councils and estate agents, were all busy.\nThe extra workload, at a time when many faced Covid-related staff shortages and practical working restrictions, meant delays in the house-buying process.\nThat affected families like the Ashleys and many thousands of others, like Nigel Moore. \nHe is typical of a trend as people look to move out of the city to the country or coast, with regular working from home set to continue.\nPlans to move to the north Norfolk coast with wife Ashley-Jane and border collie Fergus have been brought forward by years, but then delayed too by the stamp duty rush.\nHe says he is \"looking closely at the diary\", hoping to complete in time, but - as he works in the mortgage industry - he knows others will not be so lucky.\nEstimates suggest that as many as 300,000 sales could fall through because the stamp duty break will expire - although there is no way of knowing yet how accurate that prediction will be.\nZoopla predicts that there will be a sudden drop-off in sales, with an expectation of 20% fewer transactions between April and June compared with the first three months of the year.\nThat so-called cliff-edge has prompted lobbying of ministers - and particularly of the chancellor, Mr Sunak - to extend the tax breaks.\nA petition, set up by a buyer whose new home will not be built in time, is calling for a six-month extension to the stamp duty holiday. It has been signed by nearly 150,000 people.\nSome in the housing sector suggest that will just create another cliff-edge, but six months later, and so they want the chancellor to think a little more imaginatively.\nBeth Rudolf, from The Conveyancing Association, said: \"What we'd really like is for anybody who is already in a transaction to still receive the stamp duty concession when they complete. It is all about trying to bring fairness back.\"\nThis so-called tapering, to allow buyers ready to complete to benefit, could stop the sudden drop in activity seen after stamp duty concessions used by previous chancellors. It may also stop pressure on sellers to drop their price to ensure a sale.\nFinance ministers in Scotland and Wales have confirmed their plans to cancel the tax break at the end of March, giving people time to prepare, and there is still little sign of Mr Sunak doing things any differently at next month's Budget.\nA Treasury spokesman said: \"The temporary stamp duty cut is helping to protect hundreds of thousands of jobs which rely on the property market by stimulating economic activity.\n\"Its time limited nature is what has encouraged people to take advantage of the scheme.\"\nFor people like Simon Ashley, who says the money he has saved would be pumped back into the economy, that time limit may be coming a bit too soon."

      "tags": "Contact tracing,Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The search for an individual infected with the Covid variant first found in Brazil has narrowed to 379 households in south-east England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. \nHe said the batch of home testing kits in question had been identified and each household was being contacted. \nIt is one of six cases of the P.1 variant found in the UK in February.\nMr Hancock told MPs the UK's current vaccines had not yet been tested against this variant. \nBut work is already under way to tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new \"variants of concern\". \nUpdated vaccines could be ready within months, enabling people to get a booster shot in the autumn. \nPreliminary data from Manaus - the Amazonian city hit hard by the P.1 variant - suggest it is more contagious and may evade immunity provided by past Covid infection.\nThis raises questions about how well current vaccines, which were designed around earlier versions of the virus, might work. \nMr Hancock said the variant had caused \"significant challenges\" in Brazil.\nHe added: \"We're doing all we can to stop the spread of this new variant in the UK, to analyse its effects, and to develop an updated vaccine that works on all these variants of concern and protect the progress that we've made as a nation.\"\nThe search comes as the UK recorded 6,391 new coronavirus cases, down 33% on last Tuesday. \nThe number of daily deaths reported has also fallen to 343 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, down 60% on last week. \nMeanwhile, Mr Hancock said the government was \"on track\" to meet its target of offering a vaccine to everyone in the top nine priority groups, including all over-50s and those with underlying health conditions, by 15 April and all adults by the end of July. \n\"Although the day-to-day figures of supply are lumpy, we have some bumper weeks ahead later this month,\" he added. \nIt almost went unnoticed with all the focus on the Brazil variant, but during his statement to the House of Commons Mr Hancock made an uncharacteristically confident prediction about vaccine supply.\nHe said there are some \"bumper\" weeks to come. It contrasts with the policy to date, which has been to not talk about supply or, when pushed, to keep referring to it as lumpy.\nSo why the change of tack? It is mainly related to production at AstraZeneca's two UK plants which are now both fully up-to-speed.\nIt could mean around four million doses a week could be given in the second half March - compared to between two and three million in recent weeks. Soon after that supplies of a third vaccine, Moderna, may start arriving in the country.\nMinisters often refer to the programme as a race - the vaccine against the virus. Well, if that's the case, the vaccination programme could soon be at full throttle.\nThe person infected with the variant who has not been traced used a home testing kit but did not complete their contact details, Mr Hancock said. \n\"Incidents like this are rare and only occur in around 0.1% of tests,\" he added. \nNews of the mystery case prompted an appeal for anyone without a result from a test on 12 or 13 February to come forward immediately by calling 119. \nThe case is not linked to five other cases of the Brazil variant in the UK and Mr Hancock said all these individuals quarantined at home as they were legally required to. \nTwo of the cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire. They tested positive after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force for arrivals high-risk countries. \nEveryone in five postcode areas of South Gloucestershire is now being invited to take a Covid test, even if they do not have symptoms.  \nMr Hancock said testing and sequencing in South Gloucestershire was being stepped up \"as a precaution\" and there was \"no information to suggest the variant has spread further\". \nTwo other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant.\nPHE has said officials are tracking down passengers who were on the same flight - from Sao Paulo to Heathrow, via Zurich - as the two South Gloucestershire cases.\nA BBC reporter, Juliana Gragnani, was on another flight arriving at Heathrow from Brazil around the same time on 10 February. \nShe said on Tuesday she had been has been sent a Covid test kit, along with other passengers on her flight.\n\"After quarantining for more than two weeks, just to make sure, this afternoon I got a call from Test and Trace,\" she said. \"They're sending me a Covid kit and said this is being done with all passengers in my flight - AF1580. \n\"They also asked if I had taken a test after arriving in England.\"\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said tougher border controls should have been in place sooner. \nHe asked: \"How on earth can a test be processed that doesn't collect the contact details and what mechanisms will be put in place to fix this in the future?\" \nThe other three cases are Scottish residents who flew to Aberdeen from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said. \nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman said there was no reason to believe the variant is in circulation in Scotland. \nHowever, she urged all those who were on board the BA1312 flight from Heathrow to Aberdeen on 29 January to contact the NHS National Contact Tracing Centre, because the correct details were not available for all passengers.

      "tags": "Television",
      "text": "Ant Middleton has said the \"woke patrol\" had taken over SAS: Who Dares Wins, leading him to exit the series.\nOn Tuesday, Channel 4 said it would not work with him again due to his \"personal conduct\".\nIt did not go into further detail, but there was speculation it was connected to controversial comments Middleton previously made on social media.\nOn Wednesday, The Daily Mirror reported Middleton made inappropriate comments to a member of staff on the show.\nIn response, Middleton told Good Morning Britain he accepted he hadn't been the easiest person to work with and had \"butted heads\" with the production team - particularly because the show, in his opinion, had been watered down.\nBut he noted that confrontational language and behaviour was necessary to protect the authenticity of the military-based series.\n\"Over the years, the PC patrol have kicked in, the woke patrol have kicked in to the point where we can't say anything, we can't be ourselves,\" he told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid.\n\"We can't even act on the ground without health and safety jumping in going, 'Oh! You can't put them in at shoulder level in the water, you've got to put them at waist height' and it's been so controlled and so managed and so inauthentic now that I've decided to be completely walk away.\"\nChannel 4 told BBC News: \"Our decision not to renew Ant Middleton's contract and not to work with him again was solely based on his personal conduct off camera and is not related to his on-screen persona as a DS. SAS: Who Dares Wins will continue to be as tough as it's ever been.\"\nOn Wednesday, Middleton said: \"When I filmed the last episode, it became a half-scripted sort of reality show, full control was taken from me, from health and safety to production.\"\n\"And after that I said, 'Look, I'm not gonna film anymore, I'm done with SAS: Who Dares Wins'. I wanted to part in a healthy way and in a positive way.\n\"[Channel 4] knew I was going, and all of a sudden they dropped this bomb about Black Lives Matter, about been axed.\"\nLast June, Middleton apologised after referring to Black Lives Matter (BLM) and English Defence League (EDL) protesters as \"absolute scum\". In March last year, he also backtracked on comments he made about the coronavirus pandemic after he urged people to \"carry on as normal\".\nMiddleton continued: \"Ultimately what they're doing is they're protecting their brand and they knew I was going, they got in there before me.\"\n\"Everything else is smoke and mirrors, all these excuses that are coming out, everything like inappropriate comments.\"\nReferring to allegations of inappropriate comments, Middleton said: \"It's like, 'You're on SAS: Who Dares Wins. We say inappropriate things, we do inappropriate things. If you get offended by them, then then so be it.'\n\"The course is a hardcore course, it's gritty, you're going to see inappropriate things, you're going to witness inappropriate things, but it's never direct.\"\nMiddleton said he hadn't been told the details of an alleged complaint from a female staff member but said he assumed it was someone objecting to a \"military banter\"-style comment he might have made on set about a new recruit.\nThe 40-year-old said his working relationship with the station and the show's production company started off as a good one, but the he was no longer able to make the show \"true to the military ethos\", as was the original intention.\nIn its initial statement, Channel 4 said: \"Following a number of discussions Channel 4 and Minnow Films have had with him in relation to his personal conduct it has become clear that our views and values are not aligned and we will not be working with him again.\"\nBut Middleton responded on Wednesday: \"Channel 4 and Minnow Films' statement is very reckless and desperate.\n\"That's the word - it's desperate. Especially backed by excuses like the BLM tweet. The BLM tweet I've done just under a year ago, [and] settled that.\n\"I didn't word it correctly and I acknowledged that, but we put that under the carpet. And a couple of months later, I filmed two more series of SAS: Who Dares Wins.\"\nSAS: Who Dares Wins has run for seven series, since 2015, and former United Kingdom Special Forces (UKSF) soldier Middleton has been the chief instructor throughout.\nThe show sees civilians put through gruelling military training exercises to test their physical and mental strength.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Texas will lift its mask requirement and allow businesses to reopen at full capacity next week, Governor Greg Abbott has announced.\n\"It is now time to open Texas 100%,\" the Republican said on Tuesday.\nTexas is the largest US state to end its mask mandate. Mr Abbott has faced criticism from his party over the measure, which was imposed last July.\nBut the administration of US President Joe Biden has made it clear coronavirus restrictions are still necessary.\nThe announcement in Texas came as similar rules were lifted in other states, including Michigan, Louisiana, and Mississippi, which also ended its mask mandate.\nThe roll-out of vaccinations against Covid-19 has boosted confidence in a return to pre-pandemic life in the US.\nOn Tuesday, President Biden said the US was on track to have enough vaccines for every adult in the country by the end of May.\nYet the wave of reopenings has put states at odds with the Biden administration and its senior health officials, who have reacted with dismay to the relaxation of coronavirus measures at a precarious time in the pandemic.\nOn Monday the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned of a \"potential fourth surge of cases\" if the country lapsed into complacency. \nCovid-19 data shows that, while infections and deaths have declined in recent weeks, they are still at high levels relative to other countries.\nIn total, the US has recorded more than 28 million infections and 516,000 deaths related to Covid-19, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University.\nMr Abbott issued an executive order that rescinded most of the coronavirus measures he imposed earlier in the pandemic.\nThe new executive order, which is to take effect on 10 March, lifts all mask requirements and forbids local authorities from penalising residents who do not wear a face covering. \nIt removes all restrictions on businesses in counties without a high number of Covid-19 patients in hospital.\n\"Too many Texans have been sidelined from employment opportunities,\" Mr Abbott said in a speech at the Chamber of Commerce in the city of Lubbock. \"Too many small business owners have struggled to pay their bills. This must end.\"\nHe said that with increased vaccinations and improved treatment for Covid-19, the state was \"in a far better position now\".\nBut, he added, \"Covid has not suddenly disappeared\". Following weeks of decline, coronavirus infections and related deaths are creeping up again in Texas, data from the Covid Tracking Project showed.\nTexas has recorded more than 43,000 deaths related to Covid-19, the third-highest state toll in the US.\nAngelica Casas, reporting from San Antonio, Texas\nGovernor Abbott's announcement was no surprise to Texans. After all, the state's pandemic response has been political from the start.\nThe state's Republican leadership favoured former President Donald Trump's relatively relaxed approach to imposing restrictions. But that created tension with local officials in the state's major cities, which all lean Democrat.\nIt was control of the disease vs control of the economy. Mask requirements vs maintaining personal liberties. And when the surges came, state politicians were more reactive than proactive.\nA year later, not much has changed. The state's death toll and current case rate are still among the highest in the US. That's why critics say Governor Abbott's decision does not follow the science.\nSo the decision will be a test to the state - but also to Mr Abbott's relationship with President Biden, who has addressed the pandemic with more urgency than his predecessor.\nIndividual states are in charge of public health policy in the US. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, most introduced restrictions on businesses and travel.\nAbout 35 required face coverings to be worn in public places - either indoors or outdoors - although enforcement of these mask mandates has been patchy.\nWith cases and deaths falling sharply in recent weeks, several states have begun easing the restrictions.\nShortly after Mr Abbott's announcement, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said he would do the same in an even shorter time frame.\n\"Starting tomorrow, we are lifting all of our county mask mandates and businesses will be able to operate at full capacity without any state-imposed rules,\" Mr Reeves said.\nHealth experts have warned that the pandemic was far from over and cases could pick up if curbs were lifted too soon.\nPresident Biden - in contrast with his predecessor Mr Trump - has made fighting the virus a priority for his administration.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Biden said he was upbeat about reaching his goal of delivering 100 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office, but urged Americans to remain vigilant in wearing masks and observing social distancing.\n\"Today's announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic,\" Biden said in a televised statement from the White House. \"But I have to be honest with you. This fight is far from over.\""

      "tags": "HM Treasury,Spending reviews,Money,Economics,Personal finance,Housing market,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021,Universal Credit",
      "text": "On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget.\nHe'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on.\nEach year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. \nIt outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services.\nThe Budget speech will be delivered on Wednesday 27 October.\nIt usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. \nThis year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: \nAfter the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing.\nThe Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid.\nA number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise in the minimum wage from \u00a38.91 per hour to \u00a39.50 and an end to the public sector pay freeze.\nThe chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions:\nBudget 2021: What has already been announced?\nMeasures such as the furlough scheme - which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic.\nTo close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. \nIn the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed \u00a3320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. \nEconomists expect it to borrow around \u00a3180bn more this year, another enormous sum. \nDuring his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead.\nThe government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises.\nOne major tax rise was announced in September - the \u00a312bn Health and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT.\nThere has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier.\nAt the same time, the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills.\nHe is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. \nOverall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England.\nThe government has already said that the NHS in England will receive an extra \u00a35.9bn to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans.\nBut other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport, are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgets next year. \nThey have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful.\nSome parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. \nOthers, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions.\nScotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK.

      "title": "Christian Porter: Australian attorney general denies rape allegation",
      "tags": "Australia",
      "text": "Australia's Attorney General Christian Porter has identified himself as the cabinet minister at the centre of a rape accusation - an allegation he strongly denies.\nA letter sent to Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week alleged Mr Porter had raped a 16-year-old girl in 1988. The woman took her own life last year.\nNew South Wales Police have closed their investigation into the matter.\nMr Porter, 50, said he retained Mr Morrison's support as attorney general.\n\"The things that are being claimed did not happen,\" he told reporters in Perth on Wednesday.\n\"Nothing in the allegations that have been printed ever happened.\"\nAustralian media have widely reported the allegation against a cabinet minister since last Friday, but not previously revealed his identity.\nA former crown prosecutor, Mr Porter entered parliament in 2013 and became attorney general in 2017. \nAs the chief law officer of the nation, he controls one of the most senior government portfolios and is responsible for legal affairs, national and public security. \nThe alleged victim reported her complaint to New South Wales Police last year but did not make a formal statement. The investigation was suspended after she died last June, aged 49. \nBut last week a letter was sent by friends of the woman to Mr Morrison and opposition lawmakers, raising the allegations again.\nMr Porter said the letter accused him of raping the girl at a high school debating tournament at Sydney University in 1988. \nHe has strongly denied any wrongdoing, adding the only information he knew about the allegations was what had been reported in the media.\nThe attorney general said he had known the woman \"for the briefest periods, in debating competitions, when we were teenagers, about 33 years ago\". She had been one of his teammates, he added.\nAsked by journalists, he said he did not think he had ever been alone with the woman and had had no contact with her since January 1988. \nMr Porter said Mr Morrison had given him his \"full backing\" to remain as attorney general. \n\"If I stand down from my position as attorney general because of an allegation about something that simply did not happen, then any person in Australia can lose their career... based on nothing more than an accusation that appears in print,\" he said.\nBut he would take two weeks of leave for his mental health, he added.\nThe case was referred to police again last week by opposition lawmakers.\nBut on Tuesday, police confirmed they were dropping their investigation because there was \"insufficient admissible evidence to proceed\".\nSexual assault cases typically cannot proceed to prosecution in Australia without an alleged victim's testimony. \nBut Mr Morrison's government has faced calls for a separate, independent investigation into the allegations.\nThe woman's friends and many prominent Australians have called for a judicial investigation - an inquiry led by a judge into a matter of public concern.\nMr Porter said he had never been contacted by police or anyone else about the allegations.\nThe government has been rocked by a wave of sexual assault allegations in the past fortnight.\nIt began with Brittany Higgins, a former aide to two government ministers, alleging she had been attacked by a male political adviser in 2019. She said she had later felt pressured to stay silent or risk losing her job.\nHer account inspired other women in Australian politics circles to come forward with allegations.\nThe friends of Mr Porter's accuser said they had also come forward because of the debate stirred by Ms Higgins' case.\nThere are many reasons why this allegation has been so explosive and potentially damaging for Scott Morrison's government. It involves a sitting cabinet minister - the attorney general, the first law officer of the land, noting of course that he is entitled to the presumption of innocence. \nThe alleged victim took her own life last year and so is not here to speak for herself. \nBut it's also the secrecy and opaqueness by which the prime minister and members of his cabinet have chosen to deal with the whole matter.  Given it seemed inevitable that police would close their case, the government is facing calls to launch its own investigation.\nLegally, this is a bit of uncharted territory: would it be a private investigation? Would a retired judge oversee it? Would it involve a parliamentary committee?  \nPolitically, however, Scott Morrison and the whole Canberra bubble face a much more persistent issue. Remember, this all comes after Brittany Higgins inspired so many other women to come forward. This again brings to the surface a wider debate about what many have described as a toxic work culture for women in Australia's corridors of power. "

However, her family said she received the vaccine through the NHS.\nLabour has said she has not been suspended from the party but will effectively sit as an independent councillor while an investigation is carried out.\nThe original Facebook post showed Ms Azad and another woman receiving injections from a man in medical scrubs and PPE, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).\nThe comment said it was a \"Private Care Doctor for Covid 19 vaccine\"\nIt added: \"A long wait for NHS waiting list. We had take away from Akber take away.\"\nIt is unclear where Ms Azad may have received the vaccine.\nAccording to The Department of Health and Social Care, it would be illegal to administer vaccines outside of the NHS.\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which would be responsible for any enforcement action, said it was investigating.\nLynda Scammell from the agency said: \"Vaccines that are not authorised for use in UK, and if purchased from outside the legitimate NHS supply route, cannot be guaranteed to meet standards of quality, safety and effectiveness.\"\nCouncillors Susan Brown and Liz Brighouse, the leaders of the Labour groups at Oxford City Council and Oxfordshire County Council respectively, issued a joint statement in relation to the post. \nIt said: \"Following a recent post on her Facebook account about her Covid-19 vaccination, Councillor Jamila Azad has been suspended by the whips of both the Oxfordshire County Council and Oxford City Council Labour groups, pending further investigation. \n\"Councillor Azad has now removed the post in question.\n\"We will be making no further comment on this matter until formal investigations into it have been completed.\"\nCouncillor Craig Simmons, who leads the Greens at Oxford City Council, said Ms Azad would have breached the authority's code of conduct if she had paid for the vaccine privately. \n\"If [she] did indeed bypass the NHS and secure a vaccine from a private medical facility through illegal means then her position is untenable,\" he said. \n\"Principles such as selflessness, honesty and integrity are core to the code and Councillor Azad's behaviour, should the allegations be proven, would fall far short of what is expected and required of all councillors.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "The furlough scheme will be extended until the end of September by the chancellor in the Budget later.\nRishi Sunak said the scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - would help millions through \"the challenging months ahead\".\nSome 600,000 more self-employed people will also be eligible for government help as access to grants is widened. \nBut Labour said the support schemes should have been extended \"months ago\".\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has protected more than 11 million jobs since its inception last March and had been due to close at the end of April.\nIt has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as tens of thousands of businesses remain shut. \nEmployers will be expected to pay 10% towards the hours their staff do not work in July, increasing to 20% in August and September, as the economy reopens. \nGovernment support for self-employed people has also been extended until September.\nA fourth grant under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) scheme will run from February until April, covering up to 80% of three months' trading profits up to \u00a37,500.\nThere will be a fifth grant from May to September.\nPeople whose turnover has fallen by 30% or more will get the 80% grant, but self-employed people whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will get a 30% grant.\nThe government is widening access to grants, meaning some 600,000 more self-employed people will be eligible.\nPeople who filed their tax returns for 2019-20 by midnight on Tuesday are now eligible.\nSpeaking ahead of the Budget, the chancellor said: \"Our Covid support schemes have been a lifeline to millions, protecting jobs and incomes across the UK.\n\"There's now light at the end of the tunnel with a roadmap for reopening, so it's only right that we continue to help business and individuals through the challenging months ahead - and beyond.\" However, he is expected to warn in his Budget that there are tough economic times ahead.\nAre you currently on furlough?  Share your experiences.\nIt is incredible to think that last year's Budget did not even contain the word \"furlough\". Official confirmation of a pandemic came hours after its publication, swiftly rendering most of its numbers obsolete.\nBut so far in this crisis, unemployment has gone up only modestly. Furlough and the separate support scheme for the self-employed have prevented mass unemployment.\nThese extensions now aim to prevent a rapid rise in joblessness at the end of the schemes. The BBC understands that unemployment forecasts will be revised down on Wednesday as the chancellor promises to deploy his \"full fiscal firepower\" to \"protect livelihoods\" - the theme of the Budget red book.\nAt more than \u00a310bn, this intervention is almost worthy of a Budget in and of itself.\nBut the full document will reveal whether the chancellor's borrowing spree is limited to the \"rescue phase\" of this crisis, or if his confidence in a jobs bounce-back means the economy does not need further stimulus and could even sustain some business-focused tax rises.\nAfter the jabs, the jobs are the great hope.\nEconomic think tank the Resolution Foundation's chief executive, Torsten Bell, said the phased tapering-off of the furlough scheme would avoid a \"risky cliff-edge\" for employers, but warned that the \"peak of unemployment is ahead rather than behind us\".\nHowever, Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the changes to support schemes \"could have been made months ago\" - accusing Mr Sunak of focusing on \"getting his moment in the sun rather than protecting jobs and livelihoods\".\nThe SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has said furlough must be in place  \"as long as businesses and devolved governments need it\".\nHe said he was \"concerned companies are going to have to step in and pay greater contributions\".  \nAnd Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said that while the extra months of furlough support offer \"some stability in the rocky months ahead\", the scheme should be extended until 2022.\nBut Chris Wootton, chief financial officer at Sports Direct, said that although the furlough extension was helpful, other assistance was needed for businesses such as his, chiefly through business rates, payment of which has been suspended for almost a year.\nHe told the BBC: \"What we really want is structural reform. This is just kicking the can down the road.\n\"We don't know what the systemic changes to consumer behaviour are going to be. We said even before Covid happened that a number of House of Fraser stores where we're working very closely with landlords, paying zero rent, they are still losing money because the business rates are far from fair.\""

      "tags": "Economics,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021",
      "text": "There has arguably never been a moment in living memory where business and government need each other more than now. Clinging together like the passengers in the front car of a rollercoaster - this Budget is the moment the photo is snapped after the sickening plunge, grimaces fixed for the ride ahead. \nBusiness needs the government to go on another massive spending splurge to get us to the other side of lockdown. \nIn many ways, the \"roadmap\" out of lockdown already told us the most important stuff that will be in the Budget. Furlough, the business rates holiday, additional grants and VAT deferrals and cuts for hospitality are all pretty much guaranteed to the end of June, when the government hopes firms will be able to operate with few restrictions.\nAfter that, the roles start to reverse. \nWestminster will need help from businesses to preserve and create millions of jobs. Companies will need incentives to invest, build, hire and train - particularly younger workers who have suffered the most and on whose economic future the success of this moment may be judged for decades. \nGovernments can encourage, but ultimately it is businesses which create.\nIncreased capital allowances, the expansion of youth training programmes and subsidies like the Kickstart Scheme are all expected in a speech behind which the mantra \"jobs, jobs, jobs\" will be almost audible from the Treasury building. \nThe tight embrace between government and business seems a long way since the concerns of business were swatted away with a four-letter \"swish\" by a prime minister who saw them as an irritant in the project of getting Brexit done.\nThe UK is in more debt than it's been in for more than 50 years. At over \u00a32 trillion, it is equivalent to 100% of its entire annual income for the first time since the early 1960s, when debt was still on a downward trajectory from spending on World War Two.\nBy far the most powerful weapon against debt is growth: it has a doubly positive effect. It increases the denominator (the bottom number) of the debt to GDP ratio, while reducing the numerator (the top bit) by keeping the bill for benefits like Universal Credit lower.\nThat is why the next twist on this rollercoaster ride is the most perilous. No-one really knows how many of the almost five million workers still on furlough have a job to go back to. More than anything, this Budget is about how many of them can return to, or find new, work.\nThere will be some eye-catching whizzes and bangs as the government experiments with ideas like freeports, drums up extra funding for start-ups and proposes looser stock market listing rules to grow new firms and attract international investors. \nBut sooner or later - and I suspect the emphasis will be later than recent headlines suggest - the government will need businesses help to pay off some the UK's enormous debts. \nCorporation tax will rise slowly. But this is perhaps a good example of how little politics figures in this Budget. The chancellor arguably has more to fear from his own backbenches than he does from a Labour party, who find themselves in the unusual position of siding with the very MPs in their opposition on tax rises on businesses - who already enjoy the lowest rates in the G8.\nBut corporation tax is pretty small beer anyway. It contributes less than 8% of all tax collected by the government, compared with the 45% it receives from income tax and National Insurance from individuals who have - you guessed it - jobs, jobs, jobs. \nThe government is also scared that the \"free money\" window may be closing. Ever since the financial crisis, governments have been able to borrow at close to zero rates of interest. \nThere are signs that is changing. A 1% rise in borrowing costs will cost the government five times more than it will get by raising the corporation tax rate by 1%.  \nThat is why the government and businesses will need to hold each others' hands on a ride they really are in together."

      "text": "The tax holiday on stamp duty rates which was introduced in July 2020 finishes in England and Northern Ireland at the end of September.\nFrom 1 October, home buyers will have to pay stamp duty on all purchases above \u00a3125,000.\nStamp duty is a tax paid on property purchases.\nIn July 2020, the government announced a cut to help buyers whose finances were affected by Covid. \nUntil 31 March 2021, home buyers didn't have to pay stamp duty on the first \u00a3500,000 of a purchase price.\nThis meant a saving of up to \u00a315,000.\nThe government later extended the tax holiday until 30 June, and then again until 30 September.\nDuring this period home buyers didn't have to pay stamp duty on the first \u00a3250,000: \nFrom 1 October 2021, rates return to pre-Covid levels. That means the point you start paying stamp duty will be \u00a3125,001:\nYou can use the government's Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) calculator to find out how much you will pay.\nThe stamp duty holiday definitely stimulated the housing market. \nUK house prices rose 8% in the year to July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). \nThat followed a record increase of 13.2% in June, the biggest jump since November 2004. \nEstate agents reported a surge of interest in March as buyers and sellers rushed to complete property deals before the scheme was initially due to end. \nDemand continued when the holiday was extended until June and then again until September. \nHowever, there are many other reasons why house prices have been surging. \n\"The final closure of the stamp duty scheme at the end of September may have no impact at all,\" says Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agents Fine and Country. \n\"Other factors are so much more important, namely the race for space, low supply, accidental savings and low interest rates.\"\nFirst-time buyers do not have to pay any stamp duty on property purchases up to \u00a3300,000. \nHigh Street lenders are also offering mortgages to borrowers with a deposit of just 5%, under a government guarantee scheme which launched in April 2021. \nThe policy is designed to help more first-time buyers secure a home.\nThe new scheme is available to anyone buying a home costing up to \u00a3600,000, unless it is a buy-to-let property, a second home or, in some cases, a new-build.\nThe government's annual take from stamp duty is about \u00a312bn, according to latest HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) figures.\nThat's roughly equivalent to 2% of the tax the Treasury collects.\nThere were also similar tax cuts for house buyers in Scotland and Wales. \nIn July 2020, the starting point for land and buildings transaction tax (LBTT) in Scotland was increased to \u00a3250,000, but the concession stopped on 1 April, when the England and Northern Ireland holiday was originally due to end. \nIn Scotland, the current rates of Land and Buildings Transaction Tax are: \nScottish landlords pay an extra 4% Land and Buildings Transaction Tax on top of standard rates.\nThe Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers (LIFT) helps people buy their first property either on the open market, or from a council or housing association. \nIn July 2020, the Welsh government also increased the threshold for its land transaction tax (LTT) for people buying their main home to \u00a3250,000. It later extended the holiday until 30 June, with rates reverting back to normal from 1 July. \nThe current rates of Land Transaction Tax are: \nWelsh landlords pay an extra 4% Land Transaction Tax on top of standard rates.\nThe Welsh government runs various schemes to help people to buy a home.

      "text": "A single Covid vaccine dose gives high levels of protection against severe disease, even in the oldest age groups, more evidence shows.\nA study on patients in two Bristol hospitals found both Pfizer BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca jabs prevent 80% of hospital admissions among over-80s.\nSome European countries are refusing to use the Oxford jab on older groups because of a lack of convincing data.\nLead researcher Prof Adam Finn said the findings should change their minds.\nFrance agreed to offer the vaccine, which is easier to store than the Pfizer jab, to over-65s only recently, while Germany still isn't doing so. \n\"This study is much more important for non-UK countries than it is for the UK,\" said Prof Finn, who is running the study at the University of Bristol.\nIn the UK, this age group has now been immunised, he said.\n\"But there are lots of doses of AstraZenena vaccine available in European countries and they are not being given to people over the age of 65 - in some countries over the age of 55 - for lack of data.\n\"Well here are the data... showing that you can save lives in elderly people by giving them a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and those countries need to get on and start doing that as fast as possible.\"\nThe Bristol findings support figures from other studies, including those run by Public Health England and Public Health Scotland, which looked at whole populations. \nThe England study found a 57% and 63% reduction in the risk of symptomatic infection in over-80s with the Pfizer and Oxford jabs respectively, 14 days after a single dose.\nAnd both jabs reduced  hospital admissions by more than 80%. \nIn Scotland, one dose of Pfizer appeared to provide an 85% reduction, and Oxford 94%, in admissions in this age group, over a slightly longer period - 28-34 days after a first dose. \nBut the researchers recommended not focusing too closely on small differences in numbers.\nThe studies look at slightly different things and all have fairly wide margins of error. \nAs more time passes and more people are vaccinated, more data will emerge, so these margins of error will shrink. This should allow scientists to be more confident in their estimates. \nThe overall message from all the data coming out so far is both vaccines provide very good protection from illness.\nThis study was slightly different from the other two mentioned. \nIt focused on the oldest and frailest people at two major hospitals in Bristol, rather than looking at a whole population.\nWe would expect these people to respond least well to a vaccine, because their natural immunity is weaker.\nAnd the researchers looked not at their chances of mild or moderate disease, as with other studies, but at how many vaccinated people still became severely ill and needed to go into hospital.\nThey were also able to look in more detail at patient records, including how long after having symptoms they were admitted to hospital.\nThis meant the team could identify and exclude from their sample people who had symptoms for more than 10 days before having a test, to reduce the chance of false negatives which could affect their findings. \nVaccine clinical trials generally enrol younger people and measure whether any of them develop symptoms.\nThis is good at telling us how well that group is protected against mild and moderate disease.\nBut Prof Finn said what we really want to know is:\nThe Siren study of healthcare workers published last week suggests the vaccine stopped 70% of infections, even in those without symptoms, meaning those people could not transmit the virus. \nNow, this Bristol study adds to our understanding of the first question - the biggest driver of loss of life and pressure on hospitals. \nThe study will continue for another two years to monitor the effectiveness of the vaccine on different groups. \nFor example, the team hopes to identify specific factors that \"make people at increased risk of not responding well to these vaccines,\" said Dr Catherine Hyams. \nThat doesn't mean the vaccine will harm those people, but that those with compromised immune systems may not be able to benefit from the protection the jab is supposed to confer. \nFollow Rachel on Twitter"

After that they will be discounted to one third of the normal charge for the rest of the financial year, up to a maximum of \u00a32m for closed businesses. \nThe chancellor called it \"a \u00a36bn tax cut for businesses\". \nMajor supermarkets and other retailers which had been allowed to stay open as essential businesses said they would repay the rates relief they received last year, giving back \u00a32bn of the estimated \u00a311bn it cost the Treasury.\nAsda, Tesco and Sainsbury's said they would do it again this time.\nSainsbury's said in a statement: \"Despite significant ongoing costs associated with protecting colleagues and customers from Covid-19, we expect that the vast majority of Sainsbury's stores will remain open this year. \n\"We will therefore forgo the business rates relief on all Sainsbury's stores again this year. We will also forgo the business rates relief on all standalone Argos stores once they reopen.\"\nThe VAT discount to 5% for food and drink sold in pubs and restaurants will last until the end of September. After that it will increase to 12.5% - which is still below the normal rate of 20% - for a further  six months.\nMr Sunak pointed out there were 150,000 hospitality and tourism businesses employing 2.4 million people.  \nOther measures announced in the Budget include a business restart scheme, which allocates a total of \u00a35bn in funding for small business grants of up to \u00a318,000.\nUnder the scheme, non-essential retail businesses will receive grants of up to \u00a36,000 per premises, as they will be allowed to open first. Hospitality and leisure businesses, including personal care and gyms, will get grants of up to \u00a318,000, because they will stay closed for longer and will be more affected by restrictions.\nMr Sunak said some businesses would still need loans despite the restart grants. He said he was introducing a new recovery loan scheme which would allow businesses of any size to apply for loans from \u00a325,000 up to \u00a310m.\nChristian Mole of business services group EY said the industry still faced serious challenges, even once it opened up fully in May: \"Outdoor services will only be profitable for a small portion of the sector. \n\"Even after the scheduled 17 May full reopening, social distancing measures are likely to continue to limit operating capacity in restaurants and pubs. Across all hospitality, many operators also face significantly increased debts and deferred rental obligations.\n\"Hospitality businesses will need ongoing government support as long as these challenges remain in place, so it is encouraging to see the sector-specific support being offered.\""

      "text": "More than one million people are set to start paying income tax in the next five years, official forecasts say, due to a move announced in the Budget.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said that the threshold at which the tax starts being paid will be frozen until 2026 after a rise this April.\nIt means getting a pay rise could pull people into a higher rate of tax.\nCommentators have called it an increase in an individual's tax burden \"by stealth\".\nThe chancellor said that he wanted to be honest with the British public about the way in which money would be raised to pay for support schemes during the coronavirus pandemic.\nAt present, people start paying 20% income tax when they earn \u00a312,500 a year, known as the personal allowance.\nThe first \u00a312,500 they earn is tax-free with the 20% rate only being charged on everything they earn above that amount, up to the higher rate tax threshold.\nThe starting point for paying the higher 40% rate is \u00a350,001.\nThese thresholds will go up to \u00a312,570 and \u00a350,270 in April, but will then be frozen until April 2026.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's official but independent forecaster, said this policy would bring 1.3 million more people into paying income tax and one million more into paying at the higher rate. This is known as fiscal drag.\nWhile the Scottish government has the ability to vary tax rates and bands under its devolved powers, the tax free personal allowance threshold is set by the chancellor and applies to the whole of the UK.\nThe OBR said that, when taking the rise in the cost of living into account, it would effectively bring the personal allowance in 2025-2026 to the level it was in 2014-2015.\nThe Budget documents show this hits middle to higher income earners the hardest.\nThe policy will bring an extra \u00a38bn a year into the Treasury coffers, compared with what it would have received if it had raised the thresholds in line with inflation.\nThe Conservative manifesto pledged that the main rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT would not rise, and this does not break that pledge.\n\"The next few years will see the burden of tax on individuals rise quietly by stealth,\" said Jason Hollands, from financial advisers Tilney.\n\"But given pre-Budget fears\u00a0of a potential Viking-like raid on personal wealth, middle-class Britons\u00a0- particularly those with savings and investments - can sleep a little easier tonight.\"\nBecky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor, said: \"Freezing allowances is a back-handed way of raising taxes, as wage inflation and asset price inflation increase the number of people pushed over the thresholds at which they have to pay more tax.\n\"Frozen allowances and thresholds have a habit of remaining fixed for many years, dragging more people into tax charges over time.\" "

      "text": "A fire officer has told an inquiry he \"felt ashamed to be a firefighter\" after being held back from responding to the Manchester Arena bombing.\nThe first fire engine did not arrive at the scene until two hours after the explosion that killed 22 people.\nDuty command officer Alan Topping said firefighters were \"angry\" they were not able to help in the aftermath of the attack.\nHe said crews felt they \"let the people of Greater Manchester down\".\nTwenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017.\nOn the night, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) crews were sent to Philips Park Fire Station, two miles (3km) from the arena.\nWatch manager Andrew Simister told the inquiry it was a \"massive decision error\".\n\"We wanted to go the arena because that's our job, ride a fire engine. We have got first aid capabilities. After an explosion people are in distress and it's our job to go.\n\"I thought we were going there (Philips Park) because they had a plan. There was no plan.\"\nCounsel to the inquiry, Paul Greaney QC, read a statement from a firefighter who recalled a paramedic who was \"pleading with us to go and help\". \nIn tears, the paramedic asked firefighters why they were \"stood around\" at the station instead of helping casualties at the arena.\nMr Topping, who was a group manager for GMFRS, said he was shocked when he found \"a lot of firefighters hanging around\" at Philips Park fire station.\n\"They were impatient, they wanted to go,\" he told the hearing. \nAfter the attack, Mr Topping said he attended a de-briefing where some firefighters turned their backs on a senior officer who had been unable to explain why they had been held back.\nHe said some firefighters were brought to tears because they felt \"such shame and disappointment\".\n\"I had never seen firefighters cry at a debrief,\" he said.\n\"We didn't respond and we didn't do our jobs to make a difference. It took me a couple of days to put my shirt back on such was the strength of my feelings.\n\"I felt ashamed to be a firefighter. I felt we had let the people of Greater Manchester down.\"\nThe inquiry has heard previously that police declared a marauding terrorist firearms attack amid erroneous reports of gunfire but failed to inform the fire and ambulance services.\nAnd none of the three blue light services met at a rendezvous point to discuss a planned response.\nMr Topping said senior incident commanders were not working properly together and were \"too secretive\".\nWhen he arrived at the scene, he wrote in his feedback he felt like he was \"gate-crashing\".\nMr Topping, who worked for GMFRS for 32 years, said he did not believe that things within the service had improved sufficiently when he retired in September.\nHe agreed with John Cooper QC, representing the bereaved families, that the scene at the fire station a mile from the arena \"felt wrong\" because important resources and services his colleagues could have provided were \"simply wasted\".\nHe said there was \"a lot of anger, upset, confusion\" among the crews who were impatient at being kept away from the scene.\nThe inquiry continues.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "title": "The seven key questions Nicola Sturgeon faced",
      "tags": "Scottish government,Alex Salmond inquiry,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "Scotland's first minister gave evidence to a Holyrood inquiry looking into her government's 2018 harassment investigation of Alex Salmond. It was found to be unlawful by a court in a process which cost the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds. \nMr Salmond - and others - have made a number of allegations against the government and against Nicola Sturgeon herself. So, what were the key questions, and how did she answer them?\nThis was the most serious allegation for Ms Sturgeon. Mr Salmond had said he believed Ms Sturgeon definitely broke the code. Her political opponents say if she did, she would have to quit.\nThe allegations focus on when she found out about the Scottish government investigation into Mr Salmond. She initially claimed it was 2 April 2018, but since then another meeting on 29 March, when it's claimed she was told the details, has emerged.  \nThis isn't just a matter of a few days. If Ms Sturgeon knew what the second meeting was about, she would have known it was government business and she should have reported it to civil servants at the time. That didn't happen. \nMr Salmond has said Ms Sturgeon is guilty of several breaches of the code in relation to these meetings.\nWhat did Nicola Sturgeon say?\nShe told the committee that the fact that she did not remember the 29 meeting had been the subject of comment and scepticism and she wished her memory of it was \"more vivid\". \nThe first minister said she recalled that it may have been indicated \"in general terms\" there was a harassment issue but the purpose of the meeting was to arrange for her to see Mr Salmond himself.\nMs Sturgeon said that what she heard on 2 April in the dining room of her home was so significant that it may have \"obliterated\" what came before. She said Mr Salmond's account to her of his \"deeply inappropriate behaviour\" is a \"moment in my life that I will never forget\".\nThe first minister said she did not record the meeting with Alex Salmond on 2 April immediately because she did not want to compromise the independence or the confidentiality of the process.\nMs Sturgeon said the terms of the procedure excluded her from any investigation into a former minister and she should not even have known an investigation was under way. In her view, any undue influence on the procedure would have been more likely to arise if those conducting the investigation had been informed that she knew about it.\nMr Salmond believes there was a malicious and concerted plot against him from several people close to Nicola Sturgeon - including her husband, who is the SNP's chief executive, and her Scottish government chief of staff. \nThe evidence, Mr Salmond has claimed, shows there was a deliberate effort to damage his reputation \"even to the extent of having me imprisoned\". Much of this evidence Mr Salmond refers to, however, has not yet been published, so we don't know for sure how strong it is.\nBut he told the committee last week he had been given a memory stick in the run-up to his criminal case, where he was cleared of all charges. Mr Salmond claims it shows senior allies of Ms Sturgeon \"pressurising police\". He also alleges there was \"construction of evidence\" and \"collusion of witnesses\".\nWhat did Nicola Sturgeon say?\nMs Sturgeon said the suggestion that anyone acted with malice or as part of a plot against Alex Salmond was \"absurd\".\nShe argued there was \"not a shred of evidence\" to support Mr Salmond's claims and she had \"no motive, intention, (or) desire\" to conspire against him. Ms Sturgeon said text messages between leading SNP figures - including her husband - were not evidence of a plot.\nShe said they had been taken out of context and were \"not as presented\". \nThe Scottish government has been criticised for failing to provide all the documents the committee asked for. On Tuesday, legal advice was made available under the threat of a confidence vote against Ms Sturgeon's deputy, John Swinney. \nAnother question is why the documents Mr Salmond believes show a conspiracy were not published earlier.\nThe straight answer is that they were provided to him for his legal case - which means they can't be used for any other reason. But the committee now has them after compelling the Crown Office to hand them over. \nThere was a colossal row last week when part of Mr Salmond's evidence to the committee was taken down from the parliament's website. It contained some of the most damning allegations against Ms Sturgeon and claims she misled parliament.\nParts of the document were withdrawn after the Crown Office - Scotland's prosecution service - said extracts were in contempt of court and could identify Mr Salmond's accusers.\nMr Salmond has claimed the lines between the government and Crown Office have become blurred - something the Lord Advocate has said is untrue. \nWhat did Nicola Sturgeon say?\nMs Sturgeon said it had been a complex matter and the government had provided information in a proper way. The first minister says, for different reasons, she shared a lot of the frustration.\nShe said when information is not provided there is \"a lot of mystique and intrigue\" built up, which proves not to be the case when it is released. Ms Sturgeon said many of the things said about the legal advice proved not to be true.\nAlex Salmond wants resignations. He has said the government's Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans should resign and that the head of the Crown Office - the Lord Advocate, James Wolffe - should be considering his position.\nMr Salmond argued Scotland's institutions hadn't failed - but their leadership had in this case.\nHe even left the door open to Ms Sturgeon having to resign herself - saying it was for others to judge if she should quit. \nThat's a damning conclusion from the man who led the Scottish government for seven years.\nMs Sturgeon will be asked if he's wrong - and is likely to mount a passionate defence of her government. \nShe has also made clear she is sticking by her permanent secretary and the Lord Advocate - as well as the others who Mr Salmond has said should be thinking about their position.  \nWhat did Nicola Sturgeon say?\nThe first minister said there were serious mistakes made by the civil service.\n\"But the civil service in Scotland acts properly and impartially at all time,\" she said.\nMs Sturgeon said attacks on the civil service and the prosecution service were unfair and deeply unfounded. She said there had been an attack on \"the very fundamentals of our democracy\", which she finds \"deeply distressing\".\nThis is a big part of the committee's remit. They are trying to find out what led to the introduction of a policy which Mr Salmond successfully challenged in court.\nIt's been argued the policy was introduced too quickly and failed everyone involved; Mr Salmond and those who accused him of harassment.\nIt's widely accepted this was a big mistake from the government. \nWhat did Nicola Sturgeon say?\nThe first minister said organisations all over the world were reviewing their policies at that time due to the #metoo movement.\nMs Sturgeon said gaps and weaknesses in the existing policies were identified and they were keen to address them quickly but they did not cut corners. She said the harassment policy had not failed but it had not been properly followed in Alex Salmond's case. \nThe Scottish government conceded the judicial review on the ground that their had been \"prior contact\" between the independent investigating officer and those who had made harassment complaints. \nThe Scottish government initially defended the harassment policy in the face of Mr Salmond's legal challenge.\nOn Tuesday night it finally published its legal advice, which shows concerns were raised by the senior counsel - an external legal adviser - in October 2018. \nIn December, external lawyers said the least worst option would be to admit defeat. The case wasn't conceded until January 2019.\nThis has raised questions over whether the government should have made that decision earlier - and potentially saved a lot of money in the process. \nWhat did Nicola Sturgeon say?\nMs Sturgeon said that every time a government defends a legal action it is risking public funds. She also insisted the government had not prolonged its defence of the investigation and had acted in accordance with the views of the law officers.\nMs Sturgeon said that on 11 December the law officers' view was there was no question or need to drop the case. But she agreed the note on the 19 December was \"catastrophic\" and led to the ultimate concession.\nThe first minister insisted she was acting in accordance with the views of the law officers.\nMr Salmond claimed in his evidence that the name of one of the complainants was revealed during the government investigation. \nOn Tuesday night, that claim was backed up by two witnesses. Revealing the name would be a significant breach of confidentiality.\nWhat did Nicola Sturgeon say?\nReplying to the claim that a senior member of Ms Sturgeon's team revealed the name of the complainant to Mr Salmond's former chief of staff, the first minister said: \"I am not accepting that that happened.\"\nShe said her assumption was Mr Salmond had previously apologised to one of the women and may have worked out another's identity \"through his own investigations\".\nChallenged about details of the investigation being leaked to the Daily Record newspaper in 2018 - the first public confirmation of allegations against Mr Salmond - Ms Sturgeon said it \"didn't come from me, or anyone acting on my instruction or request\"."

      "text": "Artists from 41 countries will appear live at this year's Eurovision Song Contest in the Netherlands under plans set out by the event's organisers.\nExecutive supervisor Martin Osterdahl told the BBC it was \"necessary\" for participants to travel to Rotterdam.\n\"This isn't a holiday trip, this is actually a job that needs to be done,\" he said, adding that a decision had yet to be made on a possible live audience.\nLast year's event was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe contest is due to take place in Rotterdam in May this year. Dutch singer Duncan Laurence won the competition in 2019 with the song Arcade. \nSpeaking to the BBC's Newscast podcast, Mr Osterdahl said the latest plans were developed following discussions with organisers of other international live events.\n\"We have been in close contact with organisations like Formula 1, the tennis tour, the golf associations, and learned from best experiences,\" he said. \n\"We've compared our plans to the likes of the IOC [International Olympic Committee].\"\nMr Osterdahl said it had not yet been decided if an audience should attend the live event, but that organisers were hoping for \"the most normal Eurovision song contest that we can\". \n\"Hopefully we'll have some audience, it makes a huge difference to the atmosphere of the broadcast if we have some people present.\"\nHe said, however, that delegations would be smaller than usual - limited to 20 people, down from an average of 38 - and that health and safety measures to be put in place were \"very thorough\". \nEurovision presenters like Graham Norton, who commentates for the UK's BBC coverage, will broadcast from ventilated commentary booths under the plans.\nContestants had earlier been asked to produce a \"live-on-tape\" performance ahead of the competition, with the videos to be used if artists were unable to travel due to the pandemic, or forced to quarantine at the venue.\nAll 41 countries who were scheduled to compete in 2020 will return this year, as will many of the contestants who were supposed to take part last year. However, all artists will be required to perform a different song.\nReturning entrants include Ireland's Lesley Roy and Iceland's Dadi Freyr, who was tipped as a potential winner. \nNew coronavirus cases have been falling in most European countries, however some are seeing a rise in infections.\nLockdown measures - including travel restrictions and quarantine requirements - were tightened in many of the worst-affected countries over the winter, but some restrictions are now being lifted.\nThe Netherlands has recorded more than a million cases of Covid-19 and 15,775 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak will set out the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday afternoon, and rumours are rife about what giveaways and cuts lie in wait.\nHowever, he has also announced a number of his plans ahead of the speech. Here is what we know already:\nAs the pandemic has upended many people's working lives, the furlough scheme will be extended until the end of September.\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, or furlough scheme, applies across the UK. It covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they can't work, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month. \nAs Covid restrictions start to lift, employers will have to help cover part of the cost of their furloughed workers' salaries. They already have to pay pension and National Insurance contributions.\nEmployees will continue to receive 80% of their salary for hours not worked until the scheme ends.\nMore support will also be announced for self-employed workers on Wednesday, with more than 600,000 people, many of them newly self-employed last year, now eligible for cash grants.\nPubs and other hospitality venues have been battered by the pandemic, so the chancellor has promised a \u00a3150m pot to help communities take over local \"boozers\" at threat of closure. \nUnder the fund, which will open in the summer, community groups will be able to bid for up to \u00a3250,000 of matched-funding to help them to buy local pubs to run as community-owned businesses. \nIn \"exceptional cases\" up to \u00a31m will be available to community groups to buy their  local sports club. \nMr Sunak said it would help keep such venues at \"the heart and soul of our local towns and villages\". \nTens of thousands of small businesses will be offered free MBA-style management training to help them boost productivity growth, the Chancellor has said. \nUnder the so called \"Help to Grow\" scheme, the government will plough \u00a3520m into free online courses from top business schools. \nIt will also fund 50% discounts on new productivity-enhancing software.\nMr Sunak will announce a \u00a3300m recovery package for sport, another sector battered by social distancing restrictions. \nThe self professed cricket fan says his beloved sport will get a \"significant chunk\" of this cash, after last season was played behind closed doors. Other sports such as tennis and horse racing will also benefit.\nHe has also promised \u00a325m of new funding to support grassroots football - enough to build around 700 new pitches across the UK, as well as cash to kick-start a 2030 UK and Ireland World Cup bid.\nThe arts sector has struggled since last March, as gig venues, museums and cinemas have been forced to close. Many who work in the sector are freelancers who have fallen through the cracks of support for the self-employed. \nIn the Budget the chancellor is expected to put an extra \u00a3300m into the \u00a31.57bn Culture Recovery Fund, with England's museums and cultural bodies also receiving \u00a390m to keep going until they can open their doors on 17 May at the earliest.\nThere will also be \u00a318.8m for community cultural projects, and \u00a377m for similar initiatives in the devolved nations. \nThe chancellor is to unveil details of a \u00a35bn grant scheme to help struggling High Street shops and hospitality firms in England reopen after lockdown.\nThe chancellor said the grants would be worth as much as \u00a318,000 per firm, but some business groups say the money is not enough. \nNearly 700,000 shops, restaurants, hotels, hair salons, gyms and other businesses in England, will be eligible for the so-called \"restart grants\", to be distributed directly to firms by local authorities from April. It will replace the current monthly grant system.\nThe UK's Covid vaccination rollout will receive an extra \u00a31.65bn in the Budget to help it reach its target of offering a first dose to every adult by 31 July.\nOver 20 million people in the UK have had a first dose and NHS England is now asking 60 to 63-year-olds to book jabs.\nRishi Sunak said it was \"essential we maintain this momentum\".\nThe Budget will also include a mortgage guarantee scheme to help people with small deposits get on the property ladder.\nThe government will offer incentives to lenders, bringing back 95% mortgages which have \"virtually disappeared\" during the pandemic, the Treasury says.\nThe new scheme is not restricted to first-time buyers or new-build homes, but there will be a \u00a3600,000 limit.\nIt is based on the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, which closed to new loans at the end of 2016. \nThe Treasury said the scheme \"reinvigorated the market for high loan-to-value lending after the 2008 financial crisis\".\nBut housing charity Shelter said that scheme increased house prices by 1.4%.\nThe Chancellor will announced a \"fast-track\" visa scheme to help start-up and rapidly growing tech firms source talent from overseas. \nApplicants will no longer need to obtain a \"third-party endorsement\" or be backed by a sponsor organisation, simplifying the current rules and making it easier for researchers, engineers and scientists to come to the UK.\nMr Sunak will plough an extra \u00a3126m into the traineeship scheme, which sees the government pay employers who give young people work placements.  \nCurrently the government pays firms \u00a32,000 per trainee, but this will rise to \u00a33,000. He'll also create a new \"flexi-job\" apprenticeship in England that will enable apprentices to work with a number of different employers in one sector. "

      "tags": "Jamaica,Bob Marley,Music",
      "text": "One of reggae's most important voices, Bunny Wailer, has died at the age of 73.\nThe musician, from Kingston, Jamaica, was a founding member of The Wailers alongside his childhood friend, Bob Marley.\nTogether, they achieved international fame with reggae classics like Simmer Down and Stir It Up, before Wailer left to go solo in 1974.\nHe went on to win three Grammys and was given Jamaica's Order Of Merit in 2017.\nHis death was confirmed by manager Maxine Stowe, and Jamaica's Culture Minister, Olivia Grange.\nThe cause of death is unknown, but he had been in hospital since having a stroke in July 2020.\nTributes have already poured in for the musician, with fans and fellow musicians describing him as a legend.\n\"This is one of the lowest moment in the history of our culture,\" wrote dancehall artist Shaggy on Facebook. \"You have made us proud king. Rest well.\"\n\"Oh man, god bless Bunny Wailer,\" wrote Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist, Flea.  \"What a true rocker and noble man. I love him.\"\nAndrew Holness, Jamaica's prime minister, also paid tribute, calling his death \"a great loss for Jamaica and for reggae\".\nThe star, whose real name was Neville O'Riley Livingston, had been the last surviving member of The Wailers, following Bob Marley's death from cancer in 1981, and Peter Tosh's murder during a robbery in 1987.\nBorn on 20 April 10, 1947, Livingston spent his earliest years in the village of Nine Miles, where he was raised by his father, Thaddeus, who ran a grocery store.\nThat was where he first met Marley, and the toddlers soon became firm friends, making their first music together at Stepney Primary and Junior High School. \nFollowing the death of Marley's father in 1955, his mother, Cedella, moved in with Livingston's father. The boys were essentially raised as step-brothers, especially after Cedella and Thaddeus had a daughter together, Pearl.\nAfter moving to Trenchtown in Kingston, they met Peter Tosh and formed a vocal group called The Wailing Wailers - because, Marley said: \"We started out crying.\"\nThe area was poor and afflicted by violence. Livingston later remembered building his first guitar from \"a bamboo staff, the fine wires from an electric cable and a large sardine can\".\nBut singer Joe Higgs, aka \"the Godfather of Reggae\", lived nearby and took the boys under his wing. Under his tutelage, they refined their sound, adding vocalist Junior Braithwaite and backing singers Beverly Kelso and Cherry Green before shortening their name to The Wailers. \nIn December 1963, the band entered Coxsone Dodd's infamous Studio One to record Simmer Down, a song Marley had written calling for peace in the ghettos of Kingston.\nFaster and harder than the music The Wailers later became known for, the song was an immediate hit, reaching number one in Jamaica. They followed it up with the original version of Duppy Conqueror, before releasing their debut album The Wailing Wailers, in 1965.\nSoon after, the band went on hiatus as Marley got married and moved to the USA, and Livingston served a year in jail for marijuana possession. But they still managed to release 28 singles between 1966 and 1970, before releasing their second album, Soul Rebels.\nTheir international breakthrough came three years later with Catch A Fire - the first record they made for Chris Blackwell's Island Records. \nThe collaboration came about almost by accident. The Wailers had been touring the UK with Johnny Nash - who'd had a hit with a cover of Stir It Up - but found themselves unable to pay for their trip home.\nBlackwell offered to sign the band to Island, paying them an advance to cover their air fares and cost of recording an album in Jamaica.\nMuch to the band's displeasure, some of the songs were overdubbed to make them more palatable to an international audience. \n\"I felt the way to break the Wailers was as a black rock act; I wanted some rock elements in there,\" Blackwell later told Rolling Stone. \"Bunny and Peter didn't want to leave Jamaica, so Bob came to England when we did the overdubs.\"\nThe album was not a major seller and failed to chart in both the US and UK - but it has become widely recognised as a classic. Rolling Stone magazine recently placed it at number 140 in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, writing \"the Wailers' ghetto rage comes across uncut\" in  songs like Concrete Jungle and Slave Driver.\nCommercial success followed with 1973's Burnin', which featured classic cuts like I Shot The Sheriff, Small Axe and Get Up, Stand Up.\nHowever, it was to be the Wailers last album to feature the original Wailers line-up.\nTensions already present were exacerbated by Island marketing their albums under the name Bob Marley and The Wailers, and a touring schedule that kept Livingston away from his family. \nHe eventually left in 1973, saying the touring lifestyle clashed with his Rastafarian beliefs - citing the pressure to eat processed foods and play \"freak clubs\". He later said fame was the enemy of creativity. \n\"Music is based on inspiration and if you're in an environment where you are up and down, here and there, that's how your music is going to sound,\" Livingston told The Los Angeles Times in 1986. \n\"People get taken away in getting themselves to be a star and that is a different thing from getting yourself to be a good writer, musician, producer and arranger.\"\nFree from the band, he began to work on his solo album Blackheart Man, which included classic songs like Dreamland and Fighting Against Conviction, which was inspired by his stint in prison.\nHe went on to release several acclaimed albums, including 1981's Rock 'n' Groove and 1980s's Bunny Wailer Sings The Wailers, which saw him revisit some of the band's classic material.\nIn the 1990s, he won the Grammy award for best reggae album three times - with each of those records extending and preserving the legacy of Marley and the Wailers:  1991's Time Will Tell: A Tribute to Bob Marley, 1995's Crucial! Roots Classics, and the 1997's all-star Hall of Fame: A Tribute to Bob Marley's 50th Anniversary.\n\"I'm satisfied with knowing that I'm serving the purpose of getting reggae music to be where it's at,\" he told the Washington Post in 2006. \"I'm proud to be part of that.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Companies,Travellers",
      "text": "Pontins has agreed to change its working practices after disclosure it had a list of Irish surnames it used to screen out bookings for its holiday parks from Gypsies and Travellers.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) investigated after being contacted by a whistleblower. \nA spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said such discrimination was \"completely unacceptable\".\nPontins said it had agreed with EHRC change in its working practices.\nNews of the investigation was first reported by the i news website. \nThe EHRC said Pontins had an \"undesirable guests\" list on its intranet of mainly common Irish names to identify people it did not want at its parks. \nAccording to the i, there were 40 names on the list, including Boyle, Keefe, Gallagher, O'Donnell, McGuiness, Murphy, and O'Reilly.\nIt said staff monitored calls and refused or cancelled bookings made by certain people with an Irish accent or surname, and Pontins' commercial vehicle policy excluded Gypsies and Travellers from its holiday parks.\nBy declining to provide its services to guests of a certain race or ethnic group, Pontins was \"directly discriminating on the basis of race\" and breached the 2010 Equality Act, the EHRC said.\nPontins, which is owned by Britannia Jinky Jersey, has six holiday parks across England and Wales.\nThe EHRC declined to say how long Pontins had the policy in place, but according to the i, the list was used for at least six years.\nAlastair Pringle, executive director at EHRC, said: \"It is hard not to draw comparisons with an 'undesirable guests' list and the signs displayed in hotel windows fifty years ago, explicitly barring Irish people and Black people.\n\"Banning people from services based on their race is discrimination and is unlawful. To say that such policies are outdated is an understatement.\"\n\"It is right to challenge such practices and any business that believes this is acceptable should think again before they find themselves facing legal action.\"\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it is: \"Completely unacceptable to discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity. It is right EHRC and Pontins have investigated this.\" \nThe Traveller Movement, a charity that promotes inclusion for Gypsies, Roma and Travellers, said the Pontins policy was \"truly shocking\" but that it was \"not surprised\".\n\"We frequently hear of Gypsies and Travellers being turned away from holiday parks because of their ethnicity,\" said its chief executive Yvonne MacNamara.\n\"This happens across the country on a regular basis; it is unlawful and completely unacceptable.\"\nThe charity hopes the agreement between the Pontins owner and EHRC leads to better practices, \"and we also hope other holiday providers will think twice about enacting similar policies,\" Ms MacNamara added.\nSarah Mann, director at charity Friends, Families and Travellers, said it was \"shameful\" for Pontins to have acted in this way.\n\"Our thanks go to the Pontin's whistle-blower for doing the right thing and to the Equality and Human Rights Commission for using their powers.\n\"We all have a choice when we see discrimination - to stand by or to challenge it. Nobody should be treated differently because of their ethnicity.\"\nResearch by the charity suggested that nearly half of adults in the UK express negative attitudes toward Gypsies, Roma and Traveller people with hate crime being the most common issue reported to the police.\nThe Pontins owner said it would \"enhance staff training and procedures\" at the firm, and would take measures \"to promote equality throughout its business\".\nAs part of the agreement, Pontins must investigate the \"undesirable guests\" list, take appropriate action and ensure lessons are learned.\nIt must commission a review into its booking and commercial vehicle policy and consider any recommendations, and provide equality and diversity training for staff each year.\nThe EHRC started a probe in February 2020 after complaints from the whistleblower and Travellers. Its Pontins agreement is binding from 22 February 2021.\nIn 2017 EHRC said that Gypsies and Travellers were \"one of the most deprived groups in the Britain\" in terms of health and education.\nIt said in some areas of the UK \"local authorities have pioneered ways of meeting the needs of these nomadic groups to preserve their traditional lifestyle, while accessing health and education services and maintaining good relations with other communities.\"\nHowever, in other areas of the UK \"Gypsies and Travellers continue to be the focus of social tension with accommodation issues at the core. People living near unauthorised sites often object to developments without planning permission or where the environment is being damaged.\""

      "text": "Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been cleared of breaking rules during an investigation into her predecessor, Alex Salmond, but she's been criticised in a separate report by MSPs.\nAn independent report found that Ms Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code during the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints against Mr Salmond. \nHowever, a separate inquiry by MSPs has described the government's actions as \"deeply flawed\", and questioned some of Ms Sturgeon's evidence. \nThe pair dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade. They led the campaign for Scotland to become independent from the UK. \nAlex Salmond was Scotland's first minister and Scottish National Party leader before Ms Sturgeon, who had been his deputy. She took over after the 2014 independence referendum, which saw Scotland back remaining in the UK by 55% to 45%. \nThe row began when allegations of sexual harassment - strongly denied - were made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants in 2018.\nThe complaints were made after Ms Sturgeon asked for new government policies on sexual harassment to be put in place in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Mr Salmond believed the policy was aimed at him.  \nThe Scottish government eventually admitted it had acted unlawfully. It had to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000.\nMr Salmond has accused officials close to Ms Sturgeon - including her husband Peter Murrell, the SNP's chief executive - of plotting against him. They all deny these claims.\nThen, in January 2019, Mr Salmond was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, including attempted rape.\nMr Salmond was cleared of all 13 charges - which were alleged to have happened while he was first minister - after a trial last March. \nThe nine women who made the allegations included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. \nIn court, Mr Salmond said the claims made about his alleged conduct were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\", or \"exaggerations\".\nAfter being acquitted, he said there was \"certain information\" he had been unable to talk about during the trial, but which would \"see the light of day\" in the future. \nHe has since claimed there was a \"deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort\" from some in the Scottish government and leading SNP figures to damage him and even have him sent to prison.\nMs Sturgeon has accused him of peddling false conspiracy theories and suggested her predecessor is angry because she \"did not collude with him\" to make the sexual harassment allegations \"go away\". \nFollowing the trial, two separate inquiries began. One was by a committee of MSPs and the other by James Hamilton, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions.\nMr Hamilton's inquiry looked at whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. It examined whether she had interfered with the civil service investigation into the allegations against Mr Salmond, or misled parliament about what she knew and when.\nThis report cleared Ms Sturgeon of breaching the ministerial code, but said it was up to parliament to decide whether she had misled them.\nSeparately, the committee of MSPs examined the Scottish government's handling of the initial complaints against Mr Salmond. \nIts report said the Scottish government's actions had been \"seriously flawed\". \nMSPs on the committee voted by five to four that Ms Sturgeon misled their inquiry during her marathon evidence session earlier this month. \nThe committee also said the female civil servants who had made the complaints against Mr Salmond had been badly let down by the government.\nThe row has divided the SNP ahead of the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May, with some prominent MPs and many grassroots activists openly backing Mr Salmond. \nSome opinion polls have suggested that the fallout could threaten the SNP's hopes of winning an overall majority in the election - although it remains on course to once again finish as the largest party.\nPanorama on Salmond v Sturgeon is available on BBC iplayer."

      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,Economic growth,UK economy,Budget 2021,UK national debt",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that a spending spree to support workers and spur investment will be followed by tax rises as the economy recovers.\nThe UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccine rollout is expected to help the economy get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected.\nOfficial forecasts expect growth to hit 4% this year, while an extension of the furlough scheme will limit job losses.\nMr Sunak said future tax hikes were needed to stop \"irresponsible\" debt.\nThe government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said the UK had been at the \"vanguard\" of the discovery of new and effective vaccines.\nIt said this will foster a \"swifter and more sustained\" economic recovery, with the pace of growth expected to strengthen to 7.3% in 2022.\nThis would be the highest growth rate since official records began in 1949 and help the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size in the middle of next year.\nMr Sunak unveiled plans to spend tens of billions of pounds more over the next two years to support the economic recovery, including tax breaks designed to encourage business investment. \nHowever, the chancellor said tax rises were also needed to help repair the public finances.\nMr Sunak announced that corporation tax will rise from 19% to 25% for large companies in 2023, while day-to-day spending by government departments will be cut by a further \u00a34bn a year.\nMr Sunak said it would be \"irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked\".\nChris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, described the Budget as \"three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain\".\nMr Sanger added: \"Time [is] the Chancellor's friend in his aim of replenishing the Government's coffers.\" \nThe government's target to have all adults vaccinated this summer is expected to pave the way for the lifting of public health restrictions.\nThe OBR noted that British households had built up a savings war chest of around \u00a3180bn in the past year.\nIt expects a quarter of this to be spent as lockdowns end, saying there could be a \"degree of euphoria\", especially among better-off households who \"treat themselves\" when the economy opens up.\nThe main thrust of this Budget is significant extra immediate crisis support, both in terms of the furlough scheme and self employed support, and a radical \"super-deduction\" policy to encourage business investment right now.. That is \u00a360bn extra in one year and it comes from borrowed money. That leaves borrowing in the coming financial year significantly higher than expected. A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year.\nThe happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer.\nThe jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in \u00a316bn corporation tax and the \u00a38bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here. \nSo Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of \"Singapore-on-Thames\". Singapore is staying in South East Asia.\nThe timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal. \nHowever, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained \"considerable\", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was \"betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz\".\nHe added: \"The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax.\"\nUnemployment is expected to peak at a lower rate of 6.5%, keeping it well below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis.\nHowever, this means half a million more people are expected to be out of work by the end of this year.\nGovernment borrowing is expected to rise to a peacetime high of \u00a3354.6bn this year to help pay for economic support measures.\nThe size of the UK's debt pile is also expected to remain larger than the economy until at least the middle of the decade.\nMr Sunak said: \"It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover.\"\nFrom April, he will also freeze the amount of money employees earn before paying income tax at \u00a312,570 until the middle of the decade.\nThe OBR estimates an extra 1.3 million people will start to pay income tax by 2026 as a result of the freeze.\nThe level at which employees start paying the higher, 40% rate of tax will also be frozen at \u00a350,270 from April, dragging an extra million people into the band within five years."

      "tags": "Money,Personal finance,Universal Credit,Housing Benefit,Benefits,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Universal credit will rise for some people under plans announced by the chancellor in his Budget.\nRishi Sunak has reduced the \"taper rate\" - this affects the amount of money lost by working claimants if they earn more money.\nUniversal credit is a single benefit payment for working-age people, which was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people, and make the system simpler. \nIt's claimed by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, both in and out of work - 40% of universal credit claimants are workers.\nClaimants received an extra \u00a320 per week during the pandemic, but this ended at the beginning of this month.\nMost universal credit claimants lose some of their benefits if they earn more money.\nThe rate at which they lose the benefits is known as the taper rate.\nAt the moment the taper rate is 63%, which means that if you earn an extra pound you lose 63p in benefits.\nWorkers with responsibility for children or disabilities that limit their ability to work are allowed to earn a certain amount before they start losing their universal credit, which is called a work allowance. \nThe work allowance means such people can earn up to \u00a3515 a month without losing benefits. Claimants who receive help with housing costs have a lower work allowance. \nThe chancellor has announced that in the coming weeks the taper rate will be reduced to 55p, which would mean that workers would take home 8p more of an extra pound earned.\nAlso, the work allowances for eligible claimants will go up by \u00a3500 a year.\nFor some workers that will make up for the loss of the \u00a320 a week uplift to universal credit.\nEmployees claiming universal credit who earn enough to pay National Insurance (\u00a39,564 a year) will also see the amount of tax they have to pay increase next April. That will affect somebody working more than about 20 hours a week on the minimum wage.\nTake as an example somebody without children, working 10 hours a week on the National Living Wage - which is going up to \u00a39.50 an hour in April.\nThey would earn \u00a395 a week, which means - at the current 63% taper rate - they lose \u00a359.85 of their universal credit. If the taper rate were cut to 55% they would get to take home an extra \u00a37.60 a week.\nHowever, most universal credit claimants are not working, so they would not receive any extra money.\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) says that 1.4 million households still claim working tax credit and have not moved to universal credit, so they also would not benefit.\nThe cut to universal credit was opposed by many charities, opposition parties, and also some Conservative MPs.\nWriting on Twitter, Resolution chief executive Torsten Bell said that removing the boost would mean \"4.4 million households, with 5.1m adults and 3.5m children, will see their incomes fall by \u00a31,000 overnight. \nThe charity Citizens Advice warned that a third of people on universal credit would end up in debt when the extra payment is removed.\nIt said the average shortfall would be between \u00a351 and \u00a355 a month.\nThe government has defended its decision, saying the \u00a320 uplift was always meant to be temporary and that people getting back into work is the best way to tackle poverty.\nIt is complicated to work out exactly how much universal credit you might receive. Some people, such as those with \u00a316,000 or more in savings, are not eligible.\nOthers may find what they receive depends on their circumstances, including any income their family has, as well as housing and childcare costs.\nIt usually takes five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible.\nAn application for universal credit may put a stop to any tax credits you receive, even if it proves to be unsuccessful.\nYou may be able to claim a reduction in council tax when on universal credit, and get help with childcare costs. There is also support to pay the rent, which works in different ways across the UK. \nIn time, there may also be assistance in paying the mortgage, although there are some strict criteria involved.\nThe main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work is new-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA).\nThis is worth \u00a359.20 a week, if you are under 25, or \u00a374.70 a week if you are 25 or over.\nYou can get this for up to six months and it will be paid into your bank, building society, or credit union account every two weeks. Unlike universal credit, your partner's or spouse's income will not affect your claim.\nYou may be able to claim new-style JSA as well as universal credit.\nUniversal credit may not be appropriate or available for everyone. Claiming it can affect other benefits, and it is vital to get some advice - available for free - before applying.\nPlaces offering guidance on this and other benefits questions include:\nHow will you be affected by this?

      "tags": "Xinjiang,Human rights,China,Uighurs",
      "text": "China's policy of transferring hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang to new jobs often far from home is leading to a thinning out of their populations, according to a high-level Chinese study seen by the BBC.\nThe government denies that it is attempting to alter the demographics of its far-western region and says the job transfers are designed to raise incomes and alleviate chronic rural unemployment and poverty.\nBut our evidence suggests that - alongside the re-education camps built across Xinjiang in recent years - the policy involves a high risk of coercion and is similarly designed to assimilate minorities by changing their lifestyles and thinking.\nThe study, which was meant for the eyes of senior officials but accidentally placed online, forms part of a BBC investigation based on propaganda reports, interviews, and visits to factories across China.\nAnd we ask questions about the possible connections between transferred Uighur labour and two major western brands, as international concern mounts over the extent to which it is already ingrained in global supply chains.\nIn a village in southern Xinjiang, hay is being gathered in the fields and families are placing fruit and flatbreads on their supas, the low platforms around which Uighur family life has traditionally revolved.\nBut the warm wind blowing across the Taklamakan desert is bringing with it worry and change.\nThe video report, broadcast by China's Communist Party-run news channel, shows a group of officials in the centre of the village, sitting under a red banner advertising jobs in Anhui Province, 4,000km away.\nAfter two full days, the reporter's narration says, not a single person from the village has come forward to sign up, and so the officials begin moving from house to house.\nWhat follows is some of the most compelling footage of China's massive campaign to transfer Uighurs, Kazakhs and other minorities in Xinjiang into factory and manual labouring jobs, often considerable distances from their homes.\nAlthough it was broadcast in 2017, around the time the policy began to be intensified, the video has not featured in international news reporting until now.\nThe officials speak to one father who is clearly reluctant to send his daughter, Buzaynap, so far away. \n\"There must be someone else who'd like to go,\" he tries to plead. \"We can make our living here, let us live a life like this.\"\nThey speak directly to 19-year old Buzaynap, telling her that, if she stays she will be married soon and never able to leave.\n\"Have a think, will you go?\" they ask.\nUnder the intense scrutiny of the government officials and state-TV journalists she shakes her head and replies, \"I won't go.\"\nStill, the pressure continues until eventually, weeping, she concedes.\n\"I'll go if others go,\" she says.\nThe film ends with tearful goodbyes between mothers and daughters as Buzaynap and other similarly \"mobilised\" recruits leave their family and culture behind.\nProfessor Laura Murphy is an expert in human rights and contemporary slavery at the UK's Sheffield Hallam University who lived in Xinjiang between 2004 and 2005 and has visited since.\n\"This video is remarkable,\" she told the BBC. \n\"The Chinese government continually says that people are volunteering to engage in these programmes, but this absolutely reveals that this is a system of coercion that people are not allowed to resist.\"\n\"The other thing it shows is this ulterior motive,\" she said, \"that although the narrative is one of lifting people out of poverty, there's a drive to entirely change people's lives, to separate families, disperse the population, change their language, their culture, their family structures, which is more likely to increase poverty than to decrease it.\"\nA marked shift in China's approach to its governance of Xinjiang can be traced back to two brutal attacks on pedestrians and commuters - in Beijing in 2013 and the city of Kunming in 2014 - which it blamed on Uighur Islamists and separatists.\nAt the heart of its response - in both the camps and the work transfer schemes - has been a drive to replace \"old\" Uighur loyalties to culture and the Islamic faith with a \"modern\" materialist identity and an enforced allegiance to the Communist Party.\nThis overarching goal of assimilating Uighurs into China's majority Han culture is made clear by an in-depth Chinese study of Xinjiang's job-transfer scheme, circulated to senior Chinese officials and seen by the BBC.\nBased on field work conducted in Xinjiang's Hotan Prefecture in May 2018, the report was inadvertently made publicly available online in December 2019 and then subsequently taken down a few months later.\nWritten by a group of academics from Nankai University in the Chinese city of Tianjin, it concludes that the mass labour transfers are \"an important method to influence, meld and assimilate Uighur minorities\" and bring about a \"transformation of their thinking.\"\nUprooting them and relocating them elsewhere in the region or in other Chinese provinces, it says, \"reduces Uighur population density.\"\nThe report was discovered online by an overseas-based Uighur who passed it to Dr Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington.\nBefore the university realized its error, Dr Zenz saved the report (in Chinese) on a web-archive site and has now written his own analysis of it, which includes an English translation of the full document.\n\"This is an unprecedented, authoritative source written by leading academics and former government officials with high-level access to Xinjiang itself,\" Dr Zenz told the BBC.\n\"The excess surplus population that somehow has to be dealt with, and labour transfers as a means to reduce the concentration of those workers in their own heartlands is, in my opinion, the most stunning admission of this report.\"\nHis analysis includes a legal opinion from Erin Farrell Rosenberg, a former senior advisor to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, that the Nankai Report provides \"credible grounds\" for the crimes against humanity of forcible transfer and persecution.\nIn a written statement, the Chinese foreign ministry said, \"The report reflects only the author's personal view and much of its contents are not in line with the facts.\"\n\"We hope that journalists will use the authoritative information released by the Chinese government as the basis for reporting on Xinjiang.\"\nThe Nankai report authors write glowingly of an effort to combat poverty underwritten by a \"guarantee of voluntariness\" in the work placements, and with the factories allowing the workers to \"leave and return freely.\"\nBut those claims are somewhat at odds with the level of detail they provide about the way the policy works in practice.\nThere are \"targets\" to be reached, with Hotan Prefecture alone - at the time the study was undertaken - having already exported 250,000 workers, one fifth of its total working age population.\nThere is pressure to meet the targets, with recruiting stations set up \"in every village\" and officials tasked to \"mobilize collectively\" and \"visit households,\" just as in 19-year-old Buzaynap's case.\nAnd there are signs of control at every stage, with all recruits put through \"political thought education,\" then transported to the factories in groups - sometimes as many as hundreds at a time - and \"led and accompanied by political cadres in order to implement security and management.\"\nFarmers unwilling to leave their lands or herds behind are encouraged to transfer them to a centralized government scheme that manages them in their absence.\nAnd once they arrive in their new factory jobs, workers themselves are put under the \"centralized management\" of officials who \"eat and live\" with them.\nBut the report also notes that the profound discrimination at the heart of the system is getting in the way of its effective functioning, with local police forces in eastern China so alarmed by the arrival of trainloads of Uighurs, that they are sometimes turned back.\nIn places, it even warns that China's policies in Xinjiang may have been too extreme, for example, stating that the number of people placed in the re-education camps \"far exceeds\" those with suspected connections to extremism.\n\"The entire Uighur population should not be assumed to be rioters,\" it says.\nThe Huafu Textile Company is located on the edge of a grey industrial estate in the city of Huaibei, in China's eastern province of Anhui.\nIt was to this factory that Buzaynap, featured in the state-TV report, was sent.\nWhen the BBC visited, the separate, five-story Uighur dormitory showed few signs of habitation apart from a pair of shoes placed by an open window.\nAt the gate, the security guard said that the Uighur workers \"have gone back home,\" adding that it was because of the country's Covid controls, and in a statement Huafu told us that, \"the company does not currently employ Xinjiang workers.\"\nThe BBC was able to find pillowcases made with Huafu yarn on sale on Amazon's UK website, although it is not possible to confirm if the product is linked to the particular factory we visited, or one of the company's other facilities.\nAmazon told the BBC that it does not tolerate the use of forced labour and that where it finds products that do not meet its supply chain standards, it removes them from sale.\nThe BBC worked with a group of international journalists based in China, visiting a total of six factories between us.\nAt the Dongguan Luzhou Shoes factory in Guangdong Province, one worker said the Uighur employees used separate dormitories and their own canteen, and another local told reporters that the company makes shoes for Skechers.\nThe factory has previously been linked to the US company, with unverified social media videos purportedly showing Uighur workers making Skechers product lines, and references to a relationship in online Chinese business directories.\nIn a statement, Skechers said it had \"zero tolerance for forced labour,\" but did not answer questions about whether it used Dongguan Luzhou as a supplier.\nDongguan Luzhou did not respond to a request for comment.\nInterviews recorded at the scene suggest the Uighur workers were free to leave the factory during their leisure time, but at other factories visited for the research, the evidence was more mixed.\nIn at least two cases, reporters were told of some restrictions, and at one facility in the city of Wuhan a Han Chinese employee told the BBC that his 200 or so Uighur colleagues were not allowed out at all.\nThree months after Buzaynap was shown leaving her village to begin her political education training, the Chinese state-TV crew meet her again, this time in the Huafu Textile Company in Anhui.\nThe theme of assimilation is, once again, central to the news report.\nIn one scene, Buzaynap is close to tears as she is scolded for her mistakes, but eventually, a transformation is said to be taking place.\n\"The timid girl who didn't speak and kept her head down,\" we are told, \"is gaining authority at work.\"\n\"Lifestyles are changing and thoughts are changing.\"\nProducer: Kathy Long"

Three voted \"remain\".\nIn a way that's not very surprising - Labour seats and \"remain\" areas are concentrated in cities - but it's still pretty striking.\nThe plans that the Norfolk seaside town of Great Yarmouth has for its \u00a320m include job creation, supporting new homes and \"to tap into and grow a thriving arts and cultural scene\". \nChairman of the town deal board, Henry Cator, said the \"ambition [was] to realise a vibrant and inclusive coastal economy\".\nMeanwhile, Lincolnshire has five towns, as well as Lincoln, in the list to receive funding.\nJo Walker, assistant director for growth at City of Lincoln Council, said the \u00a319m it was due to receive would \"help make a significant difference in the city as we come out of lockdown and begin our recovery from the pandemic\".\nBut Mr Reynolds, the Labour MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, used the example of Greater Manchester and called decisions for where funds would go \"inexplicable\".\nHe said: \"A government serious about levelling up would look at things like council funding. It would look at the funding of the health service to address health inequalities in post-industrial areas.\n\"Instead what we seem to get are these pots from the chancellor dependent on giving money to backbench Conservative MPs, and I find that so frustrating and a misuse of public money.\"\nChallenged on the allocations at a Downing Street news briefing, Mr Sunak said that \"if you looked at all the things\" the government was doing it was \"benefitting people in every corner of the country\".\nNorth East: Middlesbrough; Thornaby-On-Tees - \u00a346m\nNorth West: Preston; Workington; Bolton; Cheadle; Carlisle; Leyland; Southport; Rochdale - \u00a3211m\nYorkshire and the Humber: Wakefield; Whitby; Scarborough; Grimsby; Castleford; Goldthorpe; Scunthorpe; Morley; Stocksbridge - \u00a3199m\nEast Midlands: Newark; Clay Cross; Skegness; Mablethorpe; Boston; Lincoln; Northampton; Staveley; Mansfield - \u00a3175m\nWest Midlands: Wolverhampton; Kidsgrove; Rowley Regis; Smethwick; West Bromwich; Burton-upon-Trent; Nuneaton - \u00a3155m\nEast of England: Lowestoft; Colchester; Stevenage; Great Yarmouth; Ipswich; Milton Keynes - \u00a3148m\nSouth East: Crawley; Margate - \u00a343m\nSouth West: Swindon; Bournemouth - \u00a341m"

      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021",
      "text": "The never knowingly under-hyped Rishi Sunak will give what he has already described as a \"Budget like no other\".\nThe Covid crisis has certainly led him to do things that no other Conservative chancellor has.\nThe government shut down much of the economy, meaning shops were shuttered, tills were empty, incomes collapsed.\nIt filled much of the gap with an alphabet soup of what the Treasury would drily term \"interventions\" - CBILS, CJRS, SEISS, the CCFF, and so on - essentially different ways of filling people's pockets with enormous amounts of cash in a time of crisis.\nAlongside that there have been the huge costs of PPE, the test-and-trace programme and vaccines. \nSome people, some of the self-employed for example, have not been caught by the safety net stitched together at high speed.\nBut there is no doubt that it has made a huge difference in the last year. One senior minister, perhaps not that modestly, suggests: \"One day we will be through this, and we will look back and realise that we prevented mass unemployment.\"\nThere was a feeling at the start of the pandemic that there was no choice. And, with the country still in lockdown, that logic persists.\nSo, however the chancellor presents his decisions on Wednesday, extending emergency support is a political no-brainer, over which he has simply had not much choice.\nAnd this time, perhaps, he has to get out ahead of the argument, rather than risk being dragged there as schemes get close to their end dates.\nMr Sunak's warm-up slogan is \"We're using the full measure of our fiscal firepower to protect the jobs and livelihoods of the British people\".\nThe Budget won't just be about carrying on the emergency support, however, with a hefty dollop of Brand Sunak, with a TV press conference and sofa chat on Wednesday evening, on top of the traditional red box doorstep and green bench moments.\nIt will also be about how he hopes to return the Tories to their more traditional trademark - being careful with the country's cash.\nThere won't be a return to the kind of political argument over the deficit and the debate that David Cameron and George Osborne dominated in the early part of the last decade.\nAs one Treasury minister said: \"Austerity? You just can't do it now.\" That's partly because the Tories made lots of pricey commitments in their election manifesto, and partly because Boris Johnson is, for a Conservative, a spender not a saver (even hypothetical bridges don't come cheap).\nBut the economic conversation is different this time. Interest rates are rock-bottom. Much of the debt the government has run up has been bought by the Bank of England. \nAnd governments around the world have been spending and borrowing eye-watering amounts to get through this emergency. There's a really good explanation of how it all works here.\nIn short, there isn't unbearable pressure on the chancellor to start saying how, and when, he'll start trying to close the gap between what the government's been spending, and what it takes into its coffers.\nAnd no-one, not even the self-described hawk former Chancellor Lord Hammond, thinks that the overall debt will be paid off for decades.\nBut, conscious of the Tory trademark, Mr Sunak will start talking about how to start balancing the books too.\nThere has been a lot of speculation (it's the Budget) about raising taxes, and in particular corporation tax - the tax firms pay on their profits.\nThat's notable because it would be a reversal of one of his predecessor Mr Osborne's flagship policies. \nBut also he would face a lot of opposition in his party, and outside, not just on the principle of raising taxes on business from Conservatives, but for doing so during what is still a huge economic emergency.\nOne prominent economist even told me it was \"economically bonkers\" to consider raising taxes now, in the hope of then cutting them in a couple of years.\nIt is indeed, despite public protestations that he hasn't said this to his MPs, at least part of the Treasury's calculation that it would be better to increase taxes soon, to ensure that 2024's is a tax-cutting, pre-election Budget.\nOne Treasury minister suggests that raising taxes, while also looking like you are concerned with balancing the books in the long term, neutralises Labour: \"If we take all the New Labour clothes, where do they go?\"\nLabour's angst over what to tax and when in the last few days bears some of that out.\nBut, as with any Budget, the calculations are not just for the carefully choreographed \"grid\" of announcements and speculation in the run-up to the moment itself, not even for the speech itself and the spreadsheets that get pored over in the hours after, but for setting a path, political and economic, for months - and years - to come.

      "tags": "Money,Tax,Personal finance,Housing market,Personal debt,UK taxes,Rishi Sunak,Budget 2021",
      "text": "With lives and livelihoods still at risk, Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget is focused on short-term support for people's jobs and finances.\nBut there are signs of what will happen next and how this will affect the money in your pocket.\nAlthough it was announced in advance, like many other key measures, the extension of furlough is significant for millions of people.\nThe scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic -\u00a0has been extended until September.\nYoung and lower-paid people have been among the most likely to have been furloughed during the pandemic.\nWhile this is designed to protect their jobs from redundancy, many will have found that their income has been a fifth less than they had anticipated over the course of 18 months.\nThe National Living Wage will rise to \u00a38.91 from April, from \u00a38.72. That is a 2.2% rise and will be for people aged 23 and over.\nMoney promised for the vaccine rollout does not directly affect the amount of money that goes into the pockets of individuals.\nBut the extra \u00a31.65bn to help vaccinate every adult by the end of July should mean people can get back to work and the economy can start to recover. \nQuicker jabs mean more jobs protected, which means that incomes can recover or be maintained.\nFurlough supports employed people. The equivalent for the self-employed comes in the form of grants through the Coronavirus Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS).\nFrom next month, claims can be made for a fourth grant worth 80% of three months' average trading profits, up to \u00a37,500 in total.\nThis will then be followed by a fifth grant later in the year, covering May to September.\nHowever, the amount paid will depend on the amount of turnover lost. People whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will receive a grant that is equivalent to 30% of average trading profits.\nWhile many self-employed people remain ineligible - the source of considerable debate - those who can show they were trading in 2019-20 from their tax returns will now be eligible for the first time. They can receive the fourth and fifth grants.\nAnother source of speculation for months has been the future for a \u00a320-a-week top-up to universal credit.\nThis has been described as a financial lifeline during the pandemic for many of those who have lost jobs or whose finances were already stretched.\nThe chancellor said this would continue for another six months, but would then be withdrawn. \nThose on working tax credits will receive a one-off \u00a3500 payment.\nThe government pledged in its manifesto not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT.\nAlthough income tax is not rising, the tax bill that people may face in future years could go up.\nAt present, people start paying 20% income tax when they earn \u00a312,500 a year. The starting point for paying the higher 40% rate is \u00a350,000.\nThese thresholds will go up to \u00a312,570 and \u00a350,270 in April, but will then be frozen for five years.\nWith these thresholds maintained at the same level until April 2026, many people receiving a pay rise may find themselves in a new tax bracket and having to pay more. \nThe government's official forecaster said this would mean 1.3 million more people paying income tax and one million more paying the higher rate of tax.\nThat will raise a significant amount of money for the Treasury, estimated to be an extra \u00a38bn a year by 2025-26, compared to what would have been the case if thresholds rose in line with the cost of living. \nScotland has some tax-raising powers of its own.\nThe chancellor confirmed that a government guarantee means first-time buyers should get a wider choice of mortgages that require a deposit of just 5% of the loan.\nThis will be available when buying properties worth up to \u00a3600,000.\nHowever, some potential homeowners may still find it hard to get a mortgage if they do not have a regular income, while getting into negative equity if house prices fall is a threat.\nThe new products will be available from next month.\nHowever, while there is support for homeownership, there are no specific policies to help those behind on their rents.\nThis tax break for homebuyers in England and Northern Ireland - as well as similar relief in Scotland and Wales - was due to finish at the end of March. This created a rush, as well as difficulties for some buyers to complete in time.\nThe chancellor has now said that the current stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland - which means no stamp duty is paid on the first \u00a3500,000 of a property purchase - will be extended until 30 June.\nThis relief will be reduced to the first \u00a3250,000 of a purchase until the end of September, before returning to its pre-pandemic level of \u00a3125,000 from the start of October.\nIn total, 46% of sales would be exempt from stamp duty as a result of this policy, according to property portal Zoopla.\nMinisters in Wales have extended its stamp duty break until the end of June.\nAll duties on alcohol will stay as they are, for a second year in a row. These had been earmarked to rise.\nThere has been a freeze on fuel duty for a decade and this will continue for at least another year.\nAbout 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT.\nThere will be a new savings product designed to raise money for environmental projects.\nThis \"green bond\" will be issued by the government-backed National Savings and Investments (NS&I), which has been criticised by savers and MPs for its customer service performance during the pandemic.\nIt will be issued in the summer, but there are no details yet on the interest rate that will be paid to savers.\nWhat is your reaction to this year's Budget?

      "text": "Scientists say they have found that three deepwater shark species living off New Zealand glow in the dark.\nThe species were collected from the Chatham Rise - an area of ocean floor to the east of New Zealand - in January of last year, according to the study.\nOne of them, the kitefin shark, is now the largest known luminous vertebrate and can reach up to 180cm (5ft 11in).\nBioluminescence was also confirmed in the blackbelly lanternshark and southern lanternshark.\nThe three species were already known to marine biologists but this is the first time that the phenomenon of bioluminescence - organisms emitting light - has been identified in them.\nWhile many marine animals - as well as some insects such as fireflies - produce their own light, this is the first time it has been found in larger sharks.\nThe researchers suggest the sharks' glowing underbellies may help them hide from predators or other threats beneath them.\nThey say the bioluminescence is achieved through thousands of photophores (light-producing cells) located within the sharks' skin.\nThe three studied species inhabit a space called the mesopelagic zone, often called the twilight zone, which ranges from 200m  to 1,000m depth (the maximum depth reached by sunlight).\nThe species in question face an environment with no place to hide, hence the need for counterillumination as a form of camouflage,  the researchers add.\nIn the study, the scientists from the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain in Belgium and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand explain the importance of bioluminescence for marine creatures: \nIt \"has often been seen as a spectacular yet uncommon event at sea, but considering the vastness of the deep sea and the occurrence of luminous organisms in this zone, it is now more and more obvious that producing light at depth must play an important role structuring the biggest ecosystem on our planet\"."

      "tags": "BBC Three,Television",
      "text": "BBC Three will return as a fully-fledged TV channel in January 2022, six years after it moved online.\nThe channel has since been responsible for major hits including Fleabag, Normal People and Killing Eve - prompting calls for its resurrection.\nLast year, BBC research concluded there was a \"strong case\" for it to come back as a regular TV channel, focusing on younger audiences.\nMP Julian Knight said the move showed the BBC had \"failed\" those viewers.\n\"I question whether putting the clock back five years is the right way to win over 18-35s,\" said Mr Knight, who chairs the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS).\n\"The BBC needs to back success and make sure its programmes reach as many young people as possible wherever they live in the UK,\" said the BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore.  \n\"So regardless of the debates about the past, we want to give BBC Three its own broadcast channel again.\"\nAs announced in the BBC's Annual Plan last year, the channel's budget will also be doubled over the next two years - a decision that was also criticised by Mr Knight, who accused the BBC of putting extra investment into programmes while \"those over 75 are being chased to pay up for their TV licences\".\nThe BBC ended the provision of free TV licences for most over-75s last year, after the government decided to stop paying for the benefit.\nWhen it returns, BBC Three will be targeted at audiences aged 16-34, broadcasting from 19:00 to 04:00 each day.\nAs a result, CBBC's broadcast hours will revert to closing at 19:00 - as was the case before 2016. It currently runs until 21:00.\nThe move will still need approval from media regulator Ofcom before it can go ahead.\nSeven years ago the BBC announced that BBC Three would become digital only. The main reason given was the need to save money. The public narrative was: Young audiences congregate online rather than watch linear TV, so there's no point providing a linear service.\nSince then, three things have happened. The flight of young audiences to digital platforms, and away from scheduled TV, has accelerated. BBC Three has produced a big range of huge, global hits. And the pressure on the BBC, not least from Ofcom, to prove that it still appeals to young people has grown sharply.\nThis last point is critical. The BBC commissioned research showing that there is still a market of young people - albeit smaller than years ago - on linear platforms. Given the success of the shows commissioned by BBC Three, the feeling at the top of the organisation was that putting them back on a linear platform would create upside in terms of audience numbers, for relatively low cost.\nDespite the need for more savings today, that cost can be justified because when the BBC negotiates with the government over the future of the licence fee, it needs the strongest possible argument on its relevance and universal appeal.\nBBC Three was originally taken off air in March 2016. The corporation said the move would save \u00a330m a year, helping it to reduce its spending after cuts imposed by the government in 2010.\nMuch of the budget was reallocated to fund drama on BBC One, while BBC Three was expected to target younger audiences online.\nBut the plans caused controversy, prompting the Save BBC Three campaign which saw more than 300,000 people sign a petition to keep it on air.\nJournalist and founder of the campaign Jono Read said the channel's return was \"great news\".\n\"It became clear that the decision to to take it off air was a counter-productive move that bosses had taken to sacrifice the station under the guise of budget cuts, and one that was deeply unpopular with its audience.\n\"Nonetheless the online move has shown real potential for BBC Three and I think it will thrive when it is once again given the chance to combine traditional and new media when it returns to TV in 2022\", he says. \nMany of BBC Three's commissions have ended up on linear TV, with shows like Killing Eve and Fleabag attracting huge audiences on BBC One.\nNormal People, about the tangled love lives of two Irish teenagers, also became the breakout hit of the first lockdown. It was requested on the BBC iPlayer 62.7 million times last year, more than any other programme.\nOther hit shows on the channel include Man Like Mobeen, This Country, Ru Paul's Drag Race UK and the Jesy Nelson documentary Odd One Out.\nIn its online incarnation, BBC Three has won a raft of awards, including RTS Channel of the Year in 2017 and Digital Channel of the Year 2019 at the Edinburgh TV Festival. It is currently Broadcast Digital Channel of the Year.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "text": "The limit on a single payment using contactless card technology will rise to \u00a3100 later this year, the Treasury has confirmed.\nThe pandemic has accelerated a move away from cash, with shoppers often being encouraged to use contactless in many stores for public health reasons.\nIt has been less than a year since the limit was raised from \u00a330 to \u00a345.\nRegulators say businesses could still decide themselves whether to accept the higher limit.\nFears have also been raised regarding fraud risks involved in the use of cards.\nThe use of contactless technology by consumers has risen sharply in recent years, with more services adopting the technology and most shops offering it as an option.\nTo protect workers and consumers during the Covid outbreak, an increase to the current limit of \u00a345 was rushed through by the regulator in April last year.\nThe latest figures show that the proportion of contactless payments had fallen slightly compared with pre-pandemic levels, because lockdown measures hit the use of pubs, restaurants and public transport. They accounted for 41% of card transactions.\nHowever, there was a 16% increase in the total value of contactless payments in the UK in October, compared with the same month a year earlier, according to the latest data from UK Finance, which represents banks.\nThe amount spent on contactless hit a monthly record in August, boosted by the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and fewer coronavirus-related restrictions. A total of \u00a38.4bn was spent on credit and debit cards using contactless during that month.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"As we begin to open the UK economy and people return to the High Street, the contactless limit increase will make it easier than ever before for people to pay for their shopping, providing a welcome boost to retail that will protect jobs and drive growth.\"\nHowever, there have been worries raised about contactless limits being raised further.\nIan Johnson, managing director, Europe, at payment business Marqeta, said: \"The problem with increasing limits on physical contactless cards is if they are stolen or cloned, it will now be even easier for a fraudster to spend large sums of the victim's money in one go. \n\"Physical cards provide very little security and a fraudster could continue to use their contactless function until they are cancelled.\""

So, that's very good news. We'll keep our fingers crossed.\"\nThe Duke of Edinburgh, who turns 100 in June, travelled by car from Windsor to King Edward VII's hospital in Marylebone, central London, on 16 February as a precaution after feeling unwell.\nThe exact reason for his initial admission has not been disclosed, but was not related to coronavirus. \nOn 1 March, Buckingham Palace announced he had been transferred to Barts by ambulance.\nThe palace said \"doctors will continue to treat him for an infection, as well as undertake testing and observation for a pre-existing heart condition\".\nThe Prince of Wales visited his father at King Edward VII's Hospital, the weekend after his admission.\nThe Queen and other members of the royal family have continued to carry out official duties while the duke has been in hospital.\nSt Bartholomew's Hospital in the City of London is an NHS hospital and home to Europe's largest specialised cardiovascular unit.\nIn 2011, Prince Philip was taken to hospital by helicopter from Sandringham after suffering chest pains as the royal family was preparing for Christmas.\nHe was treated for a blocked coronary artery at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire and had a stent fitted."

      "tags": "Unemployment,Job Retention Scheme,Housing market,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021,UK national debt,Unemployment in the UK,Stamp duty in the United Kingdom",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget will be one of the most-closely watched in years, as the government grapples with the enormous economic costs of the Covid-19 pandemic, and as he charts a financial roadmap for the country.\nIn his 3 March statement, the chancellor will outline the state of the UK economy and its outlook for the future - and give details of the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes.\nSo how is the UK economy faring under the twin impacts of coronavirus and Brexit? In the following charts, we take a snapshot of the nation's economic health - highlighting some of the economic challenges facing the chancellor.\nThe UK's national debt has reached its highest level since 1963 - reflecting the huge cost of pandemic support measures such as the furlough scheme. National debt here means the total amount the government owes to its lenders - it is the accumulation of borrowing over many years. \nSo far this year, the annual total for government borrowing - the amount the government borrows to make up for the gap between what it spends and what it raises in taxes - has reached \u00a3270.6bn, which is \u00a3222bn more than a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nThe independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates that this figure could reach \u00a3393.5bn by the end of the financial year in March. This would be the highest amount in any year since the Second World War. \nBut it is also worth pointing out that this figure has been above 100% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or annual national income in 131 of the last 320 years.\nThe 21st Century so far has been one of rising levels of public sector net borrowing (how much both central and local government have borrowed to carry out their spending programmes). Last month's figure was \u00a38.8bn, the highest January borrowing amount since monthly records began in 1993. \nAs a result of the pandemic, public sector net debt has risen by \u00a3316.4bn over the 10 months since last April to an all-time high of \u00a32.1 trillion.\nUnemployment is currently 5.1%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the highest figure for five years, and shows the effects of lockdowns on the economy due to the pandemic, with many workplaces forced to close their doors.\nSo far, this hasn't resulted in a rapid rise in unemployment, as the furlough support scheme has helped to protect jobs, but this could change if the scheme ends as planned in April. Most economists expect the unemployment rate to continue rising in 2021.\nHowever, the roll-out of Covid vaccines is happening quickly and this may help to keep unemployment down if it allows a staged re-start of the UK economy.\nYoung people have been hit particularly hard by the labour market fallout from coronavirus, with workers aged under 24 accounting for nearly half of the total fall in employment during the economic slump, according to research by the Institute for Employment Studies (IES).\nAt the same time, more people are chasing fewer jobs, so young people are struggling to enter the employment market.\nSignificantly, young people account for 46% of the overall fall in employment during the pandemic - even though they only account for just one in nine of the workforce. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has hinted that furlough support for workers will continue beyond April, as he pledged not to \"pull the rug out\" from under the UK economy when he unveiled plans to ease the national lockdown in four steps.\nIf the government does not extend the job support schemes, then the latest forecast from the Bank of England suggests that UK unemployment will reach 7.75% during the summer.\nFull-time work has risen during the pandemic, despite the impact of Covid on the labour market. However, the numbers of those in part-time jobs or self-employed have dropped, as freelancers and those in precarious work bear the brunt of the crisis.\nCampaign groups are calling on the chancellor to plug gaps in schemes such as the self-employed income support scheme (SEISS) to support millions of self-employed people and other workers excluded from furlough. The Resolution Foundation think tank says that 2.3 million workers are missing out on help because they are not covered by SEISS.\nUK house prices climbed 8.5% last year - that's the highest annual growth rate since October 2014 - with the average UK house price reaching a record high of \u00a3252,000 in December 2020.\nThe North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%.\nOne of the factors behind the rise has been the stamp duty holiday in England that was introduced last July. However, if the tax break ends on 31 March as planned, sales and house price rises are likely to slow afterwards."

      "tags": "Teaching,Schools,Wales education,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More pupils in Wales could be back in class before Easter, but there will not be a full return to school, the education minister has said.\nSchools will be able to welcome pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 for \"check-in\" sessions before they are due back fully from mid-April.\nKirsty Williams said falling Covid case rates meant pupils could return \"earlier\".\nBut teaching unions warned the return must not lead to schools closing again.\nMs Williams said while there was \"no evidence to suggest widespread transmission in schools and colleges\", for the first time official advice means pupils and teachers will have to wear face coverings in class, if they cannot stay two metres apart.\nWales' youngest pupils began returning to the classroom on 22 February for the first time since before Christmas, when schools closed to almost all pupils due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nMinisters originally hoped all primary pupils, years 11 and 13, and some college students would return from 15 March, with flexibility for year 10 and 12, to return.\nThe Welsh Government then faced backlash after hinting non-essential shops could be reopened at an earlier date.\nNow schools will be allowed to decide whether to give 11 to 14-year-olds the \"opportunity\" to see teachers face-to-face before the Easter holidays begin, in a similar way to the check-in before last year's summer holidays.\nHowever this will depend on the scientific advice at the next review of Covid rules on 12 March.\nMs Williams, said the changes for pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 had been made possible by the latest scientific advice, which showed case rates heading \"in the right direction\". \nBut, she added, caution was still needed and Wales was not in a position to have a \"big bang approach\" to schools' return. \n\"We've been very clear that should the scientists give us the all clear to have more children back in school then we would grab that opportunity,\" she said.\n\"Thankfully, because of the massive efforts of the Welsh public, we are continuing to see case rates fall here in Wales, [Covid] positivity levels fall and pressure being taken off our NHS.\"\nParents will not be fined if they choose not to send their children to school, unless there are welfare concerns, new guidance states.\nWelcoming the decision, the Welsh Conservative's Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called the decision a \"u-turn\", while Plaid Cymru's Sian Gwenllian said support for virtual learning must continue.\nThe Scottish government also changed its plans on Tuesday, to allow all secondary pupils to return to school part-time before Easter.\nAll pupils in England are due to return to school from 8 March, which is also when a phased return begins in Northern Ireland.\nGareth Evans, director of education policy at University of Wales Trinity St David, said the announcement helped provide clarity for parents, who might have been wondering why it was not safe to return in Wales.\nMeanwhile, Hugh Davies, president of the Association of School and College Leaders in Wales, said there was concern the announcement would create an expectation from parents that their children would return before Easter.\nMr Davies, who is also head teacher at Olchfa Comprehensive School in Swansea, said: \"On one level flexibility is a good thing, one size doesn't fit all... but sometimes flexibility can also set up confusion in the minds of parents\".\nHe added: \"My fear is that just as we are beginning to focus our minds on coming out of the pandemic... suddenly parents will be conflicted and comparing one school with another... that's probably an unnecessary distraction at this point.\"\nOne teaching union said they were \"surprised by the proposed acceleration before the hard data exists to support it\".\n\"We have not had a full return of foundation phase across Wales yet and what we don't want is to see schools having to close again because we have brought in too many learners too quickly,\" said NAHT Cymru director Laura Doel.\nA change in guidance means secondary school pupils and teachers will now be told to wear face coverings in classrooms if social distancing cannot be maintained.\nUntil now they had only been required outside the classroom, such as in school corridors and canteens. Other safety measures include teachers being encouraged to open windows, and older pupils being offered asymptomatic testing.\nThe education minister had been criticised by some parents last week who said they were \"furious\" hairdressers, non-essential shops and tourism would reopen before their children could return to the classroom after Easter.\nNo firm dates have been set for relaxing lockdown measures in Wales, but a provisional roadmap suggests non-essential shops could reopen on 15 March.\nFaced with parents who said their children's futures were \"being ruined\", Ms Williams said scientists had advised pupils should go back gradually to stop a risk of case rates jumping significantly.\nMs Williams announced the proposed changes on Monday, saying the falling case rates meant schools could return \"further and faster\" than originally planned.\nJackie Parker, head teacher at Crickhowell High School, said the change meant children could have a day or two to see their friends and teachers before the holiday.\nBut she added: \"I think it is going to be a period of juggling. It may be different for different schools.\"\nBronwen Hughes, head teacher at Ysgol Maes Garmon in Mold, Flintshire, said it was important that teachers had the chance to \"check in and catch up\" with pupils to prepare them for their return.\n\"Practically, a part-time return means that we have to plan effectively,\" she said, adding parents needed to know exactly when pupils would be in.\n\"As long as we plan it well, assess our risks and prepare, the sessions years 7, 8 and 9 spend in school will be beneficial for them.\"\nEmma Safhill from St Asaph, Denbighshire, whose daughter is in Year 9, said having some in class time was \"better than nothing\".\n\"She confessed the other day she'd be pleased to go back, have some normality and see her friends,\" Ms Safhill added."

      "tags": "Google,Advertising",
      "text": "Google has promised not to develop any new way of tracking individual users for adverts once it phases out its current method. \nThe tech giant is one of the world's largest advertising sellers and also owns the world's most popular web browser, Chrome. \nBut it is following other browser providers by eliminating third-party tracking cookies. \nThat move is already being looked at by the UK's competition authority. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority said in January that Google's plan to remove the cookies - which would effectively share less information with advertisers - could have a \"significant impact\" on the advertising market and news websites. \nOne group of marketers opposed to the idea claims that Google will gain an advantage by eliminating such cookies, because it has other ways of obtaining personal information from users.\nCookies temporarily store small amounts of information about what a user is doing on a website and are an important part of the modern internet. \nFor example, they can \"remember\" things, such as what is in an online shopping basket or whether a user is logged in. \nBut a third-party tracking cookie can be used to \"follow\" a user from site to site, so a website can \"know\" that you were shopping around for a type of product - like clothes or shoes - and advertise those things to you elsewhere.  \nThose are the type that Google is phasing out, following the lead of some major competitor web browsers, including Mozilla Firefox and Apple's Safari, which already block them by default. \nSome critics had been concerned that Google's plan to stop these cookies would prevent its rivals from building useful catalogues of ad targeting information - but that Google itself might still be able to do so. \nThe company appeared to tackle that idea directly in its new announcement. \n\"Today, we're making explicit that once third-party cookies are phased out, we will not build [alternative] identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web, nor will we use them in our products,\" the company said in a blog post. \nIt said the knock-on effect was that other providers could end up offering \"a level of user identity for ad tracking across the web that we will not\" (although Firefox and Safari already block the offending cookies by default). \n\"We don't believe these solutions will meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren't a sustainable long-term investment,\" Google said. \nBut that portrayal has been challenged by industry group Marketers for an Open Web, who argue Google will have an unfair advantage.\nDirector James Rosewell said Google hasn't promised to stop personalised marketing, or gathering of data, inside its own products - which would involve changing its product terms and conditions.\nRegulators still need to ensure competition, through legislation, he said, or \"advertisers will have little choice as to where they spend their money\". \nAnd there are fewer privacy advantages for the average user, he argued.\n\"You have one large trillion-dollar company that effectively, through an unfair contract... tracks you more of the time, the only difference is you're going to be logged in, and part of their walled garden.\" \n\"How does that make people more private, or more secure, versus something that doesn't have directly identifiable information -  their name, their email address - it just uses a random string of characters?\" \nThe shift away from cookies has been prompted by years of tightening regulation and increased consumer awareness. \nBut stopping the use of tracking cookies does not prevent all personalised tracking, as the industry has come up with creative solutions to generate personalised data. \nSo-called \"fingerprinting\", for example, tries to use a huge range of details about your device - the type of phone or computer, browser version, language, IP address, or even what fonts you have installed - to identify the machine. \nThe advertiser might not know the person's name, but it can still \"follow\" that unique fingerprint around the web. \nGoogle, which will continue to sell ads, argues that it and other companies need to come up with a solution that \"delivers results\" for advertisers. \nIt now says that people should not have to be tracked invasively in order to \"get the benefits\" of targeted advertising.  \nOne way of doing so, Google said in its blog post, was to \"hide individuals within large crowds of people with common interests\", so that an individual person's browsing history would be difficult to figure out.

      "tags": "Personal finance,UK economy,Freelancers,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "More help for the self-employed has been announced in the Budget, with grants available until the end of September.\nThese will be the first payments available to an estimated 600,000 people who missed out on earlier support because they couldn't demonstrate their self-employed status on their tax return.\nPrevious claimants will also be able to apply.\nTwo further payments will be available for self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus.\nThese represent the fourth and fifth grants paid out by the Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS).\nThe fourth covers the three-month period from February until the end of April. As with two of the previous SEISS grants, it is worth up to 80% of trading profits, averaged over three months, up to \u00a37,500 in total. \nThe fifth grant covers May to the end of September, but the amount available depends on loss of income.\nWorkers whose turnover has fallen by at least 30% can still apply for a grant for up to 80% of profits, up to a value of \u00a37,500 in total. \nThose whose income has fallen by less than that can apply for up to 30% of trading profits capped at \u00a32,850.\nClaims can be made from next month for the fourth grant. Claims for the fifth grant will open in July. \nNearly a fifth of self-employed people - 600,000 people - missed out on previous grants. That's because they had only recently started working for themselves, and so could not prove their income status on their tax return.\nBut those who completed tax returns for the 2019-2020 financial year will qualify for these new payments, provided they filed their return by midnight on 2 March 2021.\nHowever, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. (Although they will have some of their salary covered by job retention schemes if they operate through PAYE).\nAs a result, an estimated 18% of those for whom self-employment makes up most of their income have been ineligible for SEISS grants, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nThe chancellor's first package of measures were unveiled in March last year.\nIf they suffered any loss in income, people who were self-employed or in partnerships were paid a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits, up to \u00a32,500 per month. \nHelp was initially given as one lump-sum payment to cover three months, and businesses have also been able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans.\nMore than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment.\nThe schemes have been open to those with a trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.\nThe government's help comes on top of extended delays for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Payment plans can be set up, giving people more time to pay their full tax bill up to January 2022.\nThose with the lowest income are in line to receive more generous benefits payments compared with before the crisis.\nThis is how it has worked: \nThere are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of \u00a3781 a month. The number has risen fast since the 2008 financial crash. \nOf those eligible for previous grants, 77% have taken up the offer - a total of 2.6 million people, averaging around \u00a310,800 in payments each.\nRoughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education\nThe chancellor has suggested that in future, tax breaks for the self-employed - such as lower national insurance - may end. These were in place because the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay. They were also meant to encourage entrepreneurship.\nThis signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Bristol,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A single Covid vaccine dose gives high levels of protection against severe disease, even in the oldest age groups, more evidence shows.\nA study on patients in two Bristol hospitals found both Pfizer BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca jabs prevent 80% of hospital admissions among over-80s.\nSome European countries are refusing to use the Oxford jab on older groups because of a lack of convincing data.\nLead researcher Prof Adam Finn said the findings should change their minds.\nFrance agreed to offer the vaccine, which is easier to store than the Pfizer jab, to over-65s only recently, while Germany still isn't doing so. \n\"This study is much more important for non-UK countries than it is for the UK,\" said Prof Finn, who is running the study at the University of Bristol.\nIn the UK, this age group has now been immunised, he said.\n\"But there are lots of doses of AstraZenena vaccine available in European countries and they are not being given to people over the age of 65 - in some countries over the age of 55 - for lack of data.\n\"Well here are the data... showing that you can save lives in elderly people by giving them a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and those countries need to get on and start doing that as fast as possible.\"\nThe Bristol findings support figures from other studies, including those run by Public Health England and Public Health Scotland, which looked at whole populations. \nThe England study found a 57% and 63% reduction in the risk of symptomatic infection in over-80s with the Pfizer and Oxford jabs respectively, 14 days after a single dose.\nAnd both jabs reduced  hospital admissions by more than 80%. \nIn Scotland, one dose of Pfizer appeared to provide an 85% reduction, and Oxford 94%, in admissions in this age group, over a slightly longer period - 28-34 days after a first dose. \nBut the researchers recommended not focusing too closely on small differences in numbers.\nThe studies look at slightly different things and all have fairly wide margins of error. \nAs more time passes and more people are vaccinated, more data will emerge, so these margins of error will shrink. This should allow scientists to be more confident in their estimates. \nThe overall message from all the data coming out so far is both vaccines provide very good protection from illness.\nThis study was slightly different from the other two mentioned. \nIt focused on the oldest and frailest people at two major hospitals in Bristol, rather than looking at a whole population.\nWe would expect these people to respond least well to a vaccine, because their natural immunity is weaker.\nAnd the researchers looked not at their chances of mild or moderate disease, as with other studies, but at how many vaccinated people still became severely ill and needed to go into hospital.\nThey were also able to look in more detail at patient records, including how long after having symptoms they were admitted to hospital.\nThis meant the team could identify and exclude from their sample people who had symptoms for more than 10 days before having a test, to reduce the chance of false negatives which could affect their findings. \nVaccine clinical trials generally enrol younger people and measure whether any of them develop symptoms.\nThis is good at telling us how well that group is protected against mild and moderate disease.\nBut Prof Finn said what we really want to know is:\nThe Siren study of healthcare workers published last week suggests the vaccine stopped 70% of infections, even in those without symptoms, meaning those people could not transmit the virus. \nNow, this Bristol study adds to our understanding of the first question - the biggest driver of loss of life and pressure on hospitals. \nThe study will continue for another two years to monitor the effectiveness of the vaccine on different groups. \nFor example, the team hopes to identify specific factors that \"make people at increased risk of not responding well to these vaccines,\" said Dr Catherine Hyams. \nThat doesn't mean the vaccine will harm those people, but that those with compromised immune systems may not be able to benefit from the protection the jab is supposed to confer. \nFollow Rachel on Twitter"

      "text": "The US will have enough coronavirus vaccines for every adult by the end of May, President Joe Biden has said.\nThis will be two months earlier than previously expected, but Mr Biden said the vaccination drive must be extended, too, and people convinced to take it.\nAnd he warned people to \"stay vigilant\" because \"this fight is far from over\", with new variants a major concern.\nHis caution is at odds with some states, which are relaxing restrictions in order to boost their economies.\nMr Biden's new timeline does not mean all adults in the US will be vaccinated by the end of May, as the jabs will take longer to administer. \nAlthough there has been a sharp fall in confirmed cases since the start of the year - the figure of 68,000 a day now is well down on the 8 January peak of 300,000 - that drop has levelled off over the past week, fuelling fears of another wave.\nMore than 76 million vaccination doses have been administered - covering 15.3% of the population and the US remains on track to meet Mr Biden's pledge of delivering 100 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office.\nSome 1.74 million doses are being administered every day.\nThe president said that drug manufacturer Merck - which this year discontinued work on its own vaccine - would now be helping Johnson & Johnson to produce its newly approved one-shot drug.\n\"We're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May,\" he said, adding it was \"the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War Two\".\nBut the president acknowledged that supply was only one issue, with the nation needing to extend its vaccination drive and convince people to take the shots.\n\"We need vaccinators, people who put the shots in people's arms, millions of Americans' arms,\" he said.\n\"Great news, but stay vigilant,\" Mr Biden said. \"It's not over yet.\"\nAnother key announcement was the pledge to give every teacher at least one shot by the end of March, and speed up the reopening of schools.\nBut on a general reopening, President Biden was more cautious, saying he was unsure when a return to normal would be possible, although he did then say before \"this time next year\".\nSome are now relaxing rules, despite a warning from top federal health officials last week not to ease up.\nMr Biden repeated that, saying: \"We cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable. We can't assume that.\"\nIndividual states are in charge of public health policy in the US. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, most introduced restrictions on businesses and travel.\nAbout 35 required face coverings to be worn in public places, although enforcement of these mask mandates has been patchy.\nThe governor of Texas on Tuesday issued an executive order, effective from 10 March, that rescinds most of the coronavirus measures he imposed.\nGreg Abbott lifted the regulation ordering people to wear masks and said that businesses would be allowed to resume full capacity next week.\n\"It is now time to open Texas 100%,\" the Republican said. \"Too many small business owners have struggled to pay their bills. This must end.\"\nHe said that with increased vaccinations and improved treatment for Covid-19, the state was \"in a far better position now\".\nThe Democratic party in the state said the \"crazy\" move would throw away all of the gains.\nMississippi has followed Texas in removing the order on mask wearing, but it will come into effect even earlier - from Wednesday.\nOther states have also announced a relaxation of some rules.\nMichigan, which has a Democratic governor, is to ease capacity limits on restaurants, and on public and residential gatherings.\nSouth Carolina has removed limits on large gatherings, while capacity limits on restaurants in Massachusetts were removed.\nSome cities have also acted. Chicago has reopened public schools and San Francisco announced the easing of rules on museums, cinemas, gyms and indoor dining.\nHealth officials have warned that the pandemic is far from over and cases could pick up if curbs are lifted too soon.\nOn Monday the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned of a \"potential fourth surge of cases\" if the country lapsed into complacency.\nCovid-19 data shows that, while infections and deaths have declined in recent weeks, they are still at high levels relative to other countries.\nThe emergence of new variants could also require booster shots for those already vaccinated."

      "text": "The furlough scheme will be extended until the end of September by the chancellor in the Budget later.\nRishi Sunak said the scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - would help millions through \"the challenging months ahead\".\nSome 600,000 more self-employed people will also be eligible for government help as access to grants is widened. \nBut Labour said the support schemes should have been extended \"months ago\".\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has protected more than 11 million jobs since its inception last March and had been due to close at the end of April.\nIt has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as tens of thousands of businesses remain shut. \nEmployers will be expected to pay 10% towards the hours their staff do not work in July, increasing to 20% in August and September, as the economy reopens. \nGovernment support for self-employed people has also been extended until September.\nA fourth grant under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) scheme will run from February until April, covering up to 80% of three months' trading profits up to \u00a37,500.\nThere will be a fifth grant from May to September.\nPeople whose turnover has fallen by 30% or more will get the 80% grant, but self-employed people whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will get a 30% grant.\nThe government is widening access to grants, meaning some 600,000 more self-employed people will be eligible.\nPeople who filed their tax returns for 2019-20 by midnight on Tuesday are now eligible.\nSpeaking ahead of the Budget, the chancellor said: \"Our Covid support schemes have been a lifeline to millions, protecting jobs and incomes across the UK.\n\"There's now light at the end of the tunnel with a roadmap for reopening, so it's only right that we continue to help business and individuals through the challenging months ahead - and beyond.\" However, he is expected to warn in his Budget that there are tough economic times ahead.\nAre you currently on furlough?  Share your experiences.\nIt is incredible to think that last year's Budget did not even contain the word \"furlough\". Official confirmation of a pandemic came hours after its publication, swiftly rendering most of its numbers obsolete.\nBut so far in this crisis, unemployment has gone up only modestly. Furlough and the separate support scheme for the self-employed have prevented mass unemployment.\nThese extensions now aim to prevent a rapid rise in joblessness at the end of the schemes. The BBC understands that unemployment forecasts will be revised down on Wednesday as the chancellor promises to deploy his \"full fiscal firepower\" to \"protect livelihoods\" - the theme of the Budget red book.\nAt more than \u00a310bn, this intervention is almost worthy of a Budget in and of itself.\nBut the full document will reveal whether the chancellor's borrowing spree is limited to the \"rescue phase\" of this crisis, or if his confidence in a jobs bounce-back means the economy does not need further stimulus and could even sustain some business-focused tax rises.\nAfter the jabs, the jobs are the great hope.\nEconomic think tank the Resolution Foundation's chief executive, Torsten Bell, said the phased tapering-off of the furlough scheme would avoid a \"risky cliff-edge\" for employers, but warned that the \"peak of unemployment is ahead rather than behind us\".\nHowever, Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the changes to support schemes \"could have been made months ago\" - accusing Mr Sunak of focusing on \"getting his moment in the sun rather than protecting jobs and livelihoods\".\nThe SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has said furlough must be in place  \"as long as businesses and devolved governments need it\".\nHe said he was \"concerned companies are going to have to step in and pay greater contributions\".  \nAnd Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said that while the extra months of furlough support offer \"some stability in the rocky months ahead\", the scheme should be extended until 2022.\nBut Chris Wootton, chief financial officer at Sports Direct, said that although the furlough extension was helpful, other assistance was needed for businesses such as his, chiefly through business rates, payment of which has been suspended for almost a year.\nHe told the BBC: \"What we really want is structural reform. This is just kicking the can down the road.\n\"We don't know what the systemic changes to consumer behaviour are going to be. We said even before Covid happened that a number of House of Fraser stores where we're working very closely with landlords, paying zero rent, they are still losing money because the business rates are far from fair.\""

Kumerra Gemechu was held for 12 days before being released without charge.  \nJust over two weeks later, Dawit Kebede Araya, a reporter with the state-owned broadcaster Tigray TV was shot dead in Mekelle.\nThen in February, the Committee to Protect journalists said that freelance reporter Lucy Kassa's home in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa was raided by armed men who threatened to kill her if she kept on investigating stories about the conflict in Tigray. \nFighting continues in Tigray despite the government declaring victory over the Tigray People's Liberation Front, which used to be the region's ruling party. \nHundreds have been killed and tens of thousands displaced. \nThere is international concern over growing reports of atrocities committed by all sides and the worsening humanitarian crisis.\nAn official of Ethiopia's ruling party recently warned that measures would be taken against people they said were \"misleading international media\"."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nAll eyes were on the chancellor as he set out his tax and spending plans in the Budget, with the UK's economy reeling from the coronavirus crisis. Rishi Sunak vowed to \"protect the jobs and livelihoods of the British people\". He extended furlough until September - but he also announced plans to increase the tax on large company profits from 2023. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget was \"nowhere near ambitious enough\". There is hope on the horizon as official forecasts predict the UK economy will grow 4% this year, and get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected. But the government is expected to borrow \u00a3394bn during the current financial year - the highest figure seen in peacetime. You can read all the detail on the Budget here.\nMr Sunak said the government will keep economic support in place \"until well past the point we exit lockdown\" and the UK's recovery \"begins today\". So what does it mean for the money in your pocket? The National Living Wage will rise to \u00a38.91 from April, from \u00a38.72 for people 23 and over. National Insurance and VAT rates will not go up, but a million more people will start paying income tax by 2026. The extra \u00a320 a week for people on universal credit will continue for six months, with an equivalent \u00a3500 payment for people on working tax credit. And all duty tax on fuel and on alcohol will stay as they are. Here are 10 ways the Budget affects your finances.\nA councillor has been suspended from the Labour party after posting a photo on Facebook claiming she'd had a Covid vaccination from a private doctor. Jamila Azad posted: \"My darling daughter took me to a Private Care Doctor for Covid-19 vaccine. A long wait for NHS waiting list.\" The government says jabs are only allowed to be given by the NHS and the Labour Party is investigating. You can read the full story here.\nPeople on the Isle of Man say they are \"disappointed\" to be entering a third coronavirus lockdown - but have vowed they will beat the virus once again. All social distancing was scrapped in February, but a rise in cases - some linked to a ferry crew member have triggered a 21-day circuit-breaker. Island resident Cathy Clucas said it was unfortunate that due to a minority \"the majority are to suffer again\". She said: \"Repeated lockdowns are forcing decent, law abiding and hard working people towards debt.\" You can read about how Cathy's fellow islanders are feeling here.\nThe BBC written lots of stories on the challenges faced by couples who have had babies during lockdown - but one couple has done it twice. Rachel Taylor and Scott Gretton from Teesside had Oscar just days into the first lockdown and have now welcomed his baby brother, Chester. When Oscar was born they did not \"see a soul for months, which was great\", they said. Lockdown had given them more time to adapt to family life. And as you'll see from their video, the boys had a surprise for Rachel.

      "text": "Buckingham Palace says it will investigate claims the Duchess of Sussex bullied royal staff, adding that it was \"very concerned\" by the allegations.\nIt follows a report in the Times newspaper that Meghan faced a bullying complaint when she was a working royal.\nHer spokesman said the duchess was \"saddened\" by the \"latest attack on her character\".\nThe palace said it \"does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment\".\nIt will speak to the members of staff involved \"to see if lessons can be learned\", a statement added.\nAccording to the story in the Times, the complaint was made in October 2018, while the duke and duchess were living at Kensington Palace.\nA leaked email sent from a staff member, which was published by the newspaper, alleges that Meghan drove two personal assistants out of the household. The report claims she undermined the confidence of a third member of staff.\nIn a statement, Buckingham Palace - which is responsible for the hiring of royal staff - said: \"We are clearly very concerned about allegations in the Times following claims made by former staff of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\"Accordingly, our HR team will look into the circumstances outlined in the article. Members of staff involved at the time, including those who have left the Household, will be invited to participate to see if lessons can be learned.\n\"The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace.\"\nAn earlier statement issued by Meghan's spokesman said: \"The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma.\n\"She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good.\"\nOn one thing everyone is agreed: the interview that Meghan has given Oprah Winfrey - that will be broadcast in the US on Sunday - is concentrating minds.\nPalace staff have for some time itched to get their side of the story out; some feel that they went out of their way to help Meghan after the wedding only to be treated rudely or later dismissed as uncaring or worse.\nTeam Sussex were braced for the story. \"It's a fairly extensive list of things that has been pulled together,\" one source told the BBC. \"The timing is not coincidental.\"\nMeghan's side do not dispute the existence or content of the email; and it is pretty strong stuff. It makes flesh the rumours and allegations that swirled around the duchess when a number of staff left some months after the 2018 wedding.\nThe duchess' people have pushed back. The people named in the leaked email knew nothing about the complaint, they say, and it never turned into a formal issue.\nBut now it has; the inquiry announced tonight is a clear indication that Buckingham Palace is treating the matter seriously.\nWhatever the truth, it ratchets up the tension - and publicity - around the interview to come in just a few days' time.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. \nHarry has previously said the decision to step back was in order to protect himself and his family from the press.\nLast month, it was announced the couple would not return as working members of the Royal Family.\nIt comes ahead of Meghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah Winfrey, which will be aired on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March.\nIn the UK, the interview will be screened on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March.\nCBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about \"stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood\" and \"how she is handling life under intense public pressure\".\nShe will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans."

Its prizes included tanning foams, sold under her own brand.\nTo enter users had to:\nThe original post was liked close to 1.2 million times and attracted almost three million comments.\nTwelve people subsequently contacted the Advertising Standards Authority, challenging whether Ms Hague had included all the entrants in the draw to give them an equal and fair chance of winning - a relatively high number of complaints.\nMs Hague subsequently told the authority she had been overwhelmed by the response.\nThe ASA said she claimed a member of her management team had manually selected 100 entrants at random and assigned each a number. It said she added that another independent party had then used Google's number-picking tool to choose a winner.\nBut the regulator noted that an Instagram Story she had published after the competition's close stated that the winner had actually been picked from a smaller shortlisted group of 25 people.\n\"We were concerned by the inconsistencies,\" it said, adding that in any case she had failed to provide any evidence that the narrowed-down group had been chosen randomly.\n\"The promotion was not administered fairly,\" it concluded.\nMs Hague did not respond to a BBC request for comment.\nThe ruling came a month after the watchdog acted against two other tanning brands which had used influencers. \nIn those cases it said that digital photo filters should not be applied to social media ads if they exaggerated a product's effect .\nOne observer said the ASA was making it clear that the rules concerning influencer-led promotions went beyond labelling ads as such.\n\"Targeting someone like Molly-Mae sends a message to other influencers, who may have smaller followings, to remind them that they are under the same requirements as any other brand,\" Nick Breen from law firm Reed Smith told the BBC.\n\"So, as they do more sophisticated campaigns - beyond copying and pasting marketing from an advertiser - they need to take even more care.\""

      "text": "A revelation that two sisters of Spain's King Felipe VI were vaccinated during a trip to Abu Dhabi last month has sparked a political backlash.\nMedia reports revealed Princess Elena, 57, and Princess Cristina, 55, had got the jab whilst visiting their father.\nThe former King, Juan Carlos, left the country in 2020 amid mounting scandals.\nBoth princesses, who do not yet qualify to get a vaccine under Spain's roll-out, defended and explained their decision on Wednesday.\n\"My sister and I went to visit my father and in order to be issued with a medical certificate which will allow us to continue to visit him regularly, we were offered the chance to get vaccinated, which we accepted,\" they said in a statement to El Mundo on Wednesday. \n\"Had it not been for these circumstances, we would have waited for our turn to get vaccinated to come around in Spain,\" they added.\nJuan Carlos has been living in self-exile in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since last August. \nAlthough he denied wrongdoing regarding mounting corruption allegations, his departure heightened debate and scrutiny about the royal family.\nEquality Minister Irene Montero was among the politicians who criticised the princesses after the revelation was first reported by online news website El Confidencial. \n\"The vaccination of the princesses is more news which contributes to discrediting the monarchy. For the public, this constitutes preferential treatment and privileges,\" the minister told the public TVE network. \nLabour Minister Yolanda Diaz described the matter as as \"very unpleasant, very ugly\".\n\"We, the people who exercise some sort of representation, must lead by example,\" she added.\nA royal palace source declined to comment on the reports to Reuters on the basis that the sisters are not formally part of the institution but said the king, Queen Letizia and their daughters would get the vaccination when it was their turn.\nSpain has only administered about 4m vaccines so far, with over-80s and essential workers currently being prioritised. \nA similar scandal rocked the country in January, when some senior figures including the country's top military chief resigned after they were implicated in \"queue-jumping\" allegations of their own.

      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,Economic growth,UK economy,Budget 2021,UK national debt",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that a spending spree to support workers and spur investment will be followed by tax rises as the economy recovers.\nThe UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccine rollout is expected to help the economy get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected.\nOfficial forecasts expect growth to hit 4% this year, while an extension of the furlough scheme will limit job losses.\nMr Sunak said future tax hikes were needed to stop \"irresponsible\" debt.\nThe government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said the UK had been at the \"vanguard\" of the discovery of new and effective vaccines.\nIt said this will foster a \"swifter and more sustained\" economic recovery, with the pace of growth expected to strengthen to 7.3% in 2022.\nThis would be the highest growth rate since official records began in 1949 and help the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size in the middle of next year.\nMr Sunak unveiled plans to spend tens of billions of pounds more over the next two years to support the economic recovery, including tax breaks designed to encourage business investment. \nHowever, the chancellor said tax rises were also needed to help repair the public finances.\nMr Sunak announced that corporation tax will rise from 19% to 25% for large companies in 2023, while day-to-day spending by government departments will be cut by a further \u00a34bn a year.\nMr Sunak said it would be \"irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked\".\nChris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, described the Budget as \"three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain\".\nMr Sanger added: \"Time [is] the Chancellor's friend in his aim of replenishing the Government's coffers.\" \nThe government's target to have all adults vaccinated this summer is expected to pave the way for the lifting of public health restrictions.\nThe OBR noted that British households had built up a savings war chest of around \u00a3180bn in the past year.\nIt expects a quarter of this to be spent as lockdowns end, saying there could be a \"degree of euphoria\", especially among better-off households who \"treat themselves\" when the economy opens up.\nThe main thrust of this Budget is significant extra immediate crisis support, both in terms of the furlough scheme and self employed support, and a radical \"super-deduction\" policy to encourage business investment right now.. That is \u00a360bn extra in one year and it comes from borrowed money. That leaves borrowing in the coming financial year significantly higher than expected. A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year.\nThe happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer.\nThe jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in \u00a316bn corporation tax and the \u00a38bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here. \nSo Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of \"Singapore-on-Thames\". Singapore is staying in South East Asia.\nThe timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal. \nHowever, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained \"considerable\", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was \"betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz\".\nHe added: \"The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax.\"\nUnemployment is expected to peak at a lower rate of 6.5%, keeping it well below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis.\nHowever, this means half a million more people are expected to be out of work by the end of this year.\nGovernment borrowing is expected to rise to a peacetime high of \u00a3354.6bn this year to help pay for economic support measures.\nThe size of the UK's debt pile is also expected to remain larger than the economy until at least the middle of the decade.\nMr Sunak said: \"It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover.\"\nFrom April, he will also freeze the amount of money employees earn before paying income tax at \u00a312,570 until the middle of the decade.\nThe OBR estimates an extra 1.3 million people will start to pay income tax by 2026 as a result of the freeze.\nThe level at which employees start paying the higher, 40% rate of tax will also be frozen at \u00a350,270 from April, dragging an extra million people into the band within five years."

      "text": "Domestic abuse schemes in England and Wales will receive an extra \u00a319m from the government over the next two years.\nMost of the money will go towards programmes working with abusers, to reduce the risk of reoffending.\nThe domestic abuse commissioner said the money was \"hugely welcome\" but called for longer-term funding.\nCharities said more detail was needed on how the extra money would be used, and that a \u00a3200m \"shortfall\" remained in funding domestic abuse services.\nThe announcement is in addition to the \u00a3125m allocated last month to help councils in England give therapy and support to survivors and their children in the year 2021-22.\nMost of the \u00a319m, announced on Wednesday by Chancellor Rishi Sunak as part of his Budget, will be delivered over the next year to programmes working with perpetrators.\nWomen's Aid said working with perpetrators was important but \"must never come at the expense of funding lifesaving support for survivors\".\nThe charity added that an estimated funding \"shortfall\" of more than \u00a3200m would mean \"women and children will be turned away from the lifesaving support they need\".\nTracy Blackwell, from the charity Refuge, added that the Budget had not addressed the \"huge gap\" in funding faced by many refuges for those seeking emergency help.\nDomestic abuse has increased across the UK and the world during Covid lockdowns, organisations have reported. \nThe United Nations has called the global increase in domestic abuse a \"shadow pandemic\". \nIn the UK, charities say there has been a surge in demand for services. Police forces have also recorded a rise in incidents.\nSome \u00a34m of the new funding will help to pilot a network of so-called \"respite rooms\" to give specialist support to vulnerable homeless women in England in 2022-23.\nJohn Plummer, co-ordinator of London Prisons Mission, said the pilot was a \"step in the right direction\" to help women who become homeless after leaving prison.\nBut he said the respite rooms must \"support women into long-term safe and secure accommodation, not just provide emergency accommodation, in order to help them rebuild their lives\".\nDomestic abuse commissioner Nicole Jacobs said Mr Sunak's announcement of the \u00a319m was \"hugely welcome\" and would \"make a significant difference\" to domestic abuse survivors.\nHowever, she also said longer-term funding was needed for community-based support services. \nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by domestic abuse, the following organisations may be able to help."

      "tags": "HM Treasury,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Job Retention Scheme,Employment,Pay,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September.\nThe government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nAt first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%.\nThe most recent figures show 1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July - the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier.\nNearly one million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation.\nThe numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough.\nSome employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends.\nInternational travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs.\nMany forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. \nIf you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. \nThe selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay.\nIf you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: \nYou might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. \nThe amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. \nYou may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs. \nThere is lots of free benefits guidance and advice available, including: \nThe government says 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the scheme.\nFrom March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about \u00a366bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. \nThat's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid.\nHowever, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. \nAt the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed.\nInstead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20.

      "text": "People with low immunity due to health conditions, including cancer, are being recruited to a study to urgently find out if coronavirus vaccines will still offer them high protection. \nAs the UK comes out of lockdown, it is important to know the virus risk for all populations. \nTrials and real-life data show the shots work very well for most adults, including the very elderly. \nBut there is little evidence on efficacy in immunocompromised patients. \nThe coronavirus vaccines approved by UK regulators are safe and still recommended for people with weakened immune systems due to underlying health conditions or prescribed medications, including those having chemotherapy or stem-cell transplants.  \nIn the Octave study, up to 5,000 of these patients, from around the UK, will be vaccinated as part of the NHS mass rollout.\nBut blood tests before and after will check their immunity levels and see how well protected they are against Covid. \nThe researchers should have some findings within a few months.\nFull results are expected much later this year or early next. \nLead researcher Prof Iain McInnes, from the University of Glasgow, said: \"We urgently need to understand if patient populations with chronic conditions such as cancer, inflammatory arthritis and kidney and liver disease are likely to be well-protected by current Covid-19 vaccines. \n\"The Octave study will give us invaluable new data to help us answer questions of this kind from our patients and their families.\"\nThe British Society for Immunology said: \"While Covid-19 vaccination might provide a lower level of protection in people who are immunosuppressed or immunocompromised compared with the rest of the population, it is still very important that you get vaccinated, as it will offer you a certain amount of protection. \n\"It is important that you receive two doses of the vaccine to maximise the protection that vaccination offers you.\""

      "text": "The amount the government has to spend on state pensions will fall by \u00a31.5bn by 2022, partly because of over-65s dying of Covid, forecasts suggest.\nThe government will also receive an extra \u00a30.9bn from inheritance tax, partly due to Covid-related deaths.\nThe figures have been published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's fiscal watchdog.\nIt said it had \"revised up our assumption for excess deaths this year and next relative to November\".\nMore than 144,000 deaths involving Covid-19 have occurred in the UK since the start of the pandemic, figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show.\nThe majority of coronavirus deaths have been among people aged over 65, many of whom will have been receiving the state pension.\nThe OBR estimates spending on the state pension will fall by \u00a3600m in 2020-21 and \u00a3900m in 2021-22 compared with forecasts made before the pandemic.\nThe watchdog said the forecast for lower state pension spending was partly because of the weaker outlook for average earnings growth, which lowers the effect of the yearly triple lock uprating. \nBut it added that excess deaths due to the pandemic have also reduced the number of people receiving pensions.\n\"With virus-related deaths rising sharply again in recent months, we have revised up the number of excess pensioner-age deaths in 2020-21 from 90,000 in our November forecast to around 100,000 in this one,\" the OBR said in its Economic And Fiscal Outlook, which is published alongside the Budget.\nIt has increased its forecast because: \"Higher virus-related deaths in the current wave of the virus have outweighed the effect of lockdown reducing deaths from other causes, particularly from influenza and other respiratory diseases\".\nMeanwhile the Treasury predicted that inheritance tax receipts will increase from \u00a35.1bn in 2019-20 to \u00a36bn in 2021-22, before falling to \u00a35.8bn the following year.\nThe rise in inheritance tax receipts is partly due to the freeze of inheritance tax thresholds until April 2026 announced in the Budget and the growth in the value of estates, but higher Covid-19 deaths will also contribute, the OBR said."

He purchased the test kit on Friday on his arrival. Although he received an email confirming his order, he is still waiting for his tests four days later.\n\"When I called the line said: 'We are experiencing high volumes of calls', before dropping,' says Mr Babin. \"I have emailed too, but had no response. I can't go to the pharmacy to buy the test, what are my options?\"\nMr Babin describes the situation as \"very frustrating\".\n\"Of course I'm concerned that I might get a fine, but if I do I will challenge it. Why are the government making policies that they can't administer?\"\nHe has now been told by the test provider, CTM, that his kit will be resent. \nLorenzo Calonghi lives in France, but returned to the UK in February to study engineering. He booked his tests on 20 February, but became worried when he hasn't received the first test by his second day in quarantine at home. \n\"On day three (of home quarantine), I called the company multiple times and was unable to reach them,\" says Mr Calonghi. 'I continued to call every day but still never received a call back - nor was my call ever picked up.\"\nHe eventually found out by contacting the company on Twitter that his order had been declined, although he had already received a confirmation email and been able to go through UK border controls. \nHe says that the company did not tell him that there was an issue with his payment and nine days on, he still has not received the tests.\nOthers have had similar problems. Tasadaq Hussain booked the testing package for his wife who was returning from Pakistan. When the tests did not arrive, they tried to reach the company.\n\"I was on hold for an hour and a half without an answer,\" he says. \"We kept trying every day.\"\nMr Hussain eventually created a Twitter account and eventually received a response from the firm after eight days.\nAnyone experiencing a delay in their test kit being delivered is advised to call 119.\nBBC News has approached the testing provider CTM for comment."

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex is \"saddened\" by a report she faced a bullying complaint during her time at Kensington Palace, her spokesman has said.\nThe Times newspaper says Meghan allegedly drove two personal assistants out of the household and undermined the confidence of a third member of staff.\nMeghan's spokesman said it was the \"latest attack on her character\".\nIt comes before Meghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah Winfrey is due to be aired in the UK on Monday.\nThe duchess lived at Kensington Palace for nearly a year after her marriage to Prince Harry in May 2018.\nAccording to the story in the Times, the complaint was made in October 2018. \nBuckingham Palace, which is responsible for the hiring of royal staff, has not commented on the report. Kensington Palace has been contacted for a comment.\nA statement issued by Meghan's spokesman said: \"The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma.\n\"She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good.\"\nOn one thing everyone is agreed: the interview that Meghan has given Oprah Winfrey, and that will be broadcast in the US on Sunday, is concentrating minds.\nPalace staff have for some time itched to get their side of the story out; some feel that they went out of their way to help Meghan after the wedding only to be treated rudely or later dismissed as uncaring or worse.\nTeam Sussex were braced for the story. \"It's a fairly extensive list of things that has been pulled together,\" one source told the BBC. \"The timing is not coincidental.\"\nMeghan's side do not dispute the existence or content of the email; and it is pretty strong stuff. It makes flesh the rumours and allegations that swirled around the duchess when a number of staff left some months after the 2018 wedding.\nBut the duchess' people are pushing back. The people named in the leaked email knew nothing about the complaint, they say, and it never turned into a formal issue.\nWhatever the truth, it ratchets up the tension - and publicity - around the interview to come in just a few days time.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. \nLast month Buckingham Palace announced the couple would not return as working members of the Royal Family.\nThe two-hour interview with Meghan and Prince Harry will be screened on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March, and on ITV in the UK at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March.\nCBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about \"stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood\" and \"how she is handling life under intense public pressure\".\nShe will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the United States last year and their future plans.\nThe Duke of Sussex drew parallels between the treatment of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Meghan, in a trailer clip for the interview.\nHarry said he feared history was \"repeating itself\" before he and Meghan decided to step back as senior royals."

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brandon Lewis,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU says a UK move to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks will be a breach of international law.\nNorthern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures.\nThe grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied.\nThe first of these periods will expire at the end of March, but the UK has said it will be extended until October.\nEuropean Commission Vice President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the move amounted to \"a violation of the relevant substantive provisions\" of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, known as the NI Protocol.\nHe said the EU would respond in accordance with the \"legal means\" established by the protocol and the wider Brexit deal.\nFollowing a call on Wednesday evening between Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and Lord Frost, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for EU relations, a UK government spokesperson said \"official-level notification\" of the move was made to the commission earlier this week.\nThe spokesperson said Lord Frost underlined the extension was needed for \"operational reasons\" and such measures were \"well precedented in other international trade arrangements, and that they were entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the Protocol in good faith\".\nIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the UK government's move clearly undermined its commitment to the implementation of the protocol and described the unilateral decision as \"deeply unhelpful\".\nHe said he had made his regret over the decision clear to Lord Frost and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis.\nThe grace period affects supermarkets and other retailers, which face having to provide export health certificates for all shipments of animal products.\n\"For supermarkets and their suppliers, as part of the operational plan the UK committed to at the UK-EU Joint Committee on 24 February, the current Scheme for Temporary Agri-food Movements to Northern Ireland will continue until 1 October,\" said a government statement.\n\"Certification requirements will then be introduced in phases alongside the roll out of the Digital Assistance Scheme.\"\nIt is understood the government is describing this to the EU as an \"operational easement\", rather than a formal extension of the grace period.\nIt is using the example of how the Irish government temporarily relaxed safety and security declarations on products arriving from GB in January.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \nIt does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.\nThat has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\nUnionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union.\nBut anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the move and said the EU had refused to deal with an issue that \"would have caused a huge amount of problems for us at our ports\".\nThe DUP leader added that it showed the UK government \"can go further, so we need to see permanent solutions\". \nHowever, her deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill, described the government's decision as \"another unilateral attempt to override what has been agreed\". \n\"What everyone should be focused on is achieving agreement to find solutions to the issues that are outstanding, but it's very clear the protocol must be made to work.\"\nSimon Hoare, the chairman of Westminster's NI Affairs Select Committee, tweeted that the case for extending the grace periods was \"compelling\" but that the unilateral move struck him as an \"approach most likely to have negative/unhelpful consequences\". \nThe Labour Party's shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the Prime Minister should \"show some responsibility and find the lasting solutions with the EU that are the only way to give businesses the certainty they are crying out for\". \nIn Northern Ireland, reaction has been mixed, with Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry welcoming the extension of grace periods but warning of \"long-term detrimental consequences for Northern Ireland\" over the government's unilateral action. \nUlster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken, meanwhile, described the protocol as \"unsalvageable\" and criticised the EU and Irish government for reacting in a \"dramatic, over-the-top manner to what are minimal changes\".\n\"Simon Coveney and his EU counterparts are showing gravity-defying levels of arrogance and hypocrisy, given their past actions,\" he added. \nThe government said further guidance will be provided later this week on a grace period for parcel movements from GB to NI.\nIt is due to to end on 1 April, meaning all parcels would need customs declarations.\nGuidance will also be set out in regard to the issue of soil attached to the movement of plants, seeds, bulbs, vegetables and agricultural machinery.\nUnder the terms of the Brexit deal, soil from Great Britain is not permitted to enter Northern Ireland as it conflicts with EU plant regulations."

      "tags": "BBC Three,Television",
      "text": "BBC Three will return as a fully-fledged TV channel in January 2022, six years after it moved online.\nThe channel has since been responsible for major hits including Fleabag, Normal People and Killing Eve - prompting calls for its resurrection.\nLast year, BBC research concluded there was a \"strong case\" for it to come back as a regular TV channel, focusing on younger audiences.\nMP Julian Knight said the move showed the BBC had \"failed\" those viewers.\n\"I question whether putting the clock back five years is the right way to win over 18-35s,\" said Mr Knight, who chairs the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS).\n\"The BBC needs to back success and make sure its programmes reach as many young people as possible wherever they live in the UK,\" said the BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore.  \n\"So regardless of the debates about the past, we want to give BBC Three its own broadcast channel again.\"\nAs announced in the BBC's Annual Plan last year, the channel's budget will also be doubled over the next two years - a decision that was also criticised by Mr Knight, who accused the BBC of putting extra investment into programmes while \"those over 75 are being chased to pay up for their TV licences\".\nThe BBC ended the provision of free TV licences for most over-75s last year, after the government decided to stop paying for the benefit.\nWhen it returns, BBC Three will be targeted at audiences aged 16-34, broadcasting from 19:00 to 04:00 each day.\nAs a result, CBBC's broadcast hours will revert to closing at 19:00 - as was the case before 2016. It currently runs until 21:00.\nThe move will still need approval from media regulator Ofcom before it can go ahead.\nSeven years ago the BBC announced that BBC Three would become digital only. The main reason given was the need to save money. The public narrative was: Young audiences congregate online rather than watch linear TV, so there's no point providing a linear service.\nSince then, three things have happened. The flight of young audiences to digital platforms, and away from scheduled TV, has accelerated. BBC Three has produced a big range of huge, global hits. And the pressure on the BBC, not least from Ofcom, to prove that it still appeals to young people has grown sharply.\nThis last point is critical. The BBC commissioned research showing that there is still a market of young people - albeit smaller than years ago - on linear platforms. Given the success of the shows commissioned by BBC Three, the feeling at the top of the organisation was that putting them back on a linear platform would create upside in terms of audience numbers, for relatively low cost.\nDespite the need for more savings today, that cost can be justified because when the BBC negotiates with the government over the future of the licence fee, it needs the strongest possible argument on its relevance and universal appeal.\nBBC Three was originally taken off air in March 2016. The corporation said the move would save \u00a330m a year, helping it to reduce its spending after cuts imposed by the government in 2010.\nMuch of the budget was reallocated to fund drama on BBC One, while BBC Three was expected to target younger audiences online.\nBut the plans caused controversy, prompting the Save BBC Three campaign which saw more than 300,000 people sign a petition to keep it on air.\nJournalist and founder of the campaign Jono Read said the channel's return was \"great news\".\n\"It became clear that the decision to to take it off air was a counter-productive move that bosses had taken to sacrifice the station under the guise of budget cuts, and one that was deeply unpopular with its audience.\n\"Nonetheless the online move has shown real potential for BBC Three and I think it will thrive when it is once again given the chance to combine traditional and new media when it returns to TV in 2022\", he says. \nMany of BBC Three's commissions have ended up on linear TV, with shows like Killing Eve and Fleabag attracting huge audiences on BBC One.\nNormal People, about the tangled love lives of two Irish teenagers, also became the breakout hit of the first lockdown. It was requested on the BBC iPlayer 62.7 million times last year, more than any other programme.\nOther hit shows on the channel include Man Like Mobeen, This Country, Ru Paul's Drag Race UK and the Jesy Nelson documentary Odd One Out.\nIn its online incarnation, BBC Three has won a raft of awards, including RTS Channel of the Year in 2017 and Digital Channel of the Year 2019 at the Edinburgh TV Festival. It is currently Broadcast Digital Channel of the Year.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "HM Treasury,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled more support for workers and businesses struggling with lockdown in his first Budget since the pandemic was declared.\nThe furlough scheme will be extended to September - along with higher universal credit payments.\nBut taxes on large company profits will rise in 2023 and a million more people will start paying income tax.\nIt will take the UK's tax burden to its highest level since the 1960s, said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget measures to salvage the UK's Covid-ravaged economy were \"nowhere near ambitious enough\".\nIn his Budget speech, Mr Sunak said unemployment will be lower - and growth higher - than previously thought as the UK emerges from lockdown later this year, citing forecasts from the OBR watchdog.\nBut he warned that repairing the long-term economic damage \"will take time\", with the economy in five years' time predicted to be 3% smaller than it would have been without the pandemic.\nDespite the \u00a3280bn of support already committed to protecting the economy, the harm done by coronavirus had been \"acute\", he told MPs.\n\"Our economy has shrunk by 10% - the largest fall in over 300 years. Our borrowing is the highest it has been outside of wartime.\n\"It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover.\"\nThe headline rate of corporation tax will go up from 19% to 25% from 2023, although smaller firms will be exempt.\nAnd the freeze on income tax thresholds is expected to bring 1.3 million more people into paying income tax - and a million more into paying at the higher rate.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Budget is set to raise an extra \u00a329bn by 2025-26, which was \"big by recent standards\".\nAnd it added that the UK's tax \"burden\" is set to rise to its \"highest sustained level\" ever.\nIFS director Paul Johnson said: \"Mr Sunak made much of his desire to be honest and to level with the British people.\n\"The fact that he felt constrained to raise taxes by hitting companies and through freezing allowances, rather than through more explicit rises in people's taxes, suggests there are limits to how far he wants to level with us, as he attempts to raise the overall tax burden to its highest sustained level in history.\"\nThere has been a lot of give, and there will be a lot of take.\nBusiness will, in time, pay billions more. More than a million people will have to start paying income tax, and a million extra will pay at a higher level.\nThe deeply strange circumstances of the pandemic have turned the party with a theoretical love of low taxes into a government that will crank them up significantly in practice.\n\"Honest Rishi Sunak\", as he hopes to be represented, has chosen his determination to start dealing with the cost of Covid over the Tories' traditional backing for low taxes.\nBoxed in by election promises, he has chosen two huge future money raisers.\nDespite those hikes, and the hundreds of billions spent on Covid, public spending overall is still set to contract.\nThe chancellor extended the furlough scheme to September, paying up to 80% of people's wages - and announced further grants for self-employed people, with the scheme widened to include 600,000 who were not previously entitled, including many newly self-employed people.\nHe also extended the \u00a320-a-week top-up to universal credit for six months.\nOther Budget measures include:\nAll alcohol duties will be frozen, which Mr Sunak said would help pubs and restaurants recover, and there will be no increase in fuel duty. But duty on cigarettes will go up by 2%, plus inflation.\nThe reduced 5% VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector will be extended for six months to 30 September, and will not return to the full standard rate of 20% until April next year.\nMr Sunak also announced that 750 civil service jobs at the Treasury will be transferred to Darlington, in the north-east of England, and there will be more than \u00a31bn shared out among 45 struggling towns in England.\nAt a post-Budget Downing Street press conference, Mr Sunak vowed to protect people and businesses \"well beyond the end of lockdown\", and to build a \"fairer and more just\" country in the memory of those who have lost their lives to coronavirus.\nIt comes as the latest government figures on Wednesday showed a further 315 people had died with coronavirus in the UK within 28 days of a coronavirus diagnosis, and there were another 6,385 confirmed cases.\nMr Sunak hit back at critics who say the business tax hike will choke off recovery, saying it will \"still be the lowest out of the G7 economies,\" including the US, France and Germany.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget did nothing to \"fix the NHS and social care\", reduce inequality or create more affordable homes.\n\"The scale of what the chancellor announced today is nowhere near ambitious enough,\" he told MPs, and he claimed Mr Sunak was \"itching to get back to his free-market principles and to pull away support as quickly as he can\".\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said furlough should be in kept place \"as long as businesses and devolved governments need it\".\n\"This Budget is carefully laying the ground for more Tory austerity, a decade more of Conservative cuts,\" he told MPs.\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine warned that the universal credit top-up will end at the same time as furlough, meaning people could lose their jobs and not receive the extra help they will need.\nPlaid Cymru said it was a \"Budget of half measures and quick fixes\", and not making the universal credit uplift permanent would \"lead to 26,000 families in Wales not being able to afford essentials in six months' time\".\nHow will you be affected by this year's Budget?

      "tags": "Toronto,Canada,Toronto van attack",
      "text": "A Canadian man who killed 10 people by ploughing a van into pedestrians in Toronto has been found guilty on all 26 charges related to the 2018 attack. \nAlek Minassian had admitted the attack, but his lawyers argued he was not criminally responsible due to his autism spectrum disorder. \nJustice Anne Malloy has dismissed this claim, saying the attack was the \"act of a reasoning mind\".\nMinassian faced 10 charges of murder and 16 charges of attempted murder. \nThroughout the ruling, Justice Malloy refused to name the attacker, 28, referring to him instead as John Doe, and said she would not give him the notoriety \"he sought from the start\". \nMs Malloy accepted his diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but ruled that he was capable of understanding his actions on April 2018 were both legally and morally wrong. \nAt trial, defence lawyer Boris Bytensky said ASD had left his client without the ability to develop empathy, saying in closing arguments the attacker had no conception of the damage his actions caused. \nOn Wednesday, Justice Malloy rejected this line of argument. \n\"Lack of empathy for the suffering of victims, even an incapacity to empathise for whatever reason, does not constitute a defence,\" she said.\nMinassian rented the van some three weeks before he used it as a weapon on a major Toronto street. He told investigators he had set out to kill as many people as possible and that he drew inspiration from the misogynistic \"incel\" movement of mostly online groups of young men who blame their lack of sexual activity on women.\nAsked by investigators how he felt about the harm he had caused, the attacker replied: \"I feel like I accomplished my mission\".  \nWitnesses described seeing a white van mount the pavement on Toronto's busy Yonge Street on 23 April 2018 and run down pedestrians. Victims of the attack ranged in age from 22 to 94.\nDelivering the verdict on Wednesday, Justice Malloy said the killer had selected the van with a particular goal in mind - picking a vehicle small enough to be mobile, but large enough to inflict \"maximum damage\". \nMinassian was arrested shortly after crashing the van near the scene of the attack.\nHis victims included 80-year-old grandmother Dorothy Sewell, 45-year-old single mother Renuka Amarasinghe and Ji Hun Kim, 22, a student from South Korea."

      "tags": "Israel & the Palestinians,Israel,Palestinian territories,Gaza,International Criminal Court,West Bank",
      "text": "The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor has opened a formal investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories.\nFatou Bensouda said the probe would cover events in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip since June 2014.\nLast month, the Hague-based court ruled that it could exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the territories.\nIsrael rejected Ms Bensouda's decision, while Palestinian officials praised it.\nThe US expressed disappointment and opposition to the move.\nThe ICC has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes on the territory of states party to the Rome Statute, its founding treaty.\nIsrael has never ratified the Rome Statute, but the court ruled that it had jurisdiction because the United Nations secretary general accepted the Palestinians' accession to the treaty in 2015.\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians claim the territories for a future independent state.\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, Ms Bensouda explained that her office was obliged to act \"where a state party has referred a situation\" to it and \"it is determined that a reasonable basis exists to commence an investigation\". \nMs Bensouda said she had carried out a \"painstaking preliminary examination\" that lasted close to five years and promised that the investigation would be conducted independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favour.\n\"We have no agenda other than to meet our statutory duties under the Rome Statute with professional integrity,\" she said, noting that she had declined to investigate the 2010 killing by Israeli troops of 10 Turkish activists on the Gaza-bound ship Mavi Marmara.\n\"In the current situation, however, there is a reasonable basis to proceed and there are admissible potential cases,\" she added.\nMs Bensouda, who will be succeeded by British prosecutor Karim Khan in June, also stressed that the \"central concern must be for the victims of crimes, both Palestinian and Israeli, arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides\".\nThe prosecutor's decision came moments before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's glitzy online election campaign launch.\nHe used the stage to give an excoriating response, saying the probe was an anti-Semitic attack on the only Jewish state. \nThis approach will continue in public - to undermine the court itself. Behind the scenes though, concerned officials are working to offset, delay and limit its impact. They will try to show that Israel can investigate itself and that an outgoing prosecutor is tying her successor's hands.\nThey will roll out a plan - understood to be no-expense-spared - to minimise the chance of any future arrest of officers or politicians abroad. Israel's defence minister has acknowledged that \"hundreds\", including himself, could be at risk, adding: \"We will take care of everybody.\"\nAnd they will rely on the US and other allies for backing. But the level of rhetoric suggests Israel's leadership feels increasingly worried by the progress of the case.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the ICC's decision was \"the essence of anti-Semitism and the essence of hypocrisy.\"\n\"It found that our brave and moral soldiers, who are fighting the most brutal terrorists on earth, are, of all people, war criminals.\"\n\"The court, which was established to prevent a recurrence of the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jewish people, is now turning against the state of the Jewish people,\" he asserted.\nUS State Department spokesman Ned Price criticised the decision.\n\"We firmly oppose and are disappointed by the ICC prosecutor's announcement of an investigation into the Palestinian situation,\" he said, adding the US \"will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security including by opposing actions that seek to target Israel unfairly\".\nPalestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said: \"The crimes committed by the leaders of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people - which are ongoing, systematic and widespread - make this investigation necessary and urgent.\" \nThe militant Hamas movement, which controls Gaza, welcomed the decision as \"step forward on the path of achieving justice\", while also defending its actions as \"legitimate resistance\".\nCampaign group Human Rights Watch said \"all eyes\" would be on incoming prosecutor Karim Khan to \"pick up the baton\", and that \"ICC member countries should stand ready to fiercely protect the court's work from any political pressure\". \nMs Bensouda's preliminary examination is believed to have focused on issues such as Israeli military operations in Gaza and the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank - which most of the international community consider illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\nWhen the Palestinians asked to accede to the Rome Statute, they recognised ICC jurisdiction for the purpose of prosecuting alleged perpetrators of crimes from 13 June 2014 onwards. \nThat is one month before a war erupted between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. In the fighting, 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, were killed while on the Israeli side 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed.\nFollowing the preliminary examination, Ms Bensouda said there was a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes were committed in the context of the war, and that charges could be filed against Israel Defense Forces (IDF) personnel and members of Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups.\nThe prosecutor also concluded that there was a reasonable basis to believe that in the context of Israel's occupation of the West Bank, members of the Israeli authorities had committed war crimes."

      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Budget 2021,Coronavirus pandemic,Stamp duty in the United Kingdom",
      "text": "Chancellors typically view Budgets as political theatre - a moment to set the tone as they show off their wisdom, generosity and vision for the future.  \nBut when Rishi Sunak lays out the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday it will not be him taking centre stage, but the ongoing crisis engulfing the nation's health and finances. \nThe government has borrowed a record \u00a3270bn so far fighting the pandemic and has to come up with a way of paying it back. But it also needs to continue supporting the millions still out of work or on furlough due to lockdown.\nAhead of the speech, Mr Sunak has promised more money for the vaccination rollout;  a \u00a35bn scheme to help High Street businesses reopen; and a mortgage guarantee scheme to help first-time buyers.\nBut he's warned of tough economic times ahead and there are reports that he plans to raise some taxes.\nHere are five things to look out for in Wednesday's speech:\nThe chancellor has already said he \"is preparing a Budget that provides support for people\" as unemployment hovers at a five-year high and four million workers are on furlough. \nOn Wednesday, he is set to announce the furlough support scheme will be extended until the end of September, with employers asked to contribute to workers' salaries from July.\nFrom then, employers will be expected to contribute 10%, increasing to 20% in August and September, as the economy reopens.\nEmployees will continue to receive 80% of their salary for hours not worked until the scheme ends.\nHe is also tipped to extend a \u00a320-per-week uplift to Universal Credit for six months, after intense pressure from MPs and charities to do more to help the poor get through the pandemic. \nSome want him to go further and make the uplift permanent - but the chancellor may resist as he struggles to get government borrowing under control.\nMr Sunak may have promised grants of up to \u00a318,000 to get businesses going again, but the bigger question is what he will do about business rates.\nMPs across the board say the tax, which is calculated using the value of a company's premises, is unfair and outdated. The boss of Next, Lord Simon Wolfson, recently told the BBC that a huge number of shops will have to close unnecessarily.high streets could if rates aren't reformed. \nThe chancellor is likely to leave the thorny question of what to do about rates - including levying a so called \"Amazon tax\" on online retailers - until the autumn. \nHowever, reports suggest he will extend the business rates holiday - brought in last year to support shops - beyond its current end date of 31 March and into the summer.\nDespite the anticipated generosity, the chancellor has said he will use the Budget to \"level\" with the public about the challenges facing the economy and the need to repay the vast sums of public money spent during the crisis. \nAccording to reports, Mr Sunak is likely to announce some tax increases - although whatever he does will have to fit around with the Conservative party manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. \nSome think he will instead raise corporation tax from its current level of 19% to 23%, which is still below the G7 average. The rise would be staggered over the course of the parliament, reportedly bringing in \u00a312bn.\nThere are also rumours he will freeze the personal income tax allowance, which usually rises in line with inflation, pushing many taxpayers into higher bands and netting HMRC about \u00a36bn.\nTory backbenchers are strongly opposed to tax rises, while the Labour leader Keir Starmer has warned they risk \"choking off\" a rapid economic recovery.\nBut ex-Conservative leader Lord Hague has said \"personal and business\" taxes must rise to help government finances.\nThe chancellor is likely to set out his vision for a post-Covid (and post-Brexit) economy, which could mean more money for \"levelling up\" different parts of the UK.\nAccording to the Financial Times, he is preparing to announce the locations of freeports - special economic zones with low taxes that would help stimulate regional growth.\nHe's also expected to announce more funding to help the UK meet its decarbonisation goals. \nThere are likely to be measures to promote more environmentally friendly homes and renewable energy - but he is not expected to raise fuel duty. \nThe stamp duty holiday introduced last year not only propped up the housing market at the start of the crisis, but also drove up the average value of a home by 8.5% in 2020.\nThat tax break is up at the end of March, and many buyers have found themselves facing big bills if they don't complete their transactions on time. However, Mr Sunak will extend stamp duty holiday to prevent this cliff edge, reports suggest. \nThe government mortgage guarantee scheme will offer 95% mortgages for houses worth up to \u00a3600,000. \nIt is based on the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, which closed to new loans at the end of 2016. \nThis is a policy that the Treasury says \"reinvigorated the market for high loan-to-value lending after the 2008 financial crisis\".\nBut housing charity Shelter said that scheme increased house prices by 1.4%, making housing less affordable for many.

      "tags": "NI Brexit,Brandon Lewis,Brexit",
      "text": "The EU says a UK move to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks will be a breach of international law.\nNorthern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures.\nThe grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied.\nThe first of these periods will expire at the end of March, but the UK has said it will be extended until October.\nEuropean Commission Vice President Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the move amounted to \"a violation of the relevant substantive provisions\" of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, known as the NI Protocol.\nHe said the EU would respond in accordance with the \"legal means\" established by the protocol and the wider Brexit deal.\nFollowing a call on Wednesday evening between Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d and Lord Frost, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for EU relations, a UK government spokesperson said \"official-level notification\" of the move was made to the commission earlier this week.\nThe spokesperson said Lord Frost underlined the extension was needed for \"operational reasons\" and such measures were \"well precedented in other international trade arrangements, and that they were entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the Protocol in good faith\".\nIrish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the UK government's move clearly undermined its commitment to the implementation of the protocol and described the unilateral decision as \"deeply unhelpful\".\nHe said he had made his regret over the decision clear to Lord Frost and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis.\nThe grace period affects supermarkets and other retailers, which face having to provide export health certificates for all shipments of animal products.\n\"For supermarkets and their suppliers, as part of the operational plan the UK committed to at the UK-EU Joint Committee on 24 February, the current Scheme for Temporary Agri-food Movements to Northern Ireland will continue until 1 October,\" said a government statement.\n\"Certification requirements will then be introduced in phases alongside the roll out of the Digital Assistance Scheme.\"\nIt is understood the government is describing this to the EU as an \"operational easement\", rather than a formal extension of the grace period.\nIt is using the example of how the Irish government temporarily relaxed safety and security declarations on products arriving from GB in January.\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \nIt does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.\nThat has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\nUnionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union.\nBut anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the move and said the EU had refused to deal with an issue that \"would have caused a huge amount of problems for us at our ports\".\nThe DUP leader added that it showed the UK government \"can go further, so we need to see permanent solutions\". \nHowever, her deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill, described the government's decision as \"another unilateral attempt to override what has been agreed\". \n\"What everyone should be focused on is achieving agreement to find solutions to the issues that are outstanding, but it's very clear the protocol must be made to work.\"\nSimon Hoare, the chairman of Westminster's NI Affairs Select Committee, tweeted that the case for extending the grace periods was \"compelling\" but that the unilateral move struck him as an \"approach most likely to have negative/unhelpful consequences\". \nThe Labour Party's shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the Prime Minister should \"show some responsibility and find the lasting solutions with the EU that are the only way to give businesses the certainty they are crying out for\". \nIn Northern Ireland, reaction has been mixed, with Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry welcoming the extension of grace periods but warning of \"long-term detrimental consequences for Northern Ireland\" over the government's unilateral action. \nUlster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken, meanwhile, described the protocol as \"unsalvageable\" and criticised the EU and Irish government for reacting in a \"dramatic, over-the-top manner to what are minimal changes\".\n\"Simon Coveney and his EU counterparts are showing gravity-defying levels of arrogance and hypocrisy, given their past actions,\" he added. \nThe government said further guidance will be provided later this week on a grace period for parcel movements from GB to NI.\nIt is due to to end on 1 April, meaning all parcels would need customs declarations.\nGuidance will also be set out in regard to the issue of soil attached to the movement of plants, seeds, bulbs, vegetables and agricultural machinery.\nUnder the terms of the Brexit deal, soil from Great Britain is not permitted to enter Northern Ireland as it conflicts with EU plant regulations."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Alex Salmond inquiry,Alex Salmond case,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish Parliament,SNP (Scottish National Party)",
      "text": "For 10 years Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon showed how to be a successful political duo. They campaigned hard, won elections and brought to the fore a shared dream of Scottish independence. That irresistible combo is gone, having given way to personal silences and a public war of words. As MSPs continue investigating the Scottish government's mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond, we look at their story.\nAs the clock ticked past midday, I waited in the first minister's walnut panelled office for Nicola Sturgeon to give her first interview on the scandal.\nIt was Friday 24 August 2018 - the day the Daily Record splashed on allegations of sexual misconduct made against her predecessor, Alex Salmond.\nThe first minister was said to be so upset that her advisers worried she might cry on camera.\nWhen it came to it, Nicola Sturgeon kept her composure but there was clear emotion in the interview that followed. Her voice wavered slightly when she told me how \"incredibly difficult\" the situation was.\nAt about the time she was speaking to me, Alex Salmond was telling journalists gathered around a Linlithgow pub table that while he was \"no saint\" he had not harassed anyone.\nThe Scottish government had investigated complaints about him from two civil servants, under a new procedure signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. That was not news to the first minister because Alex Salmond had told her privately about the investigation several months before.\nWhat then could have brought Scotland's leader close to tears?\nThis was, of course, a watershed moment when a private burden finally had to be shouldered in public. And, according to one source close to Nicola Sturgeon what was also significant was confirmation from the civil service that it had sufficient confidence in its investigation to refer the complaints to the police. That is said to have shattered the first minister's confidence in the denials Alex Salmond had given her.\nHaving controversially met or spoken to him five times during the investigation - in which she insists she played no part - she broke off contact with him in July.\nNicola Sturgeon's long standing alliance with her predecessor was in the process of breaking down and the day of the Daily Record scoop was probably when it became irretrievable. Alex Salmond was effectively at war with the government he once led and therefore with the woman who replaced him - his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Nicola Sturgeon.\nThere was a lot to cry about. \nThe Salmond/Sturgeon association spans three decades - she had backed him for the party leadership in 1990 and he encouraged her to stand for Westminster two years later, when she was just 21.\n\"He believed in me long before I believed in myself,\" she once said.\nAlex Salmond was a mentor, ally and friend. You could trace his influence in her early speaking style and in the way she sometimes scoffed at rivals during debate.\nHe appointed her to the SNP front bench when they were both elected to Holyrood in 1999. However, a little over a year into the new parliament Alex Salmond gave up the leadership, passing the reins to John Swinney. When he resigned in 2004 Nicola Sturgeon made her move for the top party job.\nThe then 34-year-old entered the contest, but when it looked like she would lose to rival Roseanna Cunningham Alex Salmond came to the rescue. His decision to make a leadership comeback saved her from defeat. Instead, she became a winner, running as his deputy on what they styled as a joint ticket.\nThis was the beginning of the powerful political partnership that has dominated Scottish politics and made a big impact on the UK political scene in the early part of this century. They led the SNP into government for the first time in 2007, to an overall majority at Holyrood in 2011 and within touching distance of independence in 2014.\nThey worked well together. Not least because Alex Salmond tended to let Nicola Sturgeon and other trusted ministers do their jobs without interference. As his deputy, her skills and personality seemed to complement his. Where he revelled in the spotlight, she was more naturally reserved. While he enjoyed painting the big picture, she was content to fill in the detail.\nThey offered each other advice and challenge in private, and presented a united front in public - a discipline upon which the SNP's success was built.\nThat's not to say there were no disagreements. When the NHS faced a budget squeeze after the financial crash, Nicola Sturgeon took a stand. According to one Alex Salmond ally, she \"pushed very hard\" to protect cash spending and won the first minister's support. Had she failed, another source said, she was prepared to resign.\nNicola Sturgeon's confidence grew further during the independence campaign. From 2012, she took charge of referendum preparations as the Scottish government's so called \"Yes\" minister. It was during this period that she started coming into her own, establishing an approach that was distinct from his.\nContrast, for example, the responses they gave to protests by independence supporters against the BBC. Alex Salmond defended those involved, arguing they must be allowed to express a view. Nicola Sturgeon advised that they spend their time campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote rather than against the BBC.\nWhere he could be strident, she was more pragmatic is how one source close to Alex Salmond put it.\nWhile their relationship remained strong throughout the referendum there were points of tension.\nNicola Sturgeon was frustrated not to be involved in Alex Salmond's preparation for his first debate with the pro-Union leader Alistair Darling. The head-to-head, hosted by STV, saw Alex Salmond struggle with currency questions.\nWhen he set off for China in November 2013 without leaving detailed comments on the latest draft of the independence White Paper, her team questioned his commitment. The first minister's feedback would eventually filter through from the People's Republic.\nNone of this caused a serious rift between them - that would come later, once Alex Salmond had left office.\nOn 18 September 2014 the independence vote was lost by 55% to 45% and within two months of that date Alex Salmond was gone as party leader and first minister.\nAs Nicola Sturgeon prepared to take over, she acknowledged Alex Salmond had left \"big boots to fill\".\nHowever, she also asserted her political independence. \"I will wear my own shoes\" she said \"and they will have higher heels\".\nShe promised a more female friendly-leadership that would give priority to key issues of gender equality and seek to advance the interests of women. That's a pledge that may have weighed heavily as she thought of her response to the #MeToo movement a few years later.\nThe key point about this transfer of power is that it fundamentally changed this political couple's relationship. She was no longer the understudy, she was now the principal performer.\nThe new first minister travelled the country, addressing large audiences in what became known as her \"rock star tour\" and under her leadership the SNP won spectacularly at the 2015 Westminster election. \nBy contrast, Alex Salmond's political power was on the wane. He could have pursued a career in business, academia or on the lecture circuit but he could not resist the pull of politics.\nAs part of the 2015 landslide, he returned to Westminster, as MP for Gordon, in search of a new role. The party appointed him international affairs spokesman with a certain licence to stir things up. Friends said it was difficult for him to adjust. According to one MP, he did not take kindly to no longer driving the bus.\nWhen Alex Salmond publicly suggested a referendum might not be the only route to independence, the new driver asserted her authority. Nicola Sturgeon made clear that winning a referendum was now the established way to leave the UK.\nWithin a few months of replacing him, Nicola Sturgeon dropped Alex Salmond's policy of a blanket 3p cut to corporation tax in the event of independence. He was not consulted. He was, however, brought into the loop for some decisions, such as the ill-fated call for indyref2 in early 2017.\nThey were still in touch but nothing like as much as when they were partners in power. With one at Westminster and the other at Holyrood, they saw each other less and were gradually drifting apart.\nThe relationship deteriorated more seriously after the 2017 general election which saw Alex Salmond defeated for the first time in 30 years of parliamentary service.\nWhen Nicola Sturgeon phoned to offer her commiserations, she found Alex Salmond unavailable. It was, apparently, two or three weeks before they spoke.\nAlex Salmond was dealing with the death of his father around that time as well as the loss of his parliamentary seat. But there was something else.\nA friend of his said he was \"not very impressed\" with the SNP's election campaign, considering it insubstantial and lacking in energy and purpose. The party lost 21 of its 56 seats in this first election after the Brexit referendum and the Scottish Conservatives won 13 - enough to sustain Theresa May in office with help from the DUP.\nIf that was one source of tension in Alex Salmond's relationship with his successor, others soon emerged as he began a new career outside politics. Appearing in his own show at the Edinburgh Fringe, Alex Salmond was accused of sexism when he explained the absence of any high profile female guests with the double entendre that he \"couldn't make them come\".\nNicola Sturgeon said he was \"not sexist\" just as she had done two years earlier when Alex Salmond told Conservative minister, Anna Soubry in the Commons to \"behave yourself woman\". The first minister's defence of her predecessor was more qualified this time. She said he was not always as funny as he thought and that perhaps his joke belonged in the era of Benny Hill.\nIt was apparent to some in the SNP that she was wearying of him. As one MP put it, he was \"seen as a nuisance\" by the leadership during 2017.\nThe lowest point came in November of that year, when it was announced that Alex Salmond was to host his own show on the Kremlin-backed TV station, RT. Nicola Sturgeon has since spoken of her \"incredulity\" at this decision. It would increase the distance between them. As one Nicola Sturgeon ally put it - \"the first minister cannot take advice from a presenter on Russian state TV\".\nThe week before Alex Salmond's TV show was announced, SNP MSP Mark McDonald was forced to resign as a Holyrood minister over inappropriate behaviour. \nThe Scottish government's wider response to the #MeToo movement, following this departure, would set these political titans on a collision course. There was speculation that if Mr McDonald stood down, Alex Salmond might want to fight the Aberdeen Donside by-election.\nAccording to friends of Alex Salmond that was wrong - he had no interest in making another Holyrood comeback and Nicola Sturgeon's team did not take it seriously either. Even if they found him annoying, they did not appear to regard him as a political threat. They would not however have been unaware that Alex Salmond had helped nurture new talent at Westminster, including the QC turned MP, Joanna Cherry, whom some see as a future leader.\nWhat appeared to be of concern to team Sturgeon in November 2017 was an enquiry from Sky News about allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Alex Salmond at Edinburgh Airport. He denied wrongdoing and nothing was broadcast at the time, but according to a later account from Nicola Sturgeon, it raised suspicions about her predecessor's conduct.\nOn the first minister's instruction, the Scottish government was revising its procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying and harassment against ministers, following Mr McDonald's resignation. Nicola Sturgeon specifically told the civil service that the new policy could apply to former ministers and she put that in writing after the Sky News enquiry.\nThis note was sent after her private secretary met a potential complainer against Alex Salmond from within the civil service. The Scottish government insists the first minister did not know about that.\nSupporters of Alex Salmond suspected the new policy was designed with him in mind, however, the Scottish government rejects that claim. What is clear is that Nicola Sturgeon chose an approach that would not exempt her predecessor.\nHad she decided otherwise, there might never have been a scandal. Alternatively, one might have blown up in the media anyway and she might have faced criticism for protecting an old friend.\nComplaints of sexual harassment against Alex Salmond from two female civil servants were lodged and a seven month investigation by the Scottish government followed. Those findings were shelved when the 66-year-old successfully challenged the complaints handling process in court. It decided the investigation was \"tainted by apparent bias\" and he was awarded more than \u00a3500,000 in legal costs.\nBut the former first minister faced a much bigger legal battle ahead.\nIn January 2019, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was arrested and charged with a string of sexual offences against women he had worked with at the Scottish government or the SNP, during his term as first minister.\nWhen he looked at the names on the charge sheet - according to a Salmond ally - \"that was when it hit him\" that this could be a conspiracy.\nOne of those who testified against him in court has since told the BBC that it is \"utterly absurd\" to suggest nine women would perjure themselves as part of a political plot. Their evidence did not persuade a jury to convict and on 23 March last year - hours before the UK went into coronavirus lockdown - he was acquitted of the 13 sexual assault charges he faced.\nAlex Salmond is now trying to expose what he believes was a conspiracy, accusing Nicola Sturgeon of multiple rule breaches including misleading the Scottish Parliament. She denies his claims.\nTheir toxic feud has destroyed their relationship and caused deep divisions within the SNP. It also threatens damage to the first minister's reputation and to the independence dream she still shares with Alex Salmond. While she seems confident of weathering the storm, her credibility has hardly been enhanced by the revisions she's made to her story along the way. \nFor example, having told Holyrood she learned about the investigation into Alex Salmond directly from him, she now acknowledges that \"allegations of a sexual nature\" were mentioned at a meeting she had days earlier and claims to have forgotten. \nExactly what did she know and when, what meetings were held and why, where does party business end and government business begin? These are the questions being picked over by a committee of MSPs at Holyrood.\nThe inescapable point is that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon cannot both be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as they are obliged to do under oath before the committee.\nWhat started three years ago with complaints about the former first minister's behaviour has led to intense scrutiny of Nicola Sturgeon's conduct in handling those complaints. If Alex Salmond can prove his allegations, a clamour for her resignation will follow - ironically at a time when her party and its goal of independence are polling strongly.\nIf his claims are not proven, he is unlikely to give up the fight. Some of his supporters have called for him to be readmitted to the SNP. Others hope that he will stand in this May's Holyrood election for one of the newly formed independence parties.\nWhile those who know him well think that unlikely, they note he has not publicly ruled it out. As one MP put it \"you just never know what Alex is going to do next\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Tax,UK economy,UK national debt,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "As the country starts to emerge from lockdown, the impact it has had on the economy is becoming clearer.\nThe damage is enormous, but not as bad as feared last year, partly because the vaccines have been so effective.\nThe government has had to spend many billions of pounds to fight coronavirus and protect the economy. The lockdown has reduced the amount of money the government raises in taxes.\nThis has meant the government has had to borrow huge sums of money. \nIn the first year of the pandemic, from April 2020 to 2021, it borrowed \u00a3299bn, the highest figure since records began in 1946.\nThe government is expected to borrow less in the current year, April 2021 to 2022, though the figure could still be more than \u00a3200bn.\nOver \u00a3100bn is being spent on support for jobs, such as the furlough scheme, where the government steps in to pay most of workers' wages.\nThe NHS and other public services have been given extra money to pay for the costs of fighting the pandemic.\nHowever, the pandemic has reduced the amount the government raises in tax. \nUnemployed or furloughed workers pay less income tax, businesses pay less tax if their profits are lower, and shoppers pay less VAT if they buy fewer things.\nWith more money going out and less coming in, the government has only one option - to borrow.\nThe pandemic will still mean more government spending and less tax coming in for years to come. \nAll of this means more borrowing.  \nNo-one knew how the pandemic would affect the economy so all predictions were full of uncertainty.\nIn recent months, however, the government has been borrowing less than expected as the economy starts to reopen. It has borrowed \u00a353bn this year, \u00a314bn less than forecast in March. \nAlso far fewer people will lose their jobs in the pandemic than had been feared.\nThe government cannot keep borrowing at this level forever, so it must find a way to cut spending or increase taxes. \nBefore it was elected in 2019, the government promised not to raise the rates of the three biggest taxes - income tax, National Insurance or value added tax. \nHowever, in March the chancellor announced measures which will increase most people's tax bills next year. \nThe amount you can earn without paying tax - known as the personal allowance - will stay the same from 2022 to 2026, instead of the usual small increases.\nThe amount people can earn before paying 40% instead of 20% will also be frozen. \nBusinesses will also pay more tax, as the rate of tax on their profits - corporation tax - will rise from 19% to 25% in 2023. \nSpending in some areas, such as schools and the NHS, has been protected - and it would be difficult to reduce health spending after a pandemic. \nState pensions, another big spending item, are protected by the so-called triple lock, which guarantees they rise with workers' earnings, prices, or 2.5% every year - whichever is highest. \nThe Conservatives promised to keep this, but earnings are rising very fast as they bounce back after the pandemic, which could make it a very expensive pledge to honour next year.\nLast year, the chancellor announced some measures to reduce public spending, such as a controversial decision to freeze pay for many public sector workers.\nHe also cut the amount the UK spends on overseas aid, despite an election pledge to keep it at 0.7% of national income.\nUntil recently, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which has made its debt more affordable.\nAt the moment it pays just 0.77% interest to borrow for 10 years. \nIt's still low but interest rates have been rising recently - and the higher they go, the harder it will be to support the UK's debt burden.\nAnd in any case, interest payments will weigh on future generations until the debt is paid off, meaning there is less money available for public services, or tax cuts."

      "text": "More pupils in Wales could be back in class before Easter, but there will not be a full return to school, the education minister has said.\nSchools will be able to welcome pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 for \"check-in\" sessions before they are due back fully from mid-April.\nKirsty Williams said falling Covid case rates meant pupils could return \"earlier\".\nBut teaching unions warned the return must not lead to schools closing again.\nMs Williams said while there was \"no evidence to suggest widespread transmission in schools and colleges\", for the first time official advice means pupils and teachers will have to wear face coverings in class, if they cannot stay two metres apart.\nWales' youngest pupils began returning to the classroom on 22 February for the first time since before Christmas, when schools closed to almost all pupils due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nMinisters originally hoped all primary pupils, years 11 and 13, and some college students would return from 15 March, with flexibility for year 10 and 12, to return.\nThe Welsh Government then faced backlash after hinting non-essential shops could be reopened at an earlier date.\nNow schools will be allowed to decide whether to give 11 to 14-year-olds the \"opportunity\" to see teachers face-to-face before the Easter holidays begin, in a similar way to the check-in before last year's summer holidays.\nHowever this will depend on the scientific advice at the next review of Covid rules on 12 March.\nMs Williams, said the changes for pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 had been made possible by the latest scientific advice, which showed case rates heading \"in the right direction\". \nBut, she added, caution was still needed and Wales was not in a position to have a \"big bang approach\" to schools' return. \n\"We've been very clear that should the scientists give us the all clear to have more children back in school then we would grab that opportunity,\" she said.\n\"Thankfully, because of the massive efforts of the Welsh public, we are continuing to see case rates fall here in Wales, [Covid] positivity levels fall and pressure being taken off our NHS.\"\nParents will not be fined if they choose not to send their children to school, unless there are welfare concerns, new guidance states.\nWelcoming the decision, the Welsh Conservative's Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called the decision a \"u-turn\", while Plaid Cymru's Sian Gwenllian said support for virtual learning must continue.\nThe Scottish government also changed its plans on Tuesday, to allow all secondary pupils to return to school part-time before Easter.\nAll pupils in England are due to return to school from 8 March, which is also when a phased return begins in Northern Ireland.\nGareth Evans, director of education policy at University of Wales Trinity St David, said the announcement helped provide clarity for parents, who might have been wondering why it was not safe to return in Wales.\nMeanwhile, Hugh Davies, president of the Association of School and College Leaders in Wales, said there was concern the announcement would create an expectation from parents that their children would return before Easter.\nMr Davies, who is also head teacher at Olchfa Comprehensive School in Swansea, said: \"On one level flexibility is a good thing, one size doesn't fit all... but sometimes flexibility can also set up confusion in the minds of parents\".\nHe added: \"My fear is that just as we are beginning to focus our minds on coming out of the pandemic... suddenly parents will be conflicted and comparing one school with another... that's probably an unnecessary distraction at this point.\"\nOne teaching union said they were \"surprised by the proposed acceleration before the hard data exists to support it\".\n\"We have not had a full return of foundation phase across Wales yet and what we don't want is to see schools having to close again because we have brought in too many learners too quickly,\" said NAHT Cymru director Laura Doel.\nA change in guidance means secondary school pupils and teachers will now be told to wear face coverings in classrooms if social distancing cannot be maintained.\nUntil now they had only been required outside the classroom, such as in school corridors and canteens. Other safety measures include teachers being encouraged to open windows, and older pupils being offered asymptomatic testing.\nThe education minister had been criticised by some parents last week who said they were \"furious\" hairdressers, non-essential shops and tourism would reopen before their children could return to the classroom after Easter.\nNo firm dates have been set for relaxing lockdown measures in Wales, but a provisional roadmap suggests non-essential shops could reopen on 15 March.\nFaced with parents who said their children's futures were \"being ruined\", Ms Williams said scientists had advised pupils should go back gradually to stop a risk of case rates jumping significantly.\nMs Williams announced the proposed changes on Monday, saying the falling case rates meant schools could return \"further and faster\" than originally planned.\nJackie Parker, head teacher at Crickhowell High School, said the change meant children could have a day or two to see their friends and teachers before the holiday.\nBut she added: \"I think it is going to be a period of juggling. It may be different for different schools.\"\nBronwen Hughes, head teacher at Ysgol Maes Garmon in Mold, Flintshire, said it was important that teachers had the chance to \"check in and catch up\" with pupils to prepare them for their return.\n\"Practically, a part-time return means that we have to plan effectively,\" she said, adding parents needed to know exactly when pupils would be in.\n\"As long as we plan it well, assess our risks and prepare, the sessions years 7, 8 and 9 spend in school will be beneficial for them.\"\nEmma Safhill from St Asaph, Denbighshire, whose daughter is in Year 9, said having some in class time was \"better than nothing\".\n\"She confessed the other day she'd be pleased to go back, have some normality and see her friends,\" Ms Safhill added."

      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon has insisted she had no reason to want to \"get\" Alex Salmond as she dismissed claims of a plot against him as \"absurd\".\nThe first minister was speaking at the inquiry into her government's unlawful handling of harassment complaints against her predecessor. \nShe apologised to the two women who had made the complaints, saying they were let down by a \"very serious error\". \nBut she rejected much of Mr Salmond's version of events. \nAnd she insisted her government had nothing to hide, despite accusations of a cover-up from opposition parties.\nMr Salmond has previously claimed several people within the SNP and Scottish government - including Ms Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell, the party's chief executive - were involved in a \"deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort\" to damage his reputation, even to the extent of attempting to have him imprisoned. \nIn her eight hours of evidence to the committee, Ms Sturgeon said she had \"thought often\" about the impact of the past three years on Mr Salmond, but said he had shown no sign of thinking of others.\nShe said she had watched Mr Salmond give evidence to the inquiry committee last Friday and had found  herself \"searching for any sign at all that he recognised how difficult this had been for others too\".\nThe first minister added: \"First of all, for women who believed his behaviour towards them was inappropriate.\n\"But also for those of us who have campaigned alongside him, worked with him, cared for him, and consider him a friend - who now stand unfairly accused of plotting against him.\"\nMs Sturgeon acknowledged that Mr Salmond had been cleared of all of the sexual assault allegations against him by a High Court jury. \nBut she added: \"I know just from what he told me that his behaviour was not always appropriate.\n\"And yet across six hours of testimony, there was not a single word of regret, reflection or even a simple acknowledgement of that.\n\"I can only hope that in private, the reality might be different.\"\nThe first minister said the female complainers had come forward \"of their own free will\", and that while some offered support to each other, this was not evidence of a conspiracy. \nShe went on to tell the cross-party committee of MSPs that Mr Salmond had been one of the \"closest people to me in my entire life\".\nShe added: \"I would never have wanted to 'get' Alex Salmond - I would never, ever have wanted any of this to happen. I had no motive, intention or desire to 'get' Alex Salmond.\"\nThe inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants. \nMr Salmond used his evidence session last week to accuse his former protege of repeatedly misleading parliament, and said he had \"no doubt\" she had breached the ministerial code - which she denies.\nA separate inquiry headed by Irish lawyer James Hamilton is specifically looking at whether this was the case.\nMs Sturgeon is facing calls to quit from Scottish Conservatives after new documents released on Tuesday evening raised further questions about her involvement in the saga and appeared to back Mr Salmond's evidence. \nThey included government emails showing it continued a doomed legal fight with Mr Salmond despite its lawyers advising it was likely to lose. \nIt ended up paying Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000, on top of its own costs, after the investigation was found to have been unlawful and \"tainted with bias\" ahead of a judicial review.\nMs Sturgeon insisted that her meetings with lawyers had initially left her satisfied that the government was not \"in some way prolonging a judicial review that was dead in the water\".\nShe admitted that advice received shortly before it did finally admit defeat had been \"dreadful\" and \"catastrophic\", but said the government had taken a \"legally sound\" approach by then deciding to concede the case.\nLabour's Jackie Ballie said the legal advice had only been handed over at the \"11th hour\" after two votes in parliament and the threat of a no confidence vote in the deputy first minister, and complained that some documents had not been provided. \nThe committee has regularly complained that its work was being obstructed by the government, with SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, who chairs the inquiry, saying that she shared Ms Baillie's frustration. \nMs Sturgeon insisted she had always acted \"properly and appropriately\" and there was \"no intention\" by the government to withhold information from the committee.\nMs Sturgeon was questioned at length about claims the name of a complainer was passed to Mr Salmond while the meeting between a meeting between the two first ministers was being set up.\nMr Salmond said the name had been revealed to his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein, and two other former SNP employees - Kevin Pringle and Duncan Hamilton - have written to the committee to support his account.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that she had been given assurances that \"it did not happen in the way that has been described\".\nShe said she believed that Mr Salmond was already aware of the identities of the two complainers, and that Mr Hamilton and Mr Pringle were not present at the meeting in question.\nShe said she was prevented from going into more detail due to legal constraints, but added: \"I understand evidence has been given to this committee that denies that allegation, and I believe there has been an offer of confidential evidence as well.\"\nAs Ms Sturgeon was speaking, Mr Salmond's spokesman released a statement saying he had lodged a formal complaint with Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, about \"the conduct of the official who is alleged to have breached civil service rules by disclosing the name of a complainant.\"\nThe view in Nicola Sturgeon's team tonight is there was no knock-out blow - no truly dreadful moment for the first minister. They seem pretty happy with her performance in eight long hours of questions. \nThere are still outstanding questions; the most significant of which is whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. \nThe committee will provide an answer - but perhaps more significant is the view of James Hamilton, the Irish lawyer heading a separate inquiry into the issue. The view in Bute House is that his report will be hard to ignore. \nThe political debate over this is likely to continue in the coming days too. Ms Sturgeon's political opponents still believe her account is muddled and inconsistent. \nThen there's Alex Salmond. He's sent documents to the committee today to support his evidence last week. Might we hear more from him in the coming days?\nThe first minister had originally told parliament she first became aware of the specific allegations against Mr Salmond when she met him in her Glasgow home on 2 April 2018.\nBut she subsequently claimed to have \"forgotten\" about an earlier meeting with his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her Scottish Parliament office on 29 March when she says she was told \"in general terms\" that a \"harassment-type issue had arisen.\"\nSome committee members expressed scepticism that Ms Sturgeon could genuinely forget about such a meeting.\nMs Sturgeon said she had not taken an official record of her two meetings with Mr Salmond in her home because she thought this could \"potentially compromise the confidentiality\" of the complaints process.\nShe said if a meeting with Mr Salmond appeared in a diary then questions could be asked about it, and that there would be more risk to the complaints process if she told people within government that she was aware it was ongoing.\nAnd she said she did not agree with Mr Salmond's assertion that there had been a \"shared understanding\" ahead of the meeting as to what was to be discussed - which would suggest she knew in advance about the allegations against him.\nMs Sturgeon also denied claims that she had told Mr Salmond she would be willing to intervene in the case if necessary\nBut she said Mr Salmond had been a \"long-standing friend and colleague\", and she had therefore tried to let him down gently when he made the request  - and accepted that she may not have been frank enough.\nThe first minister added: \"I did not intend to intervene, and I did not intervene, and while I know it is more complex than this, I think in terms of his anger towards me I think that is the root of it with Mr Salmond.\"\nThe first minister also insisted that the complaints procedure was not put in place to target Mr Salmond, as some of his supporters have claimed. \nShe told the committee that she was not aware of any allegations or concerns about sexually inappropriate behaviour on the part of Mr Salmond until a media enquiry from Sky News was made in November 2017. \nMs Sturgeon also insisted that details of the allegations against Mr Salmond that were leaked to the Daily Record newspaper - which broke the story in August 2018 - had not come from her or from anyone acting on her authority or instruction.\nMs Sturgeon finished her evidence by admitting that mistakes had been made - but dismissed suggestions from Mr Salmond that this was because Scotland's leadership and institutions had failed.\nShe added: \"Actually what comes out of it is the message that no matter how powerful you are or were, no matter your status or connections, if you are accused of serious offences they will be investigated and you will have the chance to defend yourself in court. That is how these things should work.\n\"The idea that because somebody doesn't like what has happened over the last couple of years we allow this attack to be made on the fundamentals of our democracy I find deeply distressing and deeply unfair.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross claimed that the abiding memory of the evidence session would be Ms Sturgeon repeatedly saying \"I can't recall\". \nHe added: \"She dodged and evaded almost every difficult question. The first minister vividly remembers the details she believes exonerate her, then forgets entirely anything that damages her.\"\nScottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie, who sits on the committee, said \"serious questions remain\" about the first minister's conduct. \nShe added: \"Quite frankly we are not much further forward in understanding her role in this catastrophic failure of the Scottish government.\n\"Most galling of all was the first minister's complete failure to understand the obstruction that this Committee has faced and continues to face. \n\"The first minister promised the committee that it would receive all the information that it needed - this now sounds like a bad joke.\""

      "tags": "Budget 2021,Trade",
      "text": "Plans to create eight new freeports in England include tax breaks for employers, the government has said.\nWhere will they be?\nFreeports are usually located around shipping ports, or airports. \nGoods that arrive into freeports from abroad are exempt from tax charges, called tariffs, that are normally paid to the government.\nThese taxes are only paid if the goods leave the freeport and are moved elsewhere in the UK. Otherwise, they are sent overseas without the charges being paid.\nThe UK had seven freeports between 1984 and 2012. Locations included Liverpool, Southampton and the Port of Tilbury.\nThe locations of England's eight new freeports were announced at the March 2021 Budget:\nIt is hoped freeports - which can be up to 45km (27 miles) across - will help regenerate deprived areas. \nIn England, companies inside the sites will be offered temporary tax breaks. These include reductions to the tax companies pay on their existing property, and when they buy new buildings.\nIn the Queen's Speech, on 11 May, the government confirmed that freeport employers will be able to pay less national insurance for all new workers, from April 2022.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own freeport policies. \nEighteen areas in England bid to become a freeport.\nOne of the most important considerations, according to the government, was how a freeport could bring economic opportunities to poorer regions and \"level up\" the country.\nMinisters say other factors - such as the impact of Covid-19 on local areas and ensuring freeports are \"spread fairly\" across England - were also taken into account.\nSupporters say freeports can help increase manufacturing, and encourage jobs and investment in areas that would otherwise struggle to attract them. \nBut opponents say they don't boost employment overall, and moving economic activity from one place to another comes at a cost to the taxpayer.\nLabour says firms inside freeports will not be able to take full advantage of post-Brexit trade deals and tariffs will have to be paid.\nThe Labour-led Welsh government says it has reservations about freeports, although it has not ruled out introducing them.\nThe SNP Scottish government - which has previously been critical of freeports - now plans to introduce its own scheme for Scotland, dubbed \"green ports\". \nExact details have not been set out, but bidders will be asked to promote \"sustainable\" growth, and pay the real living wage. \nThere are currently about 80 freeports dotted around the EU.\nNow that the UK has left the EU, some Brexit supporters say the UK can adopt a more generous freeport policy. For example, they say the government could give businesses more financial help.\nJonathan Branton, a partner at law firm DWF, says the UK does have more flexibility now it doesn't have to follow EU rules. \nHe also points out tax breaks offered to freeport firms would no longer require prior agreement from the European Commission.\nHowever, he adds that the Brexit trade deal - agreed by the UK and the EU - still requires subsidies to be justified, otherwise they could be challenged in UK courts.  \nIn more extreme circumstances, the EU could respond to UK subsidies by introducing tariffs on some UK goods deemed to be damaging EU trade or investment.\nAnd the UK will still be subject to World Trade Organization rules - which say you can't introduce subsidies linked just to export performance.\nThere are also questions over Northern Ireland, which still has to follow EU subsidy rules under the UK's withdrawal deal. \nTreasury Minister Steve Barclay has admitted the freeport model used in Great Britain will need to be \"adapted\" for Northern Ireland. \nNorthern Ireland's devolved government says it is working with the Treasury to find out how much of the model it will be able to follow.

      "text": "At least 38 people were killed in Myanmar on Wednesday in what the UN described as the \"bloodiest day\" since the coup took place a month ago.\nUN envoy to Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener said there was shocking footage coming out of the country.\nWitnesses said security forces opened fire with rubber and live bullets.\nMass protests and acts of civil disobedience have been seen across Myanmar since the military seized power on 1 February.\nProtesters have been calling for an end to military rule and the release of the country's elected government leaders - including Aung San Suu Kyi - who were overthrown and detained in the coup.\nThe coup and the violent suppression of protests that followed have led to international condemnation, which Myanmar's military has so far ignored.\nReacting to Wednesday's deaths, the UK called for a United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday, while the US said it was considering further action against Myanmar's military.\nThe latest violence comes a day after Myanmar's neighbours urged the military to exercise restraint.\nMs Schraner Burgener said at least 50 people had now been killed \"and many wounded\" since the coup began.\nShe said one video clip showed police beating an unarmed volunteer medical crew. Another showed a protester being shot and probably killed on the street, she said.\n\"I asked some weapons experts and they could verify to me, it's not clear but it seems that the police weapons like 9mm submachine guns, so live ammunition,\" she said.\nReports from inside Myanmar spoke of security forces opening fire on large crowds in a number of cities, including Yangon, with little warning.\nTwo boys, aged 14 and 17, were among those who were killed, Save the Children said. A 19-year-old woman was also said to be among the dead.\nAt least six people were reportedly shot dead during a protest in Monywa in central Myanmar. At least 30 others were wounded in the unrest, a local journalist told Reuters.\nA volunteer medic told AFP news agency in Myingyan that at least 10 people had been injured there. \"They fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds,\" they said.\n\"They didn't spray us with water cannon, [there was] no warning to disperse, they just fired their guns,\" one protester in the city told Reuters.\nIn Mandalay, a student protester told the BBC that demonstrators were killed near her house. \n\"I think around 10am or 10.30, police and soldiers came to that area and then they started to shoot at civilians. They didn't give any warning to the civilians. \n\"They just came out and they started to shoot. They used rubber bullets but they also used live bullets to kill civilians in a violent way.\"\nThe military has not commented on the reported deaths.\nAs world powers view Myanmar's crisis with growing unease, the country's military said it was ready to withstand sanctions and isolation after its coup, \nMs Schraner Burgener has urged the UN to take \"very strong measures\" against the generals. The UN envoy warned of such punitive action in a conversation with Myanmar's deputy military chief.\nIn response, \"the answer was: 'We have to learn to walk with only few friends',\" Ms Schraner Burgener told reporters in New York.\nNevertheless, more sanctions are being considered by Western countries, including the US.\nWednesday's violence left the US \"appalled\", State Department spokesman Ned Price said. He told reporters: \"We call on all countries to speak with one voice to condemn the brutal violence by the Burmese military against its own people.\"\nHe urged China, historically a close ally of Myanmar, to bring its influence to bear on the country's military.\nThe UN Security Council - an international peacekeeping body - has voiced concern over the situation, but stopped short of condemning the coup because of opposition by Russia and China, who view the matter as an internal affair.\nMeanwhile, Pope Francis called for dialogue to \"prevail over repression\".\nForeign ministers of neighbouring South East Asian nations held a special meeting on Tuesday about the situation in Myanmar. \nBut although they urged restraint, only some of the ministers pressed the military junta to release Ms Suu Kyi.\nMs Suu Kyi, 75, was seen for the first time since her detention earlier this week when she appeared in court via video link. \nThe military says it seized power because of alleged fraud in November's general elections, which saw Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party win a landslide victory.\nBut the military has provided no proof of these allegations - instead, it replaced the Election Commission and promised fresh polls in a year."

      "title": "Calls for Nicola Sturgeon to quit over Alex Salmond revelations",
      "text": "Nicola Sturgeon is facing calls to resign after new documents raised further questions about her involvement in the Alex Salmond saga.\nThe government has published emails showing it continued a doomed legal fight with Mr Salmond despite its lawyers advising it was likely to lose. \nFurther evidence from two other witnesses has also called into question Ms Sturgeon's version of events. \nScotland's first minster is to face an inquiry over the affair on Wednesday. \nThe Scottish Parliament set up a special committee to investigate the mishandling of sexual harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. MSPs heard from the former first minister last week and now it is Ms Sturgeon's turn.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there was \"no longer any doubt that Nicola Sturgeon lied to the Scottish Parliament and broke the ministerial code on numerous counts.\"\nHe added: \"No first minister can be allowed to mislead the Scottish people and continue in office, especially when they have tried to cover up the truth and abused the power of their office in the process.\n\"The weight of the evidence is overwhelming. Nicola Sturgeon must resign.\"  \nThe party, which had earlier published a dossier claiming Ms Sturgeon has breached the ministerial code up to 38 times, said it would be submitting a motion of no confidence in the first minister to the Scottish Parliament.\nLabour MSP Jackie Baillie said the new documents showed that the government's handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond had been \"indefensible\". \nBut the pro-independence Scottish Greens, who could hold the balance of power in any vote of confidence, said it was \"for the committee and the ministerial code inquiry to do the jobs they've been tasked with.\" \nThe Liberal Democrats said the new documents \"look very serious\" for the first minister, but added: \"She deserves her day to respond to these allegations before we decide what to do next.\"\nA spokesman for Ms Sturgeon said she would address the issues \"and much more besides\" at the Holyrood Committee on the Scottish government's Handling of Harassment Complaints.\nHe added: \"But to call a vote of no confidence in the middle of a pandemic, before hearing a single word of the first minister's evidence, is utterly irresponsible.\"\nThe first minister has denied breaching the ministerial code - the rules setting out how government ministers are expected to behave - and has said she is \"relishing\" the opportunity to put her side of the story forward at the inquiry.\nShe has also dismissed Mr Salmond's claims that people close to her - including her husband Peter Murrell, the SNP chief executive - had plotted against him as untrue.\nMs Sturgeon said there was no evidence to back up the allegations and has accused her predecessor of creating an \"alternative reality\". \nA raft of new documents published by the government on Tuesday evening included email advice it had received warning that it was likely to lose a judicial review of its handling of the complaints against Mr Salmond. \nEmails showed a senior lawyer was \"very concerned indeed\" about the case in October 2018, with the government's counsel urging it to admit defeat by 6 December.\nBut it did not do so until January 2019, when it had to pay Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than \u00a3500,000 - on top of its own costs - after admitting its investigation into the allegations had been unlawful.\nThis was because the civil servant tasked with investigating the complaints had already been in contact with the complainers.\nSenior lawyer Roddy Dunlop QC said on 31 October that this \"presents a very real problem indeed\",  as it could appear that the investigating officer was \"not eligible\".\nRelations with the external counsel worsened after a series of problems with bringing forward documents to the civil court, with the lawyers writing on 19 December that they had suffered \"extreme professional embarrassment\" and that the case was becoming \"unstatable\".\nBy 28 December the lawyers had threatened to resign from the case, and the government conceded defeat days later. \nMr Salmond was later cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault against a total of nine women after a separate criminal trial at the High Court in Edinburgh in March of last year.\nOn top of the Covid crisis, Nicola Sturgeon now has a major political crisis to deal with as well.\nThe Conservative's call for her resignation backed up with plans for a vote of no confidence is a major escalation in political tensions at Holyrood.\nIf she was to lose a confidence vote, she would be expected to resign as first minister.\nThe SNP does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament - the opposition is strong enough to vote down the government, if it so chooses. \nHowever, both Labour and the Liberal Democrats want to wait to hear the first minister's evidence to the Holyrood inquiry before deciding their positions.\nMy sense is the Greens would not try to oust the first minister before they have seen the findings of two inquiries into her handling of harassment complaints.\nThat could help to sustain her in office although the parliamentary arithmetic would still be tight.\nAll of this with just over nine weeks to go to the Holyrood election \u2014 where the public will give their verdict on all parties and whoever leads them.\nThe Scottish government had refused to publish the legal advice it had received until opposition parties threatened to have a vote of no confidence in Deputy First Minister John Swinney. \nMr Swinney said the papers showed that legal advice was \"optimistic\" in the first instance, but that it \"became gradually but progressively less optimistic over time\".\nAnd he said the government had taken the \"right and proper\" approach by conceding \"within a matter of days\" of being told the case was no longer winnable. \nThe Scottish Conservatives said not all of the government's correspondence with its lawyers had been released, as the inquiry committee and parliament had demanded, and said they would push ahead with a vote of no confidence in Mr Swinney on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, the committee has also published submissions from Duncan Hamilton - a former SNP MSP and lawyer for Mr Salmond - and Kevin Pringle, a former SNP communications director.\nMr Salmond had cited both men as backing up his claims about his meetings with Ms Sturgeon, including allegations the name of one of the complainers was passed to Mr Salmond's former chief of staff in a breach of confidence.\nBoth said they agreed this had happened - despite Ms Sturgeon telling MSPs that \"to the very best of my knowledge I do not think that happened\".\nMs Sturgeon has also maintained that she only learned of the complaints against Mr Salmond at a meeting at her home on 2 April 2018 - despite accepting she had met his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, at her Holyrood office on 29 March.\nMr Pringle and Mr Hamilton said they had taken part in a conference call with Mr Aberdein ahead of the 29 March meeting, and said he was clear that \"the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the two complaints\".\nMr Hamilton was present at the meeting on 2 April, and said that \"when we arrived, everyone in the room knew exactly why we were there - no introduction to the subject was needed and no one was in any doubt what we were there to discuss\".\nThe former MSP also insisted that Ms Sturgeon had offered to assist Mr Salmond in seeking mediation with the complainers saying she had told him that \"if it comes to it, I will intervene\".\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs in January 2019 that \"I was always clear that I had no role in the process - I did not seek to intervene in it at any stage\".\nMr Salmond was SNP leader for a total of 20 years and first minister for seven before being succeeded in both roles by Ms Sturgeon after the independence referendum in 2014. \nHis long-awaited appearance at the inquiry last Friday saw him claim that \"Scotland's leadership has failed\" as he called for Mr Murrell and the country's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, to quit and Scotland's top law officer, Lord Advocate James Wolffe, to consider his position. \nHe alleged that there had been a \"deliberate suppression of information inconvenient to the government\" throughout the saga, including part of his written evidence to the committee that was removed after a request from the Crown Office despite having already been published by parliament.  \nMr Salmond also told the committee that he had been given a memory stick in the build up to his criminal trial that contained messages which involved \"pressuring police\", \"collusion of witnesses\" and \"construction of evidence because police were felt to be inadequate in finding it themselves\".\nHe described the messages - which are believed to have been handed over to the committee by the Crown Office on Tuesday - as \"probably the most shocking thing I have seen in my life\".\nBut he said he could not give any further details because he had been told he could face prosecution if he did so."

      "tags": "Cash,Money,Personal finance,Budget 2021",
      "text": "The limit on a single payment using contactless card technology will rise to \u00a3100 later this year, the Treasury has confirmed.\nThe pandemic has accelerated a move away from cash, with shoppers often being encouraged to use contactless in many stores for public health reasons.\nIt has been less than a year since the limit was raised from \u00a330 to \u00a345.\nRegulators say businesses could still decide themselves whether to accept the higher limit.\nFears have also been raised regarding fraud risks involved in the use of cards.\nThe use of contactless technology by consumers has risen sharply in recent years, with more services adopting the technology and most shops offering it as an option.\nTo protect workers and consumers during the Covid outbreak, an increase to the current limit of \u00a345 was rushed through by the regulator in April last year.\nThe latest figures show that the proportion of contactless payments had fallen slightly compared with pre-pandemic levels, because lockdown measures hit the use of pubs, restaurants and public transport. They accounted for 41% of card transactions.\nHowever, there was a 16% increase in the total value of contactless payments in the UK in October, compared with the same month a year earlier, according to the latest data from UK Finance, which represents banks.\nThe amount spent on contactless hit a monthly record in August, boosted by the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and fewer coronavirus-related restrictions. A total of \u00a38.4bn was spent on credit and debit cards using contactless during that month.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"As we begin to open the UK economy and people return to the High Street, the contactless limit increase will make it easier than ever before for people to pay for their shopping, providing a welcome boost to retail that will protect jobs and drive growth.\"\nHowever, there have been worries raised about contactless limits being raised further.\nIan Johnson, managing director, Europe, at payment business Marqeta, said: \"The problem with increasing limits on physical contactless cards is if they are stolen or cloned, it will now be even easier for a fraudster to spend large sums of the victim's money in one go. \n\"Physical cards provide very little security and a fraudster could continue to use their contactless function until they are cancelled.\""
