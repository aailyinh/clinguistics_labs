      "text": "A deadly gun battle between police and the men suspected of assassinating Haiti's President Jovenel Mo\u00efse has been raging in Port-au-Prince.\nPolice chief L\u00e9on Charles said four suspects had been killed and two detained but some remained at large and a manhunt was still under way.\n\"They will be killed or captured,\" the police chief said.\nMr Mo\u00efse, 53, was fatally shot and his wife was injured when attackers stormed their home early on Wednesday.\nPolice chief Charles described dramatic scenes as officers confronted the alleged assassins.\n\"We blocked [the suspects] en route as they left the scene of the crime,\" he told a news conference. \"Since then, we have been battling with them.\" \nOfficials say the suspects are well armed and took three police officers hostage. The three have since been freed.\nMr Charles urged residents to stay indoors for their own safety. \nHaiti's ambassador to the US, Bocchit Edmond, later said that more than 20 \"mercenaries\" had been arrested.\nThe acting prime minister, Claude Joseph, has described Haiti as being \"in shock\" after the killing of Mr Mo\u00efse. \nHeavily armed assassins stormed the president's home in the hills above Port-au-Prince at around 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday.\nMr Mo\u00efse died at the scene. The president's body had 12 bullet wounds, Magistrate Carl Henry Destin told Le Nouvelliste newspaper.\nThe president's office and bedroom were ransacked and he was found lying on his back, covered in blood, the magistrate said.\nFirst Lady Martine Mo\u00efse, 47, has been flown to Florida where she is said to be in a critical but stable condition.\nThe couple's three children, Jomarlie, Jovenel Jr and Joverlein, are reportedly in a \"safe location\", officials said.\nMr Destin said that Jomarlie had survived by hiding in her brother's room, while two domestic staff members had been tied up by the attackers. \nPolice chief Charles gave no further details of the attackers or what their motive may have been.\nAmbassador Edmond told the NTN24 channel: \"They are mercenaries; they were paid for this job of coming to assassinate the president and we hope that they will reveal for whom it was they were working.\"\nHe said he believed more than 20 people had been detained but added: \"We're continuing with the search so we get them all.\"\nMr Joseph had earlier said the attackers were \"foreigners who spoke English and Spanish\". Haiti's official languages are Creole and French. Haiti's communications minister later said there were Haitians among the suspects.\nVideo released after the shooting purports to show heavily armed men dressed in black outside the residence shouting in English: \"DEA [US Drug Enforcement Administration] operations, everybody stay down!\"\nMr Edmond said that while the attackers had disguised themselves as US drugs agents, he believed there was \"no way\" they really were US agents.\nHaitians mostly heeded the call by the interim prime minister to remain calm and stay indoors.\nMr Joseph has declared a two-week state of emergency, which allows for the banning of gatherings and use of the military for police roles, along with other extensions of executive powers.\nThe UN Security Council is set to hold a closed-door meeting later on Thursday. It has condemned the assassination, calling on all parties to remain calm and avoid further instability.\nWorld leaders also condemned the killing. Pope Francis said it was a \"heinous murder\".\nEven before President Mo\u00efse's assassination, the situation in Haiti was marked by instability and there had been widespread protests demanding his resignation. \nParliamentary elections should have been held in October 2019 but disputes delayed them, meaning Mr Mo\u00efse had been ruling by decree. \nDuring his four years in office, the president had six prime ministers and on Monday, a day before he was killed, he had nominated a seventh, Ariel Henry.\nBut Mr Henry had not yet been sworn in, leaving his predecessor, Claude Joseph, in charge.\nUncertainty about who should now govern the country is rife.\nMr Joseph has said he will take control until elections can be held. But in an interview with Le Nouvelliste on Wednesday, Mr Henry insisted he and not Mr Joseph was the prime minister. \nHaiti's constitution says the president of the Supreme Court should take over in the event of a presidential vacancy. However, Chief Justice Ren\u00e9 Sylvestre died of Covid-19 weeks ago.\nThe US said it believed elections should go ahead this year, to bring about a peaceful transfer of power."

      "text": "Haiti's President Jovenel Mo\u00efse has been killed and his wife injured in an attack on their home in the nation's capital, Port-au-Prince.\nUnidentified gunmen stormed the property at 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT), interim PM Claude Joseph said.\nHe has called for calm and declared a state of emergency nationwide.\nMr Mo\u00efse had led Haiti, one of the poorest nations in the world, since 2017 but had faced widespread protests demanding his resignation.\nThe nation's recent history has been plagued by coups, political instability and widespread gang violence.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that he was \"saddened at the death of Mr Mo\u00efse\", calling it \"an abhorrent act\" and appealing for calm. US President Joe Biden offered condolences to the people of Haiti for the \"horrific assassination\".\nFirst Lady Martine Mo\u00efse later reportedly arrived by plane in Fort Lauderdale, south Florida, for treatment. There is no official word on her condition.\nMr Joseph called the shooting of the president a \"heinous, inhuman and barbaric act\", saying the attackers were \"foreigners who spoke English and Spanish\". Haiti's official languages are Creole and French.\nSome reports spoke of men dressed in black carrying high-powered weapons who may have pretended to be part of a US drug enforcement operation, although no official details have been given.\nHaiti's ambassador to the US, Bocchit Edmond, said there was \"no way\" US drugs agents carried out the attack. He believed it was the work of \"professional mercenaries\".\nAddressing the nation, Mr Joseph vowed the killers would be brought to justice and said the security situation was \"under control\".\nThe state of emergency, or \"state of siege\", allows for the banning of gatherings and use of the military for police roles, along with other extensions of executive powers.\nMr Joseph said that \"all measures have been taken to ensure continuity\" and that \"democracy and the republic will win\".\nBut questions remain about how much control Mr Joseph can assert.\nHaiti's constitution says ministers, under the leadership of the prime minister, take control in the event of presidential vacancy until elections can be called.\nBut that also remains unclear, as a new prime minister, Ariel Henry, was named by Mr Mo\u00efse just this week but has yet to be sworn in.\nThe US later said it believed elections should go ahead this year, to bring about a peaceful transfer of power.\nThe US has been Haiti's biggest donor for 50 years but has had a fractious relationship with some of its rulers and has carried out a number of blockades and interventions.\nThe country has also had strong counter-narcotics ties with Haiti to try to prevent South American drugs being shipped through the nation and on to the US.\nThe streets of Port-au-Prince appeared to be mostly calm on Wednesday.\nOne resident, Pascale Solages, told the BBC: \"We are on our cell phones, our radio, our television, waiting for what happens next... everyone is scared.\"\nThe neighbouring Dominican Republic ordered the \"immediate closure\" of its border with Haiti.\nJovenel Mo\u00efse, 53, had been in power since February 2017.\nHis time in office was rocky as he faced accusations of corruption and there were widespread demonstrations in the capital and other cities earlier this year.\nHaiti's opposition said that Mr Mo\u00efse's five-year term should have ended on 7 February 2021, five years to the day since his predecessor, Michel Martelly, stepped down.\nBut there had been a year's delay to elections after Mr Martelly's departure, and Mr Mo\u00efse insisted he had one more year to serve as he did not take office until 7 February 2017.\nParliamentary elections should have been held in October 2019 but disputes have delayed them, meaning Mr Mo\u00efse had been ruling by decree.\nIn February this year, on the day the opposition wanted him to leave office, Mr Mo\u00efse said an attempt to kill him and overthrow the government had been foiled.\nHaiti has also faced a wave of recent gang violence and kidnappings, particularly in the capital, with a number of its districts becoming no-go areas.\nThe worsening living standards in the nation of 11 million people have pushed nearly 60% below the poverty line.\nAn earthquake in 2010 killed more than 200,000 people and caused extensive damage to the infrastructure and the economy.\nA UN peacekeeping force was put in place in 2004 to help stabilise the country, and only withdrew in 2017, but the turmoil has shown no sign of ending."

      "tags": "Europe heatwaves,COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change,Heatwaves",
      "text": "The searing heat that scorched western Canada and the US at the end of June was \"virtually impossible\" without climate change, say scientists.\nIn their study, the team of researchers says that the deadly heatwave was a one-in-a-1,000-year event.\nBut we can expect extreme events such as this to become more common as the world heats up due to climate change.\nIf humans hadn't influenced the climate to the extent that they have, the event would have been 150 times less likely.\nScientists worry that global heating, largely as a result of burning fossil fuels, is now driving up temperatures faster than models predict. \nClimate researchers have grown used to heatwaves breaking records all over the world in recent years. However, beating the previous national high temperature mark by more than 4C in one go, as happened in Canada last week, is virtually unprecedented. \nCanada's previous national record for high temperature was 45C - but the recent heat in the village of Lytton in British Columbia saw a figure of 49.6C recorded at the height of the event. \nThis was shortly before the village itself was largely destroyed by a wildfire.\nAll across the region, in the US states of Oregon and Washington and in the west of Canada, multiple cities hit new records far above 40C.\nThese temperatures had deadly consequences for hundreds of people, with spikes in sudden deaths and big increases in hospital visits for heat-related illness. \nSince the start of the heatwave, people have linked the unusual and extreme nature of the event to climate change. \nNow, researchers say that the chances of it occurring without human-induced warming were virtually impossible. \nAn international team of 27 climate researchers who are part of the World Weather Attribution network managed to analyse the data in just eight days. \nUnsurprisingly, given the quick turnaround, the research has not yet been peer-reviewed. However, the scientists use well-established methods accepted by top journals.\nThey used 21 climate models to estimate how much climate change influenced the heat experienced in the area around the cities of Seattle, Portland and Vancouver. \nThey compared the climate as it is today, with the world as it would be without human-induced warming. \n\"We conclude that a one-in-1000-year event would have been at least 150 times rarer in the past,\" said lead author Sjoukje Philip, from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.\n\"So that's in a climate without human-induced climate change, when the climate was about 1.2C cooler than it is now. The heatwave would also have been about two degrees cooler in the past.\"\nCo-author Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, explained what the researchers meant when they said the extreme heat was \"virtually impossible\" without climate change. \n\"Without the additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, in the statistics that we have available with our models, and also the statistical models based on observations, such an event just does not occur,\" she explained. \n\"Or if an event like this occurs, it occurs once in a million times, which is the statistical equivalent of never,\" she told a news briefing.\nThis type of research, which seeks to determine the contribution of human-induced climate change to extreme weather events, is known as an attribution study.\nAccording to the analysis, if the world warms by 2C, which could happen in about 20 years' time, then the chances of having a heatwave similar to last week's drop from around once every 1,000 years to roughly once every 5-10 years. \nThe authors say that the observed temperatures were so extreme that they lie far outside the range of historical observations. This makes it hard to quantify, with confidence, just how rare the heat dome event really was. \nThe scientists say there are two possibilities for the extreme jump in peak temperatures seen in the region.\nThe first is that it is just an extremely rare event, made worse by climate change, \"the statistical equivalent of really bad luck\", according to the paper. \nThe other possibility is that the climate may have crossed a \"threshold,\" that would make the kind of heatwaves witnessed recently much more likely.\nUp until now, researchers had seen a gradual increase in heat extremes as the world warmed. Their analysis of what happened in Canada has shaken that view.  \nIt could mean that the predictions of climate models might be underestimating the extreme temperatures the world could yet experience.\n\"We are much less certain about how the climate affects heatwaves than we were two weeks ago,\" said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.\n\"And we are worried about the possibilities of these things happening everywhere. But we don't know how realistic that is yet, we just we need to work on it.\"\nSo does mean that this exceptional heatwave could be some sort of tipping point?\n\"It's really not the important thing if this is a tipping point or not,\" said Dr Otto. \n\"What's important is what are our societies are resilient to and what can we adapt to. And in most societies, it's really a very, very stable climate, and that even a small change makes a huge difference.\"\n\"And what we see here is not a small change, it's a big change. I think that is really, really the important message here.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "text": "A man who missed England's semi-final win over Denmark so he could donate stem cells has been given tickets to the final. \nSam Astley, from Sedgley in the West Midlands, instead watched the Euro 2020 match from his hospital bed as he prepared for a procedure on Thursday.\nHe has been praised by the Anthony Nolan Trust and Gary Lineker. \nEuro 2020 sponsor Vivo is providing him with final tickets which he will collect on Friday after his discharge.\nMr Astley said it was \"unbelievable\" to be seeing England v Italy in the final. \nHis partner, Beth Hill, said he had also been offered a room in the Dorchester hotel so he could stay in London until Sunday's match.\nThe smartphone manufacturer responded to calls on Twitter from Lineker and football fans trying to find Mr Astley tickets to Sunday's match as a thank you.\nMr Astley, who works for Yamazaki Mazak in Worcester, said the response to his story had been \"crazy\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, he said missing the donation had not been an option, despite his girlfriend winning tickets to the Denmark match.\nHe said the chance to watch England in a semi-final would have been fantastic, but he quickly recognised donating stem cells was \"more important than any football game\" and he never considered delaying the procedure.\n\"I am obviously pleased it has taken off, because we have managed to spread awareness for the great charity Anthony Nolan so hopefully more people will sign up to their register,\" he said.\n\"I think because it has been such a crazy 24 hours I think it has really helped with my recovery and the adrenaline has kept me going.\"\nHe said he did not know who would be receiving his stem cells, but it was expected to be a child. \nThe appointment to donate the bone marrow had been made six weeks ago, after he signed up to be on the Anthony Nolan Trust's register at a football tournament organised by his partner's friend Simon Wilkes, Stourbridge News reported.\nHe said: \"Simon suffers from a form of blood cancer himself so [he] invites Anthony Nolan to the charity events and encourages as many people as possible to sign up to the register.\"\nMr Astley's partner Beth Hill, who has been working as a critical care nurse with coronavirus patients for the past 18 months, could not go either, after a colleague tested positive, forcing her to isolate.\nShe said: \"I am just so proud of him, he literally is a lifesaver and a modern day hero, it is amazing what he is doing.\" \nBut Mr Astley said she was the \"real hero\" and her work during the pandemic had been a \"big influence\" on his decision to become a donor. \nMr Astley's step-mother, Angie, who works for Telford and Wrekin Council in Shropshire, said she was \"bursting with pride\". \nThe procedure Mr Astley underwent on Thursday involved the removal of bone marrow containing stem cells from his hip bones. \nMs Hill said he was recovering well in hospital and had been told by the anaesthetist that he had woken up singing It's Coming Home.\nIn a tweet, the 24-year-old also thanked Gary Lineker for his support and for \"all the wonderful messages\".\n\"Sam has shown us all what a true hero he really is, by putting his own once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see England play at Wembley aside, to give someone with blood cancer or a blood disorder their best chance at survival and we simply cannot thank him enough,\" Anthony Nolan Trust's chief executive Henny Braund said.\nIn a statement, Vivo said it wanted to thank Mr Astley for \"his selfless lifesaving donation\" and had arranged for him and his girlfriend to attend the final as its guests. \n\"We hope that both of them enjoy the experience,\" it added.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "tags": "Maintenance, repair, and operations,Apple",
      "text": "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has issued a passionate endorsement of the right-to-repair movement, despite the company's opposition.\nThe movement wants laws passed to guarantee users access to information and parts to repair their own devices.\n\"We wouldn't have had an Apple had I not grown up in a very open technology world,\" Mr Wozniak, its co-founder with Steve Jobs in the 1970s, said. \n\"It's time to recognise the right to repair more fully.\"\nExisting right-to-repair rules in Europe and the US are limited to appliances and vehicles, respectively. \nAnd right-to-repair advocates say Apple is one of the fiercest opponents to expanding the legislation to cover consumer electronics. \nIt allows repairs by its own authorised technicians only and does not generally provide spare parts or repair information. \nAnd it has reportedly engaged lobbyists to persuade lawmakers repairing devices can be extremely dangerous. \nBut Mr Wozniak, 70, said: \"Companies inhibit [the right to repair] because it gives the companies power, control, over everything.\n\"It's time to start doing the right things.\"  \nMr Wozniak made his comments in an impassioned nine-and-a-half-minute reply to a request from right-to-repair campaigner Louis Rossmann on Cameo, a site that allows ordinary people to pay celebrities for a short message. \n\"This one has really gotten to me,\" he said.\n\"When starting Apple, I could never afford a teletype for input or output.\n\"They cost as much as two cars.\" \nBut he knew how TVs worked and had access to schematics - so he built his own solution to turn his TV into an early computer monitor for the Apple I.\n\"I didn't have to afford something I could never afford,\" he said.\n\"I wasn't restricted from anything that kept me from building that computer and showing the world that the future of personal computers is going to be a keyboard and a TV.\n\"That all came from being able to repair things, and modify them, and tap into them yourself.\" \nHe also credited an open platform with the success of the Apple II, which he said had shipped with schematics and designs.\nIt had been, he said, the only source of profits at Apple for the company's first decade.\n\"So why stop them? Why stop the self-repair community?\" he asked.\n\"How was Apple hurt by the openness of the Apple II?\"\nMr Wozniak left Apple in the mid-80s but revealed in an interview last year he was still technically an employee, receiving a weekly paycheque of about $50 (\u00a336) out of \"loyalty\" despite having no role in the running of the business.\nHe also had much to say about the value of open technology for education. \n\"You could repair a lot of things at low cost - but it's even more precious to know that you did it yourself,\" he said.\nAnd he spoke of the \"motivation and joy\" of young people learning to write software and develop hardware \"to prove to themselves they've got a little special skill in the world\", adding it was \"very motivating for creative minds, believe me - that's how I grew up\".\nEarlier this year, Mr Rossman began trying to raise $6m to get the right to repair passed into law by a direct-ballot initiative. \nSo far, he has raised $750,000. \nAnd he has now posted a video asking for direct involvement and a donation from Mr Wozniak, saying other interested donors were waiting for a figurehead to \"go first\" before donating large amounts. \nApple has been contacted for comment.  \nUS President Joe Biden is widely expected to announce some form of executive order on the topic in the coming days - as pressure also mounts from officials in Europe.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon",
      "text": "The recent surge of Covid-19 cases in Scotland may be levelling off, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nA further 2,802 positive cases were recorded on Thursday, with Ms Sturgeon saying there was an \"apparent slowdown\" in the rise in infections.\nShe said this gave her cause for optimism that Scotland can move to level zero of restrictions on 19 July.\nHowever she stressed that measures such as the use of face masks and physical distancing will remain for some time.\nThe Scottish Parliament will be recalled from recess next Tuesday for Ms Sturgeon to announce whether the easing of restrictions will go ahead as planned.\nThe 2,802 positive tests announced on Thursday represents a drop from the 3,799 logged on Wednesday.\nA total of 401 people are in hospital with the virus, with 38 in intensive care, while a further four deaths have been registered.\nCase numbers are now 1,432 lower than they were last Thursday, while the seven-day average also appears to show a slowdown in the rise of positive cases.\nMs Sturgeon said there was a \"suggestion that the recent surge in cases may be to some extent levelling off now\".\nHowever, she said figures remained worryingly high and could still put pressure on the health service.\nShe said: \"We increasingly hear talk of learning to live with the virus, which we all want to be able to do.\n\"It is true that we can't live a restricted way of life forever as that in itself affects our health and wellbeing, and vaccines are offering us an alternative way forward.\n\"However, that desire to just live with it cannot mean we simply throw caution to the wind and no longer worry at all about rising levels of infection.\"\nThe Scottish government's route map out of lockdown would see the whole of the country move to level zero of restrictions on 19 July, before scrapping most legal curbs altogether on 9 August.\nA decision is to be taken on the first step on 13 July, and Ms Sturgeon said this would be based on a careful evaluation of the latest data.\nShe added: \"I very much hope we will be able to move ahead as planned, and the apparent slowdown in case numbers gives me more cause for optimism about that than I might have had a week ago.\"\nHowever, the first minister stressed that Covid \"is going to be around for some time to come\", and said this meant some curbs would have to remain.\nShe said: \"Its important I think to remind all of us that a move to level zero does not mean the immediate end of all restrictions.\n\"Many of the baseline measures like face coverings, physical distancing, hand hygiene and advising on ventilation, these are going to continue to be important mitigations to protect us and others from the virus for some time yet.\n\"No matter what our decision is next week, there won't be an abrupt end to these basic protective measures when we do move to level zero.\"\nScottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy said continuing uncertainty over what restrictions would ease and when were not helping people's business, holiday or wedding plans.\nAnd he said it was \"not good enough\" that next week's statement would come just six days before the changes are due to come into force. \nMs Sturgeon said her government was currently reviewing its policy on self-isolation rules, including for workplaces and travellers, and would announce the outcome shortly.\nThe UK government has announced that fully-vaccinated people arriving in England from amber travel list destinations will no longer have to quarantine from 19 July.\nThe first minister also acknowledged the growing pressure on the NHS amid high case numbers, despite a lower proportion of people requiring hospital care.\nTwo hospitals in the north east of Scotland have reached full capacity, with calls for non-urgent procedures to be cancelled to ease the strain on services.\nHospitals are under pressure but it is different this time. Despite soaring case numbers, far fewer people are ending up in hospital with Covid. There's also some evidence that they don't need treatment for as long.\nBut hospitals are busier now than last year when many other procedures were postponed.\nHealth boards say the numbers of non-Covid patients they are seeing over summer is equivalent to that usually experienced in the busier winter months. Figures from Public Health Scotland show emergency departments faced their busiest ever May, with more than 112,563 attendances.\nAdd into that fewer available beds because of distancing requirements, juggling staff leave, staff sickness and self-isolation, and the already high vacancy rates in some areas. It doesn't take much before hospitals are at full stretch.\nAs ever, the NHS has to prioritise those most in need of treatment and that means some are already having to postpone non-urgent surgery.\nThe major burden on the NHS during this wave may turn out not to be Covid patients themselves but the wider impacts of the whole pandemic.\nChief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said the remobilisation of the health service - with procedures delayed due to the pandemic now starting up again - meant hospitals were busier than normal with non-Covid work.\nHe added: \"What I'm hearing from colleagues is much more in the way of very complex and often quite unwell people who are presenting, particularly either in community-based services or at emergency departments, with illness which necessitates hospital admission and where the length of stay is slightly longer.\n\"We are also seeing increased respiratory infections, particularly in younger children where we know we have an upsurge in parainfluezna, a type of viral infection, and that is having an knock on effect on people presenting to GPs and emergency departments with unwell children.\""

There are a number of issues that arose.\"\nMr Harris, who had more than 35 years of service before retiring, said some of his officers were \"stuck in a loop\" of trying to contact the police and displayed \"some inertia\" in overcoming the communication problems. \nPaul Greaney QC, lead counsel to the inquiry, asked if the delay represented \"not just a failure but a gross failure in response\".\nMr Harris replied: \"It does, sir.\"\nHe agreed that on the night there had been a failure of leadership within GMFRS and that it was \"too risk averse\" in its response. \nA few hours after the bombing, Mr Harris met firefighters who were \"fuming\" about the failed response. \nHe recalled there was a \"ring of firefighters around me\" demanding answers which he was unable to give. \n\"Not only did we let down the people of Greater Manchester, we let those firefighters down,\" he said.\nThe inquiry continues. \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nScrapping quarantine for double-jabbed travellers returning to the UK from amber countries has been widely reported. But the details of how it will work, when it would come into effect and what it means for fully-vaccinated parents with unvaccinated children haven't yet been revealed by the government. That should change when Transport Secretary Grant Shapps makes a statement to MPs this morning. It comes as travel bosses have been calling for rules to be eased so the industry can reopen more fully. Strict rules due to coronavirus mean people returning to the UK from countries on the amber or red list must isolate for 10 days, whether they are vaccinated or not. \nEngland's Euro 2020 progress could be behind infections rising faster among men than women in the past two weeks, Imperial College London data suggests. Men were 30% more likely than women to test positive for Covid, according to the React study which tested more than 47,000 volunteers across England between 24 June and 5 July. These infections have not resulted in a large number of people needing hospital treatment or dying, the study found.\nEngland are through to the final of Euro 2020 and will face Italy on Sunday at Wembley. But what is the situation with tickets? There will be at least 60,000 fans at Wembley - although there are\u00a0reports a full crowd of 90,000\u00a0could watch the match. Tickets have sold out to the general public, according to Uefa's website. Italy's supporters are unable to fly to England for the game due to travel restrictions but fully vaccinated fans or those who can show a negative lateral flow test from the previous 48 hours are allowed at Wembley.

      "text": "Details about how and when fully vaccinated travellers can return from certain countries without having to quarantine are to be set out later.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps will make a statement to MPs this morning.\nCurrently, those arriving in the UK have to follow strict rules regardless of their vaccine status, and anyone returning from countries on the amber or red list must isolate for 10 days.\nTravel bosses have called for the rules to be eased as soon as possible.\nThe UK's traffic light system for international travel is still in force. Fewer than 30 destinations are on the green list - meaning travellers do not have to self-isolate when they get back to the UK but they do have to pay for Covid tests. \nMore than 50 countries are on the strictest red list, which requires arrivals to pay to self-isolate in a hotel for 10 days.\nBut most places - including several holiday hotspots such as mainland Spain, Greece and the US - are on the amber list. People returning from these countries must quarantine for 10 days and pay for tests.\nThe government has already said it was planning to scrap the need to quarantine for those who are double-jabbed and returning from amber countries.\nBut it has not set out how it would work, when it would happen, and whether unvaccinated children would also be able to avoid quarantine if their parents are fully vaccinated. \nIn addition to relaxing the rules around isolation for travellers, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that the health secretary was considering a \"more proportionate and balanced approach\" to isolation for Covid contacts.\nIt comes amid fears that surging cases across the UK will lead to millions of people being asked to self-isolate during the summer, even if they have been fully vaccinated.\n\"I recognise people's frustrations with this. I have spoken to the health secretary and he's also aware of this,\" Mr Sunak told BBC Breakfast.\n\"He's looking at the difference between the two systems [contact tracers and the NHS app] and seeing what might be a more proportionate and balanced approach to this.\"\nThe transport secretary's travel update in the House of Commons is due at 11:30 BST.\nThe UK government's traffic light system applies to England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland able to make their own rules. \nHowever, the rules are broadly the same and previous changes to the lists have been adopted by all four nations.\nMelanie Matheis lives in California. Her daughter Allana left to go to drama school in London in September, and a few months later Melanie's husband died after being diagnosed with cancer.\nAllana couldn't come back for her father's funeral or for Christmas because of the UK's travel restrictions.\n\"She wouldn't have been able to go back to school when she went back to London because of the quarantine,\" Melanie tells the BBC, \"so she made the difficult decision to stay there.\"\nShe adds: \"It was difficult for myself as well being alone.\"\nMelanie is double-jabbed and was hoping to visit her daughter in London this month, but has put it back by a few weeks once it became clear the rules were not changing. The US is on the UK's amber list, meaning Melanie would have to quarantine somewhere when she arrives. \nWithout a home here, she would have to pay for a hotel room and tests which she can't afford. \"It would be double the expense and it's just not really possible,\" she says. \"It would make it very difficult.\"\nThe travel industry is eager to have the rules relaxed. \nDaniel Pearce, the head of Travel Trade Gazette, a monthly magazine for the travel industry, said the industry had been \"crying out\" for quarantine exemptions.\nHe said he hoped changes would coincide with the wider easing of lockdown rules in England on 19 July., as that would allow the travel industry to capitalise on the family summer holiday market.\n\"Any change as early as this would enable some form of summer season to take place during the children's school holidays,\" he said.\nHowever, other groups are concerned about the plan to open up society further.\nIn a letter to medical journal The Lancet, more than 120 scientists and doctors have called on the UK government to rethink its plan to end restrictions in England on 19 July, calling it \"dangerous and premature\", saying millions more people will became infected if it goes ahead.\nThe government should wait until everyone, including adolescents, have been offered the vaccine before opening up, they say.\nThe traffic light system sets the rules travellers must follow on their return. But holidaymakers also need to check their destination's entry rules.\nFor example, all non-vaccinated travellers to mainland Portugal need a negative Covid test, and must quarantine for 14 days. Twelve to 17-year-olds travelling with fully-vaccinated parents don't have to quarantine but need a negative test. Under-11s are exempt.\nOnly fully-vaccinated adults can travel to Malta, and don't need a negative test. Children aged 5-11 can travel with fully-vaccinated adults, but need a negative test. Under-5s don't need a test. Unvaccinated 12 to 17-year olds can't enter. \nOver-12s travelling to Spain need a negative test or proof of vaccination. \nUnvaccinated travellers can only enter France for \"essential reasons\", and must self-isolate for seven days. Fully-vaccinated adults with a negative test can enter. Under-18s travelling with fully-vaccinated adults don't need to self-isolate.\nMore than 32,000 new coronavirus cases were announced on Wednesday, as well as 33 more deaths. \nNearly two-thirds of the adult population in the UK have received two jabs, and 86% have had a first dose.\nProf Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises ministers, stressed it was \"still very important\" to try to control the Delta variant, despite the success of the vaccine rollout.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"If we abandon general population social distancing measures as a means of control, then we will very likely see a massive peak of infections and, whilst the vaccines are excellent, they're not perfect.\n\"And so, if we get to a very small percentage of a massive number of cases getting hospitalised, that's still a very large number.\"\nThe government has said that public health remains its priority and it is taking a cautious approach to the resumption of international travel."

      "tags": "Anxiety,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Counterfeit medication,Mental health",
      "text": "Fake prescription anti-anxiety pills are thought to have left several people seriously ill in hospital.  \nSwansea Bay health board said they were taken to Morriston Hospital after overdosing on Wednesday. \nIt said it believed the tablets were being sold illegally as Valium and Xanax in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot.\nSouth Wales Police said it was contacted by the health board on Wednesday evening and was carrying out an extensive investigation. \nIt comes as a report warned of the number of fake pills being seen by health experts. \nPublic Health Wales' drugs testing lab said it had seen a \"substantial increase\" in pills being sent for analysis by people concerned about their authenticity.\nThe most common were benzodiazepines, a group of anti-anxiety pills which includes diazepam and Xanax. \nJosie Smith, PHW's head of substance misuse, said the issue had likely got worse due to Covid and lockdowns. \n\"These drugs may not be regulated in the UK and they will differ in strength and in the speed at which the effects are felt... so there's a very real risk of accident, as sadly we're hearing today,\" she told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales. \nMore than half of the pills tested were found to be fakes, often containing stronger, unregulated chemicals. \nMs Smith said: \"Given the stresses, strains and pressures that people have been under in the past year, they may have been more inclined to self-medicate with medicines not prescribed to them.\n\"We are more frequently now hearing from individuals saying that they didn't wish to go to their GP to talk about the challenges they were experiencing and found it easier to go online.\"\nShe added there was anecdotal evidence of an increase of the use anti-anxiety and anti-depression drugs during the Covid pandemic. \nFake pills are often made using cheaper ingredients, which can be up to 10 times stronger than what people think they are taking, potentially leading to longer-lasting side effects and long-term addiction or overdose. \nMany closely resemble genuine pharmaceuticals, with blister packs and accompanying medical information leaflets. \nThe Welsh Emerging Drugs and Identification of Novel Substances (Wedinos) project, which analyses drug samples sent in from across the UK, saw a 40% increase in the number of benzodiazepine samples, up from 846 in 2019-20 to 1,205 in 2020-21. \nDiazepam and Xanax were the most common pills people believed they were buying. \nMs Smith said some people may worry about the stigma of seeking medication, but urged them to go to their GPs. \nShe said: \"We know that the age range for this is enormous. \n\"The youngest person submitting a sample was 14 and the oldest was 89, so this is right across the age groups. This isn't exclusively a young person's issue or an older person's issue.\"\nOut of 320 samples submitted in the past year where people believed they had bought Xanax, 58% were found to contain a different substance entirely. \nOut of 712 diazepam samples, 55% were found to be something else, with many consisting of significantly more potent chemicals that have never been regulated for medical use. \nAs well as a suspected increase in online sales, some drug support services said they had seen a marked increase in so-called street benzodiazepines, often bought and sold among those with existing addiction issues. \nKimberley Williams, who has used benzodiazepines in the past but is now in recovery, said the streets were \"flooded\" with fake medication. \n\"Obviously people are coming out of lockdown, their mental health isn't good, and these are people that don't go to the doctors to get their medication, so they're seeking something to make themselves feel better.\n\"It's so much more powerful. It's highly addictive anyway, but I'm seeing it ruining people lives faster than crack and heroin - and that says a lot.\"\nElwyn Thomas, an outreach worker at the Kaleidoscope drug support service in Newport, said he had noticed big changes in benzodiazepine use for those already struggling with addictions.\n\"We've had probably 16 or 17 drug related-deaths in the first three months of this year which related to fake benzodiazepines,\" he said.\n\"On the streets we're seeing chaos. As a front line drug worker I've seen the use of benzodiazepines changing over the past 17 months. \n\"The difference now is the types and strength of benzodiazepines that are out there on the street.\"\nSimon Jones, head of policy at Mind Cymru, said it was concerning to see people attempting to order medications online to help with mental health problems. \nHe said: \"This can be very dangerous, as there is no guarantee that people know exactly what is in the medication. \n\"Our advice is that if you think you're experiencing symptoms of a mental health problem, like anxiety, it's important to see your GP, who can talk you through a range of treatment options including a prescription if you both feel you could benefit from one.\"\nBritish Medical Association Wales council chairman Dr David Bailey said it was \"hugely concerning\" to hear of people buying prescription-only medication without a proper medical assessment. \nHe said: \"No online portal - even from a reputable pharmacy company - will have access to a patient's medical history and if medication is obtained from any other source there can be no guarantee about either the suitability of the medication or if it is genuine.\""

      "text": "Former England striker Alan Shearer has told the BBC that England's success in the Euro 2020 tournament so far has given the country \"joy\", \"relief\" and \"hope\" after a tough 18 months. \nBut could this feelgood factor translate into an economic boost for the country as well?\nAfter the team reached its first major men's football final in 55 years on Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he expected to see a \"bounce\" in consumer confidence because of the tournament. \nSome businesses, however, say social distancing rules are stopping them from fully reaping the benefits. \nSimon French, chief economist at brokers Panmure Gordon, told the BBC that he agreed England's success could boost economic growth, alongside other factors. \nPart of this would be the impact of spending on hospitality as people watched games, something he estimates could contribute a relatively small \u00a3150m to UK GDP.\nBut, he added: \"If a victory on one day coalesces with a broader feelgood factor, like we saw during during Euro 96 or the 2012 Olympics, it could boost consumer sentiment.\n\"The difference this time is that UK households have a lot of pent-up savings due to the pandemic - we estimate about \u00a320bn - and the speed with which they are spent is closely linked to consumer sentiment. \n\"Winning the final, along with lots of other things, like reopening, the easing of restrictions, could help unlock many billions of pounds worth of additional spending.\" \nIndependent economist Julian Jessop is more cautious, however. \nHe tweeted: \"I'd love to say winning #euro2020 will boost the UK economy (or at least the English bits), but it wouldn't change any of the fundamentals.\n\"And clearly [it would be] trumped by everything else going on, especially the lifting of Covid restrictions.\"\nRetail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth thinks it will be a \"massive\" weekend for the supermarkets, with the final due to be played on Sunday evening. She also expects a mini spending boom on items such as cars and homeware if England win, as well as a boost to productivity. \n\"We have gone through a period of misery which makes consumer sentiment quite low so people don't splash out,\" she said. \n\"But the vaccine programme is working which is massive source of hope. People in employment are feeling OK thanks to furlough. And now we have this massive confidence boost from the football which makes us all feel more positive and pull together.\"\nThe boss of beer, wines and spirits at Co-op, Simon Cairns, says the supermarket chain expects a \"bumper weekend\" ahead of the final on Sunday.\n\"We are expecting to sell and additional one million drinks on Sunday alone compared to our normal trading, which is twice what we could normally expect to sell,\" he told the BBC.\n\"If yesterday is anything go by those sales will be dominated by beer and cider. And in a nod to our Italian opponents we are expecting to see some bumper sales of things like Prosecco - a quarter of a million bottles we're expecting to sell between now and the end of Sunday.\" \nHe added that sales of snacks, burgers and barbecues were also expected to soar - as well as champagne sales - if England triumph.\nHowever, not everyone expects to reap the full economic benefits of the Euros. Simon Emeny, boss of pub and hotel operator Fuller, Smith & Turner, told the BBC that despite \"fantastic\" takings on Wednesday night, social distancing rules and capacity constraints had curbed profits. \n\"This is why 19 July [when Covid rules end] can't come soon enough for the sector,\" he said. \n\"Even [during the final] on Sunday, when our pubs will be pretty busy, we're operating at seriously reduced capacity and we just won't be able to satisfy demand.\"\nThe British Beer & Pub Association expects England fans to enjoy more than 13 million extra pints on Sunday. But it said the figure would be closer to 17 million - worth \u00a39m in lost sales - if social distancing rules were removed. \nAnnette Powell and her husband John run the Kenilworth Pub near Manchester and agree that the restrictions have capped profit during the tournament. \nHaving to provide table service for all customers has meant doubling their number of staff to take around two-thirds of their normal takings - which would have been around \u00a312,000 for the match on Wednesday.\nThe Kenilworth also only fits a maximum of 160 customers with social distancing and has had to turn away at least another 150 on match days. \n\"We've had to upset a lot of loyal customers,\" Annette said. \"The Euros are a huge boost, it's just unfortunate it isn't what it could have been.\"\nHowever, Oliver Thain, who runs eight pubs and restaurants in Cambridgeshire, said he was hopeful the tournament's feelgood factor would last. \nHe said the tournament had \"made hardly any difference\" to his largely food-based businesses and only two of his venues had screened games. \nBut he thinks bookings will pick up as consumers feel more confident and the country continues to unlock.\n\"Sport can really up the country's spirit, so though it's difficult to put a figure on, the Euros certainly can't do any harm.\""

      "text": "Lithuania has announced it will build a barrier on the border with Belarus and deploy troops to prevent migrants from illegally crossing into its territory.\nPrime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said more than 1,000 migrants had been held after crossing along the 679km (422-mile) border since 1 June.\nLithuania, an EU member, also accused Belarus of flying in foreign migrants and allowing them to go to the border.\nBilateral ties have been strained since May's arrest of a Belarusian dissident.\nRoman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were flying from Greece to Lithuania when a fighter jet was scrambled over Belarus to escort their plane to Minsk airport over a bomb threat which turned out to be fake.\nThey were detained as soon as the Ryanair plane landed.\nThe EU and other Western nations also accuse Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of rigging last year's elections.\nMr Lukashenko, who has been in power for 27 years and is sometimes called Europe's last dictator, rejects the allegation.\nAt Wednesday's news briefing in Lithuania's capital Vilnius, Ms Simonyte said \"an additional physical barrier\" would be built on the border with Belarus.\nShe said this would be \"a certain sign and a certain deterrent to organisers of the illegal migration flows\".\n\"To assist our border officers, our army forces will be used to increase the number of people physically guarding the border,\" Ms Simonyte added.\nIn the whole of last year, Lithuanian border guards detained 81 illegal migrants crossing from its southern neighbour - a far lower number than that seen in recent weeks. \nMs Simonyte accused Belarus of offering migrants flights to the Belarusian capital Minsk, citing evidence found on at least one such person who had reached Lithuania.\n\"There are travel agencies, direct flights that connect Minsk with Baghdad [Iraq's capital] for example, and there are agencies both in Belarus and other countries that operate and attract 'tourists' to Minsk,\" Ms Simonyte told Reuters news agency.\nMeanwhile, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said a large number of illegal migrants trying to cross into Lithuania from Belarus had been flown in from Turkey.  \nHe said he had asked his Turkish counterpart to help identify any such arrivals.\nThe EU has already sent personnel from its from its border agency Frontex to Lithuania's border to help deal with the growing migrant crisis.\nMr Lukashenko has repeatedly warned that Belarusian authorities will no longer be trying to stop an influx of illegal migrants from abroad to EU members.\n\"If some think that we will close our borders with Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Ukraine and become a camp for people fleeing Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Tunisia they are mistaken,\" Mr Lukashenko said on Tuesday.\n\"We won't hold anyone, they are coming not to us but to the enlightened, warm and cozy Europe,\" he added mockingly."

      "text": "The government has been urged to boost spending on recovery services and treatment for drug addicts by an independent review.\nThe report by Dame Carol Black said cuts have left services \"on their knees\" and urged an extra \u00a3552m investment over five years in England.\nIt also advised a \u00a315m boost towards jobs support for those in treatment.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said ministers would \"look closely\" at the recommendations. \nThe government has announced it will follow one of the recommendations, to set up a new cross-government unit on tackling drug misuse. \nMr Javid said it would ensure \"strong collaboration\" on the issue, which is the shared responsibility of several different departments.\nThe report is the second part of a two-stage review originally commissioned by Mr Javid in February 2019, when he was home secretary. \nThe first part, published in February last year, estimated the drugs trade in England cost society about \u00a319bn a year. \nThe second part, which focuses on treatment services, found \"vital services\" have been cut back, with support workers \"depleted\" and \"demoralised\".\nDame Carol, a medic and government health adviser between 2006 and 2016, said this included specialist services for young people, detox treatment in hospitals, and rehab programmes in specialist facilities. \nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, she said people dependent on drugs were stigmatised when they should be treated as having a chronic health condition, in the same way as someone with diabetes.\nShe said a change of attitude and culture was needed so that when an addict completes a treatment programme, they are given ongoing support, rather than being discharged immediately with no follow up care. \nLena Larsen from Merseyside says she became addicted to heroin \"within a few days\" after she started taking it aged 19.\nThe 46-year old says she managed to stop taking the drug in 2002 without going through any recovery treatment, but later started using again after entering an abuse relationship.\n\"Although I'd stopped the drugs, I hadn't changed anything,\" she says. \"For eight years I managed, but I'd not changed.\"\nShe adds she had \"never heard of recovery\" before a friend took her to a women's refuge and she started attending a specialist centre.\nShe adds that two and a half years later, her life is \"so much different from what it was\". She recently came off methadone, a heroin substitute, and also volunteers at the centre, helping other problem drug users.\n\"You need to engage in something, whatever route it is,\" she says.\n\"Putting the drugs down, that's easy, but you need to get involved in whatever it is\u2026 putting the drugs down isn't enough.\"\nDame Carol said many drug addicts committed minor crimes and then ended up in prison.\nShe said: \"I'm calling for there to be consideration within the criminal justice system and the probation system to think about diversion.\n\"We know that we used to have many more people diverted into appropriate treatment.\n\"The numbers have decreased because we don't have the quality and the quantity of treatment to permit this to happen with good results.\"\nNic Adamson, the executive director of drug recovery organisation Change, Grow, Live welcomed the idea of a more health-based approach.\nShe said: \"Drug use doesn't come in isolation, it's part of a much broader societal issue in relation to deprivation and poverty and the broader range of health issues that come with it.\n\"Talking about it as a health condition means it's much easier for us to access the broader range of help that people need.\"\nDame Carol said a recent pledge to spend an extra \u00a380m on treatments in England was welcome, but should lead to further spending pledges this autumn.\nAnd she welcomed the announcement by ministers of  a Joint Combating Drugs Unit as providing \"a very fair chance to deliver\" on her recommendations.\nDame Carol's review also called for:\nThe Local Government Association, which represents council leaders in England, said funding for treatment services had \"not kept pace with demand\".\nDrug-related deaths in England and Wales reached their highest level since records began in 2019, the last year for which figures are available.\nThis marks a 52% increase in drug-related deaths in the past 10 years. \nIn total, there were 4,393 drug poisoning deaths, of which about two thirds (2,883) were related to \"drug misuse,\" according to the Office for National Statistics. The rest include accidents and suicides."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nFully-vaccinated UK residents arriving in England from amber travel list destinations will no longer have to quarantine from 19 July, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has announced. Travellers will, however, still need to pay for Covid tests before and after their return. Under-18s returning from amber list places would also be exempt from quarantine. Northern Ireland will follow suit from 26 July while both Scotland and Wales have said they will consider whether to follow this latest rule change. Find out more about how you can prove you've had both jabs.\nCoronavirus infections are rising in Tokyo as the 23 July opening ceremony of the Olympic Games edges closer. Because of the increasing number of cases, Olympics Minister Tamayo Marukawa says the Games will be held without spectators. A state of emergency in Tokyo will run throughout the Games, to combat coronavirus, from 12 July to 22 August. There has been widespread opposition to the Games in Japan, with calls for them to be postponed or cancelled.\nScotland's First Minister Nichola Sturgeon says the recent surge of Covid-19 cases in Scotland may be levelling off. A further 2,802 positive cases were recorded on Thursday, with Ms Sturgeon saying there is an \"apparent slowdown\" in the rise in infections. This gives her cause for optimism that Scotland can move to level zero of restrictions on 19 July, she says. Read more about the roadmap for lifting measures across the UK.\nPlanned elective operations at hospitals in Leeds are being postponed due to staff dealing with a rise in Covid-19 patients. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs eight hospitals, says there is a \"significant demand\" for services including in the emergency departments. Meanwhile, in Londonderry a number of planned surgeries have been postponed, with the Western Trust saying it has experienced a \"sudden increase\" in Covid-19 cases at Derry's Altnagelvin hospital over the last 48 hours. As Covid-19 cases increase across the UK, hospitalisation numbers remain relatively low compared to previous waves.\nCare home residents in Wales have joined forces with artists to tell their story of the coronavirus lockdown. The Tell Me More project encourages residents from several different homes to talk about what it was like to live in a care home during lockdown. Margaret Wilson, 92, lives on Anglesey and said she felt \"lost and lonely\" at times.

      "tags": "South Africa,Jacob Zuma",
      "text": "South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma has handed himself in to police to begin serving a 15-month jail sentence for contempt of court.\nHe was admitted to Estcourt Correctional Centre in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday.\nPolice had warned that they were prepared to arrest him if he did not hand himself in by midnight.\nZuma, 79, was handed the jail term last week after he failed to attend a corruption inquiry.\nThe sentencing sparked an unprecedented legal drama in South Africa, which has never seen a former president jailed before.\nZuma had initially refused to hand himself in, but in a short statement on Wednesday, the Jacob Zuma Foundation said he had \"decided to comply\".\nHis daughter, Dudu Zuma-Sambudla, later wrote on Twitter that her father was \"en route [to the jail] and he is still in high spirits\".\nZuma was sentenced on 29 June for defying an instruction to give evidence at an inquiry into corruption during his nine years in power. He has testified only once at the inquiry into what has become known as \"state capture\" - meaning the siphoning off of state assets.\nBusinessmen have been accused of conspiring with politicians to influence the decision-making process while he was in office. But Zuma has repeatedly said that he is the victim of a political conspiracy.\nIn a separate legal matter, Zuma pleaded not guilty last month in a corruption trial involving a $5bn (\u00a33bn) arms deal from the 1990s.\nThough he was forced out of office by his own party in 2018, the African National Congress (ANC), he retains a loyal body of supporters, especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal.\nOn Sunday, crowds formed what they called a human shield outside Zuma's palatial home in an effort to prevent his arrest. Similar crowds gathered before he handed himself in on Wednesday.\nAnalysis by Farouk Chothia, BBC News\nZuma was once an illustrious political figure, who was jailed for fighting the racist system of apartheid in South Africa. \nNow, he has been arrested for being contemptuous of South Africa's most senior judges - the guardians of the democracy he fought for - as he tried to evade accountability over the deluge of corruption allegations he faced during his presidency.  \nIt is an ignominious end to Zuma's political career, but a proud moment for South Africa's democracy. It shows that no-one is above the law - not even a former president. \nHis supporters threatened to block any attempt by police to arrest him, but in the end they did not have to. The 79-year-old surrendered, knowing he could not defeat the might of the state.\nThe BBC's Nomsa Maseko, who was outside Zuma's home on Wednesday, noted that there was a large police presence outside the property that included armed officers and a paramilitary unit.\nA delegation of senior officers are believed to have spent several hours inside the residence negotiating with the former president over his arrest.\nA convoy of cars, one of which was carrying Zuma, was then seen leaving the house at high-speed shortly before the midnight deadline for his detention.\nZuma previously declared that he was prepared to go to prison. \nHowever, he said that \"sending me to jail during the height of a pandemic, at my age, is the same as sentencing me to death\"."

      "tags": "World Health Organization (WHO),Medicine,Interpol,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Growing numbers of fake medicines linked to coronavirus are on sale in developing countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.\nA BBC News investigation found fake drugs for sale in Africa, with counterfeiters exploiting growing gaps in the market. \nThe WHO said taking these drugs could have \"serious side effects\". \nOne expert warned of \"a parallel pandemic, of substandard and falsified products\".\nAround the world, people are stockpiling basic medicines. However, with the world's two largest producers of medical supplies - China and India - in lockdown, demand now outstrips the supply and the circulation of dangerous counterfeit drugs is soaring. \nIn the same week the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus a pandemic last month, Operation Pangea, Interpol's global pharmaceutical crime fighting unit, made 121 arrests across 90 countries in just seven days, resulting in the seizure of dangerous pharmaceuticals worth over $14m (\u00a311m). \nFrom Malaysia to Mozambique, police officers confiscated tens of thousands of counterfeit face masks and fake medicines, many of which claimed to be able to cure coronavirus. \n\"The illicit trade in such counterfeit medical items during a public health crisis, shows a total disregard for people's lives,\" said Interpol's Secretary General Jurgen Stock. \nAccording to the WHO, the broader falsified medicines trade, which includes medicines which may be contaminated, contain the wrong or no active ingredient, or may be out-of-date, is worth more than $30bn in low and middle-income countries. \n\"Best case scenario they [fake medicines] probably won't treat the disease for which they were intended\", said Pernette Bourdillion Esteve, from the WHO team dealing with falsified medical products. \n\"But worst-case scenario they'll actively cause harm, because they might be contaminated with something toxic.\" \nThe global pharmaceutical industry is worth more than $1 trillion. Vast supply chains stretch all the way from key manufacturers in places such as China and India, to packaging warehouses in Europe, South America or Asia, to distributors sending medicines to every country in the world. \nThere is \"probably nothing more globalised than medicine\" said Esteve. However, as the world goes into lockdown, the supply chain has already begun to uncouple. \nSeveral pharmaceutical companies in India told the BBC they are now operating at 50-60% of their normal capacity. As Indian companies supply 20% of all basic medicines to Africa, nations there are being disproportionately affected. \nEphraim Phiri, a pharmacist in Zambia's capital Lusaka, said he was already feeling the strain. \n\"Medicines are already running out and we are not replenishing them. There is nothing we can do. It's been really hard to get supplies... especially essential medicines like antibiotics and antimalarials.\"\nProducers and suppliers are also struggling as the raw ingredients to manufacture tablets are now so expensive, some companies can simply not afford to keep going. \nOne producer in Pakistan said he used to buy the raw ingredients for an antimalarial drug called hydrochloroquine for about $100 a kilo. But today, the cost has increased to $1,150 a kilo. \nWith an increasing number of countries going into lockdown, it's not only the reduction in production that's problematic, it's also the increase in demand, as people around the world anxiously stockpile basic medicines. \nIt's this unstable combination of reduced supply and increased demand that has led the WHO to warn of a dangerous spike in the production and sales of fake drugs.  \n\"When the supply does not meet the demand,\" said Esteve, from the WHO, \"it creates an environment where poorer quality or fake medicines will try to meet that demand.\"\nSpeaking to pharmacists and drug companies around the world, the global supply of antimalarials is now under threat. \nEver since US President Donald Trump began referring to the potential of chloroquine and a related derivative, hydroxychloroquine, in White House briefings, there has been a global surge in the demand for these drugs, which are normally used to tackle malaria. \nThe WHO has repeatedly said there is no definitive evidence that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine can be used against the virus that causes Covid-19. However, at a recent news conference, whilst referring to these antimalarials, President Trump said: \"What do you have to lose? Take it.\"  \nAs the demand has soared, the BBC has discovered large quantities of fake chloroquine in circulation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. The WHO has also found the fake medicines for sale in Niger.\nThe antimalarial chloroquine is normally sold for about $40 for a pot of 1,000 tablets. But pharmacists in the DRC were found to be selling them for up to $250. \nThe medicine being sold was allegedly manufactured in Belgium, by \"Brown and Burk Pharmaceutical limited\". However, Brown and Burk, a pharmaceutical company registered in the UK, said they had \"nothing to do with this medicine. We don't manufacture this drug, it's fake.\"\nAs the coronavirus pandemic continues, Professor Paul Newton, an expert in fake medicines at the University of Oxford, warned the circulation of fake and dangerous medicines would only increase unless governments around the world present a united front. \n\"We risk a parallel pandemic, of substandard and falsified products unless we all ensure that there is a global co-ordinated plan for co-ordinated production, equitable distribution and the surveillance of the quality of the tests, medicines and vaccines. Otherwise the benefits of modern medicine... will be lost.\"\nIllustrations by Jilla Dastmalchi"

      "tags": "Epilepsy,Mesh implants,NHS",
      "text": "Baroness Julia Cumberlege, who led a critical review into how the health service has treated female patients, says she is angry and frustrated not enough progress has been made.\nHer 2020 report looked into two drugs and a medical device which caused women or their babies harm.\nIt made a list of recommendations to support victims and prevent future, avoidable damage. \nThe four UK governments are still considering the recommendations.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care in England plans to fully respond later this year. \nBaroness Cumberlege and her team spent two years speaking to more than 700 women and their families who experienced complications linked to three treatments.\nThe first is sodium valproate. This is an epilepsy drug which, if taken during pregnancy, can increase a baby's risk of developmental disorders and physical abnormalities. Campaigners say women are still not being properly warned of the risks.\nThe second is pelvic mesh implants, which are used to treat prolapse and incontinence. However, complications can cause debilitating pain \"like shards of glass inside the body\". The procedure is only offered on the NHS in exceptional circumstances.\nFinally primodos - a hormonal pregnancy test thought to be associated with birth defects and miscarriages, something manufacturer, Schering, now part of Bayer, denies. It was withdrawn from the market in 1978.\nThe First Do No Harm report concluded thousands of lives were ruined because officials failed to listen to female patients. \nIt made nine recommendations, but only two of them have been fully implemented.\nThese are a government apology to the victims and the promise to introduce Patient Safety Commissioners, an advocate for patients, in England and Scotland.\n\"If all our recommendations are not implemented, avoidable harm will continue to be performed,\" says Baroness Cumberlege. \"I hoped we would have achieved so much more in this past year. I am very angry and frustrated. \n\"These people are still suffering and need care and compassion. I will take their heartbreaking stories to my grave.\" \nBaroness Cumberlege is urging the government to reconsider its decision to rule out setting up a Redress Agency, which would compensate women and families for the suffering they have experienced. \nThe government is, however, looking at setting up a payment scheme that would cover the cost of providing additional care and support for those affected.\nLawyers representing families agree with both recommendations and have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Sajid Javid, asking him to implement them.\nLike thousands of women, Leanne Matthews was never warned of the risks of taking sodium valproate during her three pregnancies. Her children were all born with many health and learning problems, and she fears for their future without financial support.\n\"It's going to be worrying when we're not here,\" she says.\nHer husband Warren agrees: \"What jobs are they going to do? What prospects do they have? As soon as you put down on your CV that you've got multiple medical conditions, who's going to employ you? \n\"When the buffer of mum and dad is gone, it's going to be the eldest daughter who has to take that responsibility, which she shouldn't have to do. She's got her own problems.\"\nBaroness Cumberlege also recommended that specialist centres should be set up to help women who have experienced complications following a pelvic mesh procedure, and to provide care for those affected by medications taken during pregnancy.\nSeven mesh centres have now been set up in England, and one in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde - but the other point is still being considered.\nAlison Jackson, from Swadlincote in South Derbyshire, used to be a keen runner, but after having mesh fitted she could hardly walk. \nTwo weeks ago, she had her implant removed at one of the new centres, and would like to see more people benefit.  \n\"The referral process should be easier and there should be more sites, though only if there are enough surgeons with the right expertise,\" she said. \n\"Mesh removal is like getting chewing gum out of hair. I know women who have been left with permanent nerve damage. There's no guarantee I will get better, but any improvement is a good thing.\"\nAlison also wants the specialist services to be extended to all mesh-injured patients, such as hernia and rectopexy.\nTwelve months after the Cumberlege review was released, the chair of the Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests says she's losing confidence the government will make all of the recommendations law.\nMarie Lyon was prescribed primodos and later gave birth to a daughter whose limbs were not fully formed. \n\"It will all be down to money and what can they get away with,\" she says. \n\"That is betraying all future patients of the NHS, which is a disgrace.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There have been 16 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 155,000 people have died, government figures show.  \nHowever, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. \nSo far, 91% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have had their first vaccine dose, 84% have had their second and 65% have had a booster. \nFind out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:\nIf you can't see the look-up click here.\nAfter a sharp increase in December, daily confirmed cases fell during the first half of January, and now appear to be levelling off. \nA further 62,399 confirmed cases were announced on Sunday.\nGovernment figures do not include people who test positive more than once - except in Wales. Some experts suggest this means the official figures are lower than the actual number of daily cases in the UK. \nHowever reinfections more than 90 days after a previous positive result are expected to be included in the data from 31 January.\nRestrictions were put in place across the UK to deal with the emergence of the Omicron variant but they are now being eased. You can use our postcode look-up to check what the rules are where you live.\nThe red and orange areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. The map's key was updated on 21 December to allow for rising case numbers. \nMore than 52 million people, 91% of those aged 12 and over in the UK, have now received a first dose of a vaccine. \nThe number of people who have received a second vaccine dose is more than 48 million, or 84% of people aged 12 and over.\nSo far, more than 37 million booster doses have been administered across the UK, with 31 million in England, 3.3 million in Scotland, 1.9 million in Wales and 940,000 in Northern Ireland. \nThe UK Health Security Agency has warned that two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant, but their scientists also say a booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid. \nThe average daily number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test increased in early January, but figures have started to stabilise.\nThere were 75 deaths counted in this way reported on Sunday.\nOf those deaths, there were 75 in England, eight in Wales and two in Scotland. No figures were reported for Northern Ireland.\nThe BBC's Head of Statistics Robert Cuffe says most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be down to \"coincidental\" Covid - people whose death may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. \nWith the high proportion of infections in the population over the past month, the number of coincidental cases would be expected to increase.\nFigures for doctors registering a death and recording what caused it will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemic's death toll - but these take longer to be published and it will be a while before we get a complete picture. \nThe most recent government figures for the whole of the UK show 16,149 people with coronavirus were in hospital on 27 January, down from 18,065 a week earlier.\nOf those in hospital with coronavirus, 549 are in mechanical ventilation beds - using ventilators to help them breathe - down from 664 a week earlier. \nThe number of hospital patients remains well below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January last year. \nThe number of patients in hospital with coronavirus increased in almost every area of the UK during December and early January. \nWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. \nFirst, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is more than 155,000.\nAccording to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen nearly 177,000 deaths in total - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. \nThe third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was about 150,000 as of 14 January.\nIn total, there were 15,257 deaths registered in the week to 14 January, which was five percent below the five-year average.\nOf the total deaths, 1,557 were related to coronavirus, up from 1,023 in the previous week.\nThe \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. \nIf R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. \nThe government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. \nThe latest R number estimate for England and Scotland  is 0.7 to 0.9, for Wales it is 1.1 to 1.5 and for Northern Ireland it is 1.1 to 1.3.

      "title": "Covid: Millions could be self-isolating between now and 16 August",
      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The delay to ending quarantine for fully vaccinated contacts of people with Covid could lead to millions being asked to self-isolate this summer. \nThe knock-on for the economy and workplaces, including the NHS, could be huge, ministers are being warned.\nThe government says close contacts who are double-jabbed will not have to isolate after 16 August in England.\nBut BBC analysis shows more than 4.5 million people could still be asked to self-isolate between now and then. \nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Keir Starmer accused Boris Johnson of \"ignoring the next big problem that's heading down the track\" as he said \"millions\" would have to self-isolate as cases rose.\n\"It won't feel like freedom day to those who have to isolate, when they're having to cancel their holidays, when they can't go to the pub or even to their kid's sports day,\" he said.\nMr Johnson said the country was \"moving to a system of testing rather than self-isolation\".\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said the system was already causing \"carnage\". And chief executive Kate Nicholls added the government's plans did not go \"far enough, quickly enough\".\nHospital bosses have also expressed concern.\nNHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said: \"Trust leaders know self-isolation requirements are an ongoing source of frustration for some staff, particularly amongst those who have had both vaccinations, tested negative and want to support their colleagues at a time when there is very high pressure on staffing levels. \n\"There is a major risk that this situation will become more challenging after 19 July when all remaining restrictions are lifted, with the expectation that even more NHS staff will have to self-isolate as community infections rates spike. This is a real current cause of concern amongst trust leaders.\"\nA conservative guess is that we might see 1.5 million cases in the four weeks after 19 July - that would be just over 50,000 cases a day on average. \nAbout three close contacts have been identified for every Covid case reported, according to Test and Trace figures for England in the last month.\nSo, 1.5 million cases, each with about three contacts, gives us between four and five million contacts who might be asked to isolate between 19 July and 16 August.\nAnd, once restrictions are lifted on 19 July and society opens up further, we might expect to see the numbers of contacts to rise.      \nThis is a very rough calculation. The true figures could, of course, be lower or even higher. \nBut it's looking increasingly clear that millions of people will be close contacts of people with coronavirus and legally required to self-isolate in the weeks before England changes the rules.\nSo why are we doing it? Clearly there is a risk scrapping the self-isolation policy would push up the infection rate.\nThe hope is in another month the rise in cases will have peaked and the change would not be as risky.\nEngland is seeing close to 25,000 cases a day on average with cases doubling every 10 days.\nAnd with the remaining restrictions - such as social distancing, limits on the gatherings and the need to wear masks - set to be lifted on 19 July, ministers have warned the public they need to be braced for very high infection levels.\nOn Tuesday Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned there could be as many as 100,000 cases a day.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has conceded the plan to keep self-isolation requirements in place after the end of other restrictions in England was \"not a perfect solution\".\nHe added: \"You can't have it both ways. On the one hand we're saying we want to reopen but we're giving a measure of precaution in terms of delaying the lifting of self-isolation restrictions.\n\"It's a balance, it's not a perfect solution.\"\nUnder-18s, who are not currently entitled to the vaccine, will also no longer be required to self-isolate from 16 August if they are close contacts of a confirmed Covid case in England. \nOther parts of the UK are also seeing rising rates, which will mean many people will be asked to self-isolate. But those nations have not announced what they plan to do about self-isolation as they open up.\nSelf-isolation for people who have symptoms will still be required in England.\nIt is defined by the government as a person who has been close to someone who has tested positive for Covid.\nIt can be anyone who:\nYou can be deemed a contact any time from two days before the person who tested positive developed their symptoms - or, if they did not have any symptoms, from two days before the date their positive test was taken."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Scotland Education,Coronavirus pandemic,Shirley-Anne Somerville",
      "text": "The Scottish government has not yet decided whether to follow England in changing the self-isolation rules for school pupils and people who have been double vaccinated. \nScotland's education secretary said the government was \"looking very seriously\" at whether it can make changes.\nShirley-Anne Somerville said decisions would be taken \"as soon as we can\".\nBut she said any decision would be based on the clinical advice and guidance the government is given.\nThe UK government announced on Tuesday that fully vaccinated people in England will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid from 16 August.\nThe same policy will also apply to anyone under the age of 18 from that date, while the system of \"bubbles\" in schools that sees pupils being sent home after a positive case will also be axed.\nThere have been calls for the Scottish government to introduce similar changes north of the border, where thousands of pupils have missed out on learning due to having to self-isolate. \nMs Somerville told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the absence rates in Scottish schools was about 4% at the end of the school term.\nBut only 3% of those actually had Covid - with the vast majority of absent pupils only being off school because they had to self-isolate after someone else tested positive. \nMeanwhile, researchers from the London School of Economics and the University of Exeter have found that pupils in Scotland lost out on an average of 64 days of learning time during the pandemic - about a third of the school year.\nThey also concluded that the poorest pupils suffered larger learning losses than their richer peers.\nMs Somerville said this was why the government was \"looking very seriously about whether we can make to changes to the self-isolation measures that are in place for children and young people as we move into the next academic year\".\nShe said following England in scrapping school bubbles was \"certainly one option\" that was being explored by the Covid Education Recovery Group.\nBut she added: \"I think people would expect us to go through that due process to make sure that parents, young people and staff have the confidence that the guidance we are putting together is fit for purpose, and that we've worked through that process together.\"\nMs Somerville also said potentially having different isolation rules for fully vaccinated people was being \"actively reviewed\" as a potential way of easing staffing pressures in hospitals, schools and other public services.\nRaigmore Hospital in Inverness was placed on \"code black\" status earlier this week after reaching capacity amid increasing Covid cases, with the local health board saying the pressure was partly due to large numbers of staff having to self-isolate.\nHowever, Ms Somerville stressed that the government also had a duty to protect those who have not had both doses.\nShe said: \"This is something that would benefit different parts of the population, different sectors of the economy. \n\"But again we must look at the evidence, we must look to see whether that's the right thing to do at this point of the virus because the virus is very much still here.\"\nMeanwhile, all travel restrictions between Scotland and the north west of England are to be lifted, with the ban on non-essential trips to Blackburn with Darwen to expire at midnight.\nAnd Scotland's health secretary has defended taking a family holiday to the Harry Potter studios near London during Scotland's surge in Covid cases.\nHumza Yousaf said he would not apologise for spending time with his family as they have seen very little of him over the last seven months.\nDetails of the trip were revealed by the Scottish Sun newspaper. \nScottish Conservative chief whip Stephen Kerr questioned whether it was appropriate for the health secretary to \"disappear\" while Scotland continues to have some of the highest Covid rates in Europe.\nMr Kerr said: \"People are continuing to make huge sacrifices to ensure we can return to normality and that will include missing out on holidays.\""

      "text": "The Scottish government has announced a further easing of the Covid rules.\nGuidance urging people to work from home wherever possible is to be relaxed in favour of a \"hybrid\" system of office and remote working from Monday 31 January.\nRestrictions on large outdoor events came to an end on 17 January, then rules on indoor events and venues, including the need for table service in hospitality premises, were lifted on 24 January.\nNew guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday 31 January.\nThis will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.\nBusinesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.\nThe requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - will be reduced from 2m to 1m from 31 January.\nAnd face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.\nFrom Friday 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland.\nThose who are not fully vaccinated will still have to take a pre-departure test no more than two days before they travel, then take a PCR test on or before day two after their arrival.\nA raft of new measures introduced in December in response to the spread of the Omicron variant have already been removed.\nThese included limits on the number of people who could attend large public events; restrictions in pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places; and the closure of nightclubs.\nAdults and children aged 12 and over still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as before, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport.\nBusinesses are legally required to take steps to reduce the spread of Covid, including physical distancing and screens.\nIn hospitality, face coverings can be removed while dancing, drinking and dining. Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Coronavirus cases in the UK have risen above 30,000 for first time since January, official figures show.\nWednesday's data showed there had been a further 32,548 confirmed Covid cases.\nAnd there were another 33 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test.\nIt comes as Boris Johnson has defended the government's approach to easing England's lockdown, saying the link between infection and serious disease and death has been \"severed\". \nThe prime minister has pledged to scrap most of England's coronavirus regulations at step four of the roadmap out of lockdown, expected on 19 July.\nIt means the government is now braced for a surge in coronavirus cases, possibly around 100,000 a day, as restrictions are lifted.\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said it was \"certainly true\" there was a \"wave of cases because of the Delta variant\" of the virus.\n\"But scientists are also absolutely clear that we have severed the link between infection and serious disease and death,\" he said.\n\"Currently there are only a 30th of the deaths that we were seeing at an equivalent position in previous waves of this pandemic.\"\nHowever, on Monday the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance was more cautious, saying vaccines had \"weakened the link between cases and hospitalisations, but it's a weakened link, not a completely broken link\".\nWednesday's daily figure for Covid cases in the UK is above 30,000 for the first time since 24 January.\nIn terms of hospitalisations, England is seeing more than 330 admissions a day on average at the moment. The most recent day - Monday - saw 416 admitted.\nAs of Wednesday, 2,144 people are in hospital in England with Covid - the first time this figure has topped 2,000 since April.\nWednesday's case total represents an increase from 28,700 on Tuesday. \nIt is not unusual for there to be a big jump on a Wednesday as a result of a weekend effect - slightly less testing is done.\nWhat's important is the trend. Week on week this represents a 43% rise. That is actually down on what has been seen recently. They are going up quickly, but not as quickly as last week.\nIt's too early to say whether that is part of a longer-term pattern. But what is certain is that government officials are watching this data like hawks.\nThe policy of opening up in England is based on the hope that the virus will soon hit the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection.\nMinisters have said we should be prepared to see 100,000 cases a day. But they are hoping this wave of infection peaks well before that.\nBecause while the vaccination programme has weakened the link between cases and hospitalisation, it has not broken it entirely.\nOn current trends that many infections would lead to 2,000 daily admissions - twice what the NHS would normally see in the depths of winter for all types of respiratory illness.\nThe PM has also defended the timescale for ending self-isolation for contacts of Covid, insisting it is a \"sensible approach\".\nThe government has said people who are fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 from 16 August.\nGiving evidence to the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson rejected the suggestion 16 August had been chosen because it was when the government expected the population to have reached herd immunity .\n\"That's not the consideration\u2026 it's the time by which we feel that there will have been much more progress on vaccination,\" he said.\nAnd the PM said to do it any sooner would \"effectively be allowing many more people to be vector of disease.\"\n\"All decisions are a balance of risk,\" he said.\nAsked how many people the government expected to end up self-isolating over the next month, he said: \"That will depend on the spread. I haven't seen any data on that. It will depend on the numbers.\"\nMeanwhile, World Health Organization emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan has urged countries to use extreme caution when reopening their economies from Covid restrictions so as \"not to lose the gains you have made\".\nAsked at a briefing if the UK was aiming for herd immunity, Dr Ryan said: \"I'm not aware that that's the logic driving our colleagues in the United Kingdom, I suspect it's not.\nHe said the argument that it was better to infect more people was morally empty and epidemiologically stupid.\nLabour's leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned the prime minister he is leading the country into a \"summer of chaos and confusion\" over plans to ease lockdown.\nAt PMQs, he said the country should open up \"in a controlled way\" and urged Mr Johnson to ensure masks still have to be worn on public transport.\nFace masks will no longer be legally required and distancing rules will be scrapped at the final stage of England's Covid lockdown roadmap. \nThe lifting of rules on 19 July will be confirmed next Monday after a review of the latest data."

      "tags": "Rishi Sunak,Economic growth,UK economy,Office for Budget Responsibility",
      "text": "Former England striker Alan Shearer has told the BBC that England's success in the Euro 2020 tournament so far has given the country \"joy\", \"relief\" and \"hope\" after a tough 18 months. \nBut could this feelgood factor translate into an economic boost for the country as well?\nAfter the team reached its first major men's football final in 55 years on Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he expected to see a \"bounce\" in consumer confidence because of the tournament. \nSome businesses, however, say social distancing rules are stopping them from fully reaping the benefits. \nSimon French, chief economist at brokers Panmure Gordon, told the BBC that he agreed England's success could boost economic growth, alongside other factors. \nPart of this would be the impact of spending on hospitality as people watched games, something he estimates could contribute a relatively small \u00a3150m to UK GDP.\nBut, he added: \"If a victory on one day coalesces with a broader feelgood factor, like we saw during during Euro 96 or the 2012 Olympics, it could boost consumer sentiment.\n\"The difference this time is that UK households have a lot of pent-up savings due to the pandemic - we estimate about \u00a320bn - and the speed with which they are spent is closely linked to consumer sentiment. \n\"Winning the final, along with lots of other things, like reopening, the easing of restrictions, could help unlock many billions of pounds worth of additional spending.\" \nIndependent economist Julian Jessop is more cautious, however. \nHe tweeted: \"I'd love to say winning #euro2020 will boost the UK economy (or at least the English bits), but it wouldn't change any of the fundamentals.\n\"And clearly [it would be] trumped by everything else going on, especially the lifting of Covid restrictions.\"\nRetail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth thinks it will be a \"massive\" weekend for the supermarkets, with the final due to be played on Sunday evening. She also expects a mini spending boom on items such as cars and homeware if England win, as well as a boost to productivity. \n\"We have gone through a period of misery which makes consumer sentiment quite low so people don't splash out,\" she said. \n\"But the vaccine programme is working which is massive source of hope. People in employment are feeling OK thanks to furlough. And now we have this massive confidence boost from the football which makes us all feel more positive and pull together.\"\nThe boss of beer, wines and spirits at Co-op, Simon Cairns, says the supermarket chain expects a \"bumper weekend\" ahead of the final on Sunday.\n\"We are expecting to sell and additional one million drinks on Sunday alone compared to our normal trading, which is twice what we could normally expect to sell,\" he told the BBC.\n\"If yesterday is anything go by those sales will be dominated by beer and cider. And in a nod to our Italian opponents we are expecting to see some bumper sales of things like Prosecco - a quarter of a million bottles we're expecting to sell between now and the end of Sunday.\" \nHe added that sales of snacks, burgers and barbecues were also expected to soar - as well as champagne sales - if England triumph.\nHowever, not everyone expects to reap the full economic benefits of the Euros. Simon Emeny, boss of pub and hotel operator Fuller, Smith & Turner, told the BBC that despite \"fantastic\" takings on Wednesday night, social distancing rules and capacity constraints had curbed profits. \n\"This is why 19 July [when Covid rules end] can't come soon enough for the sector,\" he said. \n\"Even [during the final] on Sunday, when our pubs will be pretty busy, we're operating at seriously reduced capacity and we just won't be able to satisfy demand.\"\nThe British Beer & Pub Association expects England fans to enjoy more than 13 million extra pints on Sunday. But it said the figure would be closer to 17 million - worth \u00a39m in lost sales - if social distancing rules were removed. \nAnnette Powell and her husband John run the Kenilworth Pub near Manchester and agree that the restrictions have capped profit during the tournament. \nHaving to provide table service for all customers has meant doubling their number of staff to take around two-thirds of their normal takings - which would have been around \u00a312,000 for the match on Wednesday.\nThe Kenilworth also only fits a maximum of 160 customers with social distancing and has had to turn away at least another 150 on match days. \n\"We've had to upset a lot of loyal customers,\" Annette said. \"The Euros are a huge boost, it's just unfortunate it isn't what it could have been.\"\nHowever, Oliver Thain, who runs eight pubs and restaurants in Cambridgeshire, said he was hopeful the tournament's feelgood factor would last. \nHe said the tournament had \"made hardly any difference\" to his largely food-based businesses and only two of his venues had screened games. \nBut he thinks bookings will pick up as consumers feel more confident and the country continues to unlock.\n\"Sport can really up the country's spirit, so though it's difficult to put a figure on, the Euros certainly can't do any harm.\""

      "text": "A temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours has been met with backlash from the industry who say the government is applying a \"sticking plaster\" to driver shortage problems.  \nHGV drivers can increase their daily driving limits from nine to 10 hours or change weekly rest patterns on Monday.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the move would give flexibility to drivers to make slightly longer trips.\nBut the Road Haulage Association said the move wouldn't make any difference.\nThe RHA believes there is currently a shortfall of about 60,000 lorry drivers and said the relaxation on driving hour limits was a \"sticking plaster\".\nIt estimates that some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the Covid pandemic.\n\"Relaxing drivers' hours won't make any material difference - and fails to address the underlying issues, which require a package of measures to fix,\" the RHA said.\nThe national officer for road transport at Unite the union, Adrian Jones, also said the announcement would do nothing to resolve the problem of driver shortages.\nHe added: \"Unite will be advising its members to not place themselves in danger and that if they are too tired to drive safely, they have a legal right to refuse to do so. \n\"Unite will fully support those who make that decision, legally and industrially.\"\nLogistics UK, which represents freight businesses, said longer hours would \"heap more pressure on drivers who are already stretched to the limit to deliver\". \nJames Firth, of Logistics UK, said the industry \"vehemently opposed the extension\" and said the government had \"ignored the will of those who will be most affected by the changes\".\n\"Existing drivers have been working flat out since the start of the pandemic, and this could be the final straw for many of them,\" he said.\n\"Instead of trying to paper over the gaps, government should be working with industry to produce a plan to support moving drivers through the current bottleneck of HGV driving tests.\"\nBusinesses and union officials have warned that the driver shortage jeopardises deliveries to supermarkets and other sectors of the economy.\nThe haulage industry is one of a number of sectors having trouble finding suitable staff as the economy reopens, leading some experts to talk of the UK's missing workers.\nAmong those worried is German confectionery giant Haribo, which has said it is struggling to deliver its sweets to shops in the UK. \nMr Shapps said the government had \"ramped up\" the number of driving tests available and would consider other measures.\nThe government said driver safety must not be compromised and operators must notify the Department for Transport if the relaxation is used.\nThe RHA's chief executive, Richard Burnett, said it opposed wholesale extensions to drivers' hours, believing they could be counter-productive by making the job less attractive. \n\"Loading more hours on to drivers that are already exhausted is not the answer - the problem needs more than just a sticking plaster,\" he added.\n\"Ministers should be mindful that road safety is the reason HGV drivers' hours are limited. Relaxing them should only be used as a last resort to resolve short-term issues that cannot be addressed in other ways.\"\nMr Burnett said that as the shortage worsened, drivers' pay rates were going up, often substantially.\n\"Suppliers and retailers should be prepared that these additional costs will be passed on,\" he added. \nA government spokesperson said it had \"already taken action on HGV driver shortages, including ramping up vocational test capacity, and funding apprenticeships\".\n\"Most of the solutions, however, are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity,\" they added."

      "text": "The planned dates for easing Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland are \"not set in stone\", Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nThe first minister said it would not be responsible to have a guaranteed timetable in the face of the virus, after another day of high case numbers.\nScotland is due to move to level zero on 19 July, before dropping almost all restrictions on 9 August.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon said she would look very carefully at the latest data before confirming this would happen.\nThe Scottish Parliament is to be recalled from recess on 13 July for MSPs to be updated on whether the timetable will go ahead as planned.\nA further 3,799 cases of Covid-19 were recorded in Scotland on Wednesday, breaking a trend of five consecutive days where numbers fell from the record highs seen the previous week.\nMs Sturgeon said case numbers were \"much higher than we want them to be\", but said it could still be the case that the recent increase was stabilising.\nShe said: \"We are literally monitoring the data on a daily basis right now, as we head towards the review point next week where we will be able to say what our plans are for 19 July.\n\"We are looking at this very carefully. My biggest concern right now is that even though we are seeing a weakening of the link between cases and hospitalisations, if we have a high number of cases even a lower proportion of those cases ending up in hospital can put pressure on our NHS.\"\nThe first minister said restrictions would ultimately be eased, with the vaccine programme providing a clear route out of lockdown, but said it was important to do this \"at a sensible pace\".\nAsked if this meant the dates set out in the government's latest route map out of lockdown were not set in stone, she replied: \"Nothing, against a global pandemic of an infectious virus that has got more infectious and transmissible with the Delta variant, can be set in stone.\n\"I want as much as everybody does the certainty of 'by this date we will be free of everything and there will no longer be any restrictions'.\n\"Every part of me wants that and every part of me believes we are on a journey towards that and heading in that direction.\n\"But to set dates in stone while we still face that virus would not in my view be responsible. My job is to take hard decisions that get us as safely as possible to that end point.\"\nMeanwhile, opposition parties voiced alarm at the performance of the Test and Protect contact tracing system, after figures suggested it had fallen below the benchmark set for it by ministers.\nThe government wants the service to have completed contact tracing in 80% of cases within 72 hours of their being logged in the system.\nHowever the latest report from Public Health Scotland suggested that 26.8% of cases in the five days to 2 July had taken more than three days to close - down from 34.9% the previous week.\nScottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells said the system was clearly \"completely overwhelmed\" by the recent surge in cases.\nShe added: \"A robust Test and Protect system remains a critical tool in fighting the virus, but the SNP government have failed to ensure it has all the resources it needs.\"\nScottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said the Scottish government had \"lost control of the pandemic\", saying: \"Test and trace is in disarray and cases are spiralling - we cannot have the people of Scotland put in danger due to the failure of the SNP.\"\nContact tracers are now regularly facing as many cases in a day as they had to deal with in a week earlier in the pandemic.\nThey have moved to prioritise telephone interviews with cases where there is a \"high risk\" of transmissions, with many other people who test positive contacted via text message and asked to fill out an online form.\nMs Sturgeon acknowledged last week that the system was \"under pressure\" due to the surge in cases, but insisted it was \"coping well\".\nIt came after NHS Grampian warned that the increase in cases meant it would not be able to trace the contacts of everyone who tests positive."

Fewer than 30 destinations are on the green list - meaning travellers do not have to self-isolate when they get back to the UK but they do have to pay for Covid tests. \nMore than 50 countries are on the strictest red list, which requires arrivals to pay to self-isolate in a hotel for 10 days.\nBut most places - including several holiday hotspots such as mainland Spain, Greece and the US - are on the amber list. People returning from these countries must quarantine for 10 days and pay for tests.\nThe government has already said it was planning to scrap the need to quarantine for those who are double-jabbed and returning from amber countries.\nBut it has not set out how it would work, when it would happen, and whether unvaccinated children would also be able to avoid quarantine if their parents are fully vaccinated. \nIn addition to relaxing the rules around isolation for travellers, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that the health secretary was considering a \"more proportionate and balanced approach\" to isolation for Covid contacts.\nIt comes amid fears that surging cases across the UK will lead to millions of people being asked to self-isolate during the summer, even if they have been fully vaccinated.\n\"I recognise people's frustrations with this. I have spoken to the health secretary and he's also aware of this,\" Mr Sunak told BBC Breakfast.\n\"He's looking at the difference between the two systems [contact tracers and the NHS app] and seeing what might be a more proportionate and balanced approach to this.\"\nThe transport secretary's travel update in the House of Commons is due at 11:30 BST.\nThe UK government's traffic light system applies to England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland able to make their own rules. \nHowever, the rules are broadly the same and previous changes to the lists have been adopted by all four nations.\nMelanie Matheis lives in California. Her daughter Allana left to go to drama school in London in September, and a few months later Melanie's husband died after being diagnosed with cancer.\nAllana couldn't come back for her father's funeral or for Christmas because of the UK's travel restrictions.\n\"She wouldn't have been able to go back to school when she went back to London because of the quarantine,\" Melanie tells the BBC, \"so she made the difficult decision to stay there.\"\nShe adds: \"It was difficult for myself as well being alone.\"\nMelanie is double-jabbed and was hoping to visit her daughter in London this month, but has put it back by a few weeks once it became clear the rules were not changing. The US is on the UK's amber list, meaning Melanie would have to quarantine somewhere when she arrives. \nWithout a home here, she would have to pay for a hotel room and tests which she can't afford. \"It would be double the expense and it's just not really possible,\" she says. \"It would make it very difficult.\"\nThe travel industry is eager to have the rules relaxed. \nDaniel Pearce, the head of Travel Trade Gazette, a monthly magazine for the travel industry, said the industry had been \"crying out\" for quarantine exemptions.\nHe said he hoped changes would coincide with the wider easing of lockdown rules in England on 19 July., as that would allow the travel industry to capitalise on the family summer holiday market.\n\"Any change as early as this would enable some form of summer season to take place during the children's school holidays,\" he said.\nHowever, other groups are concerned about the plan to open up society further.\nIn a letter to medical journal The Lancet, more than 120 scientists and doctors have called on the UK government to rethink its plan to end restrictions in England on 19 July, calling it \"dangerous and premature\", saying millions more people will became infected if it goes ahead.\nThe government should wait until everyone, including adolescents, have been offered the vaccine before opening up, they say.\nThe traffic light system sets the rules travellers must follow on their return. But holidaymakers also need to check their destination's entry rules.\nFor example, all non-vaccinated travellers to mainland Portugal need a negative Covid test, and must quarantine for 14 days. Twelve to 17-year-olds travelling with fully-vaccinated parents don't have to quarantine but need a negative test. Under-11s are exempt.\nOnly fully-vaccinated adults can travel to Malta, and don't need a negative test. Children aged 5-11 can travel with fully-vaccinated adults, but need a negative test. Under-5s don't need a test. Unvaccinated 12 to 17-year olds can't enter. \nOver-12s travelling to Spain need a negative test or proof of vaccination. \nUnvaccinated travellers can only enter France for \"essential reasons\", and must self-isolate for seven days. Fully-vaccinated adults with a negative test can enter. Under-18s travelling with fully-vaccinated adults don't need to self-isolate.\nMore than 32,000 new coronavirus cases were announced on Wednesday, as well as 33 more deaths. \nNearly two-thirds of the adult population in the UK have received two jabs, and 86% have had a first dose.\nProf Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises ministers, stressed it was \"still very important\" to try to control the Delta variant, despite the success of the vaccine rollout.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"If we abandon general population social distancing measures as a means of control, then we will very likely see a massive peak of infections and, whilst the vaccines are excellent, they're not perfect.\n\"And so, if we get to a very small percentage of a massive number of cases getting hospitalised, that's still a very large number.\"\nThe government has said that public health remains its priority and it is taking a cautious approach to the resumption of international travel."

      "text": "\"If we were to open up in full swing it would be at least 12 jobs unfilled, but it's six unfilled at the moment.\" \nMark Lee runs the Red Lion Country Inn, a B&B in Yorkshire, but like many employers he cannot find enough staff. \nAccording to a survey of big recruitment firms, the number of permanent jobs available in England rose at its fastest rate since 1997 in June as the economy reopened. \nBut at the same time availability of workers hit a 24-year low. \nDespite advertising on a range of sites, Mr Lee has not received a single application for jobs posted. Before the pandemic, he would frequently receive 50 or more applications per advert. \nHe has also used agencies to find staff, but when he asked for a sous chef they could only provide an employee who had never worked in a catering kitchen before. Paying above minimum wage, Mr Lee employs waiters and cleaners on \u00a310 per hour, which increases to \u00a313 for a sous chef. \nKPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) polled 400 recruitment companies in June and found \"substantial increases\" in permanent and temporary job vacancies across the Midlands, the South, London and the North. \nThe steepest increase in demand was seen for permanent private sector staff, particularly in the IT and computing, hotel and catering, and engineering sectors.\nDemand was also \"historically strong\" across the public sector.\nHowever, the survey found the supply of candidates had fallen for the fourth month in a row. Recruiters blamed increased hiring, Brexit, pandemic-related uncertainty and the furlough scheme.  \nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, told the BBC's Today programme: \"We have seen the reopening of the economy and therefore there's a surge in demand, and not all the workers we were hoping to get are readily available. \n\"Some of them need to switch sector, some of them were looking after children before or were temporarily out of the jobs market. Some went into higher education or overseas.\"\nBrian Lord, chief executive of cybersecurity and intelligence consultancy PGI, has encountered the same issue in the IT sector. \n\"Covid has been the main driver in demand because remote working has meant more vulnerability for organisations,\" Mr Lord said.  \nIn June, PGI advertised 10 roles across its digital security teams but has only managed to fill two positions so far with the help of an in-house training academy.  \nMr Lord said the slow rate in hiring was due to potential employers \"invariably ending up in a bidding war\", which he said was often won by richer companies \"who are better able to absorb the increased overhead or more able to pass the increased cost on their client base\".  \n\"There is just no unemployment in the sector and supply is struggling to keep up,\" he added.\nManny Athwal, chief executive of the School of Coding in Wolverhampton, said employers have been contacting the school, which has 5,250 students, to recruit potential candidates before they even start courses.\nThe findings come despite the UK's unemployment rate remaining relatively high due to the pandemic, at 4.7% in the three months to April.\nGerwyn Davies from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said there was a danger of overhyping the shortages, with a fall in the number of young people currently in employed in the UK.  \nIn hospitality especially, Mr Davies said \"a perfect storm\" had occurred \"where we're seeing a demand for labour occur alongside a sharp fall in the stock of EU workers\".\n\"It's a question of employers having to work harder to recruit and train their staff rather than having no applicants,\" he added. \nREC chief executive Neil Carberry said: \"Recruiters are working flat out to fill roles across our economy. The jobs market is improving at the fastest pace we have ever seen, but it is still an unpredictable time. \n\"We can't yet tell how much the ending of furlough and greater candidate confidence will help to meet this rising demand for staff. In some key shortage sectors like hospitality, food, driving and IT, more support is likely to be needed to avoid slowing the recovery.\" "

      "tags": "Florida,Miami building collapse,Miami,United States",
      "text": "Rescue workers have now recovered all but one of the victims of the tower block that collapsed in Surfside, Florida, on 24 June. Ninety-seven people have been confirmed dead and only Estelle Hedaya is yet to be identified. \nThe search for victims was extremely slow, as rescuers had to sort through the rubble in sweltering heat and high humidity. \nHere is what we know about the victims.\nAntonio Lozano, 83, and his wife Gladys, 79, were among the first to be confirmed dead after their son Sergio Lozano gave officials a DNA sample. \nThey were about to celebrate their 59th wedding anniversary in July and had known each other for more than 60 years. \nThe couple used to joke that neither wanted the other one to die first, because they did not want to be apart from each other. \nMr Lozano could see his parents' apartment from his own home and heard the crash of the collapse. When he ran to the window, he could no longer see their apartment. \nHe told reporters that he took some comfort in the knowledge that they \"went together and went quickly\".\nThe Guara family - dad Marcus, 52, mum Anaely Rodriguez, 42, and daughters Lucia and Emma, 11 and four respectively - lived on the eighth floor. On Tuesday, 6 July, they were among the first of the victims to be buried.\nMr Guara - whose remains were found days before those of his family - was described as \"helpful and friendly\" by college friend Mike Spring, while cousin Peter Milian told the Miami Herald he was \"a great brother, uncle, cousin, son, and loved his daughters passionately\".\n\"A family's been erased,\" Mr Milian told NBC 6 after rescuers found the bodies of Anaely Rodriguez and her daughters.\nManuel LaFont, 54, lived on the eighth floor of the building.\nMr LaFont's two children, a 10-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl, had been spending time with him that day, but were picked up by their mother - Mr LaFont's ex-wife - just hours before the collapse.\n\"My children were born again, and I was born again as well,\" she said.\nMr LaFont would often be found playing baseball with his young son, the Miami Herald reports. \nStella Cattarossi, the seven-year-old daughter of a Miami firefighter, was inside the building with her mother, grandparents and aunt when it collapsed. Her body was identified on 2 July.\nHer mother, Graciela Cattarossi, 48, and her grandparents Graciela, 86, and Gino Cattarossi, 89, were also killed.\nHer aunt, Andrea, who was visiting from Argentina, has also been confirmed dead. \nStella's father has been working with the rescue efforts and was on scene when she was found, local media report. \nThe first victim to be officially named was Stacie Fang. She was the mother of Jonah Handler, a 15-year-old who was pulled from the rubble hours after the collapse, as he begged rescuers: \"Please don't leave me.\"\nIn a statement, her family expressed thanks for the outpouring of sympathy and support they had received. \"There are no words to describe the tragic loss of our beloved Stacie,\" it read.\nHilda Noriega, 92, was the oldest victim of the tragedy.\nHer grandson Michael described Ms Noriega as \"larger than life\" and \"92 years old going on 62\". \nIn the hours after the collapse, Mr Noriega rushed to the scene with his parents. They later told US media how they found a birthday card and family photographs in the rubble. \nThe family released a statement in which they said they had lost the \"heart and soul\" and \"matriarch\" of the family but would \"get through this time by embracing the unconditional love Hilda was known for\".\nBhavna Patel, a 38-year-old British and US citizen, and her husband Vishal Patel, 42, were both confirmed dead on 2 July. The body of their one-year-old daughter, Aishani was identified the following week. She was the youngest victim.\nBhavna was pregnant, a tweet from a relative said. \nUmma Kannayan is a family friend of the Patels. She told the BBC's Will Grant that they were a \"very loving\" family who were closely involved in their religious community. \n\"Aishani was like the little baby of the temple,\" she said. \"It feels like you've lost a part of yourself.\"\nThe sister of Paraguay's first lady, Silvana L\u00f3pez Moreira, was confirmed dead on 8 July. \nThe remains of Sophia L\u00f3pez Moreira, her husband Luis Pettengill and their three children - ages 3, 6 and 9 - have all been found.\nThe first lady travelled to Florida to be with her family amid the search. \nTheir nanny, Leidy Luna Villalba, was found on 7 July. She had arrived in Miami hours before the building collapsed. It was her first time travelling outside of Paraguay. \nShe sent a message to her cousin when she arrived, telling him she was excited to explore the city. \nHer mother, Juana de Villalba, told media in Paraguay: \"She's the primary breadwinner of our family and she went to Miami for work. She went for us. My heart is broken\".\nHarry Rosenberg, 52, who was confirmed dead on 8 July, relocated to Miami from New York following the loss of his wife, Anna, to cancer and both of his parents to Covid in the past year.\nHe recently told a fellow congregant at a local synagogue he was entering the \"next chapter\" of his life.  \nA close friend told Associated Press that Harry had spent three years taking care of his ill wife.\nHe had only recently bought a second-floor unit in Surfside - big enough to welcome friends and family.\nBrad Cohen, 51, is one of several members of the Jewish community to have died. \nHis brother Gary, 58, who was visiting from Birmingham, Alabama, also lost his life. He had come to Florida so that the pair could see their father, who is ill, in nearby Boynton Beach.\n\"The hardest thing has been seeing the devastation of my 12-year-old daughter, she is very close to her father,\" Brad's wife, Soraya Cohen, told the BBC.\nThe disappearance of one Jewish couple prompted an emotional reaction on social media.\nSeveral people queried the whereabouts of Myriam Caspi Notkin and Arnie Notkin, an elderly couple who lived on the third floor of the collapsed building, but their bodies were both recovered on 9 July.\nThey married about 20 years ago after both being widowed. \nSpeaking to the Miami Herald newspaper, Fortuna Smukler said Mr Notkin was a beloved member of the community. \nMs Smukler said Mr Notkin taught physical education at a local primary school in South Beach for years, and is remembered by many students.\n\"He was such a well-liked PE teacher from people's past,\" she said.\n\"He had students who became famous, and he had to tell me about them, how they were good or mischievous,\" she added.\nMagaly Ramsey received a call from her mother, Magaly Delgado, the night before the collapse.\n\"My mother called me at around 10 o'clock on Wednesday night, but I was at a conference and I couldn't answer her,\" Ms Ramsey told the BBC.\nI'll call her tomorrow, she thought. On 1 July, Miami-Dade police announced they had recovered Magaly's remains. \nMagaly said her mother, an 80-year-old of Cuban origin, was idolised by her two grandsons. \"My kids adored her,\" she told ABC News.\nShe added that her mother had been concerned about shaking from nearby construction work. \n\"She did complain of a lot of tremors and things... she sometimes was concerned about what may be happening to her building,\" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \nKevin Spiegel was on a business trip in California when he heard about the collapse. He and his wife Judy, 66, had lived in an apartment on the sixth floor for more than four years.\nMrs Spiegel's daughter, Rachel, was last in contact with her mother the night before, the New York Times reported.\nThe newspaper said Judy had texted her to say that she had finally found the Disney dress that her four-year-old granddaughter wanted.\nA devoted grandmother, Judy had been helping with picking up the children from school, Rachel said. \n\"My mum is just the best person in the world. She is so caring and loving,\" Rachel told CNN. \nAlfredo Leone, 48; and his son Lorenzo, 5, were among those found nearly three weeks after the tragedy.\nThe boy's mother, Raquel, had been visiting her mother in Colorado at the time of the collapse. \nFamily members have been paying tribute to Estelle Hedaya, 54, the only victim who remains unidentified.\nHer brother Ikey told CBS he took comfort in the fact that she was \"the apex at everything in her life\".\nHe said he was not bothered by her being the last person unaccounted for because it meant that God had chosen her, although he admitted the wait had been very tough on their parents.\n\"I know my sister is in the right place now,\" he said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus vaccines,Department for Transport,Grant Shapps,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Fully vaccinated UK residents arriving in England from amber travel list destinations will no longer have to quarantine from 19 July.\nHowever, they will still need to pay for Covid tests before and after their return, the transport secretary said.\nGrant Shapps told MPs that under-18s returning from amber list places would also be exempt from quarantine.\nTravel industry leaders said the change was a \"positive step\" but called for the amber list to be expanded.\nCurrently, anyone returning from countries on the amber or red list must isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccine status. \nMr Shapps said a full vaccination means \"14 days have passed since your final dose of the vaccine\" - and only vaccines given by the NHS will count. \nBut he said officials were \"working to extend our approach to vaccinated passengers from important markets and holiday destinations, later this summer, such as the United States and the EU\".\nNorthern Ireland plans to adopt the change from 26 July, while both Scotland and Wales have said they will consider whether to follow the same rules.\nUnder the change, fully-jabbed people travelling from amber list countries will still be required to take a test three days before they return and on the second day after they are back - but they will now be exempted from a day eight test.\nMr Shapps told MPs: \"In essence, this means that for fully vaccinated travellers the requirements for green and amber list countries are the same.\"\nHe also said that, from 19 July - the day when most Covid rules in England are due to end - the guidance that people should not travel to amber list countries will be removed.\nBut he cautioned that \"an amber list country could still turn red\", meaning hotel quarantine would become a requirement. \nAll of England's 19 July rule changes are due to be confirmed on 12 July after a review of the latest data.\nFewer than 30 destinations are on the green list - meaning travellers do not have to self-isolate when they get back to the UK, while more than 50 countries are on the strictest red list, which requires arrivals to pay to self-isolate in a hotel.\nBut most places - including holiday hotspots such as mainland Spain, Greece and the US - are on the amber list. \nThe next review of the countries on the green, red and amber lists will take place on 15 July.\nSpeaking later, the transport secretary told the BBC: \"We had the choice of simply saying people would never be able to travel until every single last person had been vaccinated - or at least starting to open things up.\"\nMr Shapps said testing was \"important to keep people safe\" and prevent variants arriving in the UK, but denied the requirements would continue to price-out many families.\nOn Thursday evening, the government website was listing nearly 400 providers carrying out the tests fully vaccinated travellers would need to take on their return. Prices begin at \u00a32.49, with the majority in the \u00a350-\u00a3100 range.\nThe Foreign Office, which issues travel advice that is independent from the government's traffic light system and could affect travel insurance, is stressing that not all amber countries will be approved for international travel on 19 July. \nHowever, it has updated its approved list and it now has several amber list countries including France, Greece, Morocco, Switzerland, the US, Jamaica and mainland Spain.\nFor the first time in a while, travel bosses are relatively pleased. \nToday's announcement is a big change, opening up international travel far more significantly that has been possible this year. However, there are limitations.\nThis policy only applies to those jabbed in the UK, meaning those jabbed abroad will still have to quarantine if coming from an amber list country. \nThat will affect some family and friends hoping to reunite and impact on businesses that rely on international visitors who won't see those customers return in the same numbers as UK travellers will leave.\nTests are still required from green and amber list countries. The cost will dissuade some from travelling.\nCrucially, this rule is just about what happens when people travel to the UK. Whether other countries will let UK travellers in is a different matter altogether.\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, the industry body representing UK-registered carriers, said the rule change was a \"positive move towards the genuine reopening the sector has been looking for\".\nJohn Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow, welcomed the change but said: \"The UK should open up travel to fully vaccinated people from more countries - particularly our key partners in the US - by the end of July.\"\nHowever, MP Caroline Lucas - vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said the government was \"in danger of repeating the same mistakes that allowed the Delta variant to take root in the UK\".\nKatherine Wood, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, will not get a second jab until the end of August and told the BBC the government changes were frustrating for young people who had already sacrificed a \"huge amount\" during the pandemic.\nThe 26-year-old said: \"They should have waited until the vast majority of people, particularly young people, had been double-vaccinated before changing any rules because I really feel quite disenfranchised by what's happened.\"\nThe traffic light system sets the rules travellers must follow on their return. But holidaymakers also need to check their destination's entry rules.\nFor example, all non-vaccinated travellers to mainland Portugal need a negative Covid test, and must quarantine for 14 days. Twelve to 17-year-olds travelling with fully vaccinated parents don't have to quarantine but need a negative test. Under-11s are exempt.\nOnly fully vaccinated adults can travel to Malta, and do not need a negative test. Children aged five to 11 can travel with fully vaccinated adults, but need a negative test. Under-fives don't need a test. Unvaccinated 12 to 17-year olds can't enter. \nOver-12s travelling to Spain need a negative test or proof of vaccination. \nUnvaccinated travellers can only enter France for \"essential reasons\", and must self-isolate for seven days. Fully-vaccinated adults with a negative test can enter. Under-18s travelling with fully vaccinated adults don't need to self-isolate.\nEarlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that in addition to relaxing the rules around isolation for travellers, the government was considering a \"more proportionate and balanced approach\" to isolation for Covid contacts.\nIt comes amid fears that surging cases will lead to millions of people being asked to self-isolate during the summer, even if they have been fully vaccinated.\nThe requirement for double-jabbed people to isolate after contact with a positive case is due to end on 16 August, four weeks after the majority of England's Covid rules are set to end, to allow more people to be vaccinated.\nMr Sunak acknowledged there was \"frustration\" at how the NHS contact tracing app could continue to order the double jabbed to isolate.\nDr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, urged people to continue using the app - saying it had helped to detect about 500,000 cases to date - but told the Commons Public Accounts Committee work was being done to \"tune\" it to operate within the vaccinated population so it was there \"for a purpose, not for annoyance\".\nNearly 65% of the adult population in the UK have received two jabs, and 86% have had a first dose.\nA total of 32,551 new UK coronavirus cases were announced on Thursday - up very slightly on Wednesday and taking the total number of positive tests in the pandemic above five million. There were also 35 more deaths. \nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

      "text": "There have been 1,152,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 10,311 people have died following a positive test for the virus, according to the Scottish government.\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available at 14:00 on 30 January.\nThe Scottish government only publishes \"headline statistics\" on cases, deaths and vaccinations over the weekend. This page will be fully updated again on Monday.\nOver the past seven days 51,869 cases have been reported, with 6,185 cases confirmed on Sunday.\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how positive cases are reported.\nThe next chart shows the number of positive cases confirmed by PCR tests only over the past 12 months and uses Public Health Scotland data.\nThe data is based on the date of the test rather than when the test result was reported, which is the daily figure given out by the Scottish government.\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from five days ago.\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\nThe Scottish government also publishes the figures on the number of cases across Scotland's 14 health boards.\nThe World Health Organization has highlighted the percentage of positive test results as a key indicator when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country.\nIts guidance says a weekly positivity rate which is kept below 2% is one indication that community transmission of Covid-19 is at low levels.\nOther indicators include the number of cases, Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions per 100,000 people.\nThe Scottish government measures the positivity rate by dividing the number of positive PCR tests per day by the total number of tests carried out.\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak.\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard."

      "text": "Almost 24m viewers watched England's historic Euro 2020 victory against Denmark on Wednesday on ITV and ITV+1.\nAccording to overnight figures, the semi-final at Wembley Stadium brought an average audience of 23.86m.\nThe last five minutes of the match drew a peak audience of 25.71m - almost 5m more than the peak audience recorded during Saturday's match against Ukraine.\nThe game was the most watched non-news event since Croatia knocked England out of the 2018 World Cup.\nThat match was watched by 24.3m on 11 July 2018, with a peak of 26.5m tuning into ITV's coverage.\nEngland's 4-0 win over Ukraine on Sunday attracted a peak TV audience of 20.9m, making it the most-watched live TV event of the year up to that point.\nThe most watched event of recent years remains the Prime Minister's May 2020 coronavirus announcement, which was seen by 27.49m viewers across six different channels.\nSunday's Euros final will be shown on both BBC One and ITV and could break the viewing record set by the 32.3m who watched England win the World Cup Final in 1966.\nThe official audience for Wednesday's match may rise when those who saw it via ITV's catch-up service are taken into account.\nEngland's players sent the nation into delirium on Wednesday after beating Denmark by two goals to one after extra time.\nStriker Harry Kane scored the decisive goal after England were awarded a penalty. Kane's initial strike was blocked by Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel but he was able to tuck away the rebound.\nGoverning body Uefa has since charged England after a laser pointer was directed at Schmeichel as Kane prepared to shoot.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "title": "Climate change: US-Canada heatwave 'virtually impossible' without warming",
      "tags": "Europe heatwaves,COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change,Heatwaves",
      "text": "The searing heat that scorched western Canada and the US at the end of June was \"virtually impossible\" without climate change, say scientists.\nIn their study, the team of researchers says that the deadly heatwave was a one-in-a-1,000-year event.\nBut we can expect extreme events such as this to become more common as the world heats up due to climate change.\nIf humans hadn't influenced the climate to the extent that they have, the event would have been 150 times less likely.\nScientists worry that global heating, largely as a result of burning fossil fuels, is now driving up temperatures faster than models predict. \nClimate researchers have grown used to heatwaves breaking records all over the world in recent years. However, beating the previous national high temperature mark by more than 4C in one go, as happened in Canada last week, is virtually unprecedented. \nCanada's previous national record for high temperature was 45C - but the recent heat in the village of Lytton in British Columbia saw a figure of 49.6C recorded at the height of the event. \nThis was shortly before the village itself was largely destroyed by a wildfire.\nAll across the region, in the US states of Oregon and Washington and in the west of Canada, multiple cities hit new records far above 40C.\nThese temperatures had deadly consequences for hundreds of people, with spikes in sudden deaths and big increases in hospital visits for heat-related illness. \nSince the start of the heatwave, people have linked the unusual and extreme nature of the event to climate change. \nNow, researchers say that the chances of it occurring without human-induced warming were virtually impossible. \nAn international team of 27 climate researchers who are part of the World Weather Attribution network managed to analyse the data in just eight days. \nUnsurprisingly, given the quick turnaround, the research has not yet been peer-reviewed. However, the scientists use well-established methods accepted by top journals.\nThey used 21 climate models to estimate how much climate change influenced the heat experienced in the area around the cities of Seattle, Portland and Vancouver. \nThey compared the climate as it is today, with the world as it would be without human-induced warming. \n\"We conclude that a one-in-1000-year event would have been at least 150 times rarer in the past,\" said lead author Sjoukje Philip, from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.\n\"So that's in a climate without human-induced climate change, when the climate was about 1.2C cooler than it is now. The heatwave would also have been about two degrees cooler in the past.\"\nCo-author Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, explained what the researchers meant when they said the extreme heat was \"virtually impossible\" without climate change. \n\"Without the additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, in the statistics that we have available with our models, and also the statistical models based on observations, such an event just does not occur,\" she explained. \n\"Or if an event like this occurs, it occurs once in a million times, which is the statistical equivalent of never,\" she told a news briefing.\nThis type of research, which seeks to determine the contribution of human-induced climate change to extreme weather events, is known as an attribution study.\nAccording to the analysis, if the world warms by 2C, which could happen in about 20 years' time, then the chances of having a heatwave similar to last week's drop from around once every 1,000 years to roughly once every 5-10 years. \nThe authors say that the observed temperatures were so extreme that they lie far outside the range of historical observations. This makes it hard to quantify, with confidence, just how rare the heat dome event really was. \nThe scientists say there are two possibilities for the extreme jump in peak temperatures seen in the region.\nThe first is that it is just an extremely rare event, made worse by climate change, \"the statistical equivalent of really bad luck\", according to the paper. \nThe other possibility is that the climate may have crossed a \"threshold,\" that would make the kind of heatwaves witnessed recently much more likely.\nUp until now, researchers had seen a gradual increase in heat extremes as the world warmed. Their analysis of what happened in Canada has shaken that view.  \nIt could mean that the predictions of climate models might be underestimating the extreme temperatures the world could yet experience.\n\"We are much less certain about how the climate affects heatwaves than we were two weeks ago,\" said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.\n\"And we are worried about the possibilities of these things happening everywhere. But we don't know how realistic that is yet, we just we need to work on it.\"\nSo does mean that this exceptional heatwave could be some sort of tipping point?\n\"It's really not the important thing if this is a tipping point or not,\" said Dr Otto. \n\"What's important is what are our societies are resilient to and what can we adapt to. And in most societies, it's really a very, very stable climate, and that even a small change makes a huge difference.\"\n\"And what we see here is not a small change, it's a big change. I think that is really, really the important message here.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

      "tags": "Port-au-Prince",
      "text": "Thousands of people have taken to the streets of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince and other cities for renewed protests against the government. \nThey lit barricades of burning tyres and debris, demanding the resignation of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse.\nSome demonstrators were reportedly injured as police fired rubber bullets to disperse them.\nThe cause of the Caribbean nation's fresh unrest is a bitter dispute over Mr Mo\u00efse's legitimacy.\nHaiti's opposition says that Mr Mo\u00efse's five-year term should have ended on 7 February 2021, five years to the day since his predecessor in office, Michel Martelly, stepped down.\nMr Mo\u00efse, however, insists he has one more year to serve as he did not take office until 7 February 2017. \nThe year-long delay was caused by allegations of electoral fraud which eventually saw the result of the 2015 election being annulled and fresh polls being held, which were won by Mr Mo\u00efse.\nMr Mo\u00efse's time in office has been rocky as he faced repeated accusations of corruption and was challenged by waves of often violent anti-government protests.\nHe has been ruling by decree for the past year after his administration failed to hold scheduled legislative elections in October 2019.\nOn 7 February, the day his opponents said his term should have ended, he said that a \"coup to overthrow his government and assassinate him\" had been foiled.\nTwenty-three alleged coup-plotters were detained including a senior Supreme Court judge, Ivickel Dabresil. Mr Dabresil had reportedly been chosen by the opposition to act as \"provisional president\" to replace Mr Mo\u00efse.\nWith Mr Dabresil in detention, the opposition named another Supreme Court judge, Joseph M\u00e9c\u00e8ne Jean-Louis, as interim leader.\nWith Mr Mo\u00efse refusing to step down, one Haitian news outlet reported that \"Haiti has two presidents\".\nMr Mo\u00efse's opponents have denied his allegation of a \"coup attempt\". \nThey argue that Mr Mo\u00efse has \"illegally\" extended his mandate and that they were therefore justified in choosing a temporary replacement head of state.\nMr Mo\u00efse's government called the move an illegal \"usurpation\" and Mr Mo\u00efse issued a decree sending the top members of the Supreme Court, including Judges Dabresil and Jean-Louis, into retirement.\nAs the Mo\u00efse administration strengthened the police presence in Port-au-Prince, especially around the Supreme Court, some local commentators suggested that the sitting president was carrying out his own \"counter-coup\" to bolster his position and suppress his opponents.\nThe anti-Mo\u00efse opposition - which besides political parties is made up of religious and civil society groups, members of the judiciary and human rights organisations - say the Mo\u00efse administration has been chronically \"irresponsible\" and \"corrupt\".\nThey argue this has led to a surge in violent gang crime and kidnappings as well as worsening living standards in a nation where nearly 60% already live below the poverty line.\nCritics blame Mr Mo\u00efse for the postponement of the legislative elections from October 2019 to October 2021, which has left Haiti without a parliament. \nOpponents have also questioned Mr Mo\u00efse's use of decree powers to push through his policies.\nMr Mo\u00efse meanwhile argues that he is committed to democracy and that he will devote his remaining 12 months in power to organising local, municipal legislative and presidential elections to be held this year.\nHe is also planning to hold a referendum to overhaul Haiti's constitution, which he argues needs to be modernised. \nHis critics fear that his intention is to get rid of a clause which bans presidents from serving two consecutive terms in office so he can run again for the top job in September. \nThe escalating tension between Mr Mo\u00efse and his opponents risks prolonging Haiti's long-running political turmoil and economic deterioration. \nThe opposition has promised more anti-government demonstrations, even though some observers see signs of protest fatigue among a population also battered by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"The remarkable lack of popular response to calls for mass protests in recent weeks indicates that Haitian people are tired of endless lockdowns and squabbling over power,\" a US State Department spokesperson was quoted as saying recently in the media. \nNevertheless, Haitian media spoke of a \"human tide\" of \"several thousand\" anti-Mo\u00efse protesters marching in the streets of Port-au-Prince on 14 February, and similar protests were reported in Cap-Haitien, Les Cayes, and Mirebalais in the north, south and centre of the nation.\nBut the commander of Haiti's armed forces has so far sided with the sitting president, saying that he backs Mr Mo\u00efse.\nThe US government, the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS) have all indicated support for Mr Mo\u00efse to continue governing on the understanding that he holds free and fair elections in 2021. They appear to view this as the best strategy to avoid a descent into greater chaos.\nSome Haitian media commentators have criticised what they call misplaced international support for an \"unconstitutional\" head of state. \nSome of the 14 February protesters in Port-au-Prince shouted slogans condemning what they called the \"interference\" of the UN and the OAS."

      "tags": "NHS Grampian,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Health boards should consider cancelling non-urgent procedures to reduce pressure on hospitals, a senior public health official has said.\nJillian Evans, the head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said it would \"make sense\" to defer some operations.\nIt comes after two hospitals reached full capacity in the north east.\nNHS Lanarkshire and NHS Highland have also reported pressure on services in recent days.\nNHS Lanarkshire said it had considered scaling back procedures due to staff absences and rising Covid admissions.\nAnd NHS Highland cancelled all non-urgent elective surgery and most outpatient activity at Inverness' Raigmore Hospital amid growing pressure. \nThe health boards said self-isolation requirements meant that a number of staff who were double vaccinated had to stay off after being in contact with the virus outside of work.\nMs Evans told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that health boards across Scotland were going to see a \"really busy\" period over the next two months.\nShe said: \"It would make sense for us to try to mitigate as many risks of safety of the health of our population and our staff as possible by making some difficult decisions about elective care.\n\"That is where I think it would make more sense to start thinking about reducing pressure there couple with any changes and evidence that emerge about the safety of people when they are double jabbed.\"\nAsked whether it would make sense to start cancelling operations now, she said: \"It would make sense to look at deferring some of those. \n\"It is better to do that in a planned way then to do it on the day, that disrupts and causes upset for everyone. We want to be honest with people and help them understand what to expect.\"\nAnother possible solution would be to reassess whether double vaccinated health and social care staff need to self isolate if they had been in contact with the virus, according to Prof Jackie Taylor, president of Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow.\nInstead, she said staff identified as contacts would take a PCR test and if it was negative, return to work while taking daily lateral flow tests.\nHowever, she said there would need to be \"very firm evidence\" that changes to the quarantine policy would be beneficial.\nShe told Good Morning Scotland: \"I think it's not unreasonable to consider looking at a more proportionate policy for double vaccinated people.\n\"We're going to have do this when we start exploring what happens after level zero anyway but I think it is extremely important that we look at everything else we can do to reduce pressure on the system. \n\"I would certainly want to see a clear rationale and evidence that is an effective strategy both safe for patients and staff.\"\nEarlier this week Scotland's education secretary said having different isolation rules for fully vaccinated people was being \"actively reviewed\" as a potential way of easing staffing pressures in hospitals, schools and other public services. \nMs Evans said she agreed a change to self isolation rules for NHS staff would \"inevitably\" ease pressure on hospitals - but there was still the danger than one in five people who are double vaccinated could still go on to have Covid.\nScotland is expected to move to level zero on 19 July, with remaining legal restrictions lifted on 9 August - however, the first minister said the planned dates were not \"set in stone\".\nThe Scottish government said it was closely monitoring data after it was revealed that Scotland has the highest Covid rates in Europe.\nAnalysis by BBC Scotland data journalist Marc Ellison\nAn increasing number of health boards are saying that drastic measures may be needed in light of a surge in coronavirus cases.\nIs this reflected in the latest official data? In a word, no.\nUnlike the Covid-specific data sets, which only lag by a few days, the current figures on A&E activity and admissions only take us up to 27 June.\nSo what, if any, warning signs were there in the data of mounting pressure on boards and their hospitals? NHS Lanarkshire said this week that it had seen \"unprecedented levels\" of attendance at A&E departments. But the data shows that attendance was down at all three of the board's hospitals by an average of 9% between the 6 and 27 June.\nIn fact, people going to A&E only increased slightly at some hospitals like Shetland's Gilbert Bain Hospital (4%).\nSo what about pressure on planned operations? NHS Grampian said that Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI) and Dr Gray's Hospital in Moray had postponed all non-urgent procedures. But again the data is limited and only gives us a snapshot in time.\nAll we know, for example, is that by the end of May, ARI saw an increase of 15% in cancellations related to capacity\nBoards have also blamed staff absences - due to self-isolation requirements and summer holidays - for the mounting pressure on their resources. The Scottish Government does record and publish this daily, but not at a board level. However, we can still see that staff absences more than doubled from 1,238 to 2,760 between 1 June and 6 July.\nSo essentially while data sets do exist, they lag too far behind to give us a real-time picture."

He remains a member of the Conservative Party, but BBC Wales was told this remains under review.\nMr Roberts's former senior parliamentary assistant told BBC Wales he felt \"some disappointment\" a recall petition would not take place.\nHe added: \"At the moment, an MP found guilty of sending personal correspondence using house-headed paper is being treated more severely than MPs that are being found guilty of varying offences involving harassment, bullying and sexual harassment.\" \nThe former employee said he was \"very relieved\" to get closure after his complaint against Mr Roberts was upheld.\nHowever, he added: \"If complaints against MPs are upheld, it shouldn't be that they take a leave of absence and then come back.\n\"It should be like in any other industry: that they are dismissed from their role or - in the case of an MP - they go to a recall petition.\"\nHe said Parliament was a \"very strange place\" and was not up to date \"with how employment should be in modern times\". \nEchoing calls from senior cross-party politicians for Mr Roberts to resign, the MP's former employee added: \"I just think it's very unfair on his constituents.\n\"I don't think that they can have faith in him as a representative.\"\nHe said both the Conservative Party and Parliament needed to look at this case as a \"precedent,\" and called for more of a \"set timetable\" for how long such complaints are dealt with.\nLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg is looking at a way to change the rules so future suspensions for sexual harassment and bullying judged by the panel can trigger a recall petition.\nBBC Wales has been told the UK government does not want this to apply to previous cases, although Labour politicians have proposed a change to the rules that mean it would.\nShadow Leader of the House Thangam Debbonaire told the Commons on Thursday that \"everyone knows this needs sorting\".\n\"There's actually nothing to stop him returning,\" she said. \"Staff have concerns. Things can be done retrospectively when the government wants to.\n\"Why should the people of Delyn be denied the right to the value of democracy, because of a technicality, we know we're going to fix?\"\nIn response, Mr Rees-Mogg said it was \"very important that this is done on a consensual basis\", adding it was open to Labour to put its proposal forward on one of the days set aside for opposition parties to hold debates.\nAnother Labour frontbencher, Jess Phillips, posed a question on social media, saying: \"If the Tory Party don't think he should come to parliament why on earth do we think it's OK for him to see vulnerable constituents on his own in Delyn?\"\nIn response to the comments by Mr Roberts's former employee, a Commons spokesman said: \"We remain committed to streamlining the ICGS process in the coming months and significant work has already been undertaken to reduce delays, including procuring new investigation providers and expanding capacity to deal with casework.\"\nA spokesman on behalf of the Conservative Whips Office said the whip remained suspended from Mr Roberts.

      "text": "US President Joe Biden has defended his decision to withdraw military forces from Afghanistan, saying that US operations will end on 31 August.\nThe fourth US president to oversee the war also defended the speed of the US withdrawal, saying it saved lives.\nMr Biden's speech comes as the Taliban militant group continues to seize territory around the country.\nUS forces have fought in Afghanistan for nearly 20 years, following the terror attacks of 11 September 2001. \nEarlier this year, Mr Biden set a 11 September 2021 goal of withdrawing all US troops. \nDonald Trump had agreed with the Taliban to pull out US troops by May 2021, but that deadline was pushed back by Mr Biden after he took office in January.\n\"Just one more year of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution,\" Mr Biden said in a White House speech, \"but a recipe for fighting there indefinitely.\"\nHe also denied that a Taliban takeover is \"inevitable,\" saying that the Taliban force of approximately 75,000 fighters is no match for the 300,000 Afghan security forces.\nEven after the total pull out is complete, the US is expected to keep 650 to 1,000 troops in Afghanistan to guard the US embassy, Kabul airport, and other key government installations.\nRecent polls have shown broad US support for leaving Afghanistan, with Republican voters more sceptical of the decision to withdraw.\nMr Biden also said that efforts are being made to get translators, interpreters and other Afghans that worked with the US government out of the country. He said 2,500 special immigrant visas have been issued to allow them to come to the United States, but only half have come so far.\nSenator Biden and Vice-President Biden believed the US should get out of Afghanistan. Now President Biden is Commander-in-Chief. \nHe was at pains to say support for Afghanistan wouldn't stop, but even more adamant that both Afghan politicians and security forces had the capacity to prevent a Taliban takeover. \"Will they do it?\" he asked. \nThat's what Afghans have asked - repeatedly - in the midst of continuing disarray and disunity in Kabul, and the dramatic Taliban advance in the districts. \nThe president's emphasis on speaking out for women and girls isn't heard in districts already under Taliban control where they're not going to school. \nAs a president who's known to study all the scenarios, he made it clear \"it's highly unlikely\" there will be a unified government, and not much the US could do, or should do, if Kabul collapses. That's up to Afghans - and the countries next door.\nLast month, Mr Biden assured Afghan leaders at a White House meeting that US aid will continue.\nThe vast majority of remaining foreign forces in Afghanistan have left ahead of the US 11 September deadline, leaving the Afghan military completely in charge of national security.\nPresident Ashraf Ghani insists that Afghan security forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but there have been reports of thousands of Afghan troops seeking refuge in other countries to avoid the fighting.\nEarlier in the week, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC that the group was not responsible for the recent increase in violence.  He insisted that many districts had fallen to the Taliban through mediation after Afghan soldiers refused to fight.\nUS-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US that triggered the invasion. However, it has gradually been regaining territory in recent years."

I haven't seen my husband and daughter for some while now.\n\"I see [my family] on Skype and that's a help. It's been a very strong virus and it's very difficult. It's been very difficult to cope with it all.\n\"They've taken good care of us here, it's been very strict at times, but I'm still here at 92 so I've been very well cared for, but I must admit, I miss my family.\"\nMargaret Pullen, 86, has lived in a care home in Aberavon, Neath Port Talbot, for about four years. \nShe said she missed the company of others most of all.\n\"I was fed up with being in my room but there's nothing you can do about that. I was comfortable enough,\" she said. \n\"I had a radio and a telly. I was comfortable and there was a rota to have our meals.\n\"It was nice to go back into the dining room and see people I haven't seen for a while.\"\n\"I miss the company of people, I was fed up of being in my room. I think we all were,\" she added.\n\"We had trips before the pandemic and we've started some trips now. It's nice to be able to get out.\"\nMs Pullen said it has been lovely to see family again and that it had been nice to get out to the Brecon Beacons, Mumbles and Porthcawl and she says she enjoys the ice creams they always have on the trips.\nBut she said she misses the choir which used to be run in the care home.\nAs a retired nurse, Ms Wilson said she sympathises with those who have worked through the pandemic.\n\"Nursing is not an easy job and they don't always get the respect they deserve,\" she said. \nCare home residents have had to endure more than most during the pandemic.\nAccording to the ONS, care home residents have accounted for 1,674 Covid deaths in Wales - 21% of the total number of fatalities. \nIn March and April 2020, at the start of the pandemic, there were 624 Covid-related deaths - a third of all deaths in care homes at that time. \nJanuary 2021 saw a further 419 deaths in Welsh care homes. \nThe Older People's Commissioner for Wales and the Equality and Human Rights Commission have both shared significant concerns about the experiences of older people, particularly those in care homes, during the pandemic.\nThe Tell Me More project, which has been funded by Welsh government, has seen Age Cymru work with a group of artists to hold conversations with people in care homes. \nVicki Lloyd, Age Cymru's chief executive, said care home residents should be \"really high up on the agenda\" as more restrictions relax and society returns to some kind of normality.\n\"Care home residents have been particularly affected by the pandemic, they've been locked down longer than most of us, they've been isolated from their friends and family.\n\"For many they've only had window visits or not seen family and friends at all.\n\"It's important we listen and learn in terms of decision making, when we're setting policy and informing practices we really need to listen to what care home residents are saying.\""

      "text": "\"If we were to open up in full swing it would be at least 12 jobs unfilled, but it's six unfilled at the moment.\" \nMark Lee runs the Red Lion Country Inn, a B&B in Yorkshire, but like many employers he cannot find enough staff. \nAccording to a survey of big recruitment firms, the number of permanent jobs available in England rose at its fastest rate since 1997 in June as the economy reopened. \nBut at the same time availability of workers hit a 24-year low. \nDespite advertising on a range of sites, Mr Lee has not received a single application for jobs posted. Before the pandemic, he would frequently receive 50 or more applications per advert. \nHe has also used agencies to find staff, but when he asked for a sous chef they could only provide an employee who had never worked in a catering kitchen before. Paying above minimum wage, Mr Lee employs waiters and cleaners on \u00a310 per hour, which increases to \u00a313 for a sous chef. \nKPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) polled 400 recruitment companies in June and found \"substantial increases\" in permanent and temporary job vacancies across the Midlands, the South, London and the North. \nThe steepest increase in demand was seen for permanent private sector staff, particularly in the IT and computing, hotel and catering, and engineering sectors.\nDemand was also \"historically strong\" across the public sector.\nHowever, the survey found the supply of candidates had fallen for the fourth month in a row. Recruiters blamed increased hiring, Brexit, pandemic-related uncertainty and the furlough scheme.  \nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, told the BBC's Today programme: \"We have seen the reopening of the economy and therefore there's a surge in demand, and not all the workers we were hoping to get are readily available. \n\"Some of them need to switch sector, some of them were looking after children before or were temporarily out of the jobs market. Some went into higher education or overseas.\"\nBrian Lord, chief executive of cybersecurity and intelligence consultancy PGI, has encountered the same issue in the IT sector. \n\"Covid has been the main driver in demand because remote working has meant more vulnerability for organisations,\" Mr Lord said.  \nIn June, PGI advertised 10 roles across its digital security teams but has only managed to fill two positions so far with the help of an in-house training academy.  \nMr Lord said the slow rate in hiring was due to potential employers \"invariably ending up in a bidding war\", which he said was often won by richer companies \"who are better able to absorb the increased overhead or more able to pass the increased cost on their client base\".  \n\"There is just no unemployment in the sector and supply is struggling to keep up,\" he added.\nManny Athwal, chief executive of the School of Coding in Wolverhampton, said employers have been contacting the school, which has 5,250 students, to recruit potential candidates before they even start courses.\nThe findings come despite the UK's unemployment rate remaining relatively high due to the pandemic, at 4.7% in the three months to April.\nGerwyn Davies from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said there was a danger of overhyping the shortages, with a fall in the number of young people currently in employed in the UK.  \nIn hospitality especially, Mr Davies said \"a perfect storm\" had occurred \"where we're seeing a demand for labour occur alongside a sharp fall in the stock of EU workers\".\n\"It's a question of employers having to work harder to recruit and train their staff rather than having no applicants,\" he added. \nREC chief executive Neil Carberry said: \"Recruiters are working flat out to fill roles across our economy. The jobs market is improving at the fastest pace we have ever seen, but it is still an unpredictable time. \n\"We can't yet tell how much the ending of furlough and greater candidate confidence will help to meet this rising demand for staff. In some key shortage sectors like hospitality, food, driving and IT, more support is likely to be needed to avoid slowing the recovery.\" "

      "tags": "War in Afghanistan (2001-present),Afghanistan,Boris Johnson,British Army",
      "text": "All British troops assigned to Nato's mission in Afghanistan are returning home and most have already left, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\nThe PM said there could \"never be a perfect moment\" to withdraw, but it was \"never intended to be permanent\".\nMore than 450 British troops have died during the conflict with the Taliban and fighters from al-Qaeda since 2001.\nBut Britain's most senior general has warned Afghanistan could slide into civil war once foreign troops leave.\nThe US has said it will withdraw all forces by 11 September.\nThe US-led bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001, following the 11 September attacks on the United States.\nAt the height of the war, Nato had more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. \nIn a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Johnson said after the majority of troops returned home in 2014, about 750 service personnel stayed in Afghanistan under Nato's mission to train and assist the country's security forces.\n\"No-one should doubt the gains of the last 20 years,\" he told MPs. \"But nor can we shrink from the hard reality of the situation today.\"\nHe said the situation in Afghanistan now is \"very different\" compared to 20 years ago when the country was \"the epicentre of global terrorism\". \n\"We and our Nato allies were always going to withdraw our forces,\" Mr Johnson said. \"The only question was when, and there could never be a perfect moment.\" \nUS President Joe Biden announced in April that American troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September, saying it was \"time to end America's longest war\".\nThe US had some 2,500 troops in the country as part of a 9,600-strong Nato mission.\nThat would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the US in 2001.\nThe Taliban told the BBC this month that any foreign troops left in Afghanistan after Nato's September withdrawal deadline will be at risk as occupiers.\nBut violence in the country continues to rise, with the Taliban taking more territory.\nUnder a deal with the militant group, the US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops in return for a commitment by the Taliban not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control.\nAfter nearly 20 years of western military support, most Nato forces have now left the country for good. \nThat includes the majority of the 750 British troops who were in the capital Kabul to assist with security and training.\nThe head of the Armed Forces, General Sir Nick Carter, says that those British troops who served in Afghanistan can be proud of what they achieved.\nBut even he describes the current security situation in Afghanistan as \"pretty grim\", with the Taliban making significant advances.\nGeneral Carter says it's \"plausible\" that the country might now fracture along tribal and ethnic lines. \nThough he still believes the Taliban will not be able to control the whole country.\nA total of 475 British military personnel lost their lives in the country - most killed in Helmand before combat operations ended in 2014.\nTheir families will question whether they really leave a lasting legacy - whether their sacrifice was in vain. \nBoris Johnson insists that Britain is not walking away from the country.\nThere will still be a very small British military presence in Kabul to protect diplomatic missions. But did this costly Nato mission really achieve what it set out to do?\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the Taliban were \"making gains on the ground\" and \"serious questions remain about the future stability of Afghanistan\".\n\"A security threat remains to the wider world including to the UK, and nobody wants to see British troops permanently stationed in Afghanistan, but we simply cannot wash our hands or walk away,\" she said.\nThere had been \"moments of huge difficulty\" in the last 20 years, Ms Rayner said, but Afghanistan's current situation \"is more concerning than at any other point in many years\".\n\"It's hard to see a future without bloodier conflict and wider Taliban control,\" she said. \nMr Johnson told MPs Britain was \"not walking away\" from Afghanistan.\n\"We are keeping our embassy in Kabul and we will continue to work with our friends and allies, particularly with the government of Pakistan, to try to bring a settlement, to try to ensure that the Taliban understand that there can be no military path to victory and there must be a negotiated solution,\" he said.\nSpeaking after Mr Johnson's announcement, Head of the Armed Forces General Nick Carter said the situation in Afghanistan was \"pretty grim\", with half the country's rural districts now in the hands of the Taliban.\nHe warned there was a danger of \"state collapse\", adding: \"That's where you would see a culture of warlord-ism, and you might see some of the important institutions, like the security forces, fracturing along ethnic, or for that matter tribal, lines.\"\nDesignated transnational terrorist group, al-Qaeda, was able to establish itself in Afghanistan, led by Osama Bin Laden, over five years from 1996-2001.\nIt set up terrorist training camps, including experimenting with poison gas on dogs, and recruited and trained an estimated 20,000 jihadist volunteers from around the world. It also directed the twin attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, killing 224 people, mostly African civilians.\nAl-Qaeda was protected by the government at the time, the Taliban, who refused calls from the international community to expel the terror group after the 9/11 attacks in the US in September 2001. This led to the US-led bombing of Afghanistan, which began in October 2001. "

      "tags": "Tourism,Travel,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "With the vaccination programme racing against the spread of new variants, rules around international travel are rapidly changing.\nAlthough different countries have their own entry rules, a digital \"passport\" which provides evidence of a person's vaccination status has been rolled out across Europe.\nSimilar apps have been rolled out in the UK and while Scots have had to request theirs by post, Nicola Sturgeon has announced a QR system will be launched on Friday.\nPeople in Scotland have been able to access their certificate since 19 May - which shows both the dates of Covid vaccination and the type of drug administered.\nThe Scottish government said the service was intended to allow people access to a certificate without asking their GP, thereby \"easing the burden\" on the NHS.\nWhile no countries required vaccination status to travel when the service launched, some countries now do - and destinations have different entry rules which can change at short notice.\nThe government has information which you can check before travelling.\nMore than 30 countries, including Greece and Spain, now accept the pass.\nOriginally people could download the document online, but on 22 May the site suffered a security glitch which enabled people to alter details on the document using popular software programmes.\nBBC Scotland was able to download a certificate and edit it to include a false name and the address of the BBC's Glasgow headquarters.\nA fix was implemented on 25 May, which meant people in Scotland could only request the document be sent to them by post.\nPeople can view their vaccine status through the NHS Inform patient portal. Users have to log in using a unique username printed on their Covid vaccination appointment letter.\nThose who are not online can request the certificate to be posted by phoning a freephone Covid status helpline on 0808 196 8565.\nScotland's reliance on a paper system was previously criticised by travel agents, who said travellers were being \"blindsided\". \nConcerns emerged that the paper system was causing airport queues and more interactions with staff and passengers.\nBy the end of July, the Scottish government had awarded a Danish firm a \u00a3600,000 contract to develop a vaccine passport similar to those already in use elsewhere in the UK and Europe.\nOn Tuesday during a Covid update to Parliament, Ms Sturgeon confirmed people could download their certificate in the form of a QR code from Friday.\nPaper copies will continue but will include a QR code on them.\nFurthermore, vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month.\nMs Sturgeon said the hospitality industry as a whole would not be included in the certification scheme - although that decision would be kept under review.\nAnd there are no plans to include key services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services.\nAn EU vaccine \"passport\" has been introduced across all 27 member nations - plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.\nBecause the UK is no longer in the EU, the certificate is not available to most Britons, which has led to a number of problems.\nThe European system often requires people to present a QR code, however people in Scotland have been denied entry to certain places when they presented their paper certificate.\nFrance insists UK visitors are fully vaccinated before entry for non-essential travel. The country has also tightened its rules for any UK travellers who are not fully vaccinated, requiring them to have a negative test in the 24 hours before arrival, rather than the 48 hours allowed previously.\nThe country has also rolled out a new health pass which means people need proof of vaccination to enter places such as museums and cinemas.\nMeanwhile Norway initially only accepted Norwegian, Danish, Swedish or EU digital Covid certificates as proof of vaccination or previous illness.\nFrom 12 August it began to accept certificates from England and Wales as it was able to verify QR codes at the border.\nAgain this has caused problems for people in Scotland - including one man whose yacht has been stranded in Norway since last August.\nPeople in England can use the NHS app to either download their certificate or have it emailed to them. \nSimilar systems are in place in Wales and Northern Ireland, and while the NI system went offline following a data breach in early August, it is now up and running again.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has announced plans \"to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather\" by the end of September.\nUnder these new measures, people would show proof of vaccination by using the NHS Covid Pass app in England."

      "tags": "Moths,Butterflies,Wildlife,Nature,Insects",
      "text": "Lockdown sparked a surge in interest in moths, with a rise in rare species spotted last year.\nSightings were up by about a third - and many counties across the UK recorded species new to their area.\nExperts are heartened by a new found fascination for the insects, which they say are ecologically important but underappreciated and under threat.\nThey say July is the perfect month to find moths - and are calling for the public to go in search of them.\nMark Tunmore, editor of Atropos, the journal for butterfly, moth and dragonfly enthusiasts, said all the evidence points to a surge of interest during lockdown.\n\"It's not surprising in many ways, because moth trapping is an ideal activity for the garden,\" he said. \n\"All you need is a moth trap, which is something you can construct yourself or buy from specialist dealers, and once you've got that, you can run it in your garden and the moths come to you.\"\nData from the National Moth Recording Scheme suggests there was a rise of around a third in the numbers of people submitting sightings of moth species in 2020, while sales of moth traps also rose.\nIn Cheshire, seven species new to the county were recorded in 2020, including Light Feathered Rustic and Beautiful Marbled. Several species new to Cornwall were spotted in the county, and it was also a record year for numbers of some scarce migrant species such as Crimson Speckled, Slender Burnished Brass and Scar Bank Gem. \nIn Yorkshire, the number of annual moth records submitted rose by around a quarter in 2020. There was also a surge in interest in moth hunting in Shetland, with four species new to the islands recorded last year.\nWith many people desperate to find things to do in their own backyard during lockdown, moth trapping provided a distraction and interest, Mark Tunmore said.\n\"It's a whole new world once people start looking at moths and they're amazed by what's in their garden,\" he explained. \"Even in a very simple garden you can have dozens or hundreds of species, potentially, recorded over a long period of time.\"\nMoth traps are usually set up at night, and checked the following morning, although some moth species fly by day. The different species can be identified with the help of websites, apps and books.\nAtropos, the charity Butterfly Conservation, and the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH) are hoping to build on lockdown efforts by getting the public involved in the annual Moth Night, which this year takes place over two days and nights (8 to 10 July).\nThey are calling on the public to submit their daytime and nighttime sightings of species, as well as photographs.\nThe aim is to try to dispel some of the negative myths around moths, which are important both as pollinators and sources of food for other wildlife.\nOver the past 50 years, numbers of larger moths in Britain have declined by a third, due to habitat loss, climate change and pollution. Meanwhile, climate change also means that species favouring warmer weather have expanded their range across the UK.\n\"By submitting more records, the public is improving scientists' understanding of the impacts of environmental changes on moth populations and also British wildlife,\" said Dr David Roy of UKCEH.  \nThis year's event has an emphasis on wetlands, which support wildlife and mitigate climate change, but - like moths - are under threat from human activities.\n\"Moths and wetlands have a lot in common, for they are both important for a variety of wildlife but are both underappreciated and under threat, \" said Dr Richard Fox of Butterfly Conservation.\nHe added: \"Moths have a reputation for targeting people's wardrobes but only two common species - out of 2,500 in this country - cause damage to fabrics.\"\nMoths are somewhat overshadowed by butterflies, though they can be just as colourful and beautiful. \nMoths and butterflies belong to the same group of flying insects - called Lepidoptera, or \"scale wings\" in Greek, but likely emerged at different times in the geological past.\nThere is no single answer to the question of how to tell them apart physically, but there are some clues, such as flying habits, wing position and the shape of the antennae.\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

However, it was sold to a single bid from a man and a woman.\nThe drawing was created using silverpoint on pale pink-beige paper and is among a number of the artist's small-scale drawings of animals, which date back to the early 1480s.\nLaetitia Masson, an expert in old master drawings at Christie's, described silverpoint as \"a very difficult technique, because it doesn't really admit any mistake\". It involves applying a silver stick to a specially prepared paper to leave marks and lines, requiring delicate touch and pressure.\nMs Masson said Leonardo was fascinated by nature and animals in general.\nThe sketch previously belonged to British painter and collector Sir Thomas Lawrence, before being sold at Christie's in 1860 for \u00a32.50. \nIt has been included in a number of exhibitions, notably a major show at the National Gallery in London in 2011.\nLeonardo da Vinci, who was born in 1452 and died in 1519, is famous for both his art and inventions. \nIn 2017, a 500-year-old painting of Christ believed to have been painted by Leonardo sold in New York for a record $450m (\u00a3341m).\nKnown as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World), the sale represented the highest auction price for any work of art.

      "text": "As theatre shows rejoice at reopening, one actress has had extra cause for celebration - after receiving a surprise onstage marriage proposal.\nNatalie Pilkington from the musical Six said she was \"absolutely gobsmacked\" when boyfriend Andy McGuire got down on one knee after the show's finale. \nAfter she said \"yes\", the audience at Leeds Grand went wild and the rest of the cast threw confetti.\nPilkington adds she \"literally had absolutely no idea\" of McGuire's plan.\nPilkington is what is known as a \"swing\" performer, who understudies several roles, on the UK touring production of Six - an uproarious romp which turns Henry VIII's wives into Beyonc\u00e9 and Ariana-style divas. \nOn Saturday, she was starring as Anne Boleyn, a part she played for the first time on the tour last month. \n\"I'm what you call a super-swing. I cover all six of the parts, so it's a rarity that I go on very often,\" 31-year-old Pilkington, from Chorley, Lancashire, told BBC News. \n\"But I believe that Andy had organised it all. Andy had been arranging with the office at Six and with my agent to make sure that I was going to be on stage, but I literally had absolutely no idea,\" she added.\nShe said she was told there was going to be a charity announcement at the end of Saturday night's finale.\nOne of the other cast members then welcomed a man called Andy onto the stage. \n\"And then when my Andy walked out, I was just like, 'Oh my God, what's he doing here?',\" said the actress. \n\"I think I just knew straight away what was going to happen when I saw him in his suit and everything, but I was gobsmacked. Absolutely gobsmacked.\"\nMcGuire, 34, from Leeds, and Pilkington have been together for four-and-a-half years. \nThe actress recently returned to the stage after working as a teaching assistant in a special needs school when theatres shut at the start of the pandemic.\nShe said she thinks McGuire had been planning various ways to pop the question all through lockdown but kept being thwarted as anything he'd booked was later cancelled. \n\"I think he just thought in the end, you know what, we're going to do it the safest way and probably the best way,\" said Pilkington.\nSix started life at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2017 and went on to become a West End smash.\nIt received five Olivier Award nominations and was later performed to sell out shows in  Chicago and on Broadway.\nThe current UK tour is continuing until September 2022. The West End production is currently at the Lyric Theatre until 29 August 2021.  \nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The Olympic Games in Japan will be held without spectators at venues in and around the capital after a spike in coronavirus infections. \nOlympics Minister Tamayo Marukawa made the announcement after talks with officials and organisers on Thursday.\nA state of emergency in Tokyo will run throughout the Games, to combat coronavirus.\nPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters it would run from 12 July and remain in place until 22 August.\nBars and restaurants will not be allowed to serve alcohol and must close by 20:00 (11:00 GMT).\nVenues in Tokyo and other areas near the capital city will not be allowed to hold events with fans during the Games.\nBut stadiums in the regions of Fukushima, Miyagi and Shizuoka will be permitted to have spectators up to 50% of capacity and up to 10,000 people.\nCoronavirus infections are rising in Tokyo as the 23 July opening ceremony edges closer.\nThere has been widespread opposition to the Games in Japan, with calls for them to be postponed or cancelled.\nAfter meeting government officials, Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said: \"It is regrettable that we are delivering the Games in a very limited format, facing the spread of coronavirus infections.\n\"I am sorry to those who purchased tickets and everyone in local areas.\"\nTokyo governor Yuriko Koike said that holding Olympic events without spectators was \"heart-breaking\" for those who wanted to attend. It was not immediately clear if refunds will be made available to some or all ticketholders.\nMr Suga announced the state of emergency in Tokyo earlier in the day.\n\"Taking into consideration the effect of coronavirus variants and not to let the infections spread again to the rest of the nation, we need to strengthen our countermeasures,\" the prime minister said. \nThe state of emergency was announced after a meeting between the organising committee, the government and the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, who has just arrived in Japan.\nThe Olympic Games are scheduled to take place in the Japanese capital between 23 July and 8 August. The Paralympic Games are between 24 August and 5 September.\nA new wave of infections began in April, but overall the country has had relatively low case numbers and a death toll of around 14,900.\nOn Wednesday, there were 2,180 new cases reported in the country. Some 920 of those were in Tokyo, up from 714 last week and its highest since 1,010 on 13 May.\nJapan's vaccination rollout has been slow, and just over 15% of the country is fully vaccinated. There is rising concern over the threat of the Delta variant. \nIn Tokyo and Osaka, the two cities hit hardest by the recent surge, authorities hope over-65s will be fully vaccinated by the end of July. \nEntry to Japan by foreigners from 159 countries - including the UK - is currently banned.\nThere is lots of opposition to the Games, which have already been postponed by a year because of Covid-19 and have experienced setbacks, including massive budget overruns.\nA June poll in the leading Asahi Shimbun newspaper suggested more than 80% of the population wanted the Games cancelled or postponed.\nThe paper also called for them to be cancelled. \nPublic spectator sites have been scrapped and companies have been hesitant about advertising related to the Olympics because of the widespread opposition to them."

That is also the maximum fine in Northern Ireland, where the government has said police will visit venues to check compliance.\nCouncils in Scotland have the power to issue enforcement notices which could lead to prosecution for non-compliance.\nCovid passes can also be used for travelling abroad, to show your vaccination status or test results.\nHowever, it is important to check Foreign Office advice for any other requirements at your destination before you travel. \nAs yet there is no evidence that Covid passports stop the spread of the virus. \nThey have, however, led to an increase in vaccination rates in some countries where they have been introduced, according to a study by researchers at the University of Oxford, which was published in the Lancet. \nFrance, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland had lower-than-average vaccination rates before announcing plans for Covid certification.  \nEach country subsequently experienced a large increase in vaccine take-up 20 days before and 40 days after the introduction of the passports. \nPasses made little difference to vaccination rates in other countries such as Germany where take-up was already above average, or in Denmark where the supply of doses was limited.

      "tags": "NHS Grampian,NHS Scotland,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Health boards should consider cancelling non-urgent procedures to reduce pressure on hospitals, a senior public health official has said.\nJillian Evans, the head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said it would \"make sense\" to defer some operations.\nIt comes after two hospitals reached full capacity in the north east.\nNHS Lanarkshire and NHS Highland have also reported pressure on services in recent days.\nNHS Lanarkshire said it had considered scaling back procedures due to staff absences and rising Covid admissions.\nAnd NHS Highland cancelled all non-urgent elective surgery and most outpatient activity at Inverness' Raigmore Hospital amid growing pressure. \nThe health boards said self-isolation requirements meant that a number of staff who were double vaccinated had to stay off after being in contact with the virus outside of work.\nMs Evans told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that health boards across Scotland were going to see a \"really busy\" period over the next two months.\nShe said: \"It would make sense for us to try to mitigate as many risks of safety of the health of our population and our staff as possible by making some difficult decisions about elective care.\n\"That is where I think it would make more sense to start thinking about reducing pressure there couple with any changes and evidence that emerge about the safety of people when they are double jabbed.\"\nAsked whether it would make sense to start cancelling operations now, she said: \"It would make sense to look at deferring some of those. \n\"It is better to do that in a planned way then to do it on the day, that disrupts and causes upset for everyone. We want to be honest with people and help them understand what to expect.\"\nAnother possible solution would be to reassess whether double vaccinated health and social care staff need to self isolate if they had been in contact with the virus, according to Prof Jackie Taylor, president of Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow.\nInstead, she said staff identified as contacts would take a PCR test and if it was negative, return to work while taking daily lateral flow tests.\nHowever, she said there would need to be \"very firm evidence\" that changes to the quarantine policy would be beneficial.\nShe told Good Morning Scotland: \"I think it's not unreasonable to consider looking at a more proportionate policy for double vaccinated people.\n\"We're going to have do this when we start exploring what happens after level zero anyway but I think it is extremely important that we look at everything else we can do to reduce pressure on the system. \n\"I would certainly want to see a clear rationale and evidence that is an effective strategy both safe for patients and staff.\"\nEarlier this week Scotland's education secretary said having different isolation rules for fully vaccinated people was being \"actively reviewed\" as a potential way of easing staffing pressures in hospitals, schools and other public services. \nMs Evans said she agreed a change to self isolation rules for NHS staff would \"inevitably\" ease pressure on hospitals - but there was still the danger than one in five people who are double vaccinated could still go on to have Covid.\nScotland is expected to move to level zero on 19 July, with remaining legal restrictions lifted on 9 August - however, the first minister said the planned dates were not \"set in stone\".\nThe Scottish government said it was closely monitoring data after it was revealed that Scotland has the highest Covid rates in Europe.\nAnalysis by BBC Scotland data journalist Marc Ellison\nAn increasing number of health boards are saying that drastic measures may be needed in light of a surge in coronavirus cases.\nIs this reflected in the latest official data? In a word, no.\nUnlike the Covid-specific data sets, which only lag by a few days, the current figures on A&E activity and admissions only take us up to 27 June.\nSo what, if any, warning signs were there in the data of mounting pressure on boards and their hospitals? NHS Lanarkshire said this week that it had seen \"unprecedented levels\" of attendance at A&E departments. But the data shows that attendance was down at all three of the board's hospitals by an average of 9% between the 6 and 27 June.\nIn fact, people going to A&E only increased slightly at some hospitals like Shetland's Gilbert Bain Hospital (4%).\nSo what about pressure on planned operations? NHS Grampian said that Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI) and Dr Gray's Hospital in Moray had postponed all non-urgent procedures. But again the data is limited and only gives us a snapshot in time.\nAll we know, for example, is that by the end of May, ARI saw an increase of 15% in cancellations related to capacity\nBoards have also blamed staff absences - due to self-isolation requirements and summer holidays - for the mounting pressure on their resources. The Scottish Government does record and publish this daily, but not at a board level. However, we can still see that staff absences more than doubled from 1,238 to 2,760 between 1 June and 6 July.\nSo essentially while data sets do exist, they lag too far behind to give us a real-time picture."

      "text": "Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 350 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths reported across almost 200 countries. \nThe US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, France and Russia. \nVery few places have been left untouched. \nThe latest available data for the total number of cases in France since the start of the pandemic is from 16 January. \nIn the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.\nThe true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.\nDeaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. \nData on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. \nNearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 96 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. \nThe map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.\nAccording to that data, around 60% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. \nSome countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. \nOf those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Denmark and the UK have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. \nThe number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  \nStudies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said the \"tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world\".\nAsia\nAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, is starting to see case numbers increase once more.\nThere has been a sharp rise in daily cases in India and the country is reporting its highest number of confirmed cases since May 2021, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial centre of Mumbai.\nThe official death toll in India is about 490,000 and it has recorded nearly 49 million cases - second only to the US.\nChina, which is preparing to host the Winter Olympics in February, has announced that it will not be selling tickets to members of the public for the Games. Beijing's \"dynamic zero Covid\" strategy combines mass vaccination with constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps.\nEurope\nSeveral European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.\nFrance, Germany and Italy are experiencing a rapid increase in infections, with France currently seeing more daily cases on average than anywhere else in Europe. \nIn the UK, case numbers are falling after a spike over the holiday period. Hospitalisations and deaths appear to have been greatly reduced due to the UK's widespread vaccination rollout.\nNorth America\nThe US has recorded more than 70 million cases and over 860,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. \nDr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has said the latest wave now seems to be going in the right direction but hospitalisations could still put pressure on health services in areas of the country where people had not been fully vaccinated or had a booster.\nThe death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America, cases appear to be on the rise again in most places, with Argentina, Mexico and Peru reporting their highest numbers of confirmed cases.\nBrazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 24 million cases and 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. \nIn Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.\nAfrica\nAfrica has seen at least 10 million cases and more than 235,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.\nAccording to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. \nSouth Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the government says this fourth wave has now peaked and numbers are falling.\nSeveral African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Morocco and Tunisia. \nMiddle East\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. \nThe official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.\nIsrael currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. It has now begun administering a fourth vaccine dose to people aged over 60 and to healthcare workers.\nOceania\nEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began. \nThe country lifted most of its restrictions in December but the Omicron variant has fuelled a surge in cases.\nSo far, Australia has seen more than two million confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths, while there have been 15,000 cases in New Zealand and only 52 deaths. \nCovid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. \nIt was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.\nA pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. \nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.\nThe map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands."

      "title": "Euros 2020: What all of us can learn from Gareth Southgate",
      "tags": "Diversity",
      "text": "Part of Gareth Southgate's success could be his willingness to turn to football outsiders to help prepare his England team. One of these advisers, former Olympian Matthew Syed, argues there's a lot the rest of the world can learn about this approach.   \nIf there is one universal truth about human psychology, it is that we love being surrounded by people who think just like us. The Ancient Greeks called it \"homophily\" which means \"love of the same\". It was Plato who warned \"birds of a feather flock together\".  \nIn some ways, this is the story of the England football set-up for the last three decades, the squad run by a true \"footballing man\" advised by other \"footballing men\". The idea is that if you get knowledgeable football chaps in a room, you will maximise the amount of knowledge - and thereby find a way to win matches. \nThis is why when Sir Clive Woodward - a world-class rugby coach - was appointed as an assistant coach at Southampton FC a few years ago, there was uproar. \"But he's a rugby person\", football insiders said in horror. \n\"If Harry Redknapp - the coach of Southampton at the time - needs advice, what is wrong with, say, Tony Pulis or David Pleat (both English based football coaches)? They are experts on football!\"\nThe curious thing about these arguments is that they are, on the surface, persuasive. It is true that Pulis knows more about football than Woodward. But do you see the problem? Redknapp already knows what Pulis knows. They were each socialised into the assumptions of English football: a way of setting up tactically, diet, recovery, you name it. They are, if you like, intellectual \"clones\". \nIf you put Redknapp, Pulis and Pleat in a room - all good footballing men - you would have high individual knowledge, but you would also have collective uniformity. You would have an echo chamber. They would reflect each other's assumptions back to each other. It would be comfortable, chummy and consensual. It would also be monolithic and non-creative. \nThis tendency is a problem that extends beyond English football. When the CIA was founded in 1947, it hired brilliant analysts, but they also happened to look similar - white, middle-class, Anglo Saxon, Protestant males. \nThe recruiters, doubtless subconsciously, were influenced by homophily. As the academics Milo Jones and Philippe Silberzahn put it: \"The first consistent attribute of the CIA's identity from 1947 to 2001 is homogeneity in terms of race, sex, ethnicity and class background.\"\nThe same is true of many of the big tech firms such as Google which, a decade or so ago, wondered why innovation had dried up, despite hiring so many brilliant software engineers. \nThey then realised that they were hiring people from similar universities who had learned under similar professors and had absorbed a similar range of concepts, heuristics and models. They were \"clones\" of each other. Only when they started looking beyond their usual horizons, reaching out to different universities and social networks, did things change. \nGareth Southgate, the England head coach, has followed a different approach, opening himself up to new ideas from the outset. \nOne source of these ideas is the FA Technical Advisory Board, an eclectic group that has been advising on performance in regular meetings since 2016.  \nMembers (all unpaid volunteers) include Sir Dave Brailsford, a cycling coach, Colonel Lucy Giles, a college commander at the Sandhurst Military Academy, the Olympic rower Dame Kath Grainger, Manoj Badale, a tech entrepreneur, the rugby coach Stuart Lancaster and David Sheepshanks, mastermind behind the St George's Park national football centre. \nAt first, football insiders were horrified by this group, with negative articles appearing in the British press. We are not \"footballing men\". But this is why the group is capable of offering fresh insights on preparation, diet, data, mental fortitude and more. This is sometimes called \"divergent\" thinking to contrast it with the \"convergence\" of echo chambers. \n\"I like listening to people who know things that I don't,\" Southgate told me. \"That's how you learn.\"\nSouthgate has also assembled a diverse group of coaches in Graeme Jones, Chris Powell and Martyn Margetson - individuals who have deep but very different experiences of the game. And, just as importantly, he's keen to listen to them: the moment England score, the celebration is curtailed so that Southgate can gain the input of Steve Holland, his assistant. \nThese diverse coaches are not rebels in the sense of seeking to disrupt the team. Rather, they are rebels in the sense of injecting fresh thinking which helps everyone perform better. \nThe tragedy is that people in echo chambers often don't even realise they are trapped. This is a point made by the novelist David Foster Wallace, who tells a story that starts in a fish tank. \"There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish, who nods at them and says 'Morning, boys. How's the water?' And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then one of them looks at the other and goes, 'What the hell is water?'\" \nWallace's point is that when we are surrounded by people who think the same way, we can overlook the obvious. Classic examples include Blockbuster, which missed the opportunities of the internet despite dominating the movie rental business, and Kodak, which was so fixated on print photography that it never took the opportunities afforded by digital. \nThe CIA missed an entire series of threats due to its clone-like recruits. A few more rebels could have changed everything. It wasn't until after the 9-11 attack that the CIA started to broaden its intake. \nOf course, diversity shouldn't be pursued frivolously. If Brailsford, Giles, Badale, Grainger et al were advising not on football performance but how to design the Large Hadron Collider, they would be ineffectual. Introducing outsiders for the sake of it rarely works. The key is to bring people together whose perspectives are both relevant to the problem, and which are also different from each other. This maximises both \"depth\" and \"range\" of knowledge - leading to \"collective intelligence\". \nThe England football team haven't won the Euros, and there's a long way to go. But the power of diversity is beyond dispute, central to the strategies of many of the most cutting-edge institutions. \nEcho chambers may be comfortable but they are inherently self-limiting. In the post-pandemic age, with the world changing faster than ever, it is diversity that unlocks the key to success. \nMatthew Syed is author of Rebel Ideas: the Power of Diverse Thinking and represented Great Britain in table tennis at two Olympic Games "

      "text": "A lack of available properties is helping to push up house prices, surveyors say.\nAs a result, a majority of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) members think prices will continue to rise over the next year.\nThe shrinking supply meant the number of new properties coming to the market fell by a third in June.\nBut with no let-up in demand, all parts of the UK continued to report robust increases in house prices, RICS said.\n\"Respondents are pretty unanimous in once again highlighting the challenge around supply, whether in the sales or rental markets,\" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist.\nWith demand increasing and supply continuing to falter, a net balance of 83% of surveyors reported an increase.\nLooking ahead, a net balance of 56% anticipated that prices will continue to increase over the next twelve months.\nDemand from tenants rose in June, boosting the rental market and pushing up rent costs.\nA net balance of 60% of surveyors noted a rise in demand, up from 48% in May. \nBut a shortfall in new landlord instructions intensified with a net balance of -32% of surveyors reporting a decline in supply. \nSurveyors predicted rental growth would grow slightly as a result, suggesting a 3% rise over the coming twelve months, including in London, where the rental market has bounced back since a RICS assessment earlier in the year.\nThere were notable sharp house rises in Yorkshire & the Humber, Northern Ireland and Wales, according to surveyors.\nBen Hudson, York surveyor reported: \"The busiest sales month on record with the push towards the end of June stamp duty deadline.\"\nIn Haverfordwest in Wales, Paul Lucas said: \"The sales market is currently extremely buoyant with buyers moving to Pembrokeshire from both England and many parts of Wales.\"\nBut London is presenting a different picture, said Allan Fuller, Putney surveyor. \"New buyer enquiries have reduced except for larger houses where demand remains strong, as opposed to flats,\" he said.\nMr Rubinsohn said the government needed to continue to help increase the supply of new homes.\n\"While the role of the credit channel and the extended period of ultra-low interest rates can't be ignored, it is critical the government is able to create the conditions to support higher levels of new build development to address the worsening affordability challenge,\" he said.\nBut he added homes are \"needed across all tenures\", including social and private rent alongside home ownership.\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said \"decisive action\" was being taken to ensure the country had the new homes and ownership options needed.\n\"We delivered more than 243,000 homes last year - the highest in over 30 years and the seventh year in a row with an increase,\" the person said.\nThe department also pointed out the government had reformed the planning system, and that measures such as Help to Buy and shared ownership were in place."

      "tags": "Media,Amsterdam,Netherlands",
      "text": "The son of Dutch investigative reporter Peter R de Vries has said the family's \"worst nightmare came true\" when his father was shot and seriously wounded.\nRoyce de Vries added that the family were taking \"enormous support\" from the messages of solidarity pouring in.\nMr de Vries, 64, was shot on Tuesday after leaving a TV studio in Amsterdam. Three men were arrested, but police say one is no longer a suspect.\nOfficials say the journalist is fighting for his life in hospital.\nThe veteran journalist is well known for his coverage of the criminal underworld, exposing gangsters and drug lords. He has helped police solve a number of high-profile cases, and also investigated cold cases, especially concerning children and teenagers.\nMr de Vries has faced danger because of his work in the past. He has needed police protection after receiving threats in connection with his coverage of criminal cases, and in 2019 police told him he was on the hit list of the Netherlands' most wanted criminal.\nPrime Minister Mark Rutte said the shooting was \"shocking and incomprehensible\", adding that it was an attack on a \"courageous journalist\" and on the freedom of the press.\nKing Willem-Alexander and Queen M\u00e1xima said they were \"deeply shocked\" and that \"journalists must be free to carry out their important work without threats.\"\nTributes including flowers, candles and messages have been placed at the scene of the shooting. There have also been strong reactions from outside the Netherlands. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, called the attack a crime against journalism.\n\"We will relentlessly continue to defend the freedom of the press,\" he wrote.\nThe attack happened just after 19:30 (17:30 GMT) on Tuesday, as the journalist was walking away after a chat show on the Lange Leidsedwarsstraat in central Amsterdam.\nFive shots were fired at close range and Mr de Vries was hit in the head, local media reported.\nDutch police later said they would continue to hold two men in connection with the shooting. They said a 35-year-old Polish man and a 21-year-old Dutch man would face a magistrate on Friday.\nA third suspect, who is 18 years old, will be released.\nThe attack has put the spotlight once again on the safety of journalists.\nThe International Federation of Journalists called the attack \"another tragic blow to press freedom in Europe.\"\nEuropean Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said \"attacks against journalists are attacks against all of us.\"\nAlthough journalists work in a relatively safe environment in the EU, there have been high-profile killings of investigative reporters in recent years which have shocked the continent.\nLast year, a former soldier in Slovakia was jailed for 23 years for the killing of journalist Jan Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e in 2018.  \nIn Malta, two men were charged earlier this year with supplying the car bomb that killed investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2017.\nPeter R de Vries has covered numerous high-profile crimes, including the 1983 kidnapping of beer magnate Freddy Heineken.\nIn 2013 Heineken's kidnapper, Willem Holleeder, was convicted of making threats against Mr de Vries. \nOne of the Netherlands' most notorious gangsters, Holleeder, was given a life sentence in 2019 for his involvement in five murders.\nA novel Mr de Vries wrote about the case was later adapted into the movie Kidnapping Freddy Heineken, starring Anthony Hopkins.\nThe journalist also won an Emmy Award for a television show he made about Natalee Holloway, a US teenager who disappeared on the Caribbean island of Aruba in 2005.\nMr de Vries frequently acted as a spokesperson for witnesses in police or court cases, and had been acting as an adviser to Nabil B, a former gang member testifying in the case against alleged drug lord, Ridouan Taghi.\nThe Moroccan-Dutch suspect and his associates are currently on trial in the Netherlands for murder and drug trafficking.\nThe case has already sent shock waves through Netherlands after Nabil B's previous lawyer Derk Wiersum was assassinated in front of his Amsterdam home in September 2019.\nThe attack has put the spotlight once again on the safety of journalists.\nThe International Federation of Journalists called the attack \"another tragic blow to press freedom in Europe.\""

      "text": "From next month, fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK will no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or after arrival. \nFor the first time since the pandemic began, Wales has also stopped advising against non-essential foreign travel. \nFrom 04:00 GMT on 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s will no longer need to take a lateral flow test two days after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTravellers who aren't fully vaccinated will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. \nHowever, they will still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before they travel, and they must still take a post-arrival PCR test. They won't need to self-isolate unless the day two test is positive. \nTo qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with \"approved proof of vaccination\". This now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February.\nAll passengers will still need to fill in a passenger locator form.\nFully vaccinated passengers (who have had two doses) and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.\nHowever, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over (11 and over in Scotland) must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.\nThe test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests cannot be used. \nIf they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.\nVaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.\nBefore departure: \nAll unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, and take an LFT or PCR in the 48 hours before departure. \nThe test can be taken either in the country where you start your journey, or in another country en route to the UK.\nIf you test positive, you must follow the rules in the country you're in, and not travel onwards to the UK.\nAfter arrival:\nIf you've not been fully vaccinated you must quarantine for 10 days after arrival in the UK.\nYou must also take two PCR tests - on days two and eight of your quarantine.\nThese must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately from a government-approved list of providers. \nTravellers to England also have the option of ending quarantine under the Test To Release scheme - this involves taking a private PCR test after five days of isolation. A negative test will allow them to leave quarantine, although they must still take another PCR test on day eight. \nThese rules do not apply to travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, unless they have been in another country in the 10 days before their departure for the UK.\nDigital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. \nTest results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish.\nEuropean Union residents can use the EU Digital Covid Certificate to show their vaccination status or test results.\nFrom 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will also be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass.\nYou need to check the UK Foreign Office website for entry requirements of any other countries you visit. These can change quickly.\nCovid passes issued in the UK can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination - either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated later than 1 November 2021)."

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,Parliamentary Standards Commissioner ",
      "text": "Boris Johnson has been criticised by the MPs standards watchdog for failing to promptly explain how a trip to Mustique was funded - however he has been cleared of breaching the rules.\nAn inquiry was launched into the prime minister's 2019 Caribbean holiday after confusion over who paid for the trip.\nThe Committee on Standards has now concluded that Mr Johnson's account was \"accurate and complete\".\nBut, it added it was \"regrettable\" a full explanation had not come earlier.\nIn making its judgement, the committee overruled the Commons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone who having carried out the report had concluded that Mr Johnson broke the rules by having not \"fulfilled conscientiously\" the requirements to register donations.\nThe committee - made up of MPs and members of the public - said it reached a different conclusion after receiving additional evidence. \nThe prime minister told reporters he hadn't seen the conclusions of the report but said \"as I understand it, the committee has found there was no case to answer.\"\nResponding to the report, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: \"The way Johnson handles his personal finances mirrors the way he governs the country - chaos and confusion.\"\nThis report reads a bit like a weary teacher's verdict on an unruly pupil... \"I'm not angry, just disappointed,\" it might have said. \nBoris Johnson hasn't broken the rules but neither has he gone out of his way to comply with them. \nNot for the first time, the committee points out. \nBefore he was prime minister, Mr Johnson broke parliamentary rules by not declaring his share of a property soon enough and his own standards advisor said he acted \"unwisely\" over the refurbishment of his Downing street flat. \nHis political opponents claim it's a pattern of behaviour that makes him unsuitable to govern. \nBut Boris Johnson has survived another brush with authority unscathed. \nIn February 2020, Mr Johnson declared that his \u00a315,000 holiday accommodation on the Caribbean island had been covered by Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross.\nMr Ross initially said he had not paid \"any monies\" for the trip. He later clarified that he had \"facilitated\" accommodation for the prime minister.\nFollowing an investigation, the Committee on Standards concluded that Mr Ross had donated the accommodation, but added that the arrangements had been \"ad hoc and informal and do not appear to have been fully explained to Mr Johnson at the outset\".\n\"This matter could have been concluded many months ago if more strenuous efforts had been made to dispel the uncertainty,\" the committee said.\n\"It is regrettable that a full account and explanation of the funding arrangements for Mr Johnson's holiday accommodation has only come to light as a result of our own inquiries rather than at an earlier stage. \n\"Given that Mr Johnson was twice reprimanded by our predecessor committee in the last Parliament in the space of four months for 'an over-casual attitude towards obeying the rules of the House', we would have expected him to have gone the extra mile to ensure there was no uncertainty about the arrangements.\"\nIn May 2020, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, undertook the investigation on behalf of the committee.\nShe found that Mr Johnson had \"sought and was offered\" use of a villa owned by Mr Ross, a Conservative party supporter and friend of Mr Johnson. \nHowever, Mr Ross' villa was unavailable for the dates of Mr Johnson's holiday so instead another villa was found for the prime minister.\nThe commissioner said Mr Johnson was right to name Mr Ross as a donor, but said if another person had provided funds, Mr Johnson should also have given the details of whoever funded his holiday accommodation in the first instance. \nMs Stone said it had been \"unusually difficult\" to establish the facts during her investigation - which had been delayed due to the pandemic and Mr Johnson's own stay in hospital.\nDue to a lack of \"reliable documentary evidence\", she said she was unable to conclude whether Mr Johnson's account was accurate and complete adding \"it is not my role to provide the missing information - this remains the responsibility of the member.\"\nHowever she did conclude that the prime minister had breached the code because he did not \"make sufficient inquiries\" to establish who was providing his accommodation.\nOn receiving the commissioner's report, the committee concluded it did not have sufficient evidence to judge if the code had been broken.\nHowever after making further inquiries - including contacting the owner of the villa where Mr Johnson stayed -  it said it reached a different conclusion from the commissioner and decided that Mr Johnson had not breached the rules.\nThe committee explained it had received confirmation from the owners of the villa where Mr Johnson stayed that they had been paid by the Mustique Company that manages the island.\nIn turn, the committee said, Mr Ross allowed the Mustique Company to use his own villa to compensate for Mr Johnson's holiday.\nIt therefore concluded that Mr Ross was the donor \"of a benefit in kind\" to the prime minister and that Mr Johnson's account of the donation had been accurate."

Its DNA has been recovered at the scene of the attack, and it will be compared with that of  any bear that authorities trap.\nA friend of Ms Lokan's, Mary Flowers, told AP news agency that Ms Lokan had taken long-distance bike trips in the past. On this latest journey she had been accompanied by her sister and a friend.\n\"She loved these kind of adventures,\" said Ms Flowers. \"She had a passion for life that was out of the ordinary.\"\nThe FWP said the bear first approached the campers at around 03:00 local time (09:00 GMT), but initially ran away. \nMs Lokan and her two companions, who were staying in a separate tent, then removed food from their tents and secured them before going back to sleep. But the bear returned shortly afterwards, leading to the fatal attack.\nOvando, a community of fewer than 100 people, sits to the south of Glacier National Park - an expanse of forests and mountains stretching over the border into Canada. \nThe park is home to the largest concentration of bears within the contiguous US, but fatal attacks are rare in the region. Over the last 20 years there have  been two other incidents, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.\nBears that attack people are not always killed if their attack results from a surprise encounter, or if the bear was defending its young. \nBut a Montana FWP spokesperson told AP that the bear involved in Ms Lokan's death is considered a threat because of the nature of the attack."

      "text": "A group of 28 foreign mercenaries, including retired Colombian soldiers, assassinated Haiti's President Jovenel Mo\u00efse earlier this week, police say.\nAfter a gun battle in the capital Port-au-Prince, 17 were detained, some at the house they were using, others after entering Taiwan's diplomatic compound.\nThree suspects were killed by police and eight are still being sought.\nBloodied and bruised, arrested suspects were shown to the media on Thursday, along with a slew of seized weapons.\nIt is still unclear who organised the attack and with what motive.\nAlso unclear is who is in charge of the country. On Friday, a group of political parties added to that uncertainty by nominating a president, although how much legitimacy that has is unknown.\nThe attack took place in the early hours of Wednesday, when gunmen broke into the president's home in Port-au-Prince, shooting him dead and wounding his wife. Mr Mo\u00efse, 53, was found lying on his back with 12 bullet wounds and a gouged eye, according to authorities.\nMartine Mo\u00efse, 47, was seriously wounded and is in a stable condition after being flown to Florida for treatment.\nPolice said the hit squad included mainly Colombians, along with two Haitian-Americans.\nFound in the suspects' possession were firearms, sets of US dollar bills, the president's personal chequebook and the server that held surveillance camera footage from his home, Le Nouvelliste newspaper reported.\nTaiwan confirmed that 11 of the suspects were arrested after breaking into a courtyard at its compound.\nAngry civilians had joined the search for the gunmen, and helped police track down some who were hiding in bushes. The crowd set fire to three of the suspects' cars and destroyed evidence.\nPolice chief L\u00e9on Charles called for calm, saying the public should not take the law into their own hands.\nAt the news conference on Thursday, police showed reporters Colombian passports.\n\"Foreigners came to our country to kill the president,\" Mr Charles said, as the suspects sat on the floor behind him in handcuffs.\nColombia's government has pledged to assist Haiti with its investigation efforts.\nColombian police director, Gen Jorge Luis Vargas, said 17 former Colombian soldiers were thought to be involved.\nThe US state department, meanwhile, said it could not confirm if any of its citizens had been detained.\nHowever, US and Canadian media are reporting that one of the dual citizens arrested, James Solages, 35, is from Florida and was a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haiti.\nAn investigating judge told local media that Mr Solages and the other US citizen, named as Joseph Vincent, had said they were there as translators for the mercenaries, after finding the job on the internet.\n\"The mission was to arrest President Jovenel Mo\u00efse... and not to kill him,\" Judge Cl\u00e9ment No\u00ebl told Le Nouvelliste.\nThe US said on Friday it was sending FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials to Haiti following the nation's request for help in the investigation.\nMembers of Mr Mo\u00efse's security detail have been summoned before Haiti's courts to answer questions about its failures.\nColombian daily El Tiempo said that it had seen confidential documents that named the Colombian suspects. The paper's research suggests that four of them flew from Colombia to the Dominican Republic on 4 June.\nThey crossed by land from there into Haiti two days later. The two countries share the island of Hispaniola.\nAccording to El Tiempo, Colombian intelligence has seen photos posted on social media by members of the group, showing them posing at a popular tourist spot in the Dominican Republic.\nThe killing has triggered some civil unrest in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Americas. A state of emergency remains in force across the country, while the Dominican Republic has closed its border.\nThe situation has been unclear and is getting murkier.\nIn this particular situation, the constitution says the National Assembly should choose another president. But disputes meant that elections scheduled for October 2019 did not take place - and Mr Mo\u00efse had been ruling by decree amid widespread protests.\nAmendments to the constitution - not accepted by everyone - suggest the prime minister should be the next one to take over.\nBut Haiti has both an interim prime minister, Claude Joseph, and a new appointee, Ariel Henry, who has yet to be sworn in.\nBoth are claiming to be in charge.\nOn Friday, a group of political parties signed a resolution proclaiming a new president - Joseph Lambert - with Mr Henry acting as his PM.\nThe situation is doing little to resolve the political and economic instability that has long plagued the nation."

      "text": "Terminally ill people with less than a year to live will get fast-tracked for benefits after ministers said they will expand the timeframe for those eligible for special consideration.\nPreviously patients had to prove they had less than six months to live and charities say many died without their cases being resolved. \nIt is two years since a government review was launched into the issue.\nCampaigners say it is a \"significant step forward\". \nThey have been seeking a change to how terminally ill people access benefit support, known as Personal Independence Payments (PIP). \nUnder the current rules, patients in England and Wales must provide medical proof that they have six months or less to live to access benefits quickly and at a higher rate.\nAnd if they live longer than three years after benefits are awarded, they have to be reassessed. \nCharities and some MPs say people have endured distress trying to wade through red tape, filling in forms and attending interviews with benefits advisers.\nAnd some patients have died waiting for the welfare benefits they need.\nHelen Nicell, who has stage 4 cancer, told the BBC her payment was reduced initially when she was moved from disability allowance to PIP because a doctor could not say she was likely to die within six months.\nShe said: \"To have to ask your consultant - do you think I may only have six months to live -  when really they can't answer that, it's a very, very difficult question and very difficult to live with. \n\"The consultant said it was actually impossible to put a prognosis on how long it would take.\n\"The cancer is in my spine and at any point it could spread in to one of my organs\" she said. \nShe added: \"When you have retired from work and you have a budget and you have no other income\" the uncertainty of waiting for an assessment to come through is very hard.\nIn a written statement to MPs,  Minister for Disabled People, Justin Tomlinson, said the changes will \"increase much needed support for people who are nearing the end of their lives\".\nHe said the new 12-month approach \"will ensure people get the financial help they need as quickly as possible in the most challenging of times.\"\n\"Under the updated rules, clinicians still have discretion and will be supported by a realistic and straightforward definition\" he added.\nIn an interview with BBC News, Mr Tomlinson said under the special rules, payments can be made within four to five days rather than 16 weeks.\nHe said the changes will bring the benefits system in line with the NHS definition of terminal illness, which is having less than twelve months to live.\n\"What clinicians were telling us was about removing duplication\", he said.\n\"The GP and the patient would have this devastating awful conversation at 12 months as part of the NHS role and then they would have to come and have it a second time with us to get the GPs the [benefits] form at six months\". \nMatthew Reed, Chief Executive of Marie Curie welcomed the announcement as a \"significant step forward\", and a \"tribute to all those who bravely shared their experiences of the benefits system\".\n\"This will help ensure that more dying people can concentrate on making the most of the limited time they have left, rather than worrying about their finances. \n\"There is more to be done, but this is important progress and we look forward to working with the UK Government to bring in this change as quickly as possible\", he said. \nSally Light, CEO of the Motor Neurone Disease Association said the recommendations \"must be implemented quickly\".\n\"No more people already facing the most difficult time of their life [should] have to wait to claim the support they not only desperately need but are entitled to\". \nThe changes will not happen immediately - ministers say the law will be changed within 12 months \"when parliamentary time allows\". \nThe reforms  in England and Wales follow similar pledges in the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland and Scotland.  \nLast week the Stormont Assembly signalled it intended to scrap the six month rule for those with terminal illnesses.  \nAnd in 2019, Holyrood said it intended to do the same, with guidelines for clinicians due to be published this summer."

      "tags": "Scottish government,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The delay to ending quarantine for fully vaccinated contacts of people with Covid could lead to millions being asked to self-isolate this summer. \nThe knock-on for the economy and workplaces, including the NHS, could be huge, ministers are being warned.\nThe government says close contacts who are double-jabbed will not have to isolate after 16 August in England.\nBut BBC analysis shows more than 4.5 million people could still be asked to self-isolate between now and then. \nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Keir Starmer accused Boris Johnson of \"ignoring the next big problem that's heading down the track\" as he said \"millions\" would have to self-isolate as cases rose.\n\"It won't feel like freedom day to those who have to isolate, when they're having to cancel their holidays, when they can't go to the pub or even to their kid's sports day,\" he said.\nMr Johnson said the country was \"moving to a system of testing rather than self-isolation\".\nIndustry group UK Hospitality said the system was already causing \"carnage\". And chief executive Kate Nicholls added the government's plans did not go \"far enough, quickly enough\".\nHospital bosses have also expressed concern.\nNHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said: \"Trust leaders know self-isolation requirements are an ongoing source of frustration for some staff, particularly amongst those who have had both vaccinations, tested negative and want to support their colleagues at a time when there is very high pressure on staffing levels. \n\"There is a major risk that this situation will become more challenging after 19 July when all remaining restrictions are lifted, with the expectation that even more NHS staff will have to self-isolate as community infections rates spike. This is a real current cause of concern amongst trust leaders.\"\nA conservative guess is that we might see 1.5 million cases in the four weeks after 19 July - that would be just over 50,000 cases a day on average. \nAbout three close contacts have been identified for every Covid case reported, according to Test and Trace figures for England in the last month.\nSo, 1.5 million cases, each with about three contacts, gives us between four and five million contacts who might be asked to isolate between 19 July and 16 August.\nAnd, once restrictions are lifted on 19 July and society opens up further, we might expect to see the numbers of contacts to rise.      \nThis is a very rough calculation. The true figures could, of course, be lower or even higher. \nBut it's looking increasingly clear that millions of people will be close contacts of people with coronavirus and legally required to self-isolate in the weeks before England changes the rules.\nSo why are we doing it? Clearly there is a risk scrapping the self-isolation policy would push up the infection rate.\nThe hope is in another month the rise in cases will have peaked and the change would not be as risky.\nEngland is seeing close to 25,000 cases a day on average with cases doubling every 10 days.\nAnd with the remaining restrictions - such as social distancing, limits on the gatherings and the need to wear masks - set to be lifted on 19 July, ministers have warned the public they need to be braced for very high infection levels.\nOn Tuesday Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned there could be as many as 100,000 cases a day.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has conceded the plan to keep self-isolation requirements in place after the end of other restrictions in England was \"not a perfect solution\".\nHe added: \"You can't have it both ways. On the one hand we're saying we want to reopen but we're giving a measure of precaution in terms of delaying the lifting of self-isolation restrictions.\n\"It's a balance, it's not a perfect solution.\"\nUnder-18s, who are not currently entitled to the vaccine, will also no longer be required to self-isolate from 16 August if they are close contacts of a confirmed Covid case in England. \nOther parts of the UK are also seeing rising rates, which will mean many people will be asked to self-isolate. But those nations have not announced what they plan to do about self-isolation as they open up.\nSelf-isolation for people who have symptoms will still be required in England.\nIt is defined by the government as a person who has been close to someone who has tested positive for Covid.\nIt can be anyone who:\nYou can be deemed a contact any time from two days before the person who tested positive developed their symptoms - or, if they did not have any symptoms, from two days before the date their positive test was taken."

      "tags": "Counterfeit medication,Reality Check",
      "text": "The proliferation of fake medicines in Africa is a public health crisis that can no longer be ignored, according to a UK charity.\nThere's a meeting of seven African countries, in Togo, this week, to combat the problem.\nCongo, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Uganda, Ghana and The Gambia will discuss measures to clamp down on trafficking in fake medicines, says the Brazzaville Foundation.\nBut how big a problem is counterfeit medicine in Africa, and what impact does it have?\nGlobally, the trade in counterfeit pharmaceuticals is worth up to $200bn (\u00a3150bn) annually, with Africa among the regions most affected, according to industry estimates.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says 42% of all fake medicines reported to them between 2013 and 2017 were from Africa. \nThe European region and the Americas (North and South) accounted for 21% each.\nBut how reliable are these figures?\nThe WHO has a reporting mechanism that relies on national or regional regulatory authorities around the world to notify it of seizures. So the data for 2013-17 is only as good as the surveillance and reporting systems in the countries or regions concerned.\nThe WHO has itself noted that as more officers were trained and national regulators became more aware, the numbers of drug seizure reports went up. So it's possible areas with weak regulation and enforcement may be under-reporting the extent of the problem.\nBright Simons, who set up a mobile system to verify drugs in Ghana, says it's not possible to produce a precise estimate, as the trade is underground.\nBut there've been several seizures in recent years, which give an indication of the size of the problem in West Africa:\nThe accounting firm PwC says the proportion of fake pharmaceuticals in some countries can be as high as 70%, in developing regions such as Africa.\nThe WHO estimates one out of every 10 medical products in low- and middle-income countries, which includes most of Africa, is sub-standard or fake.\nAnalysis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for the WHO estimates substandard and fake anti-malarial drugs could be causing 116,000 extra deaths from the disease every year in sub-Saharan Africa at a cost to patients and health systems of on average $38.5m a year.\nAnd in 2015, a study published in the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene estimated more than 122,000 children under the age of five died each year because of sub-standard anti-malarial drugs in sub-Saharan Africa. \nAlthough these results are only estimates, the scientists say they suggest poor quality drugs are important contributors to under-five mortality rates.\nFake medicine can often be indistinguishable from the real products, with the packaging as good if not better than the original. \nAnd weak or inconsistent legal frameworks and the lack of regulations to address sales, often carried out online or in informal locations, add to the problem, the UN says.\nThere's also an issue with the cost of drugs in poorer countries. \n\"If a good quality medicine from a known supplier is too expensive, people may try a cheaper one from an unlicensed supplier,\" the WHO says.\nCutting prices for licensed drugs, however, does not guarantee a solution. \nEven low priced medicines can make money for criminals, as long as the sales volume is high enough.\nBut there are some technological solutions being tried out to tackle the problem, including mobile apps to help users verify medicines, using scratch stickers, barcodes and other means of identification printed on packaging.\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions\nFollow us on Twitter"

      "tags": "Women,Contraception",
      "text": "Some types of oral contraceptive pill can now be sold over the counter at pharmacies without a prescription, the UK's drug regulator has ruled. \nThe landmark decision should make access easier for people, although buyers will still need to have a consultation with the pharmacist.\nThe reclassification applies to two brands of \"progesterone only\" pill - Hana and Lovima. \nCombined oestrogen and progesterone pills still require a prescription.\nThe move has been welcomed by campaigners who say the coronavirus pandemic has made a difficult situation even worse for those trying to access contraception services. \nSexual health doctors say services have been stretched and underfunded for some time. \nHana and Lovima, which contain 75 micrograms of desogestrel, are still available for free on prescription too.\nThey should be taken once a day, with no break between packs. If a dose is missed by more than 12 hours, the contraceptive effect may fail. \nTaken correctly, the mini pill is more than 99% effective, meaning fewer than one in 100 women using it will get pregnant in a year. In reality, because of a range of factors, it is about 91% effective.\nMost women can take desogestrel even if they are over 35 and smoke, unlike the combined pill, where risks can outweigh benefits. \nDr June Raine, head of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said: \"This is good news for women and families. \n\"We have consulted a wide range of people to enable us to reach the decision to make this contraceptive available for the first time in the UK without prescription. We received many responses to our consultation, the majority of which supported this approach.\"\nThe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it was delighted by the news. \nDr Asha Kasliwal, president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said: \"Progestogen-only contraceptive pills are safe, reliable, easy to use and are an incredibly popular contraceptive method. Availability over the counter in pharmacies will make it easier for women to access essential contraception to avoid unplanned pregnancies during and beyond Covid-19.\" \nShe said successive cuts to public health budgets have made it harder for women to get the contraception they need. \n\"Reclassification may also reduce unnecessary pressures on GPs, who will not need to see patients for repeat prescriptions.\n\"However, reclassification of one brand is only the first step, and buying contraception should definitely not be the only solution. We are calling for these pills to be available to everyone for free in community pharmacies, as well as the reclassification of other contraceptives moving forward.\""

      "text": "Travel bosses have given a cautious welcome to the announcement that fully vaccinated travellers returning from amber-list countries will not have to self-isolate after 19 July.\nEasyJet boss Johan Lundgren said he did not want to see \"a return to flying being a preserve of the rich\".\n\"Expensive testing could sadly make travel out of reach for some,\" he said.\nAirlines and airports said millions of people could have a more normal summer, but there was still work to do.\nThe need to quarantine on return had hindered a travel industry recovery. Under previous rules, those returning to Britain from its top destinations, Spain, France, the US and Italy, all had to self-isolate for up to 10 days.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told the Commons, however, that Britons returning from amber list destinations would still have take a Covid-19 test before they arrive home and then a second test on or before day two.\nChildren under the age of 18 will not have to self-isolate, but will need to take tests. There is no change to red-list travel restrictions.\nHeathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: \"This is excellent news that will give a much needed boost to millions of people across Britain looking forward to a more normal summer and reuniting with family and friends abroad. \n\"But the job isn't done,\" he said, adding: \"The UK should open up travel to fully vaccinated people from more countries - particularly our key partners in the US - by the end of July.\"\nHe said Heathrow was \"working closely\" with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic to demonstrate this could be done safely, with checks on departure, and no need for delays at immigration on arrival.\nDame Irene Hays, boss of independent travel agent Hays Travel, told the BBC she was \"absolutely delighted\" by the move.\n\"I think it's a huge step in the right direction,\" she said, adding that it came at the right time for all those whose holidays had been cancelled last year and who had been \"sitting there with their fingers crossed\" hoping for good news.\nShe acknowledged that there were still \"some constraints\", especially involving testing, but advised would-be holidaymakers to have good travel insurance.\nSteve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2, said: \"This is the news that UK holidaymakers have been looking forward to, as it finally signals a meaningful restart to international travel.\"\nHe said his firm would restart flights and holidays to all amber-list destinations from 19 July onwards.\nShai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said the announcement was \"a positive development\" that provided \"assurance for consumers and businesses who can now book and travel with greater confidence\".\nGatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate described the new rules as \"another small step in the right direction\".  \n\"However, with summer holidays just around the corner, we are approaching a crucial time for our industry and we urge government to remove other barriers inhibiting international travel, including the need for costly PCR tests for those who have been double vaccinated,\" he added.\nBritish Airways chief executive and chairman Sean Doyle welcomed what he called a \"common-sense approach which is already working safely for many other countries\".\n\"But there is more work to do,\" he added.\n\"While the quarantine requirement for 'amber' countries is being lifted for fully vaccinated UK travellers, the government needs to quickly extend this to all vaccinated travellers, agree a reciprocal deal with the US, add more countries to the 'green' list and reduce the need for unnecessary, expensive tests.\"\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, said it was \"a positive move towards the genuine reopening the sector has been looking for\".\n\"We now urge the government to continue this momentum by adding many more countries to the green list next week and removing onerous testing requirements at its next review on 31 July, thereby opening up more non-quarantine travel to all.\"   "
