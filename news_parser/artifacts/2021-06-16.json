      "title": "Boris Johnson calls Matt Hancock hopeless in texts revealed by Dominic Cummings",
      "tags": "Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus testing,Matthew Hancock,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Dominic Cummings has published expletive-laden messages, apparently from Boris Johnson, in which the PM calls the health secretary \"hopeless\".\nIt is the latest salvo in a bitter war of words between Mr Cummings, the PM's former top aide, and Matt Hancock over the handling of the pandemic.\nDowning Street did not deny the authenticity of the messages.\nBut the PM's official spokesman insisted Mr Johnson has full confidence in the health secretary.\nIn a 7,000-word blog, Mr Cummings accused Mr Hancock of trying to rewrite history during a select committee hearing last week which was examining how the government has managed various aspects of the crisis.\nHe also took aim at Mr Johnson, claiming he had \"lied about failures\" during the government's initial response to the pandemic.\n\"If No 10 is prepared to lie so deeply and widely about such vital issues of life and death last year, it cannot be trusted now either on Covid or any other crucial issue of war and peace,\" Mr Cummings wrote.\nMr Cummings told MPs three weeks ago that the health secretary had lied to the prime minister about testing hospital patients before they were released into care homes at the start of the pandemic - something firmly denied by Mr Hancock.\nA source close to Mr Hancock said: \"The health secretary answered many of Mr Cummings' claims at a lengthy session in front of MPs. \n\"Mr Cummings has still failed to provide evidence to substantiate his claims. \n\"The health secretary continues to work with the prime minister on the vaccine programme and getting us out of this pandemic as quickly as possible.\"\nMr Cummings, who was forced out of Downing Street last year, claims the version of events given to the committee by Mr Hancock was \"fiction\".\nThe former aide appears to have kept WhatsApp messages from his time in government and selected six to share with readers of his blog.\nOne of them appears to show an exchange between Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings on 27 March last year.\nMr Cummings highlights the ramping up of testing capacity in the US and criticises Mr Hancock for saying he was \"sceptical\" about meeting a target.\nMr Johnson purportedly responds: \"Totally [expletive] hopeless.\"\nMr Cummings also published another private message about the struggle to procure ventilators for Covid-19 patients.\n\"It's Hancock. He has been hopeless,\" a contact appearing to be Mr Johnson replies on 27 March last year.\nIn another message, on 27 April last year, the prime minister appears to call the situation around personal protective equipment (PPE) \"a disaster\" and alludes to diverting some responsibilities to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove.\n\"I can't think of anything except taking Hancock off and putting Gove on,\" Mr Johnson apparently adds.\nMr Johnson's official spokesman said he was \"not going to be drawn on these claims\", adding that the prime minister has \"worked very closely with the health secretary and continues to do so\". \nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told Mr Hancock in a Commons debate that he had been \"forever branded Hopeless Hancock by his own leader\".\nThe party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said a public inquiry into the pandemic promised for next spring was now needed \"as quickly as possible\".\nMr Cummings suggests in his blog that any inquiry would not \"start for years\" as it was \"designed to punt the tricky parts until after this PM has gone\".\n\"Unlike other PMs, this one has a clear plan to leave at the latest a couple of years after the next election, he wants to make money and have fun not 'go on and on',\" writes Mr Cummings. \nBut with the Conservatives riding high in the opinion polls, there is no incentive for the party's MPs to move against Mr Johnson, despite the \"systemic incompetence\" surrounding him, he adds. \nDowning Street rejected the claim that Mr Johnson planned to stand down after the next election, saying: \"The PM has actually been asked this before and said it's utter nonsense, so that still stands.\"\nLet's start with a quick political quiz.\nQ: Who has the safest job in cabinet?\nA: Matt Hancock\nQ: Why?\nA: Because Dominic Cummings wants him sacked.\nBoris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had full confidence in the health secretary.\nHe could say little else - as he won't be sacking him at the urging of a disgruntled former aide.\nIf he did, that would suggest that Dominic Cummings was right, about what he thinks were failures over PPE, ventilators and testing, early in the pandemic.\nAnd if Mr Hancock goes now, Labour would ask why he wasn't dismissed sooner.\nMr Cummings makes serious allegations about the handling of the Covid crisis.\nBut by continually suggesting that Matt Hancock is the very personification of government errors, he may be making it a little too easy for his detractors to portray his interventions as a grudge match.\nAnd by denouncing not just the Department of Health and Social Care but the Cabinet Office too, you get the impression that Mr Cummings felt that very few people could come up to his standards.\nMr Cummings's own credibility, of course, still remains dented due to last year's lockdown drive to Durham.\nBut his latest dossier does raise questions of ministers well ahead of the formal inquiry, and provides ammunition to an opposition which has questioned the pace at which the government moved.\nGiving evidence to MPs last week, Mr Hancock said he had seen no evidence to suggest any medical staff had died because of a lack of PPE.\nIn his blog, Mr Cummings accuses the health secretary of trying to blame NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the Cabinet Office for last April's \"PPE disaster\".\n\"The lack of PPE killed NHS and care home staff in March-May,\" he writes.\nHe claims Number 10 and Mr Hancock had \"repeatedly lied about the failures last year\" and accuses them of now trying to \"rewrite history\", with the prime minister \"encouraging ministers to give false accounts to Parliament\".\nMr Cummings goes on to criticise Mr Johnson's management style. \nIn one section he contrasts Mr Johnson's approach with that of Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who stood in for the PM when he was in hospital with coronavirus.\nHe said meetings with Mr Raab at the helm were \"less pleasant for everybody but much more productive\". He said this was because Mr Raab \"can chair meetings properly instead of telling rambling stories and jokes\".\nHe went on to say that \"as soon as things get 'a bit embarrassing' [Boris Johnson] does the whole 'let's take it offline' shtick before shouting 'forward to victory', doing a thumbs-up and pegging it out of the room before anybody can disagree\".\nDowning Street said it was \"not going to engage\" with this claim.\nAnd on Thursday, Treasury minister Jesse Norman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think this is some of the biggest nonsense I've heard.\n\"The prime minister obviously, as anybody would detect, is a massive supporter of the health secretary.\n\"He's coming firmly behind him. There can be no question of loss of confidence.\"\nMr Cummings published the alleged leaks on Substack, an online platform that allows people to charge for newsletters. \nHe has said he plans to charge subscribers for insider information on subjects other than the pandemic."

      "title": "'Great Dimming' of Betelgeuse star is solved",
      "tags": "Astronomy,Stars,Chile",
      "text": "Astronomers say they've put to bed the mystery of why one of the most familiar stars in the night sky suddenly dimmed just over a year ago. \nBetelgeuse, a red supergiant in the constellation of Orion, abruptly darkened in late 2019, early 2020.\nThe behaviour led many to speculate that it might be about to explode. \nBut a team using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile says the cause was almost certainly a giant dust cloud between us and the star.\nEven if you can't name many points in the sky, you'll definitely know Betelgeuse by sight. It's the orange dot in the top-left corner of Orion - or bottom-right, if you're viewing the constellation in the Southern Hemisphere.\nClose to Earth, relatively speaking, at a distance of about 550 light-years, Betelgeuse is what's known as a semi-regular variable star. It naturally brightens and darkens over a period of roughly 400 days.\nBut what happened 18 months ago was out of the ordinary. The loss of brightness was far greater than anything previously recorded. \nAstronomer Miguel Montarg\u00e8s and colleagues investigated the event with the European Southern Observatory's VLT, one of the most powerful telescopes on Earth. It has the resolution to directly image the surface of Betelgeuse.\nThe researchers compared pictures before, during and after the dimming, and did some modelling to see what kind of behaviour might give rise to the views obtained.\nTwo ideas were dominant. Perhaps there was a large cool spot on the surface of the star, because red supergiants like Betelgeuse are known to have very large convective cells that can cause hot spots and cold spots. Or maybe there was a cloud of dust forming right in front of the star as viewed from Earth. \nThe explanation turns out to be \"a bit of both\", says colleague Emily Cannon from KU (Katholieke Universiteit) Leuven in Belgium. \n\"Our overall idea is that there was a cool spot on the star which, because of the local drop in temperature, then caused gas ejected previously to condense into dust,\" she told BBC News.\n\"So, the cool spot on the surface would initially make the star look dimmer to us. But then this condensation of dust would add to the rapid drop in brightness of the star.\"\nBetelgeuse is about 15-20 times as massive as the Sun. An object that big is likely to go supernova at some point. So, it wasn't crazy to wonder when this unusual dimming occurred that Betelgeuse might be about to let go in a spectacular explosion.\nEmily Cannon said: \"I don't think this event means Betelgeuse is going to go supernova anytime soon, even though that would be incredibly interesting and I was kind of wishing it myself!\n\"We know that red supergiants can display increased mass loss rates, which may indicate there's a later stage in their lives when they are more likely to go supernova. But Betelgeuse we think is a relatively young red supergiant and it probably has a lot more time left.\"\nHow much time is that? Tens, even hundreds, of thousands of years is the sort of period astronomers will often quote.\nIt would be an amazing thing to see; the event would be visible in daylight.\nThe last supernova observed in our Milky Way Galaxy was Kepler's Star, which was observed in 1604. Records from astronomers at the time indicate it was visible during the day for over three weeks.\nMiguel Montarg\u00e8s' team reports its findings in the journal Nature. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \n\"Our priority is to make sure people in care homes are protected,\"\u00a0says the government as plans to make Covid vaccinations compulsory among those staff in England are revealed. The BBC has been told jabs will become mandatory for anyone working in homes that care for older people, with further a consultation on rolling this out to other health and care staff. It will mean that staff who aren't medically exempt face being redeployed away from frontline care or could lose their jobs if they don't get vaccinated within 16 weeks.\nAnother life-saving treatment has been found been a year on from the discovery that a cheap steroid drug prevented Covid deaths, according to researchers. The therapy is a potent intravenous infusion of antibodies, which neutralise the virus, rather than dampen the body's inflammatory response to it. Results from the Recovery trial suggest it could help one in three of those in hospital with severe Covid. Or for every 100 patients treated, experts calculate, it would save six lives. Kimberley Featherstone (pictured below) says she feels \"very lucky\" to have received the treatment when she was in hospital with Covid. \nUK inflation jumped to 2.1% in the the 12 months to May, after as the rising cost of clothes, fuel, food and drink pushed the rate above the Bank of England's 2% target. The Consumer Price Index measure of inflation rose from 1.5% in the year to April, according to the Office for National Statistics. Inflation is now at its highest since before the pandemic. The May rise was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 1.8%.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement of a delay to the planned lifting of all restrictions on 21 June will be put before MPs later. They will discuss, then vote on extending emergency Covid laws in England for another four weeks, amid concern over rising cases. On Monday Mr Johnson said the delay would give the NHS \"a few more crucial weeks\" to get people vaccinated. Labour is likely to support extending the rules and the government is expected to win the vote. \nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, waiting lists for allotments have swelled. The BBC visited one site to find out what these small patches of land mean to those who cultivate them.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nThe Delta variant of Covid-19 has changed how the virus is spreading, and has resulted in delays in restrictions being lifted.

      "tags": "Cwmbran,Metropolitan Police Service,Sydenham,Daniel Morgan",
      "text": "The Metropolitan Police was institutionally corrupt in the way it concealed or denied its failings over the unsolved murder of Daniel Morgan, a report has found.\nThe force's first objective was to protect itself, said Baroness O'Loan, the head of an independent panel.\nPrivate investigator Mr Morgan was attacked with an axe in the car park of a pub in south-east London in 1987.\nMet Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has apologised to his family.\nShe said it was a \"matter of great regret that no-one has been brought to justice and that our mistakes have compounded the pain suffered\".\nDespite five police inquiries and an inquest, no-one has been convicted over the father of two's death, with the Metropolitan Police previously admitting corruption had hampered the original murder investigation.\nMr Morgan, from Llanfrechfa near Cwmbran in south Wales, died outside the Golden Lion pub in Sydenham on 10 March 1987.\nThe panel found his family had \"suffered grievously\" as a consequence of the failure to achieve justice for them.\nIt criticised the \"unwarranted assurances\" they were given, the misinformation put into the public domain, and a failure \"to acknowledge professional incompetence, individuals' venal behaviour, and managerial and organisational failures\".\n\"The Metropolitan Police also repeatedly failed to take a fresh, thorough and critical look at past failings,\" the report said.\n\"Concealing or denying failings, for the sake of the organisation's public image, is dishonesty on the part of the organisation for reputational benefit and constitutes a form of institutional corruption.\"\nThe report said there were several theories as to why Mr Morgan was killed, among them:\nMr Morgan's brother Alastair said earlier that Dame Cressida should \"absolutely\" be considering her position in light of the report.\nMr Morgan's family - who believe he was on the brink of exposing police corruption when he was killed - said in a statement: \"We welcome the recognition that we - and the public at large - have been failed over the decades by a culture of corruption and cover-up in the Metropolitan Police, an institutionalised corruption that has permeated successive regimes in the Metropolitan Police and beyond to this day.\"\nThe family's statement added: \"At almost every step, we found ourselves lied to, fobbed off, bullied, degraded and let down, time and time again.\"\nIn a statement released early on Tuesday evening, Dame Cressida said she had been \"personally determined\" that the Met provided the panel with the fullest level of co-operation.\n\"I recognise this is a powerful and wide-ranging report,\" she said. \"We will take the necessary time to consider it and the associated recommendations in their entirety.\"\nMet Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said that since the murder the force had \"completely overhauled our ability to identify corruption\". He added: \"I am confident we have never been better at finding corruption and getting rid of it.\"\nSpeaking in the Commons shortly after the publication of the panel's report, Home Secretary Priti Patel said it was \"deeply alarming\" and revealed a \"litany of mistakes\" by the Met Police.\nShe said the behaviour of the force had \"irreparably damaged the chances of successful prosecution\".\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the report was \"damning\", adding that the Morgan family had endured a \"three-decade nightmare\".\nTom Symonds, home affairs correspondent\nThe early years of the Daniel Morgan saga experienced policing that was \"poor or below accepted standards\", while there was a \"historical phenomenon\" of regular drinking sessions in which officers mixed with local figures \"operating on the fringes of legality\".\nMore serious was evidence that stories were sold by the police to the press; misuse of the police national computer; and the planting of false evidence.\nThe inquiry also found links between \"personnel at the highest levels of the Metropolitan Police and people working for a news organisation linked to criminality associated with the murder of Daniel Morgan\". The evidence relates to dealings with the News of the World.\nThe panel strongly criticises the Met for impeding its investigation by failing to co-operate with elements of its work.\nThe Met has at times accepted failings in the Morgan case, and suggested corruption was to blame, but when asked to explain what this meant, the panel said little detail was often provided.\nThe force also placed barriers in the way of the inquiry when the panel asked for a computer terminal so that it could access the police Holmes investigation database.\nA series of recommendations includes better vetting of police officers and a requirement for police officers to register their membership of any organisation, including the freemasons.\nContinuing his criticism of Dame Cressida, Mr Morgan said: \"I think certainly we need much better leadership than she has provided here.\n\"Anyone with any knowledge of the history of the police knows how much they hate scrutiny, and I think she has been true to form in that respect.\"\nThe Morgan family's solicitor Raju Bhatt said: \"You heard from the panel that the institutionalised corruption that they found is a current problem in the present tense.\n\"The current leadership in the Met has to take responsibility for that continuing.\"\nWhen asked if Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who had spoken to then-Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Yates about Mr Morgan's murder when London mayor in 2009 - had full confidence in Dame Cressida, Mr Johnson's spokesman replied: \"Yes\". \nFor an inquiry commissioned by the home secretary to accuse a police force of \"institutional corruption\" is about as serious a finding as it is possible to imagine.  \nLegitimacy is the vital ingredient in the British approach of policing by consent. \nToday's report, therefore, represents a major crisis for the Met in general and for its commissioner Dame Cressida Dick in particular. \nIn simple terms, the force is accused of putting its corporate reputation ahead of the search for truth. \nDame Cressida is personally accused of obstructing the panel's work, and causing delays which added further and unnecessary distress to the family of a murder victim.\nThe commissioner has made it clear she is not resigning. The prime minister has said she has his backing and Scotland Yard is denying it sought to hamper the inquiry.  \nBut unlike other institutional scandals affecting the Met, this is not just about historical or operational failings.\nThis is about a culture which the panel says exists to this day, and evidence of which can be traced to the desk of the woman who currently heads the force."

      "title": "Covid in Scotland: 'Lost summer' warning as lockdown easing paused",
      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Nicola Sturgeon,Hospitality industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The hospitality industry is warning of the potential of \"another lost summer\" as Scottish ministers prepare to delay easing coronavirus restrictions. \nNicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that moving Scotland to level zero was likely to be pushed back three weeks. \nIt means restrictions on bars, cafes, restaurants and hotels could be in place until the middle of July. \nThe first minister told MSPs the delay would ensure more people could be vaccinated. \nCovid cases are continuing to rise in Scotland, where the infection rate is five times higher than it was in early May.\nMs Sturgeon's statement came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that plans to lift restrictions in England would be delayed by four weeks until 19 July.\nThe Scottish Licensed Trade Association said the industry was now at \"breaking point\" and they called for more financial assistance for businesses. \nIts managing director, Colin Wilkinson, said: \"There needs to be an extension to the current support schemes available such as furlough, VAT reduction, deferral of loan repayments and so on.\n\"Our pubs and bars have already invested millions to provide a safe environment as we all learn to live with this virus and we need to be able to open without restrictions as soon as we can.\"\nMr Wilkinson said most hospitality businesses were continuing to operate at loss and racking up further debt. \nThey have increased staff costs as they have to provide table service, but fewer tables - and customers - because of social distancing rules. \nBut the situation is even worse for nightclubs, which would not even be allowed to open under level zero rules. \n\"This is a never-ending hell for hospitality workers and the businesses that employ them, especially those in the music and night-time sectors,\" said Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group. \nHe asked the Scottish government to \"tweak the tiers\" so businesses could operate safely but viably. \n\"The government has shown that it can be flexible and understanding when it wants to, as we've seen with the Euros and the fan zone,\" he added. \n\"All we're asking is for hospitality to be shown the same consideration.\"\nHe called on ministers to \"get out from behind their desks\" to understand how their policy decisions affect businesses, and to provide \"proper financial support\". \nIt was echoed by the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, which said state support should be \"proportionate to the scale of the restrictions\". \nFrom next month, employers will have to contribute more to the wages of furloughed employees ahead of the scheme winding up at the end of September.\nAhead of that, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and her counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer asking for an urgent meeting. \nThey want to discuss the financial recovery from the pandemic, including the furlough scheme.\nA formal decision on what level each area of Scotland will be in will not take place until next week, but Ms Sturgeon said on Tuesday it was \"reasonable to indicate now that I think it unlikely that any part of the country will move down a level\" as planned.\nIt means the country's mainland council areas will remain in either level one or level two, although many island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"we need to buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus, and that is the reason for caution at this juncture\".\nShe also said that a review of physical distancing rules would be published next week, along with a report on what life could look like once Scotland moves beyond level zero. \nTrade minister Ivan McKee said the Scottish government was trying to make the situation as \"painless as possible in this very difficult time for businesses\".\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We'll watch the data closely and, based on the direction the virus takes, then we're able to ascertain what measures could be taken.\n\"There's no point in loosening up too early and then we see a further spike in cases and hospitalisations. We've been here before [and] we don't want to see a third wave of that magnitude.\"\nThe Scottish Chambers of Commerce's chief executive Liz Cameron said the latest developments would be \"frustrating and painful\" for many Scottish businesses. \nShe added: \"Any delay must be used to expand the vaccine rollout and deliver the crucial second doses that will move us out of lockdown restrictions faster.\""

      "title": "Covid: Deaf campaigner takes legal action over No 10 briefings",
      "tags": "Deafness and hearing-impairment,Sign language,Disability,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A deaf campaigner is taking legal action against the government, after complaining that it failed to provide in-person British Sign Language (BSL) interpreters at No 10 Covid briefings. \nKatherine Rowley, 36, from Leeds, says the government breached its obligations under the Equality Act to make broadcasts accessible to deaf people.\nShe says the failure to convey vital facts led to \"stress and frustration\".\nThe government said it was \"committed to supporting disabled people\".\nA spokesperson said BSL interpretation of the No 10 coronavirus briefings was available on the BBC News Channel and BBC iPlayer, which could be accessed via Freeview. \n\"We continue to work across government to ensure that information and guidance is fully accessible,\" he added.\nMs Rowley was 25 weeks pregnant when she started the claim for a Judicial Review, which will focus upon two Covid briefings in September and October 2020. \nDuring those two briefings there was no sign language interpreter at all, either in person or superimposed by broadcasters.\nShe says the stress she suffered in being unable to access government information during the briefing, impacted on her pregnancy and her wellbeing. \nSpeaking to the BBC through an interpreter, Ms Rowley said: \"It was frustrating. Why wasn't there an interpreter on the television? \n\"It's important to get that information - the world should know - and for me, on my own, where is that information? \n\"I feel ashamed - I'm deaf, I can't access information - but really it isn't my fault, not at all.\" \nAt the High Court on Wednesday, Ms Rowley's barrister Catherine Casserley argued there has not been a BSL interpreter present in the room with the speakers at any of the UK government Covid briefings in England, unlike in Scotland and Wales. \nShe said providing \"on-platform\" interpretation would have been more inclusive than broadcasters superimposing an interpreter, because it means the sign language is visible wherever and whenever footage of the briefing is shown.\nThe government was failing to meet the obligations of equality legislation and it should be ordered to provide on-platform legislation, Ms Rowley's barrister said. She is also seeking compensation for injury to feelings, the barrister added.\nZoe Leventhal, the barrister representing the Cabinet Office, said the claim should be dismissed.\nShe said \"damages for injury to feelings\" were \"not merited here\".\nMr Justice Fordham, who oversaw the online trial with sign language interpreters, said he would deliver a ruling at date to be determined later.\nThe High Court heard that there are 70,000 deaf people in England who use British Sign Language.\nMs Rowley's solicitor Chris Fry said he is also representing 350 other deaf people who have made similar claims to Ms Rowley, but their cases are on hold until this one is decided.\nMany who use BSL as their first language say they cannot rely on subtitles because the average reading age for deaf people is nine years.\n\"I have dyslexia myself - I am a slow reader - so that means when I was reading the subtitles, I would miss so much information and [it] would just mess up my head. It would be so difficult - it became impossible,\" Ms Rowley told the BBC.\nLynn Stewart-Taylor started the #WherestheInterpreter campaign after the first Covid briefing in March 2020.\nDespite watching it, she said she came away with nothing of what had been said, as there was no interpreter. \n\"Lots and lots of other countries have managed to get the interpreter in the same room. It's accepted that members of the deaf community get the information at the same time as the hearing members of the community. \n\"We seem to be the only country that haven't been able to make that happen and we feel very separated and segregated.\n\"We don't feel accepted, we don't feel that our language is respected and recognised. It's almost as if we don't exist.\"\nMr Fry, the solicitor representing hundreds of deaf people in their claims, said: \"Ensuring that information is provided in an accessible format can rarely be more important than in the midst of a pandemic. \n\"This case has brought deaf people together in the most remarkable way to challenge the government to do better, and to fulfil what we say are its obligations under the Equality Act.\"\nAmanda Casson-Webb, joint chief executive of the Royal Association for Deaf People, said this was the first time the deaf community had joined forces to litigate a Judicial Review on the provision of sign language interpreters.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to supporting disabled people through every stage of this pandemic and have established BSL interpretation at the No 10 press conferences via the BBC News Channel and iPlayer, available on all TV packages as part of Freeview. \n\"The BBC has also made their video feed for the BSL interpreter available to all other broadcasters and for use on No 10 social channels.\"\nBut deaf people supporting the Judicial Review say having an in-person interpreter at briefings avoids any technical issues and ensures that a BSL-interpreted version is available on any channel."

      "text": "Lives and livelihoods are at risk if Wales does not do more to prepare for a hotter, wetter future, government advisers say.\nThe Climate Change Committee (CCC) said current plans to protect people, infrastructure and wildlife \"will not be sufficient\".\nIt comes despite warnings in a series of reports by the CCC since 2011.\nThe Welsh government said climate change was \"at the heart\" of its decision making.\nOf the 61 risks identified by the CCC in its latest assessment of the impact of climate change in the UK, \"more action\" is needed in Wales to address 32 of them.\nTwenty six of the risks have increased in urgency since the last report in 2016.\nThey include threats to the viability of coastal communities from sea level rise, flooding and erosion, people's health from overheating in their homes, roads and railways from extreme weather and lightning, and wildlife across land and sea.\nIt is getting warmer and sunnier - but wetter and wilder too.\nSince the mid 1970s Wales has seen an increase in average annual temperatures of 0.9C, with a 6.1% rise in average sunshine hours.\nThe report forecasts a rise of between 1.3 and 2.3C in annual temperatures here by the 2080s, depending on how successful the world is at cutting out the gases driving climate change.\nIt means hotter, drier summers with more extreme heatwaves - something we are already starting to experience.\nRainfall is expected to decrease in summer by approximately 15% by the 2050s and by up to 26% by the 2080s - leading to potential droughts.\nBy contrast, we are likely to have much wetter winters, exacerbating flooding issues.\nSea levels are also rising - with predictions in the report they could be between 22 (8.6in) and 28cm (11in) higher in Cardiff by the 2050s and between 43 (17in) and 76cm (30in) by the 2080s - once again depending on global efforts.  \nDisruption to transport and IT infrastructure from fluctuating temperatures, wildfires and flooding could potentially impact \"hundreds of thousands of people annually\".\nThe report warns of \"cascading risks\" if power supplies are affected too, given Wales, like the rest of the UK, will be heavily reliant on electricity for everything from heating to transport.\nHeat-related deaths in Wales could increase from 2.4 per 100,000 people a year in 2016 to 6.5 per 100,000 by the 2050s.\nThe report says measures to prevent overheating in people's homes is a \"major policy gap\" across all UK nations.\nOn sea level rise, there is \"little evidence\" Welsh government and local authorities are taking a strategic approach to identifying communities that may be at risk of losing homes and amenities and supporting them.\nBut the report does point to Fairbourne in Gwynedd as an example for the rest of the UK of where a plan is being put in place with the community.\nJust over 10,000 properties are at risk from coastal flooding in Wales at present, this could increase \"by 260%\" by the 2080s - while 2,126 properties are likely to be at risk of coastal erosion where defences are not maintained.\nAnd 148,000 people live in areas of significant flood risk from rivers, the sea and surface water.\nWhile acknowledging \"considerable advances\" have been made on managing flood risk since 2016, the CCC concluded more action was needed given the scale of the threat - including tackling continued development on flood plains.\nThe problems that could be caused by landslides and subsidence in ex mining areas is a particular concern for Welsh communities, it said.\nIt said \"urgent action\" is needed to enhance surveillance of tree disease in Wales, with climate change thought to be contributing to a rise in the spread of pests and pathogens such as ash dieback.\nWe could face big problems if trees, peatlands and other natural habitats are allowed to suffer as they are a vital way of soaking up carbon dioxide and avoiding even worse effects from global warming.\n\"We're seeing the climate change now, it's no longer a future issue,\" said Kathryn Brown, the CCC's head of adaptation.\n\"Welsh government will need to look at all of the risks and think carefully about how to enhance its policies but also take urgent action in the next two years in the priority areas.\"\nProf Andrew Flynn who specialises on climate adaptation at Cardiff University's school of geography and planning said it was an issue which \"tends to get left behind\".\n\"So much of the focus is on how can we reduce those carbon emissions - which is obviously hugely important,\" he said.\n\"But adapting to climate change is equally worthy of attention and matters a lot to people in the communities where they live.\"\nProf Flynn said the Welsh government had a tradition of being \"innovative\" on the environment and sustainability which meant it had a \"good base to build on\".\nHow communities are told about and consulted on the threats and opportunities climate change might pose in their areas should be one priority, he said.\n\"This is not simply a case of developing new policies - it's about recognising the scale of the challenge that we face.\"\nWales' climate change minister has welcomed the report from the CCC and said environment and climate change was \"at the heart of our decision making\". \n\"To help limit further climate change we need to do more to tackle emissions in the next 10 years than we have in the last 30,\" said Julie James MS.\nThe minister said its plan for climate change was already in the second year of being delivered, and the new advice \"will enable us to review and update our actions in light of the latest science\".\nWelsh Conservative spokeswoman on climate change Janet Finch-Saunders called the report \"alarming\".\n\"Two years ago, in the wave of publicity driven by the antics of Extinction Rebellion, Labour declared a 'climate change emergency', but have done very little since to tackle the crisis,\" she said.\n\"Twenty-six of the risks have increased in urgency since the last report by the CCC, and if the current Welsh government fails to act to slow climate change, it is our children, grandchildren and future generations who will be forced to pay the price.\""

      "text": "People living in a sea-threatened village on the west coast of Wales are calling for answers over their future.\nSea defences at Fairbourne will stop being maintained in the 2050s, but Gwynedd Council said it may begin \"decommissioning\" the village before then and start moving residents out.\nVillagers want more detail on when and how, saying uncertainty is devaluing homes and harming community life.\nThe council said it had met with residents more than 300 times.\nNatural Resources Wales maintains the sea defences and a council consultation is taking place on Thursday and Friday to hear residents' views on options for the next few years.\nBut some say there also needs to be more discussion about what happens to them and their homes if the village is to be abandoned to the sea.\nThe council is leading a partnership to co-ordinate what happens in Fairbourne, and says some of the decisions about what happens in the long term are out of its hands.\nIt said it was forecast \"that the engineering and financial challenges of protecting the village are likely to become insurmountable earlier than other areas\".\nThere are \"five specific plans which can be taken forward and developed by partner organisations over the coming years\" to be considered by locals during the consultation, it added.\nThe plans focus on flood risk management, people and the built environment, infrastructure management, economy and business management, and natural environment management.\nSylvia Stephenson, who lives in the village, said: \"I don't really think that we'll get the answers to the questions that we want.\n\"The answers we want are: what are you going to do with us if we have a major event or you want to decommission the village? To decommission the village, you're going to have to take my house and my land. \n\"We own this house and we own the land, and the only way you can do that is with legislation. And that in turn has to mean compulsory purchase. I don't know if we're going to get any answers about that.  \n\"I don't know if we'll get any answers at all about where they could put us all.\"\nAnother resident, Malcolm Flynn, said there was still scope for the authorities to look again at the long-term future of the village.\nHe said: \"The council gave an undertaking that they would do their best to protect the village for 40 years. After that, anything could happen.\n\"It's like the guillotine hanging over you, waiting to drop. The council has relied on one consultant to give a view where I suspect there are many differing views and different things to check.\n\"Young people living here can't get a mortgage. Houses are cheap, but they can't get a mortgage because no-one will lend them money. Likewise older people who need equity release can't get it.\"\nA Gwynedd council spokesman said it had held engagement events, workshops, visits and discussions, along with issuing quarterly newsletters to keep people informed.\nIt said all feedback from the consultation would be considered."

      "tags": "Russia,Geneva,Vladimir Putin,United States,Joe Biden",
      "text": "The Geneva summit between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden on 16 June will not be a friendly encounter. \nFor a start, Russia recently included the US on its official list of \"unfriendly states\".\nBoth sides describe relations as at rock bottom and neither currently has an ambassador in-country; senior Russian officials are under American sanctions for everything from annexing Ukraine's Crimea to alleged election meddling, and two former US marines are now in Russian prisons - one serving 16 years accused of espionage. \nOn top of all that, there's the moment in March when Joe Biden agreed with an interviewer that Vladimir Putin was \"a killer\".\nAnd yet, the two men are set to meet as presidents for the first time, and some in Russia see that as an achievement in itself.\n\"The summit is important in terms of symbolism; it puts Russia in the same league as the US, and for Putin symbolism is not unimportant,\" says Andrei Kortunov, director of the RIAC think-tank in Moscow.\nThe meeting comes early in Mr Biden's time in the White House, on his first foreign trip and at his request - all bonus points for the Kremlin. It's also a full summit - not a brief encounter appended to some other event. \nAnd despite a packed agenda, including meetings at Nato headquarters in Brussels on Monday, there's particular interest in Joe Biden's final stop on his European trip, his one-on-one on Wednesday with Vladimir Putin.\n\"Putin definitely wants to be equal to the US president. He wants to be respected on his terms,\" political analyst Lilia Shevtsova agrees. \"Putin wants to demonstrate macho muscle and to be a member of the club.\"\nThe choice of Geneva as a setting harks back to a Cold War encounter in 1985: the first summit between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. But there's little prospect that this week's event will match that either for personal rapport or political thaw.\nToday's White House says its aim is a \"stable\" and \"predictable\" relationship with Russia. But keeping people guessing - and wary - has been Vladimir Putin's way ever since his \"little green men\" entered Crimea in 2014 and the peninsula was annexed from Ukraine.\nIt was the start of this slide in Russia-US relations.\n\"A more feasible goal would be to test where each other's 'red lines' lie,\" Ms Shevtsova suggests, as well as \"an understanding that dialogue is the way back from the abyss\".\n'If they're not talking, then Russia will become more unpredictable,\" she argues.\nThis weekend, Vladimir Putin told state TV there were \"issues where we can work together\" with the US, starting with new nuclear arms control talks, discussing regional conflicts including Syria and Libya, and climate change. \n\"If we can create mechanisms for working on those issues, then I think we can say the summit was not in vain,\" Mr Putin argued. \nSome in Russia suggest a truce in the \"diplomatic wars\" may also be possible: the US has expelled dozens of Russian diplomats and shut down two compounds in recent years; now US missions in Russia are to be barred from employing locals, meaning dramatic cuts in services including visas.\nMoscow might allow its ambassador back to Washington as a minimum move.\nThe US will also raise the fate of its prisoners in Russia, including Paul Whelan who was arrested in 2018 and convicted of espionage, which he has always denied. \nRussia recently renewed its push for a prisoner-swap - but its terms have so far been impossible for the US to meet, and a unilateral gesture of generosity by Mr Putin seems unlikely. \nRussia's president has gone out of his way lately to underline his view of the West as hostile.\nAt this month's Economic Forum in St Petersburg, he claimed again that the US wants to \"contain\" Russia's development. \nA few days earlier, he had threatened to \"knock out the teeth\" of any foreign aggressor who wants to \"bite\" Russia, insisting that the world needs to wake-up to the country's restored status and strength.\n\"Clearly he believes the US is an adversary that doesn't wish Russia well, and I don't think this vision will change,\" Mr Kortunov says.\nEven so, he argues that Russia may be looking to lower the temperature a notch or two.\n\"As a rational politician, Putin would like to reduce the costs and risks associated with this adversarial relationship,\" Mr Kortunov believes. \nThat includes economic sanctions: the latest round restricted the government's capacity to raise funds and new steps could be further reaching, adding more strain to the economy in a key election year. \n\"The Russian public has no appetite for foreign policy 'victories' now as a substitute for addressing burning social and economic problems at home,\" Mr Kortunov says. \"Whatever Putin might want, I don't think he can gain anything [domestically] by escalating.\"\nWhat Vladimir Putin doesn't want, but is braced for, is a lecture on human rights - including the case of Alexei Navalny, Russia's opposition politician first poisoned and now in prison.\nNavalny's political offices and anti-corruption organisation have just been banned as \"extremist\" by a Moscow court, a ruling that could easily have been delayed until after the summit. \nInstead, the timing seems meant to send a message: that Vladimir Putin will continue to crush dissent and that is none of America's business.  \n\"Biden will do his song - his prelude about Navalny and human rights; then Putin will do his song - that the US is the same,\" Ms Shevtsova predicts, dryly. \n\"But the fact this meeting is taking place means that after the human rights 'hors d'oeuvre', they'll move on to the main dish. And that is: let's do something to lower the tension.\""

      "text": "Consumers kept their cash and cards in their pockets last year, as lockdowns cut the number of payments made for the first time in six years, banks say.\nMore than eight out of 10 payments by consumers are spontaneous but options were limited by the Covid crisis.\nThe total number of payments was down on the previous year, but when people did spend money they were increasingly likely to use contactless technology.\nCovid concerns meant shoppers were encouraged to use it instead of cash.\nContactless technology allows consumers to place their debit or credit card, or smartphone, near a trader's terminal to pay for things, without needing to enter a four-digit pin. \nOf the payments that were made last year, an increasing proportion were via contactless cards, banking trade body UK Finance said.\nThe contactless limit was hurriedly raised at the start of the pandemic to \u00a345 per use, from \u00a330.\nMinisters are planning to allow that limit to be increased to \u00a3100 later this year.\nThe total number of payments made by consumers last year fell by 13% compared to the previous year, to 31 billion, according to the UK Finance report.\nContactless payments accounted for 27% of these transactions. They were most commonly made in supermarkets, although these were among the relatively small list of outlets which were able to remain open throughout the pandemic.\nNine out of 10 people shopped online and they were increasingly likely to spend via this method during lockdowns.\nPayments made via smartphones and other digital devices also increased, primarily among the younger generations.\nIn contrast, cash use fell. The number of payments made with notes and coins dropped by 35%. This continued a trend of recent years, but also reflected the reduced opportunities to pay for things during lockdowns.\nIt still accounted for 17% of all payments, making it the second most-popular way to pay behind debit cards.\n\"While it is still too early to say if this is a permanent change to people's behaviour as, in many other parts of people's lives, the pandemic has also affected UK payment markets,\" the report said."

      "title": "Clothes and fuel costs push UK inflation to two-year high",
      "tags": "Inflation,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The UK inflation rate jumped to 2.1% in the year to May, the highest for almost two years, as the easing of lockdown sparked a rise in consumer spending.\nThe Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 1.5% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics, driven by the rising cost of fuel and clothing.\nThe rate is now above the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. \nThat will fuel the debate about whether it's time to raise interest rates.\nMay's reading was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 1.8%.\nSimply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a \u00a31 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%.\nIt applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted.\nYou may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money.\nRead more about inflation here.\nONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said the biggest single rise was coming from fuel prices, which were falling this time last year as the lockdown started to bite. \nPetrol and diesel saw a 17.9% price surge over the past year, representing the highest increase for more than four years.\nCrude oil prices have been increasing over the past few months, which is expected to continue feeding through to pump prices.\nClothing prices also increased by 2.3%, the biggest rise since 2018, as retailers significantly reduced their discounting a month after welcoming customers back into stores.\nThe rise in inflation was, however, partly offset by a negative impact from cheaper food and drink prices. Bread, cereals and meat prices all dipped after seeing significant rises a year earlier.\nKaren Ward, a chief market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, told the BBC: \"Consumers have got all these savings they accumulated last year when they weren't allowed out. But supply is really struggling to keep pace, and so what we are seeing therefore is pops of prices in various aspects of the consumer basket.\"\nIt certainly was. Most economists were expecting inflation to hit 1.8%, and are now suggesting the rate could rise faster and higher over the next few months than previously thought.\nJP Morgan's Ms Ward described May's rate as a \"big upside surprise\".\nAnd HSBC economist Chris Hare said: \"Whether the upside news proves temporary or persistent, [May's rate] is clearly a hawkish surprise.\"\nThe price data was collected on or around May 11, before pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers indoors and cinemas and hotels reopened from 17 May.\nThe Bank of England has said it expects inflation to hit 2.5% by the end of this year before settling back to its 2% target as the impact of post-lockdown energy price rises fades along with other cost pressures, such as bottlenecks in supply chains.\nAs you'd expect, economists are divided. \nMs Ward said that if inflation pressure was sustained into next year, \"we could see interest rate hikes\" to dampen down rising prices. \nUK rates, however, remain at historic lows. Also, there are some benefits to rising rates - for example, on the amount of interest people earn on savings. \nNevertheless, the low-rate environment that has existed for a decade and upward changes could be a shock for many consumers and businesses.\nLast week, the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said a rise in inflation above the central bank's target must be only temporary, and that long-term levels of high inflation need to be \"avoided at all costs\".\nSome economists are concerned that despite rising inflation, governments continue to use stimulus to jump-start their post-Covid economies. \nFormer treasury official Lord Nick Macpherson tweeted on Wednesday that Bank of England policies to control the amount of money in the economy are \"excessively loose\".\nThe UK is by no means an isolated case. In the US, where President Joe Biden has proposed a $6 trillion stimulus package, consumer prices hit 5% in May, the highest in almost 13 years.\nJack Leslie, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the speeding up of UK price growth from 0.3% last November to 2.1% in May represented the fastest six-month rise since sterling collapsed after the 2008-09 financial crisis.\n\"But UK inflationary pressures are different - and nowhere as near as large - as those causing fierce debate in the US,\" he said.\nIn China, long a source of cheap goods for the world, inflation is also rising - effectively exporting higher prices.\nAnd Eurozone inflation rose to 2% in May, the first time the rate has surpassed the European Central Bank's target in more than two years.\nNevertheless, central banks seems committed to keeping rates low. The US Fed, for example, expects rates to remain close to zero until 2023. \nGiven the lag between changes in rate policy and the required impact on the economy, some economists worry that central banks could be leaving it too late to change direction.\nIf you think this morning's higher-than-expected inflation number is something to be scared about, the financial markets don't share your view. \nTraders on foreign currency markets, for example, were unimpressed, with the pound shifting up a modest 0.3% against the euro or 0.2% against the dollar. \nInflation may be slightly above the 2% target but it's no higher than it was in July 2019 and well below the 5% inflation of ten years ago, when the global economy was recovering from the 2008 financial crisis.\nPart of the reason the markets shrugged off the inflation figure is the widespread belief that the upward pressure on prices is temporary. \nPrices of raw materials such as wood and steel have shot up from a combination of two things - demand after economies re-opened and supplies still coming back up on stream. The result? Shortages and price rises. \nThe confident expectation is that, for example, as steel manufacturers crank up production there'll be more steel to meet demand so its price will fall back, relieving the inflationary pressure. \nAs summer turns to autumn we'll find out if that expectation is justified.

      "tags": "Children,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination",
      "text": "A decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-old children against Covid is unlikely to be recommended by UK vaccine experts imminently, the BBC has been told.\nCertain groups of children may still be offered a Covid jab - but not all.\nA statement from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is expected in the coming days.\nThe government will then make a final decision on whether teenagers will be included in the mass rollout.\nVaccinating all over-18s with a first dose and two-thirds of adults with a second dose by 19 July is the latest target set by the UK government.\nThere has been much speculation over whether children were going to be included in the UK's vaccination programme against Covid-19 after regulator the MHRA approved Pfizer's use in 12 to 15-year-olds recently.\nBut the JCVI - the committee of UK vaccine experts which advises the government on the best approach - has not yet made any formal recommendation on the matter.\nCurrent advice is that 16 to 18-year-olds can be offered a Pfizer jab if they are in a priority group, or live with someone who has a weakened immune system.\nThe committee may be waiting for more safety data on children who have been vaccinated in other countries, such as the US and Israel, before making its decision.\nThe MHRA's approval was based on trials of the Pfizer vaccine in 2,200 adolescents in the US which showed it was safe and effective, but this is a relatively small number.\nAt the same time, the UK's stock of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is being prioritised for adults aged 18 to 40 - who are not being offered AstraZeneca - meaning supplies available for children are currently low.\nHowever, for the experts there are a whole host of factors to consider, including the benefits and risks for children, as well as other wider ethical issues. \nChildren's risk of severe disease from Covid is tiny, deaths are extremely rare and have only occurred in UK children with profound underlying and life-limiting conditions. The direct benefits to them of vaccination would be low.\nSome people question whether it's morally right to vaccinate children in the UK, when so many millions of other people in the rest of the world are still unvaccinated.\nOn the other hand, vaccinating children could reduce infections across society, help protect adults and the vulnerable who are most at risk, and keep schools open.\n\"This is a very finely balanced issue and a difficult decision,\" says Prof Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine and child health from the University of Liverpool, who is also a member of the scientific advisory group, Sage.\nHe said he was \"veering towards not vaccinating children\" because of the need to get the vaccine into the arms of more hard-to-reach adults instead.\n\"The virus is spreading in schools because it's got nowhere else to hide at the moment,\" Prof Semple said, adding that improved ventilation in classrooms was much more of a priority than masks in schools.\nVaccinating children would be \"mainly to protect public health and reduce transmission\", he added.\nIt's possible the government is not rushing any decision because it wants to see the impact of vaccinating all adults in the UK on virus cases, which have been rising steadily since the end of May.\nA target of giving two doses to two-thirds of the UK's adult population was set by the prime minister on Monday - but that is principally the over-40s, who are due to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThere are concerns there are not enough Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to start vaccinating younger age groups any earlier.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"No decisions have yet been made on whether people aged 12 to 17 should be routinely offered Covid-19 vaccines.\n\"We will be guided by our expert advisers, and the government has asked the JCVI for its formal recommendation. We will update in due course.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Toyota,Jaguar Land Rover,Mini (BMW),Nissan,BMW,Electric cars,Car industry",
      "text": "The UK risks being left in the slow lane when it comes to building electric cars, according to a new report.\nInfluential green group Transport and Environment (T&E) says as recently as 2018, the UK produced roughly half of all electric cars built in Europe.\nBut it claims a lack of investment by UK manufacturers means that by the end of the decade that figure will have fallen to just 4%.\nThis comes at a time when the market is expanding rapidly. \nAs a result, the Brussels-based campaign group says that, despite being one of the first countries to outlaw the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, the UK will be almost wholly reliant on electric vehicles imported from abroad.\nThe market for electric cars remains relatively small, but it is growing rapidly, largely due to increasingly stringent emissions limits. \nA number of European governments have already set targets for phasing out the sale of new petrol and diesel-powered vehicles, in their efforts to meet climate change targets.\nThe UK, which plans to ban the sale of most new cars with internal combustion engines by 2030, is among the most ambitious.\nBut according to the study by T&E, manufacturers based here are among the worst prepared for the change.\nT&E's report is based on information compiled by industry data specialist IHS Markit, including the carmakers' own market and production forecasts.\nIt concludes that by 2030, battery-powered electric cars will account for 48% of production across the 27 countries of the EU and the UK. Plug-in hybrids will make up 11%.\nHowever, it suggests that the difference in the way manufacturers have approached the transition means that the balance of power in the industry is expected to change.\nGermany is expected to remain the dominant car producer in Europe. By 2030, its output is expected to increase from 4.5 million cars a year to 5.1 million - with half of them being electric. \nBut the UK, it says, will see output fall from its pre-Covid level of 1.3 million cars a year to just 1 million - and only 24% are expected to be battery-powered electric vehicles. \nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which represents the automobile industry, strongly refutes T&E's conclusions.\n\"The accusation that UK car makers are not preparing for the shift to electrification is utter nonsense,\" SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes told the BBC.\n\"The UK was home to the first mass-produced electric vehicle in Europe, almost one in four cars made here this year have been either battery electric or hybrid, and British brands have publicly committed to be amongst the first anywhere to be fully electric.\"\nHe added that independent forecasts showed the UK was ramping up its production of electric vehicles and that it would be able to meet the government's net zero 2030 ambitions.\n\"However, our ability to realise this opportunity still depends on the inherent competitiveness of the UK as a place to invest,\" he stressed. \n\"The UK-EU trading rules will help but success will depend on greater backing for advanced manufacturing; reducing operating costs, investing in workforce skills and the maintenance of a healthy new car market.\" \nAccording to T&E, among the manufacturers with facilities in the UK, Toyota is \"least prepared for the electrification revolution that is under way\". \nThis, the group says, is because of the Japanese company's plans to continue building hybrid cars at its factory in Derbyshire. Rather controversially, it describes hybrids as \"a 25 year-old outdated technology\".\nToyota has frequently defended its focus on hybrids in the past, saying it \"believes it is better to maintain an open regulatory framework towards carbon neutrality and not limit possible technology solutions too early\".\nThe organisation is also critical of Jaguar Land Rover and BMW, owner of the Mini brand. It says Stellantis, which owns Vauxhall, \"is better prepared to transition to electric cars but is focusing new electric car production in EU countries\".\nIt is worth pointing out, however, that Stellantis is still in talks with the government over the future of its plant at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, which could lead to electric cars being built at the site. \nThe report also accepts that BMW's plans to turn Mini into an all-electric brand could affect the forecasts it uses for UK production.\nNissan, meanwhile, is widely reported to have plans to expand battery production at its base in Sunderland, with the construction of a new \"gigafactory\". \nBut according to T&E, the plan - which would initially see the plant having a capacity of 6.5 Gigawatt hours (GWh), this amounts to \"a tiny fraction of the 474GWh of production at 17 sites across Europe for which funding has already been secured\".\nIt adds: \"A further 10 gigafactory projects (including BritishVolt) have been announced, which would take total cell production to over 1000GWh\".\nBut it claims these projects are unlikely to go ahead unless the government puts more pressure on carmakers. \nWithout strong pressure to change, it says \"the UK car industry will wither away\". \nA government spokesperson said: \"The UK will continue to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing through a major government investment programme of up to \u00a31bn to support the electrification of the auto supply chain, including the development of gigafactories in the UK.\""

      "text": "A ban on landlords evicting firms for unpaid commercial rent is being extended for another nine months.\nThe ban, which stops landlords taking tenants to court for non-payment, was due to end on 30 June.\nTreasury Secretary Stephen Barclay said the delay in easing lockdown restrictions, announced on Monday, \"present additional challenges\" to business.\nIt is estimated that firms in retail and hospitality are \u00a35bn in rent debt.\nWhile retailers and hospitality firms welcomed the measures, landlords voiced dismay and again warned that some profitable tenants were abusing the ban to avoid paying rent they can afford.\nMr Barclay told the Commons: \"Existing measures will remain in place, including extending the current moratorium to protect commercial tenants from eviction to March 25, 2022,\" Mr Barclay told the Commons.\nHe also announced plans for a binding arbitration scheme to resolve disputes between landlords and commercial tenants. Mr Barclay said the scheme should be in place for when the eviction ban is lifted.\nHe said the measures \"strike the right balance\" between protecting landlords and supporting businesses most in need.\nBut Mr Barclay added: \"To be clear, all tenants should start to pay rent again in accordance with the terms of their lease or as otherwise agreed with their landlord as soon as restrictions are removed on their sector if they are not already doing so.\"\nThousands of companies, especially in the hospitality sector, are still unable to trade normally, among them nightclubs and leisure firms.\nIn April last year the government blocked legal attempts to evict shops, restaurants and other businesses that had stopped paying rent, as part of emergency measures to soften the economic impact of the pandemic.\nHospitality leaders had called for an extension of the moratorium and for more financial support from the government.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said plans to remove remaining pandemic restrictions on 21 June have been pushed back to 19 July amid concerns over the spread of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India.\nLast week, the chief executives of trade groups UK Hospitality and British Retail Consortium (BRC) told MPs that both sectors have accrued a combined \u00a35bn in rent debt.\nData for the first quarter of 2021 shows that only 74% of rent was collected by landlords 60 days following the end of the period after tenants were battered by the pandemic.\nHospitality, leisure and retail operators have also benefited from a business rates holiday since the start of the crisis.\nHelen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, many of whose members have felt lockdown most acutely, said the extension comes \"in the nick of time\".\nShe said: \"Just as retailers feared a wave of legal action by landlords, the government has stepped in to offer both landlords and tenants more time to negotiate. Retailers need time to trade their way out of debt; this announcement does exactly that.\"\nThe Institute of Directors (IoD) also said firms across the country would welcome the extension, but the Treasury could have gone further. \nDr Roger Barker, the IoD's director of policy, said: \"This is only one element of the cliff edge that we have been calling on government to address. \n\"At the end of this month businesses will still face the tapering off of furlough and business rates relief, and the suspension of wrongful trading liability. The government must hold its nerve and push out its business support measures until the job is properly done.\"\nHowever, landlords were critical of the measures, with Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, saying: \"The government has failed to recognise that commercial property owners are essential to the health of our town centres - to creating economic growth, jobs and opportunity.\"\nShe said the majority of property owners had already reached agreement with their tenants on rent, and millions of pounds have been provided to the most vulnerable tenants in the sectors most impacted by Covid-19. \"That support will continue in light of the delay in the recovery roadmap for those businesses that need it,\" Ms Leach said.\n\"Another blanket extension to the moratoriums will provide further opportunity for those well-capitalised businesses who can afford to pay rent, but are refusing to do so, to continue their abuse of government and property owners' support and will cast a long shadow over future investment to build back better,\" she said.\nThe ban on tenant evictions was just one of the government support measures that is due to start wearing off on 1 July. A business rate holiday will end with firms asked to pay 33% of their normal bill - rising to 100% by next March, while government contributions to furloughed staff wages will drop by 10% with employers making up the difference. \nExtending these two measures would be very expensive for the government - extending an eviction ban costs it nothing - leaving the bomb in the lap of the landlord. \nThe government insisted the extension to March would allow new legislation to be drafted to create an arbitration system to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.\nLandlords big and small point out that they will have received no income from anyone who didn't want to pay (even if they could) for two years by next March. Support for them has largely come in the form of forbearance from their own banks whose patience may begin to run out. \nMany also point out that the process of investment and repurposing commercial business premises for a post pandemic age will fall to them.\nWhile many businesses will breathe a sigh of relief that landlord's knock at the door can be ignored for another nine months, someone will be left holding a rent arrears bomb - and the government is keen it's not them.

      "text": "More than 90 schools in Wales have been named on a website where girls have shared allegations of sexual harassment or abuse.\nA review of sexual abuse in schools and colleges in England concluded sexual harassment had become \"normalised\" among school-age children.\nThe Welsh Conservatives called on the Welsh government to find out the scale of the problem in schools across Wales.\nEducation Minister Jeremy Miles said the issue was a priority.\nUK ministers asked English schools inspectorate Ofsted to begin a review in England after the Everyone's Invited website began publishing anonymous testimony of sexual abuse allegations in schools.\nIt also launched a helpline run by the NSPCC.\nSchools in Wales are the responsibility of the Welsh government.\nLaura Anne Jones, education spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives, called on ministers in Wales to act after the \"troubling references to 91 schools in Wales\" by asking its own schools watchdog to investigate.\nShe said: \"It's vital the Welsh government now instructs Estyn to look at the prevalence of the problem in Wales, assess safeguarding policies and experiences in schools and colleges, and publish its findings.\n\"Schools must be a safe place for our children.\"\nMr Miles told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Ginio the issue \"is a priority for us here in Wales too\".\nAsked if he would commit to an inquiry by Estyn, the minister replied: \"We are looking at the best way to respond to this.\n\"We want to make sure we take deliberate steps to ensure this doesn't happen.\"\nMr Miles said the Welsh government would say more \"in due course\".\nThe Ofsted report, which questioned 900 staff and pupils in 30 schools and colleges in England, found more than two-thirds of girls said they endured unwanted touching \"a lot\" or \"sometimes\", while eight in 10 said they had been put under pressure to share sexual images of themselves.\nThe report said data on children sexually harassing or abusing other children was scarce, saying: \"It is hard to get an accurate picture of the scale and nature of sexual harassment and violence between children and young people in schools and colleges.\n\"Although anyone can experience sexual harassment and violence, research indicates that girls are disproportionately affected,\" the report said. \n\"For example, 90% of recorded offences of rape in 2018-19 of 13 to 15-year-olds were committed against girls. In the past year, girls aged between 15 and 17 reported the highest annual rates of sexual abuse for young people and children aged 25 and younger.\"\nThe report was prompted by the Everyone's Invited website, which has attracted more than 16,000 posts.\nIt publishes anonymous allegations which mostly refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university.\nWales' children's commissioner Professor Sally Holland said: \"Whilst I would welcome Estyn's expertise in gathering more information about this, we already know that this is an issue here in Wales.\n\"I've been hearing harrowing experiences from children and young people for years - which we've dealt with as individual cases - and I wouldn't want to delay taking action on this now by having to wait for a review.\"\nShe called for government to make a \"wider package of support and resources\" available, with \"high quality professional learning that gives all teachers the understanding and skills needed to prevent sexual harassment\"."

      "text": "A pet owner says she was \"devastated\" after discovering her eight month-old kitten may have died from eating food linked to a rare disease.\nAlex Padovano believed the food she bought for Penelope was the very best.\nBut a short time after learning her kitten had contracted a bone marrow condition, Ms Padovano said Penelope had to be put down.\nSainsbury's and Pets at Home have recalled a type of dry cat food over a potential link to the fatal disease.\nCat owners are being advised to return food made on behalf of retailers by the manufacturer, Fold Hill, as a precaution.\nFold Hill and the Food Standards Agency said there is a possible link between the products and a bone marrow condition called pancytopenia.\nMs Padovano, 26, said she had fed Penelope Ava pet food, which is sold by Pets at Home, since she brought the kitten home at just three months old.\nHowever, she was forced to take the kitten to a vet a fortnight ago.\n\"She was doing really well on the Sunday,\" said Ms Padovano. \"But on the Monday she took a turn for the worse. She was bleeding out of her ears and mouth.\"\nThe vet did a blood transfusion but the treatment, costing more than \u00a33,500, was not enough to save Penelope.\nMs Padovano says she does not know if the food she fed her kitten contributed but if a link is proven that would be \"horrific and horrendous\".\nThere has been a spike in cases of pancytopenia in the UK, the Royal Veterinary College said.\nThe disease causes a cat's blood cell count to fall rapidly, leading to serious illness and sometimes death. \n\"Typically, we may see one case of this per year, but we have seen now 10 cats with severe pancytopenia in the last four weeks,\" said Dr Barbara Glanemann, senior lecturer in small animal medicine at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC).\n\"Given the rarity of this condition, the clustering of these cases is concerning.\"\nThe college is aware of between 40 and 50 affected cats around the country. She said that some animals had become unwell at the same time and from the same household.\nThe RVC is running a survey of owners who think their cats may been affected.\nFold Hill Foods said products under the Sainsbury's Hypoallergenic Recipe range and Pets at Home Ava range are being recalled. \nApplaws products, which are sold by Amazon and other pet food shops, may also be unsafe. \nThe Food Standards Agency said that notices will be displayed at the tills of retailers selling these products and online.\nIt advised customers to contact retailers if they had bought the goods.\nA Sainsbury's spokeswoman said: \"We are supporting an investigation into a possible safety issue affecting cats.\n\"We are not willing to take any risks where the safety of our products is concerned and so we are voluntarily recalling these products and asking customers not to use them and to return the packs to their nearest Sainsbury's store for a full refund.\"\nA Pets at Home spokesman said that it was aware of the rise in pancytopenia cases identified by the RVC.\n\"The health and wellbeing of pets is our top priority, which is why we are supporting the manufacturer's product recall of Ava and Applaws dry cat food ranges,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"This is a precautionary measure while further investigations are carried out and we are working closely with the Food Standards Agency, RVC and wider industry to determine the cause.\"\nSainsbury's:\nPets at Home:\nApplaws products (best before date between December 2022 to June 2023 with a site reference code of GB218E5009):"

      "tags": "Inflation,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "The UK inflation rate jumped to 2.1% in the year to May, the highest for almost two years, as the easing of lockdown sparked a rise in consumer spending.\nThe Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 1.5% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics, driven by the rising cost of fuel and clothing.\nThe rate is now above the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. \nThat will fuel the debate about whether it's time to raise interest rates.\nMay's reading was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 1.8%.\nSimply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a \u00a31 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%.\nIt applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted.\nYou may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money.\nRead more about inflation here.\nONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said the biggest single rise was coming from fuel prices, which were falling this time last year as the lockdown started to bite. \nPetrol and diesel saw a 17.9% price surge over the past year, representing the highest increase for more than four years.\nCrude oil prices have been increasing over the past few months, which is expected to continue feeding through to pump prices.\nClothing prices also increased by 2.3%, the biggest rise since 2018, as retailers significantly reduced their discounting a month after welcoming customers back into stores.\nThe rise in inflation was, however, partly offset by a negative impact from cheaper food and drink prices. Bread, cereals and meat prices all dipped after seeing significant rises a year earlier.\nKaren Ward, a chief market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, told the BBC: \"Consumers have got all these savings they accumulated last year when they weren't allowed out. But supply is really struggling to keep pace, and so what we are seeing therefore is pops of prices in various aspects of the consumer basket.\"\nIt certainly was. Most economists were expecting inflation to hit 1.8%, and are now suggesting the rate could rise faster and higher over the next few months than previously thought.\nJP Morgan's Ms Ward described May's rate as a \"big upside surprise\".\nAnd HSBC economist Chris Hare said: \"Whether the upside news proves temporary or persistent, [May's rate] is clearly a hawkish surprise.\"\nThe price data was collected on or around May 11, before pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers indoors and cinemas and hotels reopened from 17 May.\nThe Bank of England has said it expects inflation to hit 2.5% by the end of this year before settling back to its 2% target as the impact of post-lockdown energy price rises fades along with other cost pressures, such as bottlenecks in supply chains.\nAs you'd expect, economists are divided. \nMs Ward said that if inflation pressure was sustained into next year, \"we could see interest rate hikes\" to dampen down rising prices. \nUK rates, however, remain at historic lows. Also, there are some benefits to rising rates - for example, on the amount of interest people earn on savings. \nNevertheless, the low-rate environment that has existed for a decade and upward changes could be a shock for many consumers and businesses.\nLast week, the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said a rise in inflation above the central bank's target must be only temporary, and that long-term levels of high inflation need to be \"avoided at all costs\".\nSome economists are concerned that despite rising inflation, governments continue to use stimulus to jump-start their post-Covid economies. \nFormer treasury official Lord Nick Macpherson tweeted on Wednesday that Bank of England policies to control the amount of money in the economy are \"excessively loose\".\nThe UK is by no means an isolated case. In the US, where President Joe Biden has proposed a $6 trillion stimulus package, consumer prices hit 5% in May, the highest in almost 13 years.\nJack Leslie, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the speeding up of UK price growth from 0.3% last November to 2.1% in May represented the fastest six-month rise since sterling collapsed after the 2008-09 financial crisis.\n\"But UK inflationary pressures are different - and nowhere as near as large - as those causing fierce debate in the US,\" he said.\nIn China, long a source of cheap goods for the world, inflation is also rising - effectively exporting higher prices.\nAnd Eurozone inflation rose to 2% in May, the first time the rate has surpassed the European Central Bank's target in more than two years.\nNevertheless, central banks seems committed to keeping rates low. The US Fed, for example, expects rates to remain close to zero until 2023. \nGiven the lag between changes in rate policy and the required impact on the economy, some economists worry that central banks could be leaving it too late to change direction.\nIf you think this morning's higher-than-expected inflation number is something to be scared about, the financial markets don't share your view. \nTraders on foreign currency markets, for example, were unimpressed, with the pound shifting up a modest 0.3% against the euro or 0.2% against the dollar. \nInflation may be slightly above the 2% target but it's no higher than it was in July 2019 and well below the 5% inflation of ten years ago, when the global economy was recovering from the 2008 financial crisis.\nPart of the reason the markets shrugged off the inflation figure is the widespread belief that the upward pressure on prices is temporary. \nPrices of raw materials such as wood and steel have shot up from a combination of two things - demand after economies re-opened and supplies still coming back up on stream. The result? Shortages and price rises. \nThe confident expectation is that, for example, as steel manufacturers crank up production there'll be more steel to meet demand so its price will fall back, relieving the inflationary pressure. \nAs summer turns to autumn we'll find out if that expectation is justified.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Care homes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes in England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.\nMr Hancock said it was a \"sensible and reasonable step\" and he would consult on extending it to the NHS.\nThere are no plans to extend mandatory vaccinations beyond health and care workers, he said.\nWorkers will have 16 weeks to get both jabs from the time regulations are approved by Parliament.\nIf they do not, they face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially losing their job.\nMr Hancock told the House of Commons that the \"vast majority of staff in care homes\" were vaccinated, but not all of them.\n\"We know that the vaccine not only protects you but protects those around you,\" he said, adding that compulsory vaccinations in care homes and hospitals would save lives.\nCare organisations have warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people.\nThe government, however, is believed to have considerable concerns about low take-up of the vaccine in some areas, including London.\nA Whitehall source told the BBC that guidance to doctors that they should take the Hepatitis B vaccine suggested there is a precedent for mandatory vaccination.\nThe requirement will also apply to volunteers at care homes and those visiting for other work, such as healthcare workers, tradespeople, hairdressers and beauticians.\nWorkers who can prove they are medically exempt from getting the vaccine will not be affected.\nThere will be also be exemptions for visiting family and friends, under-18s, emergency services and people undertaking urgent maintenance work.\nGovernments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have said they have no plans to make Covid jabs mandatory for care home staff.\nIt comes as the UK recorded a further 9,055 confirmed Covid cases and nine more deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nAnother 190,033 people received a first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday, bringing the total with at least one dose to more than 42 million - or 79.8% of adults. \nMore than 30 million people - 57.8% of adults - have had both doses after a further 230,666 second jabs were given out.\nThe move to mandatory vaccinations for care home staff in England follows a consultation by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), launched in April, two months after the government said it had met its target of offering all front-line care workers a first dose of a vaccine by mid-February.\nAt the time, it said 47% of English care homes for older people had more than a fifth of staff yet to take up the vaccine, despite staff at all eligible care homes having been offered vaccines, with the vast majority of homes having had repeat visits by vaccine teams.\nDr Susan Hopkins, strategic response director for Covid-19 at Public Health England, said there are \"pros and cons to any debate on mandatory vaccination\", with the \"pro\" being that those caring for the most vulnerable in care homes would be vaccinated, thus minimising the risks to residents.\nShe said a possible downside could be that \"people may vote with their feet, and not want to have the vaccine, and therefore not work in a care home, and that could lead to staff supply issues in care homes\".\nDr Hopkins said there had been \"excellent uptake\" of the vaccine, adding: \"I think where people are hesitant, we need to work harder to make them understand why the vaccines work.\"\nThe British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned compulsion was \"a blunt instrument that carries its own risks\".\nIt added: \"While some healthcare workers are already required to be immunised against certain conditions to work in certain areas, any specific proposal for the compulsory requirement for all staff to be vaccinated against Covid-19 would raise new ethical and legal implications.\"\nMike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group (ICG) which represents care homes in Yorkshire, said he was disappointed by the decision and concerned it could cause legal disputes for providers.\nHe told the Today programme: \"People should be vaccinated, every member of staff should take up the vaccine, but I just think persuasion rather than coercion or compulsion is the way to deal with it.\"\nSusan Lord, whose mother lives in a care home in Leeds, said whilst it was \"great\" staff in the home had been vaccinated, she was \"concerned\" by the idea of mandatory jabs targeted solely at care workers.\nMs Lord, from High Wycombe, told BBC News: \"If someone has been working in care for years and isn't able to have the vaccine or has strong objections to having it, it seems a little bit unfair that they're going to lose their job\".\nShe said most care home staff only work in one place and are regularly tested, so it seems \"a little bit harsh\". \nMr Padgham said the sector already had a \"recruitment crisis\", saying: \"We're frightened that this is going to put more people off coming into social care and that's going to be difficult.\"\nCaroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK said: \"Every care home resident would want to be cared for by someone who had been vaccinated, but if a compulsory approach leads to some care workers quitting it will make existing chronic staff shortages even worse.\"\n\"With or without mandatory vaccination,\" she said an approach of \"peer-to-peer persuasion\" should be taken in care homes, \"because this approach has been found to work well\". \nLow uptake among care home staff was a big concern when the vaccine programme was launched - similar issues are seen with the annual flu jab.\nEfforts have been made to convince staff of the need to get vaccinated - there have been advertising campaigns targeting them, webinars held by health leaders and repeat visits made to homes by vaccination teams.\nThere are plenty of places where there has been good uptake.\nBut there are also significant numbers of places where fewer than 80% of staff have been vaccinated - the threshold deemed essential to keep the virus out if 90% of residents are also vaccinated.\nThose working in the sector say there are a variety of reasons staff have cited - cultural reasons and concerns about safety. One common issue has been (unfounded) worries about its impact on fertility as the workforce is young and predominantly female.\nThis move raises lots of concerns from individual rights to its potential to force staff out from a sector that is already short of workers.\nBut the counter argument is that the vulnerabilities of residents and the closed environments they live in require drastic action.\nKelly Andrews, national care lead of the GMB union and a former care worker told BBC News: \"We should not have forced vaccinations in social care, this is pushing the workforce away from social care in an area that we're already struggling to recruit and retain\".\nIn a survey of about 1,000 of its carers, the GMB said, more than a third indicated they would quit their jobs if vaccines were mandated.\nIn the care sector in England there have been more than 40,000 deaths involving Covid.\nAdditional reporting by Joseph Lee."

As of 15 June, the vaccination dashboard from PHS details that 100% of care home staff have received both doses.\n\"Obviously, statistically, this does not mean all staff have now been vaccinated because there is a continual flow of new staff and there may be some homes with less than 100% compliance.\n\"But even then, we have clear measures now in place to ensure new starts are offered the vaccine and where there are gaps that there are targeted efforts to increase uptake.\"\nDo you work in a care home and have a view on whether staff should be required to have the Covid vaccine?

The damage to private properties across the county is likely to run to nearly \u00a3150m pounds.\"\n\"We are a resilient community, many hundreds of people have mucked in and helped out. We are generous too. Charitable donations have nearly reached \u00a3200,000. \n\"But, however generous we are individually, we do not have deep pockets.\" \nIn addition to calls for additional cash, the Labour politicians have also asked for some rules on benefit payments to be suspended.\n\"It would be manifestly unfair for families to receive \u00a3500 from RCT council or from a Crowd Fund Me page, only to have that money clawed back,\" they said.\nFinally, they have called on the UK government to fund an urgent review across all south Wales coalfield communities, to address concerns over landslides following weeks of rain.\nCoaltips remain the responsibility of the Coal Authority, local councils and Natural Resources Wales.\nSpeaking to BBC Wales, the Rhondda MP Chris Bryant added: \"Wales has borne the brunt of the misery and RCT in particular has been hardest hit. \n\"Without extra help, RCT could be wiped out financially as we rebuild bridges, roads and flood defences.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said it had been \"working around the clock with partner agencies to keep people safe and informed\" since the storms and resulting floods. \n\"We have made available \u00a310m to deal with the immediate impact of the storms,\" they added. \n\"This funding is being made available for the initial response, while work to assess the overall impact and cost of the damage continues. This will determine what further financial support is needed and, depending on the scale of those costs, we would look to the UK government to provide resources.\"\nThey said the First Minister Mark Drakeford would be meeting the Welsh Secretary Simon Hart next week to discuss the safety of coal tips and the communities in their shadows.\nA UK government official said it had been communicating with emergency services, councils and the Welsh Government over flooding.\nThey added: \"Whilst flood defences and the response to flooding in Wales are devolved, we will continue to engage with and support the Welsh Government on flood relief and coal tip safety.\"  "

      "text": "The easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland is likely to be pushed back by three weeks, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nThe whole country had been due to move to the lowest level zero of its five-tier system from 28 June.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that this was likely to be be delayed by three weeks so that more people can be vaccinated against the virus.\nThe Covid case rate in Scotland is five times higher than it was in early May.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"we need to buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus, and that is the reason for caution at this juncture\".\nShe added: \"Doing that will give us the best chance, later in July, of getting back on track and restoring the much greater normality that we all crave\".\nBusiness organisations said the delay would be \"frustrating and painful\" for firms who were gearing up to make the most of a boom in summer trade over the coming weeks, and called for greater support to be given. \nAnd opposition parties accused the Scottish government of sending out mixed messages over Covid restrictions in recent weeks. \nIt comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that plans to lift restrictions in England would be pushed back by four weeks until 19 July.\nA formal decision on what level each area of Scotland will be in will not be taken until next week, but Ms Sturgeon said it was \"reasonable to indicate now that I think it unlikely that any part of the country will move down a level\" as planned.\nIt means the country's mainland council areas will remain in either level one or level two, although many island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero.\nMs Sturgeon said the vaccination programme was weakening the link between the rising number of cases - largely driven by the so-called Delta variant that was first detected in India - and serious illness and deaths.\nBut she said there were still too many people who have not yet had both doses of the vaccine. \nShe also said she did not want to \"commit to firm dates\" for easing restrictions, saying she was \"not going to give false guarantees\" in the face of an \"unpredictable virus\".\nThe Scottish government says the entire adult population will have been offered an appointment for a first dose of the vaccine by the end of next week, with everyone due to have had their first dose by 18 July - two weeks ahead of schedule.\nIt is also planning for the possibility of booster vaccines against Covid-19 in the autumn.\nThe first minister added: \"The vaccination programme is going exceptionally well and it is being rolled out just as quickly as supplies allow. But there is still a significant proportion of the population that isn't yet fully vaccinated.\n\"To be blunt, that remains our biggest vulnerability at this stage - and it is a significant one.\"\nWhile the wider easing of restrictions is likely to be delayed, ministers will consider whether some rules could be changed to correct \"perceived anomalies\".\nMany soft play owners, for example, have questioned why their facilities remain closed in level two areas while trampoline centres are allowed to open.\nQuestions have also been asked about why thousands of fans are allowed to gather in a Euro 2020 fan zone in Glasgow, but parents are not allowed to attend outdoor nursery graduations. \nThe government is also to publish the outcome of a review of physical distancing rules, along with a report on what life could look like once Scotland moves beyond level zero - which Ms Sturgeon said she hoped could still happen \"later in the summer\".\nShe said breaking the link between cases and hospital admissions would allow for a move to a \"fundamentally different way of dealing with this virus\" with \"far, far less restrictions and hopefully no meaningful restrictions at all\".\nMeanwhile, the finance ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer calling for an urgent meeting with him to discuss the financial recovery from the pandemic, including the furlough scheme.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said people would be \"frustrated\" that restrictions looked set to continue for \"weeks or even months\", pressing for more detail on when the vaccination programme would be complete.\nHe said: \"We had all hoped for a summer of freedom but instead this stubborn virus is determined to keep us scunnered instead.\n\"It's disappointing that there was no further hope or information for people planning weddings, businesses waiting to know when they can reopen or parents desperately hoping to see their children graduate from nursery.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for called for action to speed up vaccinations and the publishing of hot-spot protocols.\nHe added: \"In order to maintain public trust and confidence we need consistent communications, consistent decision-making, adequate support for businesses and employees alongside a robust vaccination programme, and hot-spot protocols.\n\"I accept what the first minister has said around the delay, but there has been mixed messages that I think do not help maintain public trust.\n\"We have also seen inconsistent decision making: why is it okay to have 3,000 fans at a fan zone, but parents cannot attend a nursery graduation outdoors?\"\nMs Sturgeon said she understood why some people would be \"nervous\" about the fan zone, but said she was a \"highly regulated environment\" and was \"confident it is low risk based on public health advice\"."

      "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden have agreed to develop a cyber-security arrangement between the two countries after discussing the issue of ransomware at their summit in Geneva.\nMr Biden says he and Mr Putin will start consultations \"to begin to bring some order\" after recent high-profile attacks by criminal gangs on critical US companies. \nBut talks are likely to be complex after both sides disagreed about who was to blame for the growing problem of ransomware. \nPresident Biden says he raised a recent attack which took a major US fuel pipeline offline with Mr Putin. \nThe attack was carried out by hacker group Darkside, which is suspected to be Russian. \nMr Biden says he gave Mr Putin a list of 16 specific critical entities that should be considered \"off-limits\" from future cyber-attacks.\nHowever President Putin told reporters that the Colonial Pipeline attack and others have \"nothing to do with Russian authorities\".\nMr Putin also claimed he had been told by US sources that most cyber-attacks originate from the US, and that Russian attempts to get information about attacks originating from the US are being ignored.\nThe anonymous nature of the cyber world means it is often hard to know exactly who is doing the attacking and from where.\nHowever, over the last few years an undeniable pattern has been observed by experts that points in one distinct direction.\n\"The intelligence and research community believes that the attacks are coming from former Soviet block countries, namely Russia, Ukraine, and others\", says former Russian hacker and now cyber-security expert Dmitry Smilyanets. \n\"There are multiple indications proving that point.\"\nDmitry Smilyanets and other experts point towards four distinct pieces of evidence:\n\"Covert engagement and clandestine operations aimed at ransomware operators and affiliates are also providing extraordinary intelligence,\" Mr Smilyanets who works for cyber-defenders Recorded Future says. \n\"Their knowledge and attribution are very accurate and support the findings of cyber-researchers also looking into this area\". \nIn 2019 two Russian individuals were indicted by US and UK authorities accused of running the Evil Corp ransomware gang but both men remain free in Russia.\nIn his press conference, President Putin told reporters that Russia regularly faces ransomware attacks and cited the example of a Russian healthcare service being hit by hackers, which he claimed was carried out by US hackers.\nHowever, Dmitry Smilyanets says he thinks it's unlikely this incident would have been ransomware or news of any resulting disruption would have been public.  \nThe reason there are so few ransomware attacks on Russia and the former Soviet states is often put down to the much discussed 'One Rule' of Russian hacking - which means you can go after anyone as long as they are not on friendly soil.\nThere's no doubt that ransomware gangs are operating in many other countries.\nHackers in North Korea for example were responsible for the most serious ransomware attack in history that impacted hundreds of NHS hospitals in the UK in 2017.\nOn the same day as the Geneva summit, six suspected criminals were arrested in Ukraine for alleged links to a ransomware group called Clop.\nThe individuals are being accused of being involved with attacks against organisations in the US and South Korea.\nAnother suspected hacker was arrested in Canada in January for his alleged involvement with another ransomware group called Netwalker.\nHowever, none of these recent arrests are thought to have seriously harmed the core criminal enterprises of these well-funded and lucrative ransomware hacking networks. \nMost experts agree that the epicentre of this destructive and lucrative criminal industry which is currently ripping through the world originates from Russia and its former Soviet neighbours.

But getting the medicine from the government without having to do lots of things to find the money would help them a lot.\" \nThomas said he \"felt nervous\" delivering the letter to Downing Street but he said \"it was also very exciting, because this is my chance to actually help change my brother's life and my family's life\".\nHis mother Ilmarie Braun said \"you have to fight for access to everything\" for children who have complex needs.\n\"A school place, adaptations at home, the right wheelchair, to then try to manage Eddie's medication needs, that's just beyond what's reasonable,\" she said.\nHannah Deacon, whose son Alfie Dingley was the first UK patient given a long-term licence for medicinal cannabis on the NHS in June 2018, has also raised concerns in a letter to the prime minister.\nShe said unless the situation changed \"we will remain forever stuck with access blocked for very poorly children who are either left suffering unnecessarily, forced to pay thousands of pounds privately or even more worrying drawn to the black market\".\nMs Deacon, of Kenilworth, Warwickshire, said \"desperate parents\" were being forced to purchase \"dangerous products\" and were treating their children with substandard, illegal products. \nShe said it was estimated more than 1,000 UK families were accessing black market products, but the number may be much higher. \nMs Deacon, said nine-year-old Alfie's life had been transformed by taking medical cannabis.\nAlfie, who has a severe, rare form of epilepsy, previously had \"absolutely no quality of life\", suffering up to 150 seizures a month and she said caring for him was \"harrowing\". \nAlfie, who was prescribed Bedrolite oil, has been seizure-free for over a year, she said. \nPeter Carroll, from campaign group End Our Pain, said the situation was \"bizarre and cruel\" as the government \"legalised a medicine, but hardly anyone can get it\".\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said licensed cannabis-based medicines were \"funded by the NHS where there is clear evidence of their safety and clinical effectiveness\".\nShe said specialist doctors could now prescribe \"unlicensed cannabis-based products for medicinal use where it is clinically appropriate and in the best interests of patients\".\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

as per the demand from Sinn F\u00e9in - that Westminster will legislate for Irish language but only if the executive fails to act first?\nBut, crucially, without setting a deadline or timeline for that to happen?\nIf he does, will that be enough for Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP to lift the threat hanging over the institutions?\nLots of questions but don't expect the answers as quickly as the secretary of state would like.\nEarlier, the NI secretary said he wanted to get the Stormont executive \"on a stable footing\".\n\"We all want to see New Decade New Approach delivered and there is a cultural, cross-community package,\" Mr Lewis said.\n\"I want to make sure we do everything we can to ensure the first minister and deputy first minister can be nominated by the parties, which means they've got to find a way to agree a process.\"\nIn the House of Commons, Mr Lewis criticised the Republic of Ireland's T\u00e1naiste (deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar after he said he believed a united Ireland would happen in his lifetime.\nMr Lewis said Mr Varadkar's comments, made during an opening address of Fine Gael's Ard Fheis (party conference) on Tuesday, were \"unhelpful and ill-advised\" and urged people to \"dial down the rhetoric\".\nMr Varadkar said while the views of unionists must be \"acknowledged and respected\", \"no one group can have a veto on Ireland's future\".\nConservative MP Simon Hoare, the chair of the NI Affairs Committee, said he would vote for an Irish language act if it came to the Commons.\nHowever, in a reply to his tweet, the DUP's Carla Lockhart said: \"Not for the first time, a lack of real knowledge of Northern Ireland and a respect for devolution. You can't cherry pick when it suits you.\"\nMeanwhile, assembly members have been told that the executive's post-pandemic recovery plan has been put on hold because of the absence of a first and deputy first minister.\nThe plan was due to be approved on Tuesday and set out by the interim head of the Civil Service, Jenny Pyper.\nMs Pyper said she hoped to give the plan from the Covid Taskforce on Thursday."

      "text": "The 1,000th captive-bred hazel dormouse has been released into the wild in a UK-wide reintroduction scheme for these threatened mammals. \nBig-eyed and famously sleepy, the dormouse is a woodland and fairy tale icon, but it is a species in decline. \nOnce widespread, the animals have now disappeared from 17 English counties. \nReintroduction, scientists say, is the only way to bring dormice back to habitats from which they have been lost. \nThe project, a collaboration between the wildlife charity People's Trust for Endangered Species (PTES), Natural England and the University of Cumbria, brought 15 breeding pairs to a secret location in the Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Lancashire. \n\"When I started 15 years ago, there were five populations in northern England, and now there's only one,\" said Ian White, who has worked for the PTES for 15 years. \n\"It's a decline in woodland and hedgerow management. Dormice live in the shrub layer of woodland, and in many areas that layer has been stripped out, or the forest has been left to grow up and shade out the understory.\"\nWith its tangle of hazel, willow and bramble, the chosen Lancashire release site is ideal for the rodents, but getting them there has been a time-consuming team effort. \nThe 30 dormice in this most recent (and most northerly) release were bred and reared in captivity at London Zoo. They were kept in quarantine for nine weeks and thoroughly checked for disease or parasites, before being transported more than 250 miles by car. \nThe animals travelled in special dormouse nest boxes that were handmade by prisoners in HMP Doncaster and Humber - as part of a partnership between the PTES and the Department of Justice. \n\"Dormice belong here,\" said Dr Deborah Brady, from the University of Cumbria in Ambleside. \"But 50% of the population has been lost in just the last 20 years, which fits in with the loss of biodiversity we're facing more broadly. \n\"And this is a species that we can practically help - we can do something about that.\" \nThe same team is planning another reintroduction next year in a nearby location. \n\"We should end up with a population of possibly 70 or 80 animals in three very closely connected woodlands. Those animals will hopefully breed and we'll be watching that population really carefully,\" Dr Brady added.\nWith the help of 200 extra carefully monitored dormouse nesting boxes installed in the woodland, as well as footprint tunnels placed along branches the rodents will use to move around the undergrowth, the team will be watching closely to see how well the animals settle into their new home.\nHopefully, said Mr White, there will be dormouse babies in Lancashire this summer. \n\"One of my go-to dormouse facts is that the newborn babies are the size of raisins,\" he said.\n\"The idea, long-term, will be to have dormice in this whole landscape - not just this individual wood.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

      "text": "The Ministry of Justice is removing all children from a key institution detaining young criminals in the UK, amid serious concerns for their safety. \nAll 33 children currently detained at the Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre will be transferred to other institutions. \nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said private contractor MTC had \"failed to deliver\" vital changes. \nThe company said it was surprised by the move and challenged the findings.\nDuring the peak of the pandemic last year, detainees were being locked up in near solitary confinement as a quarantine measure. \nThree watchdogs were so concerned to find that children were still being held in those conditions in December, despite an order to the centre's management to stop, they ordered ministers to take urgent action. \nThat prompted Justice Secretary Robert Buckland to order major changes to how private contractor MTC ran the facility in Northamptonshire, including new managers responsible for more closely monitoring how the young detainees were being cared for. \nBut in a statement on Wednesday, the Ministry of Justice revealed that a further inspection by the education watchdog Ofsted had rated the centre as \"inadequate\", despite attempts to turn it around. \nIt said that the most urgent concerns about the time children spent locked up had been addressed - but the government did not believe that MTC had done enough to resolve \"wider long-standing issues\". \nMr Buckland said: \"Six months ago, I demanded that MTC take immediate action to fix the very serious failings at Rainsbrook. \n\"They have failed to deliver and I have been left with no choice but to ask that all children are moved elsewhere as soon as possible.\n\"This move will help protect the public by ensuring often vulnerable children get the support they need to turn their lives around - ultimately resulting in fewer victims and safer streets.\"\nThe 33 current detainees will be moved out of the facility to other accommodation within the youth justice system. In practice that means the only other operating secure training centre (STC) or secure children's homes that are dotted around the country. \nIn a statement, MTC said the welfare of children had been its priority and it had been working in close partnership with officials from the Ministry of Justice since late last year. \n\"Given the previous positive assessments, including Ofsted's follow-up visit in January, we were very surprised to receive Ofsted's feedback at the end of last week's inspection,\" said the statement. \n\"We have a number of concerns about their approach and ultimately the conclusions they have reached. We plan to vigorously challenge this as we go through the fact-checking process.\"\nRainsbrook will be mothballed while the MOJ considers its future, including its contract with MTC.\nIt's not clear whether the contract can be automatically terminated. \nThe potential complete closure of Rainsbrook would mean that two of the three STCs in England have been emptied after serious allegations of poor management and care - the other being Medway in Kent."

      "text": "Lockdown restrictions in England will be extended by up to four weeks after MPs backed the government in a Commons vote by 461 to 60. \nIt means the regulations can stay in place until 19 July, despite a large Tory rebellion against the move. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs ahead of the vote there has been a \"significant change\" that has given the virus \"extra legs\".\nLabour supported the delay but said it did so \"with a heavy heart\". \nOn Monday, Boris Johnson said delaying the planned lifting of restrictions would give the NHS \"a few more crucial weeks\" to get people vaccinated.\nThe decision means pubs, clubs and theatres will still have to operate within capacity limits and nightclubs will remain closed.\nAnd limits remain on how many people can meet up, with groups of up to 30 allowed to gather outdoors and up to six people or two households allowed indoors, although weddings will be exempt. \nSeveral Conservative MPs expressed their unhappiness with the plans and 51 voted against the government. \nFormer Conservative minister, Mark Harper, who chairs the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, said: \"My worry, and the worry of others, is we're going to get to this point in four weeks' time and we're just going to be back here all over again extending the restrictions.\"\nSenior Tory Sir Desmond Swayne said ministers' response to the rising cases was disproportionate and a threat to civil liberties.\n\"I always thought it was wrong for them to take our freedoms, even though they believed that they were acting in our best interests in an emergency, but by any measure that emergency has now passed and yet freedoms are still withheld, and the government will not allow us to assess for ourselves the risks that we are prepared to encounter in our ordinary everyday lives,\" he said. \nFormer cabinet minister Dame Andrea Leadsom said while she would reluctantly back the government in the vote, she urged ministers to show some \"flexibility\" and if possible lift restrictions after two weeks rather than four. \nOn weddings, she said: \"For many couples being able to hug, but not dance, you can't have a band, you've got to socially distance, that's not the kind of big day that they wanted for themselves and their families, so can he reconsider this?\"\nSchool and university students, she added, \"are now faced for the second year in a row with no end-of-year celebrations\".\nOpening the debate, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said pausing step 4 of the roadmap out of restrictions was a \"difficult but essential decision\".\nHe said figures showed the Delta variant now accounts for 96% of new cases and the number of infections was rising - with hospitalisations up 48% over the past week.\nHe added: \"We don't yet know the extent to which the link between hospitalisation and deaths has been broken so we propose to give the NHS a few more crucial weeks to get those remaining jabs into the arms of those who need them.\" \nAnd he said the government's objective was \"not to eradicate\" the virus, he said, because \"that is not possible\" but rather to aim \"to live with it\" like we do with flu.\nAnd he said the delay to 19 July would enable \"a majority\" of the over-40s to have two doses of the vaccine.  \nThe government easily won the vote thanks to Labour's support.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said lifting all restrictions now \"could be akin to throwing petrol on a fire\" and it was essential to listen to the warnings from health professionals and help relieve the pressure on hospitals. \nBut he added: \"We are only here because over the last eight weeks we have failed to contain the Delta variant and have allowed it to become dominant.\"\nMPs also voted to back a range of other measures, such as extending the wearing of face coverings on public transport to 19 July."

      "tags": "Belfast,Balham,Death of Nora Quoirin,Malaysia",
      "text": "A Malaysian judge has overturned an inquest verdict of misadventure in the death of 15-year-old N\u00f3ra Quoirin, changing it to an open ruling. \nN\u00f3ra, from south-west London, was discovered dead in the jungle nine days after she went missing from an eco-resort in Malaysia in August 2019.\nThe change in verdict suggests there are still questions to be answered in the case, and leaves open the possibility of criminal involvement.\nHer family believe she was abducted. \nOverturning the original ruling, High Court Judge Azizul Adnan said there was \"no creditable evidence to support any other verdict\".\n\"I am of the view the verdict of misadventure ought to be vacated in the interests of justice and substituted as an open verdict,\" he said.\nThe initial verdict returned in January had indicated N\u00f3ra's death was accidental.\nHer family said changing the verdict was \"a huge step forward\" for them and they were \"very pleased by the outcome\".\nN\u00f3ra was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development. \nShe and her family had travelled to the Dusun resort in Malaysia on holiday but she disappeared from her room the day after they arrived on 3 August 2019.\nHer body was later found in the jungle about 1.6 miles (2.5km) away.\nA post-mortem examination found N\u00f3ra had died three days before her body was found, due to gastrointestinal bleeding from hunger and stress endured over a prolonged period.\nWhen making the original inquest ruling, the coroner had said there was nobody else involved in N\u00f3ra's death.\nHowever, her parents dismissed claims that their daughter could walk off into the jungle alone at night and challenged the ruling.\nHer mother Meabh Quoirin, who was from Belfast, previously told the BBC she believed her daughter's body was placed by somebody in the spot where she was found, adding that there were \"so many questions... left unanswered\".\nOverturning the verdict, the High Court judge said it was \"not probable\" N\u00f3ra would have left her chalet alone at night, nor that she could \"have navigated by herself the challenging terrain in and around the location where she was eventually found\".\nHe added she was a \"shy and retiring child who was uncurious and unadventurous, and who was strongly attached emotionally to her parents\", and it was \"unlikely\" she would go out on her own.\nFollowing his ruling, Judge Adnan told the family: \"We have not been able to assist you in finding the answers that you may have been seeking, but I hope that these proceedings would have assisted you in some way on the long road towards healing\".\nHigh Court judge Azizul Asmi Adnan explained in detail his reasons for overturning the coroner's verdict, saying he had re-examined all the evidence, and gone back to the resort where N\u00f3ra Quoirin went missing. \nFrom what he saw there, he said, he agreed with what N\u00f3ra's parents Meabh and Sebastien have said all along: that it was very unlikely that N\u00f3ra, a teenager with special needs who was known to be shy, unadventurous and emotionally attached to her parents, would have wandered off in a strange place in the middle of the night. \nHe said she would have had to climb over a fence, and squeeze between a gap in the gates, then negotiate difficult and steep jungle terrain to reach the spot 2.5km from her room where she was eventually found. \nNor did the judge believe she would have evaded a massive search operation, using sniffer dogs and infrared camera-equipped drones, for the six days until she is believed to have died. \nGiven all these questions, he said the interests of justice require that he substitute an open verdict. \nHer family's lawyers say that while this does not automatically reopen the police investigation into N\u00f3ra's death, it does offer a much better starting point to encourage the police to do so.\nReacting to the judge's ruling, Ms Quoirin told the BBC the verdict was what they had wanted and it was \"an important step in our healing process\".\n\"We finally feel that someone has listened to us and recognised who N\u00f3ra truly was,\" she said.\nAsked what their future plans would be, Ms Quoirin said they would \"take some time to think about that and to consider what else we might do. But we already feel this is a huge step forward in our quest for justice\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Care homes,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes in England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.\nMr Hancock said it was a \"sensible and reasonable step\" and he would consult on extending it to the NHS.\nThere are no plans to extend mandatory vaccinations beyond health and care workers, he said.\nWorkers will have 16 weeks to get both jabs from the time regulations are approved by Parliament.\nIf they do not, they face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially losing their job.\nMr Hancock told the House of Commons that the \"vast majority of staff in care homes\" were vaccinated, but not all of them.\n\"We know that the vaccine not only protects you but protects those around you,\" he said, adding that compulsory vaccinations in care homes and hospitals would save lives.\nCare organisations have warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people.\nThe government, however, is believed to have considerable concerns about low take-up of the vaccine in some areas, including London.\nA Whitehall source told the BBC that guidance to doctors that they should take the Hepatitis B vaccine suggested there is a precedent for mandatory vaccination.\nThe requirement will also apply to volunteers at care homes and those visiting for other work, such as healthcare workers, tradespeople, hairdressers and beauticians.\nWorkers who can prove they are medically exempt from getting the vaccine will not be affected.\nThere will be also be exemptions for visiting family and friends, under-18s, emergency services and people undertaking urgent maintenance work.\nGovernments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have said they have no plans to make Covid jabs mandatory for care home staff.\nIt comes as the UK recorded a further 9,055 confirmed Covid cases and nine more deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nAnother 190,033 people received a first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday, bringing the total with at least one dose to more than 42 million - or 79.8% of adults. \nMore than 30 million people - 57.8% of adults - have had both doses after a further 230,666 second jabs were given out.\nThe move to mandatory vaccinations for care home staff in England follows a consultation by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), launched in April, two months after the government said it had met its target of offering all front-line care workers a first dose of a vaccine by mid-February.\nAt the time, it said 47% of English care homes for older people had more than a fifth of staff yet to take up the vaccine, despite staff at all eligible care homes having been offered vaccines, with the vast majority of homes having had repeat visits by vaccine teams.\nDr Susan Hopkins, strategic response director for Covid-19 at Public Health England, said there are \"pros and cons to any debate on mandatory vaccination\", with the \"pro\" being that those caring for the most vulnerable in care homes would be vaccinated, thus minimising the risks to residents.\nShe said a possible downside could be that \"people may vote with their feet, and not want to have the vaccine, and therefore not work in a care home, and that could lead to staff supply issues in care homes\".\nDr Hopkins said there had been \"excellent uptake\" of the vaccine, adding: \"I think where people are hesitant, we need to work harder to make them understand why the vaccines work.\"\nThe British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned compulsion was \"a blunt instrument that carries its own risks\".\nIt added: \"While some healthcare workers are already required to be immunised against certain conditions to work in certain areas, any specific proposal for the compulsory requirement for all staff to be vaccinated against Covid-19 would raise new ethical and legal implications.\"\nMike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group (ICG) which represents care homes in Yorkshire, said he was disappointed by the decision and concerned it could cause legal disputes for providers.\nHe told the Today programme: \"People should be vaccinated, every member of staff should take up the vaccine, but I just think persuasion rather than coercion or compulsion is the way to deal with it.\"\nSusan Lord, whose mother lives in a care home in Leeds, said whilst it was \"great\" staff in the home had been vaccinated, she was \"concerned\" by the idea of mandatory jabs targeted solely at care workers.\nMs Lord, from High Wycombe, told BBC News: \"If someone has been working in care for years and isn't able to have the vaccine or has strong objections to having it, it seems a little bit unfair that they're going to lose their job\".\nShe said most care home staff only work in one place and are regularly tested, so it seems \"a little bit harsh\". \nMr Padgham said the sector already had a \"recruitment crisis\", saying: \"We're frightened that this is going to put more people off coming into social care and that's going to be difficult.\"\nCaroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK said: \"Every care home resident would want to be cared for by someone who had been vaccinated, but if a compulsory approach leads to some care workers quitting it will make existing chronic staff shortages even worse.\"\n\"With or without mandatory vaccination,\" she said an approach of \"peer-to-peer persuasion\" should be taken in care homes, \"because this approach has been found to work well\". \nLow uptake among care home staff was a big concern when the vaccine programme was launched - similar issues are seen with the annual flu jab.\nEfforts have been made to convince staff of the need to get vaccinated - there have been advertising campaigns targeting them, webinars held by health leaders and repeat visits made to homes by vaccination teams.\nThere are plenty of places where there has been good uptake.\nBut there are also significant numbers of places where fewer than 80% of staff have been vaccinated - the threshold deemed essential to keep the virus out if 90% of residents are also vaccinated.\nThose working in the sector say there are a variety of reasons staff have cited - cultural reasons and concerns about safety. One common issue has been (unfounded) worries about its impact on fertility as the workforce is young and predominantly female.\nThis move raises lots of concerns from individual rights to its potential to force staff out from a sector that is already short of workers.\nBut the counter argument is that the vulnerabilities of residents and the closed environments they live in require drastic action.\nKelly Andrews, national care lead of the GMB union and a former care worker told BBC News: \"We should not have forced vaccinations in social care, this is pushing the workforce away from social care in an area that we're already struggling to recruit and retain\".\nIn a survey of about 1,000 of its carers, the GMB said, more than a third indicated they would quit their jobs if vaccines were mandated.\nIn the care sector in England there have been more than 40,000 deaths involving Covid.\nAdditional reporting by Joseph Lee."

      "text": "A deep-water search for the body of a one-year-old girl, believed murdered by her father, is continuing off Tenerife in the Canary Islands.\nAn investigating judge alleges Anna Gimeno Zimmermann and her six-year-old sister Olivia were killed by their father Tom\u00e1s to \"cause the greatest pain imaginable\" to their mother.\nOlivia's body was found in the sea on Thursday, in a bag tied to an anchor.\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said the whole country was in shock.\nThere have been nationwide protests against domestic violence, with hundreds of people - especially women and children - holding dolls and soft toys in memory of the young girls.\nAnna and Olivia were reported missing on 27 April, after Mr Gimeno arranged to spend the afternoon with them. He is also missing, presumed dead by the Spanish Civil Guard.\nA nine-page report by an investigating magistrate was released on Saturday and details have been reported in the Spanish press. Based on the police investigation, it outlines what Mr Gimeno, 37, is alleged to have done leading up to his daughters' deaths, and afterwards.\nTom\u00e1s Gimeno and the girls' mother, Beatriz Zimmermann, had dated since they were teenagers but broke up last year during the pandemic. While both had formed new relationships, Mr Gimeno would send Ms Zimmermann \"offensive and insulting\" messages, the magistrate's report says.\nIt concludes that Mr Gimeno \"most likely\" murdered his daughters in a \"planned and premeditated fashion\", including leaving his pet dog, bank cards with the pin numbers, and car keys at his parents' house. He also gave his new girlfriend \u20ac6,200 ($7,500; \u00a35,400) in cash and a goodbye letter.\nThe court document alleges Mr Gimeno killed his daughters in his house on the day they were reported missing. It says he then drove their bodies to the port, sailed his boat out to deep water off the coast of Tenerife and, at about 22:30, threw bags containing the bodies overboard, having weighed them down with heavy objects.\nHe \"sought to create uncertainty as to the destination of his daughters by hiding their bodies in places... where he thought that they would never be found\", the report alleges.\n\"All of this after announcing to his ex-wife, as well as his relatives, that he was leaving with Olivia and Anna and that they would never be seen again.\"\nThe next afternoon, his boat was found drifting at sea. Anna's car seat was also discovered floating in the water.\nOlivia's body was found in the bag 44 days later, at a depth of 1,000m (3,280ft). Another bag next to it was empty.\nOn Sunday, the children's mother published an open letter to the public.\nBeatriz Zimmermann wrote that it was \"the most monstrous act a person can commit: killing their own innocent children\".\n\"When they told me the news, the world came crashing down on me, and as hard as it is, at least now I can mourn their loss,\" she said.\n\"It hurts my soul that I can't have saved their lives. I wish I had been there at that moment holding their hands so we could die together... But that couldn't be, because Tom\u00e1s wanted me to suffer searching endlessly for them all my life.\"\nThe sisters' case has shaken Spain, and there have been a number of protests against gender-based violence. \nOn Friday, about 1,000 people - mainly women and children - came out to protest in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. One young girl was holding a sign that read \"Stop killing us,\" reports Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds.\nSince 2013, 39 minors have been killed in Spain either by their father or a partner or former partner of their mother, the government says.\nThis year alone, 19 women have been killed because of gender-based violence in Spain, according to statistics from the Spanish government.\nIf you are affected by issues raised in this article, help and support from organisations in the UK is available via the BBC Action Line."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. \nBoris Johnson's former top adviser has released images of private messages which appear to show the prime minister calling the health secretary \"hopeless\". Dominic Cummings, who left Downing Street at the end of last year, claims No 10 and Matt Hancock have \"repeatedly lied\" about failures in dealing with coronavirus. A Downing Street spokesperson wouldn't go into the allegations, but said the PM backs Mr Hancock. It's not the first tirade by Mr Cummings - only last month he made seven explosive claims about what he saw as mistakes made by the government in the pandemic. Here's how Mr Hancock responded.\nThere's been much speculation over vaccines for children in the UK but now the BBC understands a mass vaccination programme for 12 to 17-year-olds is unlikely any time soon. However certain groups of children may still be offered a vaccine. The reason behind the decision is unclear, but children are known to be at extremely low risk of severe disease. Our health correspondent James Gallagher considers whether all children should get the vaccine.\nBack in February, Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon described working from home as \"an aberration\". The bank told all of its workers to get ready to return to the office in June. But, after the government extended coronavirus restrictions to 19 July, Goldman Sachs has delayed its plans. Wondering if you can ask to carry on working from home? The short answer is yes, you can ask, but your boss doesn't have to let you.\nA deaf campaigner is taking legal action against the government, after complaining that it failed to provide in-person British Sign Language interpreters at No 10 Covid briefings. Katherine Rowley, 36, from Leeds, says the lack of access to information caused her frustration and stress during her pregnancy. The government says an interpreter was available on the BBC News Channel and BBC iPlayer, which could be accessed via Freeview.\nAs the lifting of restrictions in England is put on hold, wedding couples are trying to make up their minds whether to postpone their big day. For Kathy Leather, from Malvern, Worcestershire, going ahead now would be like a trifle without the jelly. \"You can't have a celebration without chatting and dancing and singing, so we can't do it.\" Instead, Kathy and Steve Lloyd, her partner of 19 years, will spend what would have been their wedding day volunteering at a vaccination centre.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The Covid-19 epidemic in England is growing, scientists tracking it say - with much of it being driven by younger people who are not yet vaccinated.\nThe analysis, from the React-1 study, looked at the period 20 May to 7 June. \nHowever, tentative signs in the latest daily data suggest growth may be beginning to slow.\nThe rollout of vaccinations to younger people is key to reducing further spread, researchers from Imperial College London say.\nSince last year, the team has been inviting a representative sample of the population to take Covid swab tests. The researchers found:\nThe analysis also suggests a strengthening link between cases and hospital admissions, which is also reflected in the government's daily coronavirus data.\nThe number of new infections is rising, with a seven-day average of 8,404 cases. The UK recorded 11,007 cases on Thursday - the highest number since 12,027 were reported on 19 February. \nThe number of hospitalisations has also increased, with 1,177 patients in hospital as of Monday. However, daily deaths remain low, with a weekly average of nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\nA further 19 deaths were reported on Thursday.\nProf Paul Elliot, who directs the study, said: \"We can take quite a lot of comfort from the fact that when we look in the details, it does appear that there is very, very good protection in the older ages, where there is virtually everyone double vaccinated.\n\"The government has clearly announced that they want to vaccinate all adults in the period between now and 19 July. That will make a very big difference and increase the total amount of population immunity.\"\nHe told BBC News that the study had found the Delta variant first seen in India had overtaken the Alpha (Kent) variant as the UK's dominant strain, and was responsible for an estimated 90% of infections.\nEngland's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said Covid-19 had \"not thrown its last surprise at us\", warning that he is anticipating case rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks due to the Delta variant being \"significantly more transmissible\" than the Alpha variant.\nHe told the NHS Confed Conference he expected a \"further winter surge\" and said he thought new variants may well lead to booster jabs or revaccination being required over the next two to three years.\nThe picture presented by React is one from 10 days ago. But if we look at the daily figures published by the government, there are some encouraging signs, albeit very tentative.\nLast week, cases appeared to be doubling every 10 days, but this week that has slowed to something closer to 14 days. \nIt still means the epidemic is growing - but it is the first sign of a flattening of cases. \nThis, of course, could be a false dawn. The rise in infections has largely been driven by north-west England- the top 20 local-authority areas with the highest rates are all in that region. \nInfections could easily take off in other areas, speeding up the growth of this wave. \nBut if this slowing of growth holds, it is very positive. \nGovernment scientists had feared rapid growth right up to 19 July. \nThis would drive up hospital admissions, albeit, because of the vaccines, at a lower rate than in previous waves. \nIt is still early days, but data is now a little more encouraging than it was. \nPrime Minister Boris Johnson cited the Delta variant's rapid spread when he announced a four-week delay to the lifting of remaining Covid restrictions in England\nThe government has accelerated its vaccination drive, setting a new target to vaccinate all over-18s with a first dose and two-thirds of adults with a second dose by the same date.\nEveryone aged 18 and over in England will be able to book their Covid-19 vaccine from Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced at the NHS conference.\nHe said a first dose had now been given to four out of five adults (80.1%). \nAs of Wednesday more than 30 million people - 58.2% of adults - have had both doses.\nNew figures published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday suggest people who test positive for Covid after being vaccinated are less likely to show symptoms and have less of the virus in their body.\nThe ONS analysis swabbed people at random and picked up asymptomatic infections as well as cases that show up in the daily case numbers.\nIt showed that the risk of getting infected was highest in the first three weeks after vaccination and fell after a second vaccination. Just under 40% of people who did get infected after vaccination showed symptoms. \nThere have been about 16,000 suspected cases of coronavirus reinfection detected in England, out of nearly four million cases, according to Public Health England data, although only 53 have been confirmed.\nIn other coronavirus developments:"

      "text": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock has sought to justify the timing of the first national Covid lockdown after claims a delay cost thousands of lives.\nHe told MPs locking down earlier than 23 March 2020 would have gone against the scientific advice at the time.\nMinisters did challenge the scientists, he insisted, but overruling their advice would have been \"much harder\".\nHe denied claims by Dominic Cummings at the same committee two weeks ago about his handling of the pandemic.\nHe rejected Mr Cummings's criticisms - including that he had lied to Prime Minister Boris Johnson about care home testing - and gave a very different version of events to that set out by the PM's former aide.\nAfter his appearance, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said Mr Hancock \"blames everyone but himself and the government for the handling of the pandemic\".\nMr Hancock told the MPs he \"bitterly regretted\" not pushing back harder against initial scientific advice that Covid was unlikely to spread asymptomatically. \nThis assumption was a big reason, he said, why the government advice on routinely testing hospital patients before they were discharged into care homes did not change until April.\nWhen pressed that government scientists had concluded on 28 January \"early indications\" implied asymptomatic transmission, he maintained the \"recommendation for policy advice\" at that point was that it was unlikely. \nHe said he had asked scientists in January to look into evidence from China that the virus could transmit in this way - but was told during a World Health Organization call this was \"highly likely\" to have been down to \"translation issues\".\nHe added he had an \"instinct\" the advice was wrong, but said it was hard to overturn this when \"you don't have the evidence that you're right, and the scientific consensus is wrong\".\nRegrets? Matt Hancock has a few. \nSuch as not challenging the assumption within Whitehall early last year that the public wouldn't tolerate a lockdown to contain Covid. \nHe \"bitterly regretted\" that he had not overruled scientific advice at the start of the pandemic that assumed coronavirus could not be transmitted asymptomatically. \nMr Hancock said the death rate in care homes \"weighed heavily\" on him. \nBut over four and half hours the health secretary defended the government's actions on several fronts - from PPE provision to care homes - making claims that will be scrutinised further. \nDominic Cummings sat in the same chair two weeks ago and heaped scorn on blame on his former colleagues (most venomously on Mr Hancock). \nIn contrast, the health secretary said ministers and officials largely did their best in unprecedented circumstances. \nMr Hancock strenuously avoided mentioning Mr Cummings by name but swatted away his allegations when they were put to him by MPs. \nWhile assiduously praising those he worked with Matt Hancock also gave the impression that what the crisis really needed was more Matt Hancock. \nAfter having his name trashed by Mr Cummings a fortnight ago this was quite a bounce back. \nMatt Hancock ended his evidence saying the government was now better prepared to handle another pandemic. \nIt had better be because Mr Hancock's testimony added to the picture of a government stunned, sometimes inert and often overwhelmed as the Covid crisis engulfed it at the start of last year.\nTwo weeks ago, Mr Cummings had told the committee that delays to lockdowns and mistakes by Mr Hancock and others had needlessly cost \"tens of thousands\" of lives. \nFormer government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson has said deaths in the UK would have been halved if the first lockdown had been introduced a week earlier.\nQuizzed by MPs on the decisions that led up to the first lockdown, the health secretary said he had instructed the NHS to plan on a \"reasonable worst case\" basis, from January, that 820,000 people could die from Covid.\nBut it was not until 9 March that data \"started to follow\" this trajectory, and not until a week later that \"updated modelling\" showed the UK was broadly on track to meet it.\nThe public was told to avoid non-essential social contact on 16 March, with a full UK-wide national lockdown introduced on 23 March. \nAsked why a lockdown was not implemented earlier, he said: \"The clear advice at the time was there was only a limited period that people would put up with lockdown.\"\nHe added: \"That proved to be wrong.\"\n\"Challenging the advice is one thing, but overruling a scientific consensus is much harder, especially when the costs of the lockdown of the lockdown are immediate and are obvious,\" Mr Hancock told the committee.\nMr Hancock also said he had known Mr Cummings wanted the PM to fire him last year, claiming the ex-aide had \"briefed the newspapers at the time.\"\nAnd in a swipe at the PM's former aide, he said government had \"operated better\" since his departure from Downing Street in December. \nDefending the government's initial advice that all hospital patients did not need to be repeatedly tested before being sent to care homes, he said ministers had \"followed the clinical advice\" at all times.\nHe said clinicians at the time were worried about people picking up Covid in hospital while they waited for test results and false negatives from patients without symptoms providing \"false assurance\". \nBut Labour's shadow care minister Liz Kendall accused Mr Hancock of \"selectively\" quoting clinical advice \"instead of admitting his abject failure to protect care homes\".\n\"He has now used multiple excuses for failing to test those discharged to care,\" she said. \nThe health secretary was giving evidence to the Commons health and science committees, as part of their joint inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic.\nThe committees asked Mr Cummings to provide documents to back up his allegations about Mr Hancock. \nAsked by a reporter waiting outside his home when he would produce this material, Mr Cummings said: \"I'm dealing with a TV repair van, I'm afraid.\""

      "text": "Israel says it carried out air strikes in Gaza overnight after Palestinians launched incendiary balloons from the territory, in the first major flare-up since an 11-day conflict last month.\nThe Israeli military said it targeted compounds belonging to Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza.\nThe incendiary balloons sparked 20 fires in southern Israel on Tuesday.\nHamas said they were a response to a march by Israeli nationalists in occupied East Jerusalem.\nThere were no casualties on either side and calm had been restored by Wednesday morning.\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets had hit military compounds operated by Hamas in Khan Younis and Gaza City.\nIt said \"terrorist activity\" took place in the compounds, and that the IDF was \"prepared for all scenarios, including the resumption of hostilities, in the face of continued terror acts from the Gaza Strip\".\nThe Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that aircraft bombed a site in the Maen area, south of Khan Younis, and another south of Gaza City, causing material damage.\nA Hamas spokesman said on Twitter that Palestinians would continue to pursue their \"brave resistance and defend their rights and sacred sites\" in Jerusalem.\nThe IDF said the strikes were carried out in response to the \"arson balloons launched from Gaza into Israel\" on Tuesday.\nIn recent years, militants have frequently sent helium balloons and kites carrying containers of burning fuel and explosive devices over the Gaza border. \nThe devices have caused hundreds of fires in Israel, burning thousands of hectares of forest and farmland.\nThe air strikes were the first carried out under Israel's new government, which took office on Sunday, ending Benjamin Netanyahu's 12 years in power. \nNaftali Bennett, the new prime minister, is a right-wing nationalist who heads a coalition of eight parties spanning the entire spectrum of Israeli politics.\nIn a separate development on Wednesday, the IDF said soldiers shot a Palestinian woman who it alleged had attempted a car ramming and stabbing attack at a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank. She is reported to have died of her wounds. \nby Rushdi Abu Alouf, BBC News, Gaza City\nThe recent air raids lasted for only 10 minutes, but they were enough to remind the city's residents, who are trying to recover from the aftermath of the recent fighting, that the ceasefire is fragile. \nIt is not only the sounds of explosions that remind people of the war here. You only have to drive your car or walk the streets to witness the scale of destruction that has befallen the city. Tons of rubble still block the main roads in the heart of Gaza. \nA local street vendor, Abu Muhammad, sells nuts on a small cart in the Rimal neighbourhood, which was subjected to the largest strikes in the previous round of violence. He told me: \"We can no longer tolerate more wars, the coronavirus pandemic stopped our work for many months, and the last war caused a great loss, I could no longer feed my six children.\" \nA neighbour, who lives near a Hamas military site that was hit in the latest strikes, told me by phone it was scary watching new plumes of smoke rising.\nThe Jerusalem Day flag march is an annual event that marks Israel's capture of East Jerusalem - home to the Old City and its holy sites - in the 1967 Middle East War. Palestinians see it as a provocation.\nAt Tuesday's event, hundreds of mostly young, nationalist Israelis danced, sang and waved Israeli flags in front of the Old City's Damascus Gate, the main entrance to the Muslim Quarter. \nThey later entered through another gate to reach the Western Wall, one of Judaism's holiest sites.\nIsrael's centrist Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, praised the management of the event but condemned a group of marchers who were filmed chanting racist slogans.\n\"The fact that there are extremists for whom the Israeli flag represents hate and racism is abominable and intolerable,\" said Mr Lapid. \"It is incomprehensible how one can hold an Israeli flag in one's hand and shout 'Death to Arabs' at the same time.\"\nPalestinians accused Israeli security forces of violent and discriminatory policing as the area was cleared for the march.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 33 Palestinian protesters were injured in clashes with Israeli police officers, who fired stun grenades and rubber bullets.\nThe police force said two officers were lightly injured and that 17 people were arrested.\nOriginally, the flag march was supposed to take place on 10 May. But it was interrupted by Hamas militants in Gaza firing rockets towards the holy city, which led to the 11-day conflict.\nAs soon as a ceasefire took hold, the organisers asked for the march to be rescheduled. \nIt was due to take place last Thursday, but it was cancelled by the organisers after Israeli police rejected the proposed route, citing security concerns.\nAn amended route that avoided passing through the Damascus Gate was later approved by the new Israeli government, though the leader of the Arab Islamist Raam party in the coalition said it should have been called off.\nThe Palestinian Authority's prime minister warned that there could be \"dangerous repercussions\".\nThe conflict began after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews.\nHamas began firing rockets into Israel after warning it to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes from Israel on Gaza targets.\nAt least 256 people were killed in Gaza, according to the UN, and 13 people were killed in Israel before an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire took effect on 21 May.\nThe UN said at least 128 of those killed in Gaza were civilians. Israel's military said 200 were militants; Hamas's leader in Gaza put the number of fighters killed at 80.\nMore than 16,000 homes in Gaza were destroyed or damaged in the conflict, along with 58 schools and training centres, nine hospitals, 19 clinics and vital infrastructure, according to the UN."

      "text": "Ryanair and the owner of Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports have launched a legal challenge against the government over the travel traffic light system. \nThey are calling for more transparency about how the government decides which countries qualify for the green list of safe places to visit amid the pandemic.\nEasyJet, Tui and IAG, the owner of British Airways, have backed the case.\nMinisters say the system \"cautiously manages the risk of new variants\".\nThe traffic light system rates countries green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. \nTravellers to countries rated green will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test before and after their trip.\nArrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel.\nThe challenge by Ryanair and Manchester Airports Group (MAG) has been put together after huge frustration within the travel industry at the inclusion of Portugal on the green list in mid-May and then its sudden removal a few weeks later. \nIAG, the owner of British Airways, has told the BBC it intends to join the case as an \"interested party\".\nOne airline in support said: \"We have been asking for more transparency for some time now and so we share the serious concerns being raised by MAG concerning the lack of transparency around government decision making.\"\nOn top of this, the travel industry believes the Balearic and Greek Islands should have been included on the green list of countries last month when health data was analysed.\nIn a separate development, the bosses of Jet2 and EasyJet Holidays have told the BBC they do not understand why low infection destinations like Mallorca were left off the green list in the last review and questioned how government decisions are made. \nThe boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, wants Boris Johnson to explain the scientific basis behind the system which he says the government \"seems to make up\" as it goes along.\nFurther signatories to the challenge are set to be revealed on Thursday. They are demanding a fast response as the crucial summer season edges closer.\nThe government said at the time that moving Portugal from the green to amber list was necessary because of an increase in infection rates in the country, and the emergence of the \"Nepal variant\", a mutation of the Delta version of the virus first detected in India. There were concerns that vaccines would not work as well on this particular mutation.\nThe move meant that some British holidaymakers had to cut short their holidays and dash back from Portugal on extra flights put on by airlines before the country came off the green travel list in early June.\nTravellers the BBC spoke to said it cost them hundreds of pounds to book new flights to get home before the deadline. \nTravel bosses are concerned the damage of these sudden reversals will continue to erode the confidence of the British travelling public. \nThey maintain there is huge pent-up demand to travel abroad this summer, following three coronavirus lockdowns and huge numbers of cancelled or postponed holidays. \nBut epidemiologists worry that mass travel before more people are fully vaccinated, both in the UK and at holiday destinations, will allow the virus to spread more rapidly. \nAnd if Covid cases spiral suddenly on holiday islands, it is not clear if healthcare systems there are in a position to manage their care.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We recognise this is a challenging period for the sector, as we seek to balance the timely reopening of international travel while safeguarding public health and protecting the vaccine roll-out.\"\n\"We have provided \u00a37bn to help support for the industry during the pandemic.\"\nThe spokesperson added that the government could not comment on legal proceedings.

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

      "text": "The easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland is likely to be pushed back by three weeks, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.\nThe whole country had been due to move to the lowest level zero of its five-tier system from 28 June.\nHowever Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that this was likely to be be delayed by three weeks so that more people can be vaccinated against the virus.\nThe Covid case rate in Scotland is five times higher than it was in early May.\nMs Sturgeon said that \"we need to buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus, and that is the reason for caution at this juncture\".\nShe added: \"Doing that will give us the best chance, later in July, of getting back on track and restoring the much greater normality that we all crave\".\nBusiness organisations said the delay would be \"frustrating and painful\" for firms who were gearing up to make the most of a boom in summer trade over the coming weeks, and called for greater support to be given. \nAnd opposition parties accused the Scottish government of sending out mixed messages over Covid restrictions in recent weeks. \nIt comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that plans to lift restrictions in England would be pushed back by four weeks until 19 July.\nA formal decision on what level each area of Scotland will be in will not be taken until next week, but Ms Sturgeon said it was \"reasonable to indicate now that I think it unlikely that any part of the country will move down a level\" as planned.\nIt means the country's mainland council areas will remain in either level one or level two, although many island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero.\nMs Sturgeon said the vaccination programme was weakening the link between the rising number of cases - largely driven by the so-called Delta variant that was first detected in India - and serious illness and deaths.\nBut she said there were still too many people who have not yet had both doses of the vaccine. \nShe also said she did not want to \"commit to firm dates\" for easing restrictions, saying she was \"not going to give false guarantees\" in the face of an \"unpredictable virus\".\nThe Scottish government says the entire adult population will have been offered an appointment for a first dose of the vaccine by the end of next week, with everyone due to have had their first dose by 18 July - two weeks ahead of schedule.\nIt is also planning for the possibility of booster vaccines against Covid-19 in the autumn.\nThe first minister added: \"The vaccination programme is going exceptionally well and it is being rolled out just as quickly as supplies allow. But there is still a significant proportion of the population that isn't yet fully vaccinated.\n\"To be blunt, that remains our biggest vulnerability at this stage - and it is a significant one.\"\nWhile the wider easing of restrictions is likely to be delayed, ministers will consider whether some rules could be changed to correct \"perceived anomalies\".\nMany soft play owners, for example, have questioned why their facilities remain closed in level two areas while trampoline centres are allowed to open.\nQuestions have also been asked about why thousands of fans are allowed to gather in a Euro 2020 fan zone in Glasgow, but parents are not allowed to attend outdoor nursery graduations. \nThe government is also to publish the outcome of a review of physical distancing rules, along with a report on what life could look like once Scotland moves beyond level zero - which Ms Sturgeon said she hoped could still happen \"later in the summer\".\nShe said breaking the link between cases and hospital admissions would allow for a move to a \"fundamentally different way of dealing with this virus\" with \"far, far less restrictions and hopefully no meaningful restrictions at all\".\nMeanwhile, the finance ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer calling for an urgent meeting with him to discuss the financial recovery from the pandemic, including the furlough scheme.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said people would be \"frustrated\" that restrictions looked set to continue for \"weeks or even months\", pressing for more detail on when the vaccination programme would be complete.\nHe said: \"We had all hoped for a summer of freedom but instead this stubborn virus is determined to keep us scunnered instead.\n\"It's disappointing that there was no further hope or information for people planning weddings, businesses waiting to know when they can reopen or parents desperately hoping to see their children graduate from nursery.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for called for action to speed up vaccinations and the publishing of hot-spot protocols.\nHe added: \"In order to maintain public trust and confidence we need consistent communications, consistent decision-making, adequate support for businesses and employees alongside a robust vaccination programme, and hot-spot protocols.\n\"I accept what the first minister has said around the delay, but there has been mixed messages that I think do not help maintain public trust.\n\"We have also seen inconsistent decision making: why is it okay to have 3,000 fans at a fan zone, but parents cannot attend a nursery graduation outdoors?\"\nMs Sturgeon said she understood why some people would be \"nervous\" about the fan zone, but said she was a \"highly regulated environment\" and was \"confident it is low risk based on public health advice\"."

      "text": "Wales' education watchdog will hold a review into sexual harassment in schools after 91 were named on a site for reporting allegations of abuse.\nEducation minister Jeremy Miles has asked Estyn to examine the culture in schools.\nHe said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the recent reports and that the schools named will be offered support.\nIt comes after a report found sexual harassment had become \"normalised\" in schools in England.\nOfsted said that some girls can be contacted by up to 11 boys a night asking for nude images.\nMr Miles had faced calls from the Welsh Conservatives for a Wales-only review after Everyone's Invited, which has attracted more than 16,000 posts, listed 91 schools in Wales.\nIt publishes anonymous allegations which mostly refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university.\nIn a statement for Senedd members Mr Miles said: \"I am deeply concerned by recent reports of sexual harassment and abuse in schools. \n\"Any form of sexual harassment or abuse is totally unacceptable and should not be tolerated. All education settings have a legal duty to ensure that children and young people are shown respect and have access to a learning environment in which they feel comfortable and safe.\"\nHe said he will be \"requesting Estyn to conduct a review into culture and processes in schools to help protect and support young people better\".\n\"While the findings of that review will play an important role in supporting settings and informing Welsh Government policy, I recognise that we cannot await the outcome of that review before we act.\"\nNew training will be made available on incidents of sharing nudes in schools, while the Welsh government will review the relationships and sexuality education (RSE) resources made available to schools.\nConservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said some most schools \"take their safeguarding responsibilities very seriously\" and some were taking action already.\n\"However, as so much guidance has already been available for schools, parents and young people, it's vital that any new advice actually has the impact we need it to have, in order to protect our young people from harm,\" she said. \n\"It's also crucial that Wales' higher education establishments are not forgotten as part of this work, and today I called on the minister to make sure he engages with them too to ensure students are able to focus on their studies without fear of abuse.\""

      "text": "The UK is woefully unprepared to deal with changes occurring to the climate, government advisers say.\nA report by the independent Climate Change Committee predicts warming will hit the UK harder than first thought.\nIt warns of more severe heatwaves, especially in big cities, and more intense rainfall, with an increased flood risk across most of the UK.\nIt says homes, infrastructure and services must be made resilient to floods, heat and humid nights.\nThe authors of the report on adaptation, or \"climate-proofing\", warn that global warming can cause damage running into tens of billions of pounds over short periods - and they say they're frustrated at the lack of government action.  \nThe committee, also known as the CCC, says the UK is even worse prepared than it was five years ago, at the time of its last report on the risks of climate change. \nThe CCC is an independent group of experts set up to provide the government with advice on the climate crisis.\nThe chairwoman of the CCC's sub-committee on adaptation, Baroness Brown, said ministers appeared to be deterred from taking action by the upfront costs of protecting infrastructure. This is because the benefits sometimes are not seen for several years.\n\"They think they can put adaptation off until tomorrow,\" she said. \"But now's the time for urgent action.\" \nResponding to the report's findings, a government spokesman said many of the issues raised were being addressed in policy.\nHere's what the CCC says the government must do to better prepare for the impacts of climate change:\nThere's a need to insulate buildings to save emissions, but overheating has emerged as a deadly risk - especially in flats. The government must force landlords to improve cooling by, say, installing sunshades. Ministers must ensure all new homes are built for a hotter climate.\nThe state of UK nature has been declining for some time, with habitat loss one of the factors driving the loss of plant and animal species. Climate change will make the situation worse. Beech trees won't be able to tolerate conditions in southern England by 2050. \nThree-quarters of upland species are likely to struggle by the end of the century, the report says. Meanwhile, peat bogs currently help reduce the effects of climate change by absorbing carbon from the atmosphere. But if the world continues to warm at the current rate, peatlands could dry out, and begin releasing their stored carbon into the air. \nThe government must re-wet 100% of upland peat moors urgently, the report says.\nClimate change will place pressure on our increasingly connected world and the effects can take us by surprise. For example, about 10 years ago, flooding in Thailand caused a global shortage of computer hard drives.\nRising temperatures will put supply chains at risk for food, medicines, goods and services.

Even so, sleeping at night this week has been difficult and I've been going to work tired and tetchy.\nUntil a couple of years ago, my flat was mostly in shade owing to a large office block opposite.

      "tags": "Department of Health & Social Care,Social care,Child protection",
      "text": "Child protection services in England are too focused on investigating families in crisis and do not provide enough early support, a report says.\nAn independent review of council-run children's social care said services to protect vulnerable children were in urgent need of investment and reform. \nIt concluded that with an increasing demand for help, the current system was unsustainable and failing young people.\nThe government, which set up the review, said it was boosting funding.\nOver the last three months, the review team has heard from more than 1,000 young people, families and staff working in children's services. \nIt found a system under significant strain with an increasing number of families being investigated, more children in care and costs spiralling. \nJosh MacAlister, who chaired the independent review, said: \"If we carry on like this, children's social care will both become more expensive and continue to be inadequate in the support it gives to children and families, so we need to change.\" \nThe report said deprivation was a key factor among families needing help. Many of those who asked for support found assessments and investigations added to their stress. \nThe number of inquiries into whether a child is at risk of significant harm - known as section 47 inquiries - has more than doubled since 2010, rising to 201,000 investigations in a year. \nBut the report said 135,000 of those led to no child protection plan. It concluded that concerns about risk have dominated. \nOfficial figures also show that in 2019-20 there were more than 80,000 children in the care of local authorities in England, up 24% in a decade. \nThe review team looked at the availability and costs of foster care places and children's homes. It concluded this \"placement market\" was broken and that too often young people ended up being moved a long way from home.\n\"Too often children are moved far from where they have grown up, are separated from their brothers or sisters, are forced to move schools, and have a revolving door of social workers,\" the report said.\n\"We are failing to build lifelong loving relationships around these children.\" \nWith council budgets squeezed over the last 10 years, spending has increasingly focused on expensive crisis services that local authorities are legally required to provide. That has meant cuts to early help for families.  \nAt High Trees Family Centre in Hertfordshire, the county council provides the sort of wide-ranging support that the review team believes is vital. In one place, all local families can access health and care services along with playgroups.  \nChelsea, whose one-year-old daughter Darcie is happily playing with paints, said there should be more play sessions like this.\n\"It is very important for the mum and the baby,\" she said. \"It means the mum can meet new friends and get advice and tips.\"\nSammy Lewis works with pregnant mothers and under-ones at the centre. She said that because the centre was open to everyone, it was easy for parents to ask for help and made a real difference to those who were struggling.\n\"That can help to prevent the need for additional support later down the line and they can feel more happy and confident about family life,\" she said.\nThe independent review will publish its final report, making recommendations for change, next spring. \nNSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless said the review should seize a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity\" to create \"a comprehensive, properly-funded care system that works for every child and family who needs it, regardless of their background or where they live\".\nMark Russell, chief executive at The Children's Society, said children's social care was \"hamstrung\" by under-investment and bureaucracy, too often intervened only at \"crisis point\", and had \"serious systemic flaws\" including a lack of understanding of threats outside the home.\n\"Covid has left more children at risk of abuse, exploitation, isolation, mental ill-health and poverty,\" he said, with vulnerable older children being failed as they enter adulthood.\nThe government said it was giving councils an extra \u00a316m to target more support earlier in the lives of children already in the care system. It is also planning a pilot scheme to increase educational help.\nChildren and families minister Vicky Ford said: \"For children in care, or those who are known to social care teams, it is absolutely vital we help them to overcome the barriers they can face in education so that they have the best chance to succeed in life.\"\nTulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, said: \"After failing to ban unregulated accommodation for all children in care, there is no evidence that ministers will deliver the reforms that are needed to stop vulnerable young people fall through the cracks.\"\nDirectors who run council care services said that while the child protection system in England was one of the safest in the world, the report represented a once-in-a-generation chance to make meaningful and lasting change for children and young people.

Glasgow moved from level three to level two - but there were no changes in many parts of central Scotland due to high case numbers.

Going inside someone's living accommodation is only permitted for essential purposes or if you are in an extended household. Shops and many leisure facilities can open, but cinemas, theatres, nightclubs, concert halls and stadiums cannot. People should only travel in or out of the areas for permitted purposes.\nNo Scottish local authority is in this level. The rules say that four people from two households can meet outdoors in a private garden or a public place, but they would not be able to travel outside their area, unless for an essential reasons. Indoor activity can only be for essential purposes and not for socialising. Essential shops would be open, plus places of worship which can follow social distancing rules.

      "text": "A decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-old children against Covid is unlikely to be recommended by UK vaccine experts imminently, the BBC has been told.\nCertain groups of children may still be offered a Covid jab - but not all.\nA statement from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is expected in the coming days.\nThe government will then make a final decision on whether teenagers will be included in the mass rollout.\nVaccinating all over-18s with a first dose and two-thirds of adults with a second dose by 19 July is the latest target set by the UK government.\nThere has been much speculation over whether children were going to be included in the UK's vaccination programme against Covid-19 after regulator the MHRA approved Pfizer's use in 12 to 15-year-olds recently.\nBut the JCVI - the committee of UK vaccine experts which advises the government on the best approach - has not yet made any formal recommendation on the matter.\nCurrent advice is that 16 to 18-year-olds can be offered a Pfizer jab if they are in a priority group, or live with someone who has a weakened immune system.\nThe committee may be waiting for more safety data on children who have been vaccinated in other countries, such as the US and Israel, before making its decision.\nThe MHRA's approval was based on trials of the Pfizer vaccine in 2,200 adolescents in the US which showed it was safe and effective, but this is a relatively small number.\nAt the same time, the UK's stock of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is being prioritised for adults aged 18 to 40 - who are not being offered AstraZeneca - meaning supplies available for children are currently low.\nHowever, for the experts there are a whole host of factors to consider, including the benefits and risks for children, as well as other wider ethical issues. \nChildren's risk of severe disease from Covid is tiny, deaths are extremely rare and have only occurred in UK children with profound underlying and life-limiting conditions. The direct benefits to them of vaccination would be low.\nSome people question whether it's morally right to vaccinate children in the UK, when so many millions of other people in the rest of the world are still unvaccinated.\nOn the other hand, vaccinating children could reduce infections across society, help protect adults and the vulnerable who are most at risk, and keep schools open.\n\"This is a very finely balanced issue and a difficult decision,\" says Prof Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine and child health from the University of Liverpool, who is also a member of the scientific advisory group, Sage.\nHe said he was \"veering towards not vaccinating children\" because of the need to get the vaccine into the arms of more hard-to-reach adults instead.\n\"The virus is spreading in schools because it's got nowhere else to hide at the moment,\" Prof Semple said, adding that improved ventilation in classrooms was much more of a priority than masks in schools.\nVaccinating children would be \"mainly to protect public health and reduce transmission\", he added.\nIt's possible the government is not rushing any decision because it wants to see the impact of vaccinating all adults in the UK on virus cases, which have been rising steadily since the end of May.\nA target of giving two doses to two-thirds of the UK's adult population was set by the prime minister on Monday - but that is principally the over-40s, who are due to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThere are concerns there are not enough Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to start vaccinating younger age groups any earlier.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"No decisions have yet been made on whether people aged 12 to 17 should be routinely offered Covid-19 vaccines.\n\"We will be guided by our expert advisers, and the government has asked the JCVI for its formal recommendation. We will update in due course.\""

During her long career, she was renowned for her down-to-earth nature, great sense of humour and superb acting ability.\n\"She was a true professional. It seems very apt that a bikini that caused her so much embarrassment during the filming will now go to such a good cause.\"\nAccording to the auction house, the Carry On Camping wardrobe department would have commissioned duplicate bikinis for the film, but this was the only example known to have survived after it was rescued from a bin during a costumier's stock clearance.\nKate Lee, chief executive of Alzheimer's Society, said: \"Dame Barbara Windsor inspired so many when she spoke out about her dementia diagnosis and we are so incredibly grateful to have had her and her husband Scott's unwavering support - what they achieved for people with dementia has been truly awe-inspiring.\n\"It is fantastic that such an iconic item will continue Dame Barbara's legacy to support people affected by dementia, and we are touched by the generosity of the vendor.\" "

      "text": "An \"extremely fit\" firefighter died while swimming in a triathlon in Majorca, an inquest has heard.\nHeathrow Airport Fire and Rescue Service crew commander Carl Cavanagh, 45, had been swimming in the Challenge Peguera event when he got into difficulty in October 2019. \nHe was pulled out of the sea but did not survive, the court was told. \nCoroner Brendan Allen concluded the death was natural, but the precise cause could not be ascertained. \nThe Bournemouth court heard Mr Cavanagh, from Wimborne, Dorset, had flown to Spain with his wife to take part in his first triathlon when he died on 19 October. \nGiving evidence, Elizabeth Cavanagh said her husband had swam in open water before but was anxious about the swimming leg.\nGraham Taylor, a member of the UK Fire Service triathlon team, said conditions in the sea were \"rough\". \nHis wife Zoe Taylor described assisting lifeguards perform chest compressions and attaching a defibrillator. \nShe said: \"They [paramedics] were unable to get Carl's heart started again and had taken the decision to stop CPR.\"\nPathologist Dr Robert Blahut explained he was unable to discern Mr Cavanagh's exact cause of death, but on the balance of probability it was more likely the death was natural.\nThe court heard a fire service fitness test completed by Mr Cavanagh on 18 June showed him to be \"A-one fit\". \nHe had been a firefighter since the age of 18, working at Bournemouth and Southampton Airports, before becoming a crew commander at Heathrow Airport. \nSpeaking to Mrs Cavanagh, Mr Allen said: \"I'd like to offer you my condolences on your loss.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

She loved the travelling and it inspired a lifelong interest in visiting different countries and meeting new people,\" said her granddaughter.\n\"She is modest about her war service and never saw herself as a hero, especially as she lost family members in the conflict.\" \nMrs Dyde started as a steward on HMS Defiance at Plymouth before being sent to Warrington to learn coding.  \nIt was on board a troop ship, the Devonshire, en route to Sri Lanka, where the reality of war really hit home.\n\"It was Christmas Day and just as dinner was finishing, action stations sounded,\" Mrs Dyde said.\n\"An unfortunate ship some way ahead had been torpedoed but we all had to just stand there and chug along towards it.\"\nServing on HMS Anderson, she had the opportunity to meet Lord Mountbatten.  \nWhen asked, she told him her work was \"a bit dull\". Although she said he found it amusing, she was later reprimanded for not having the right attitude.\n\"That 'dull' work was actually a crucial part of the war effort - she was communicating intercepted signals from Japanese warships back to the code-breaking experts at Bletchley Park,\" said Ms Meaby.\nAfter the war, the former Wren said her life became so busy, she never found time to apply for her defence and war medals.\nThey were presented to her at Woodland Grove care home by Cdr Andy Swain, chief of staff of the Naval Regional Command Eastern England.\n\"I'm absolutely thrilled,\" said Mrs Dyde.\n\"And to be given them by such an important personage is even more wonderful.

      "text": "Broadcaster Piers Morgan has attacked Ikea after it became one of a number of companies to withdraw advertising from newly launched news channel GB News.\nThe former Good Morning Britain anchor said the Swedish furniture makers were \"pathetic virtue-signalling twerps\" and that he would now be boycotting them.\nIkea said it had not knowingly booked slots on GB News, saying it was not in line with its \"humanistic values\".\nAndrew Neil, GB News' chairman, issued his own response to the decision.\n\"Ikea has decided to boycott GB News because of our alleged values,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\"Here are Ikea's values - a French CEO who is a criminal with a two year suspended jail sentence for spying on staff.\"\nThe company's French arm was fined \u20ac1m (\u00a3860,000) this week after it was found guilty of using private detectives and police officers to collect staff's private data.\nJean-Louis Baillot, Ikea France's former CEO, was given a two-year suspended jail term and a \u20ac50,000 (\u00a343,000) fine. His lawyer said he was considering an appeal.\nOctopus Energy and cider firm Kopparberg are among the other brands that have withdrawn advertising since GB News' launch on Sunday.\nKopparberg said its advert ran \"without our knowledge\" and that it was undertaking a review of the channel's content.\nA post on the its Twitter account said: \"Kopparberg is a drink for everyone and we have immediately suspended our ads from this channel pending further review of its content.\"\nOctopus said it would only run ads in future if the news channel proved \"genuinely balanced\".\nGreg Jackson, the company's founder, said it did not advertise on platforms \"whose primary purpose is the distribution of hate\" and said it would only run adverts on new channels after watching their output for a period of time.\nThe Open University and Ovo Energy also said they were pausing advertising, which they said had been placed by a media partnership without their knowledge.\nGB News has vowed to fight cancel culture and reflect voices not heard in the media.\nBut it has faced criticism from campaigners such as the group Stop Funding Hate, who say its launch brings highly partisan Fox News-style programming to the UK.\nNeil, the BBC's former political presenter, has dismissed the Fox News comparisons as \"nonsense\".\nAs chairman and a presenter, he has promised to challenge the \"echo chamber\" of the \"metropolitan\" news.\nIn an opening monologue to viewers on Sunday night, Neil said GB News would aim to \"puncture the pomposity of our elites in politics, business, media and academia and expose their growing promotion of cancel culture for the threat to free speech and democracy that it is\".\nCancel culture is an idea generally promoted by right-leaning commentators that activists, mostly on the left, are seeking to suppress free expression by permanently shaming and ostracising individuals deemed to have transgressed.\nIt is often associated with woke culture - a call for an increased alertness to social injustice that some on the right of politics feel has strayed into stifling political correctness.\nFraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator which Neil is also chairman of, told BBC News that Kopparberg's boycott could lead to a consumer backlash. \n\"Cancel culture is not popular. If Kopparberg is clever enough to sell cider to the English (who have the best apples on earth) then it should be clever enough to realise its mistake. We should expect a clarification soon. \n\"Being 'for everyone' should mean being for everyone.\"  \nPress Gazette reported that other companies and organisations including Nivea and drinks brand Grolsch had also distanced themselves from the news channel within 48 hours of its launch. \nPromoting a personality-led approach, the GB News presenting line-up includes ex-BBC host Simon McCoy, ITV veteran Alastair Stewart and ex-Sun journalist Dan Wootton.\nMorgan is not a member of the station's line-up, despite speculation he would join the channel following his leaving ITV's Good Morning Britain show in March.\nTopics discussed on Wootton's Dan's Digest segment have included the UK's lockdown extension, taking the knee and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\nSpeaking to BBC News on Tuesday, Richard Wilson, director of media group Stop Funding Hate, said that the immediate controversial tone meant \"it's no surprise\" that a reputable brand such as Kopparberg are \"stepping away, and refusing to align with this\".\nThe group has begun compiling a list of brands advertising on the fledgling channel - urging its 120,000 followers on Twitter to exert pressure on them on social media.\nGB News is available on Freeview channel 236 as well as other platforms including Sky, Virgin Media and Freesat.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Nadhim Zahawi,Boris Johnson,Nick Thomas-Symonds,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Lockdown restrictions in England will be extended by up to four weeks after MPs backed the government in a Commons vote by 461 to 60. \nIt means the regulations can stay in place until 19 July, despite a large Tory rebellion against the move. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs ahead of the vote there has been a \"significant change\" that has given the virus \"extra legs\".\nLabour supported the delay but said it did so \"with a heavy heart\". \nOn Monday, Boris Johnson said delaying the planned lifting of restrictions would give the NHS \"a few more crucial weeks\" to get people vaccinated.\nThe decision means pubs, clubs and theatres will still have to operate within capacity limits and nightclubs will remain closed.\nAnd limits remain on how many people can meet up, with groups of up to 30 allowed to gather outdoors and up to six people or two households allowed indoors, although weddings will be exempt. \nSeveral Conservative MPs expressed their unhappiness with the plans and 51 voted against the government. \nFormer Conservative minister, Mark Harper, who chairs the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, said: \"My worry, and the worry of others, is we're going to get to this point in four weeks' time and we're just going to be back here all over again extending the restrictions.\"\nSenior Tory Sir Desmond Swayne said ministers' response to the rising cases was disproportionate and a threat to civil liberties.\n\"I always thought it was wrong for them to take our freedoms, even though they believed that they were acting in our best interests in an emergency, but by any measure that emergency has now passed and yet freedoms are still withheld, and the government will not allow us to assess for ourselves the risks that we are prepared to encounter in our ordinary everyday lives,\" he said. \nFormer cabinet minister Dame Andrea Leadsom said while she would reluctantly back the government in the vote, she urged ministers to show some \"flexibility\" and if possible lift restrictions after two weeks rather than four. \nOn weddings, she said: \"For many couples being able to hug, but not dance, you can't have a band, you've got to socially distance, that's not the kind of big day that they wanted for themselves and their families, so can he reconsider this?\"\nSchool and university students, she added, \"are now faced for the second year in a row with no end-of-year celebrations\".\nOpening the debate, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said pausing step 4 of the roadmap out of restrictions was a \"difficult but essential decision\".\nHe said figures showed the Delta variant now accounts for 96% of new cases and the number of infections was rising - with hospitalisations up 48% over the past week.\nHe added: \"We don't yet know the extent to which the link between hospitalisation and deaths has been broken so we propose to give the NHS a few more crucial weeks to get those remaining jabs into the arms of those who need them.\" \nAnd he said the government's objective was \"not to eradicate\" the virus, he said, because \"that is not possible\" but rather to aim \"to live with it\" like we do with flu.\nAnd he said the delay to 19 July would enable \"a majority\" of the over-40s to have two doses of the vaccine.  \nThe government easily won the vote thanks to Labour's support.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said lifting all restrictions now \"could be akin to throwing petrol on a fire\" and it was essential to listen to the warnings from health professionals and help relieve the pressure on hospitals. \nBut he added: \"We are only here because over the last eight weeks we have failed to contain the Delta variant and have allowed it to become dominant.\"\nMPs also voted to back a range of other measures, such as extending the wearing of face coverings on public transport to 19 July."

      "text": "Exactly a year on from the discovery that a cheap steroid drug prevented Covid deaths, researchers say they have found another life-saving therapy. \nIt is expensive - a potent intravenous infusion of antibodies to neutralise the virus, rather than dampen the body's inflammatory response to it. \nResults from the Recovery trial suggest it could help one in three of those in hospital with severe Covid. \nFor every 100 patients treated, experts calculate, it would save six lives. \nBut only those who have not already made any antibodies of their own to fight the virus should be given the treatment, which costs between \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,000.\nKimberley Featherstone, 37, who received the treatment during the trial, said: \"I feel very lucky that the trial was up and running by the time I was taken to hospital with Covid-19 and I was able to receive this ground-breaking treatment. \n\"I'm happy that by participating I played a part in finding out this treatment is successful.\"\nThe monoclonal antibody treatment, made by Regeneron, binds to the virus to stop it infecting cells and replicating. \nIn the trial, which included nearly 10,000 UK hospital patients, it significantly reduced the:\nJoint chief investigator Sir Martin Landray said: \"Giving them this combination of two antibodies by an intravenous infusion then actually reduces their chances of dying by a fifth.\n\"What we found is now here we can use an antiviral treatment, in this case these antibodies, in patients who have got a one in three chance of dying untreated and we can reduce that risk for them.\"\nThe treatment was given in addition to the anti-inflammatory steroid drug dexamethasone, which itself cuts death risk by up to a third for the sickest Covid patients.\nSir Peter Horby, the other chief investigator, said there had been great uncertainty about whether antibody therapies were the right approach, when some other studies had found no benefit. \nUsing blood plasma from recovered patients - which contains antibodies that should recognise and fight the virus - has not proved effective as a Covid therapy, for example. \nBut the antibody treatment used in the Recovery trial contains large doses of two specific antibodies, made in the lab, that are good at latching on to the pandemic virus. \nSir Peter said: \"It is wonderful to learn that even in advanced Covid-19 disease, targeting the virus can reduce mortality in patients who have failed to mount an antibody response of their own."

      "tags": "Russia,Geneva,Vladimir Putin,United States",
      "text": "US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are meeting for their first, highly-anticipated summit.\nThe talks in Geneva, Switzerland, come at a time when both sides describe relations as being at rock bottom.\nDiscussions are set to include arms control and US allegations of Russian cyber-attacks. \nNo major breakthroughs are expected but there are hopes of finding small areas of agreement. \nThe arrangements for the meeting were carefully choreographed. The Russian president flew into Geneva on Wednesday before being taken by motorcade to the grand villa overlooking Lake Geneva where the summit is taking place. \nMr Biden, who arrived in the city on Tuesday, then headed to the villa where the two leaders shook hands. \nBoth are accompanied by senior officials for the talks. \nThe meeting comes on the tail end of Mr Biden's first foreign trip as US president, in which he has also attended meetings with G7 and Nato leaders. Going into the summit, Mr Biden has stressed that he has the backing of his Western partners. \nThe choice of Geneva as the setting harks back to the Cold War summit between US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985.\nNeither the US nor Russia currently has an ambassador in-country, and Russia recently included the US on its official list of \"unfriendly states\".\nHowever, Mr Biden has said the meeting is an important step if they are to ultimately find \"stability and predictability\" in relations, while Mr Putin told state TV there were \"issues where we can work together\".\nBut Yuri Ushakov, Mr Putin's foreign affairs adviser, told journalists there was \"not much\" ground for optimism, while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the talks would be \"very difficult\". \nMeanwhile, asked if the leaders - who previously met while Mr Biden was vice-president - would share a meal together, one senior US official told AFP news agency: \"There will be no breaking of bread.\"\nThe US and Russian flags are out in Geneva, armed police in speed boats are patrolling the waterfront and a lakeside beach has been shut to sunbathers opposite the quietly stylish Swiss mansion that will host this summit. \nIt won't be a friendly affair: how could it be, when Joe Biden has called Vladimir Putin a killer and claims he has no soul? In return, Russian TV reports on the meeting today opened by praising the elderly US leader for making it down the stairs of his plane without falling. \nThere is plenty to discuss, and potentially cooperate on - from arms control to cybersecurity, the new battleground. \nThe US also has a long list of concerns to raise about Russia's \"malign activity\" abroad and human rights at home. Vladimir Putin will shrug them off - he has years of practice at that. \nThere are hints of possible progress in talks on the fate of US prisoners in Russia, including the former US marine Paul Whelan, convicted of espionage: Moscow has long been pushing for a swap for its own high-profile detainees in America. \nA truce in the long-running \"diplomatic war\" is also possible, with ambassadors perhaps finally returning to their posts.\nThis encounter will produce no \"reset\" in relations, the hostility is here to stay. But it is a chance for the leaders of two nuclear powers to look each other in the eye again - to be frank - and to set out their respective stalls. At the very least, it's a chance to stop things getting any worse. "

      "text": "Airbnb paid a tourist $7m (\u00a35m) after she was allegedly raped at knifepoint at a rental property in New York City, according to media reports.\nBloomberg News reported an Australian traveller received the payout after an attack on New Year's Eve in 2015.\nThe victim and her friends picked up the keys to the property from a nearby shop that evening, it says.\nThe report suggests the suspect had made a copy of keys to the apartment, which he accessed before an attack.\nThe traveller returned shortly after midnight, as the suspect, 24-year-old Junior Lee, allegedly hid in the bathroom, Bloomberg reports. \nMr Lee has been charged with predatory sexual assault. He has pleaded not guilty, but remains in custody.\nThe Legal Aid Society, which is representing Mr Lee, declined to comment when approached by BBC News.\nAfter the alleged attack, an Airbnb safety team contacted the local police department to offer its assistance and put the victim in a hotel.\nIt also offered to pay for costs such as counselling and flew her mother overseas from Australia.\nBloomberg said that, as part of the $7m settlement, the victim cannot blame or sue Airbnb or the apartment host where the incident took place. It says it was reached two years after the alleged attack.\nBut Airbnb spokesman Ben Breit told the New York Post: \"In sexual assault cases, in the settlements we've reached, survivors can speak freely about their experiences. This includes the NYC case.\"\nAirbnb's prospectus, released before the company floated the business last December, states that for hosts and guests based in the US, it conducts \"online background checks\" including criminal and public records.\n\"In some instances, we re-run these checks periodically thereafter,\" it said. \n\"We also conduct host background checks in India prior to the first transaction. We check all of our hosts and guests against certain regulatory, terrorist, and sanctions watchlists to increase safety for all parties.\"\nEarlier this month, the company led calls for a nationwide registration system for short-term let operators, who would be required to obtain a registration number from the government or a devolved authority in order to list their homes on platforms, such as Airbnb.\nAirbnb said the move would \"empower local authorities to notify platforms about issues with listings in their area\" and also enable platforms to \"remove bad actors\" by preventing people from getting around the rules by switching their listing to another booking site.\nThe latest news is part of a wider Bloomberg investigation into safety standards on the rental platform.\nSince the attack, the company has not overhauled its rules on keys and where hosts may leave them.\nHosts on the platform are not required to use keypad locks or change codes for keypads between bookings. They do not have to tell Airbnb who else has a copy of a property's key either.\nHowever, it has introduced a number of discounts for hosts who want to buy items such as smart locks and noise detectors.

      "tags": "Geneva,Cyber-attacks",
      "text": "The presidents of the US and Russia have praised their talks in Geneva but have made little concrete progress at the first such meeting since 2018. \nDisagreements were stated, said US President Joe Biden, but not in a hyperbolic way, and he said Russia did not want a new Cold War.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Mr Biden was an experienced statesman and the two \"spoke the same language\".\nThe talks lasted around three hours, less time than was scheduled.\nMr Biden said they did not need to spend more time talking and there was now a genuine prospect to improve relations with Russia. \nAs a gift to the Russian leader, Mr Biden brought Mr Putin a custom-made pair of aviator sunglasses, a style favoured by the US president, and a crystal sculpture of a bison. It is unclear whether Mr Putin gave Mr Biden a gift. In 2018, the Russian leader gave former President Donald Trump a soccer ball after a meeting in Helsinki, Finland.  \nThe two sides agreed to begin a dialogue on nuclear arms control. They also said they would return ambassadors to each other's capitals - the envoys were mutually withdrawn for consultations in March, after the US accused Russia of meddling in the 2020 presidential election. \nHowever, there was little sign of agreement on other issues, including cyber-security, Ukraine and the fate of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is currently serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence in a penal colony. \nMr Biden said there would be \"devastating consequences\" for Russia if Navalny died in prison.\nBefore the summit, both sides said relations were at rock bottom. \nMr Putin hinted at a possible deal on exchanging prisoners, saying he believed compromises could be found. \nOn cyber-attacks, Mr Putin brushed away accusations of Russian responsibility, saying that most cyber-attacks in Russia originated from the US. \nMr Biden said he told Mr Putin that critical infrastructure, such as water or energy, must be \"off-limits\" to hacking or other attacks.\n\"I looked at him and said how would you feel if ransomware took on the pipelines from your oil fields? He said it would matter,\" Mr Biden said, adding that if Russia violated these \"basic norms\" the US would retaliate. \nThe two sides differed sharply on human rights, including the right to protest. \nMr Putin dismissed US concerns about Navalny, who recently undertook a 24-day hunger strike. \nHe said Navalny had ignored the law and knew he would face imprisonment when he returned to Russia after having sought medical treatment in Germany. Navalny says he was poisoned with a nerve agent on Mr Putin's orders - an accusation Mr Putin denies. \nHe said Russia did not want disturbances on its territory comparable to the Capitol riots or the Black Lives Matter movement. \nMr Biden dismissed Mr Putin's comments about Black Lives Matter as \"ridiculous\", and said human rights would \"always be on the table\". \nAsked why Russia would want to co-operate with the US, Mr Biden said it was \"in a very, very difficult spot right now\".\n\"They are being squeezed by China. They want desperately to remain a major power,\" he told reporters, shortly before leaving Geneva.\nAt one point during his press conference, the US president appeared to nod in response to a reporter who asked if he trusted Mr Putin. But the White House sent a tweet out soon after saying Mr Biden was \"very clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgment to the press generally\". \nWhen a CNN journalist asked why Mr Biden was confident Mr Putin would change his behaviour, the US president became visibly irritated, retorting: \"If you don't understand that, you're in the wrong business.\" He later apologised for being a \"wise guy\". \nBBC Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford says Mr Putin was keen to underline several times that Russia was a nuclear power - an important country, with an economy smaller than that of the US, but one that still mattered and that was why Mr Biden had come to talk to him.\nWhat is the metric for success following this summit? I think that Joe Biden will see a success as the fact that they engaged in detailed conversations about the knottiest issues around. \nI think Mr Biden - for a domestic audience - also wanted to prove that the 'America is back' tour also means 'I'm not Donald Trump'. And I think he was very keen to underline this in his news conference that I attended a little while ago. \nBut as Mr Biden goes back to the US now on Air Force One, he said: \"We will respond if Russia doesn't do what we want, on cyber, on human rights and the rest of it.\" But respond how? That's the bit of it that is unclear. \nAnd I'm sure Mr Putin returning to Moscow will be thinking: \"Well, he said all these things, but what's he going to do about it?\" Mr Putin has seen down Western leaders before. Maybe he will think that Mr Biden is a different sort of American president. \nBut I think that Mr Putin is going to test his boundaries, and Mr Biden will eventually have to decide how he is going to respond."

      "text": "Dua Lipa, Coldplay and The Beatles helped the British record industry earn \u00a3519.7m overseas last year, the highest figure on record.\nExport revenues for music grew by 6% compared to 2019, aided by the \"explosive growth of music streaming\", said record label association the BPI.\nOne in 10 tracks streamed globally hail from the UK, with 300 British artists receiving 100 million streams or more.\nDua Lipa's Don't Start Now was the biggest British hit of 2020.\nThe club anthem was streamed 1.62 billion times in total, while her Brit Award-winning album Future Nostalgia was the 10th best-seller of the year.\nHarry Styles' second record Fine Line did even better - emerging as the world's fifth best-selling album of 2020.\nDespite these achievements, there were no British artists listed among the year's top 10 biggest-sellers across all formats - raising questions about the UK's ability to create global superstars in an increasingly competitive marketplace.\nInstead, the list was topped by Korean pop band BTS, with the rest of the acts coming from North America - including The Weeknd, Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift.\nAccording to the BPI, the UK is still the largest exporter of music in the world, after the USA - but its share of the global market has dropped from 17% in 2015 to 10% last year.\nHowever, with the exception of Dua Lipa's album, 2020 was relatively quiet for major new releases from British artists. This year could play out very differently -  with Adele, Ed Sheeran and Coldplay all working on new albums.\nThe global popularity of classic acts like The Beatles, Queen, Pink Floyd and The Rolling Stones has also helped sustain the British music industry on streaming services.\nEarlier this year, the BPI announced that total UK recorded music revenue had risen by 3.8% in 2020 to reach \u00a31.118 billion, driven largely by the growth of streaming. \nThis is the highest total since 2006 (\u00a31.17bn) and the fifth consecutive year of growth. \nThe figures come as musicians and songwriters stage an increasingly vocal protest about the way streaming revenue is handled.\nThe Musicians' Union and the Ivors Academy for songwriters and composers told a parliamentary inquiry into the issue that music creators were being \"cheated\" out of royalties, while record labels reap the rewards.\nAccording to the Broken Record campaign, artists receive around 16% of the total income from streams, while record companies receive around 41% and streaming services around 29%.\nHowever, the BPI has argued that streaming works in artists' favour.\nIt said that 1,800 artists had achieved more than 10 million streams in the UK during 2020,  earned them around \u00a329,400 each.\nIt also suggested that streaming has made the market more \"democratic\" - with the top 10 artists accounting for just 5% of all music streamed last year.\nWhen CDs were the dominant form of music consumption in 2005, the top 10 artists were responsible 13% of all sales.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Saudi Arabia has executed a man for offences that rights groups say he committed while aged 17, despite the kingdom's assurance that it had abolished the death penalty for minors.\nMustafa Hashem al-Darwish was arrested in 2015 for protest-related offences.\nSaudi authorities say he was charged with forming a terror cell and trying to carry out an armed revolt.\nBut rights groups had called for a stop to his execution, saying his trial had been unfair.\nAmnesty International and Reprieve, an anti-death penalty charity, say 26-year-old al-Darwish had already recanted his confession, which was allegedly made after he was tortured. Saudi authorities have not publicly commented on the accusation.\nAccording to Reuters news agency, al-Darwish's charges included \"seeking to disturb security by rioting\" and \"sowing discord\".\nEvidence against him included a picture \"offensive to the security forces\", and his participation in over 10 \"riot\" gatherings in 2011 and 2012.\nThe Saudi interior ministry said al-Darwish had also attempted to kill local security forces, state media reported. However court documents did not specify the dates of any of his offences, according to Reuters.\nReprieve said al-Darwish's family received no warning about the execution in advance, and only learned about it online.\n\"How can they execute a boy because of a photograph on his phone?,\" his family said in a statement, published by Reprieve. \"Since his arrest, we have known nothing but pain. It is a living death for the whole family.\"\nThe Saudi interior ministry, cited by state news agency SPA, said al-Darwish was executed in Dammam, a city in the oil-rich Eastern Province.\nSaudi authorities last year said that they would no longer hand out death sentences to people who committed crimes while they were minors, and instead only apply a maximum 10-year jail sentence. \nThe royal decree said the new law would be applied retroactively to those awaiting execution. \nAmnesty and Reprieve say al-Darwish's case should have been reviewed under the new law. They and other groups have repeatedly raised concerns about the implementation of this reform.\nThe UK's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, also raised the issue of justice reform during a visit to Riyadh last month, according to the UK foreign office.\nEarlier this year, the Saudi Human Rights Commission said the kingdom had \"drastically\" reduced the number of people it put to death in 2020.\nHowever, Reprieve said Saudi Arabia had now executed the same number of people in the first half of 2021 as it did in the whole of 2020.

      "text": "The Scottish government has announced a further easing of the Covid rules.\nGuidance urging people to work from home wherever possible is to be relaxed in favour of a \"hybrid\" system of office and remote working from Monday 31 January.\nRestrictions on large outdoor events came to an end on 17 January, then rules on indoor events and venues, including the need for table service in hospitality premises, were lifted on 24 January.\nNew guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday 31 January.\nThis will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.\nBusinesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.\nThe requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - will be reduced from 2m to 1m from 31 January.\nAnd face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.\nFrom Friday 11 February, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer need to take a test after they arrive in Scotland.\nThose who are not fully vaccinated will still have to take a pre-departure test no more than two days before they travel, then take a PCR test on or before day two after their arrival.\nA raft of new measures introduced in December in response to the spread of the Omicron variant have already been removed.\nThese included limits on the number of people who could attend large public events; restrictions in pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places; and the closure of nightclubs.\nAdults and children aged 12 and over still have to wear face coverings in all the same indoor settings as before, such as shops, hospitality venues and public transport.\nBusinesses are legally required to take steps to reduce the spread of Covid, including physical distancing and screens.\nIn hospitality, face coverings can be removed while dancing, drinking and dining. Indoor venues are required to reduce crowding and collect the contact details of customers to help with Test and Protect.\nRetail and other sectors also have to ensure social distancing and manage customer flow.\nThe two-metre distancing rule remains in healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists.\nA vaccine passport scheme was introduced last year for entry to:\nUnder the scheme, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they are fully vaccinated, or a negative lateral flow test.\nIf it is more than four months since your second jab you will need to show proof of a booster to be classed as fully vaccinated. The app has been updated to include boosters.\nProof of a negative LFD test will be needed before people can visit someone in hospital or a care home, or accompany someone to a medical appointment.\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later. \nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 and four months old and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\nHowever, people returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. \nInstead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online so that Test and Protect can start the contact tracing process.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said no changes to the guidance for schools were being recommended at this stage - although this was being kept under \"close and regular review\".\nPupils and teachers in secondary schools must continue to wear face coverings and the one-metre social distancing rule is still in place.\nMs Sturgeon said young people wanted to see the back of masks as soon as possible, but that many understood they provided \"important protection\". She said the issue \"requires and will receive careful consideration\".\nAll secondary school children are being asked to take a lateral flow test twice a week. \nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\nUniversity and college students are being asked to test twice a week and before socialising with other households.\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Dominic Cummings,Boris Johnson,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Boris Johnson's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings has made a series of explosive claims about mistakes made by the government during the Covid pandemic.\nDuring a seven-hour joint session of the Commons Heath, and Science and Technology committees, Mr Cummings made a number of allegations - here are the key points.\n\"Tens of thousands of people died, who didn't need to die,\" Mr Cummings said.\nEarlier, he said sorry for ministers, officials and advisers \"like me\" for falling \"disastrously short of the standards that the public has a right to expect\".\n\"When the public needed us most the government failed,\" he added, apologising to \"the families of those who died unnecessarily\".\nMr Cummings said the government was not on a \"war footing\" when the virus emerged in January and February last year and \"lots of key people were literally skiing\".\nMr Cummings made a series of allegations against his former boss Boris Johnson, including:\nDescribing a decline in his relationship with Mr Johnson after the summer of 2020, he said \"it was clear in July that our relations were very far from where they had been\".\nHe added: \"They took another terrible dive after the second lockdown in October because the prime minister knew that I blamed him for the whole situation - and I did - and by 31 October our relations were essentially already finished... \n\"The heart of the problem was, fundamentally, I regarded him as unfit for the job. And I was trying to create a structure around him to try and stop what I thought would have been bad decisions, and push things through against his wishes.\"\nAsked later by Labour MP Sarah Owen whether Boris Johnson was a \"fit and proper person to get us through this pandemic\", Mr Cummings replied: \"No.\"\nDowning Street rejected many of the remarks and Mr Johnson insisted his government at \"every stage tried to minimise loss of life\".\nMr Cummings appeared to reserve his harshest criticism for Health Secretary Matt Hancock.\nMr Hancock \"should have been fired for at least 15 to 20 things\", Mr Cummings said, as he alleged the health secretary:\nA spokesman for Mr Hancock later said: \"We absolutely reject Mr Cummings' claims about the health secretary.\"\nMr Hancock added he had not seen Mr Cummings' evidence to MPs in full \"and instead I've been dealing with getting the vaccination rollout going, especially to over-30s, and saving lives\".\nHe said he would make a statement in the Commons on Thursday when he would \"have more to say\".\nMr Cummings said it was \"obvious\" in retrospect that the UK should have locked down in the first week of March at the latest - and it was a \"huge failure\" on his part not to alert the prime minister.\n\"I bitterly regret that I didn't hit the emergency panic button earlier than I did,\" he added.\nMr Cummings said that, on 14 March, Boris Johnson had been told that models showing the peak of infections was \"weeks and weeks and weeks away\" in June were \"completely wrong\".\nMr Cummings said that meeting came after the then deputy cabinet secretary, Helen MacNamara, relayed concerns that there was \"no plan... we're in huge trouble\".\nHe said the PM was warned: \"The NHS is going to be smashed in weeks. Really we've got days to act.\"\nMr Johnson announced a national lockdown nine days later on the evening of 23 March.\nMr Cummings painted a vivid picture of the chaotic atmosphere in Downing Street on one \"crazy\" day in March 2020 when the government was considering a national lockdown - at the same time as officials considered a bombing campaign in Iraq.\nOne morning, he claimed, the \"national security people came in\" and said \"[US President Donald] Trump wants us to join a bombing campaign in the Middle East tonight\" and this \"totally derailed\" meetings about quarantine and the coronavirus.\nAt the same time, he said, \"the prime minister's girlfriend was going completely crackers\" over a story in Times newspaper with the headline \"Downing St dog to be reshuffled\".\nThe article reported a Whitehall source as saying they were not sure Carrie Symonds' dog Dilyn would \"make it through the next reshuffle\" due to the mess he had created in her and Mr Johnson's No 11 flat.\nMr Cummings said: \"So, we have this sort of completely insane situation in which part of the building was saying, 'are we going to bomb Iraq?', part of the building was arguing about whether or not we're going to do quarantine or not do quarantine, the prime minister has his girlfriend going crackers about something completely trivial.\"\nMr Cummings said that, as late as 12 March last year, the UK's top civil servant championed a plan of rapid herd immunity involving \"chicken pox parties\" for the virus.\nThen cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill is alleged to have suggested to Mr Johnson: \"Prime minister, you should go on TV tomorrow and explain the herd immunity plan and that it is like the old chicken pox parties. We need people to get this disease because that's how we get herd immunity by September.\"\nBut Mr Cummings said he told him not to use the analogy, which was \"not right\", as - according to data expert Ben Warner - Covid was \"spreading exponentially and killing hundreds of thousands of people\".\nAsked about more recent decisions over a second lockdown in the autumn of 2020, Mr Cummings alleged Mr Johnson rejected a recommendation last September for a shorter stay-at-home order in England.\n\"He was ignoring the advice,\" he added, saying the prime minister believed he had been pushed into imposing the first one and that the economic harm done by lockdown would be worse than Covid itself.\nHe added: \"All credible serious people in my opinion were saying essentially the same thing so I was very, very clear with him about it.\n\"He wasn't taking any advice, he was just making his own decisions, he was going to ignore the advice. Cabinet wasn't involved or asked.\n\"I've been very critical of Matt Hancock but I think Hancock agreed with me actually in September about acting then.\""

      "text": "Goldman Sachs has delayed plans to bring all UK staff back into the office after the government extended coronavirus restrictions to July 19.\nThe bank had told staff to be ready to return to the workplace in June, but confirmed the change in a note to workers late on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, NatWest said its plans for \"priority workers\" to return on 21 June were also under review.\nIts new working model could see just 13% of staff in the office full-time.\nGoldman Sachs International chief executive, Richard Gnodde, told staff its office London remained \"open and available\" in line with government guidelines. \nHe added that according to \"anonymised data\" from its recent vaccination survey, \"the majority of our people have either had their first dose or expect to receive it before Monday 21 June\".\nBut a spokesman confirmed the bank now planned to get all staff back in the office after July 19.\nBanks appear to be split over whether staff should come back to the office full-time or work from home for some or all days of the week \nGoldman Sachs' group chief executive, David Solomon, has described working from home as \"an aberration\", while James Gorman, the boss of rival US investment bank Morgan Stanley said: \"If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office.\"\nHowever, NatWest said just over a third of its 59,300 UK full-time employees would continue to work remotely. Some 55% of its staff would adopt a hybrid model of working between the office and home.\nNatWest chief executive, Alison Rose, said leaders would hold conversations with staff over the summer about which category they fall into.\n\"I would say that we've busted the myth that jobs need to be done in a certain way,\" she previously told staff. \"We have learnt new ways of working and it's important we carry those learnings forward.\"\nThe government's decision to delay easing all coronavirus restrictions from the original date of 21 June prompted criticism from hospitality industry groups, who said it could cost businesses \u00a33bn in lost sales.\nIn the City of London, also known as the Square Mile, the drop in people commuting to the offices of big firms has hampered shops, cafes and restaurants, which are reliant on workers to stay in business.\nDavid Abrahamovitch, chief executive and founder of Grind coffee shops, said the four-week delay to restrictions ending \"killed the summer\".\nHe does not expect a \"material change\" in the number of commuters to city centres until September to October time.\nMr Abrahamovitch said it was \"encouraging\" that some firms had decided workers would return to office working once restrictions are lifted, but added it was a \"completely different landscape\" compared to pre-pandemic times.\n\"We are a long way away of seeing the same kind of working patterns we had in 2019,\" he said.\nMr Abrahamovitch said online subscriptions for Grind coffee had \"bailed us out\" during the pandemic, which had become the \"focus of our business\" now.\nBarclays bank told the BBC it expected to \"invite\" more staff back to its Canary Wharf office over the summer, but said it was \"moving towards a hybrid way of working\".\nBarclays boss, Jes Staley, had previously said home working was \"not sustainable\" for large financial institutions.\nA HSBC spokesman said it planned to adopt a hybrid model of working.\nDespite several firms forecasting to have less people in their buildings, Marcus Geddes, managing director for central London for property giant Land Securities, said tenants and customers were \"telling us, loudly and clearly\" the office was a \"key part of ensuring productivity and culture can thrive\".\nHave you got a question about working from home or hybrid working?

      "tags": "United States,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The number of Americans who have died from Covid-19 has reached 600,012 - the most of any nation - according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nThe US also ranks highest in total number of recorded cases, with nearly 33.5 million infections since 2020.\nThis latest milestone comes as President Joe Biden's goal of getting 70% of US adults vaccinated by 4 July appears increasingly likely to fail.\nOver 173 million people, around 52% of the US, have had at least one dose.\nBrazil and India have reported the next highest death tolls, with Brazil at more than 488,000 deaths and India at more than 377,000.\nIt took around four months for the US to go from 500,000 to 600,000 deaths - about as long as it took to go from none to 100,000. It marks a significant change from the height of the pandemic when the death toll jumped from 300,000 to 400,000 in one month last winter.\nBut the country's vaccination rate has begun to fall to around 1m doses administered per day - down from a high this April of nearly 3.4m.\nRoughly 43% of the US population, or about 144 million Americans, are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC says people are fully vaccinated at least two weeks after their final vaccine dose.\nIt comes as the CDC officially labels the Delta mutation, first discovered in India, a \"variant of concern\". Delta variant cases amount to 10% of all new infections, the CDC said, and is growing in comparison to the dominant Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, UK.\nThough a majority of adult Americans have received at least one dose, the percentages vary wildly from state to state. Vermont has fully vaccinated 71% of its residents, but only 36% of Mississippians have received both jabs, according to a New York Times database.\nA recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found around a third of US adults were not planning on getting vaccinated yet - leading states and companies to offer countless vaccine incentives.\nOhio has been selecting one vaccinated resident each week to win $1m (\u00a3708,000). On Tuesday, California will give $1.5m each to 10 residents. Other winnable items include alcohol, cannabis, guns, food vouchers and gift cards.\nThe White House is also working to boost vaccinations, with Vice-President Kamala Harris beginning a national tour to promote jabs on Monday.\nThe same day, US drug maker Novavax announced that its vaccine was found to be 90.4% effective after testing was conducted on 30,000 participants.\nIf this vaccine is eventually approved, it would be the fourth coronavirus vaccine to hit the US market.\nThe Biden administration has already ordered enough doses of the existing vaccines for the entire US population, US media report, so Novavax may become part of the global vaccine-sharing deal to donate doses.\nOn Monday night, the governor of California - the most populous US state - announced a \"grand re-opening\".\nThe state which ordered the first coronavirus lockdown will now allow vaccinated people to not wear masks or socially distance in most settings. Public health measures remain for events with over 5,000 people.\nAcross the country, New York is also beginning a return to normalcy. \nOn Tuesday, the Governor Andrew Cuomo lifted nearly all restrictions after the state's vaccination rate passed 70%.\n\"We can now return to life as we know it,\" declared Mr Cuomo, adding that the new rules were effective immediately."

It was started by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010 and other signatories include the likes of Star Wars creator George Lucas.\nMr Bezos has not yet signed the pledge, although Mr Jewett joined in March.\nHe said in a letter: \"In a stroke of happy coincidence, I am married to one of the most generous and kind people I know - and joining her in a commitment to pass on an enormous financial wealth to serve others.\""

It was drafted based on the 45 second video of the incident which was shared very widely on social media this morning. \n\"We were subsequently made aware of a longer piece of footage lasting 3 minutes and 28 seconds which shows the incident in full. \n\"It is clear that the incident began on Whitehall where officers were present.\" \nIt added that \"the behaviour shown in the video is unacceptable - members of the public, of any profession, have the right to go about their day without being subjected to verbal harassment or actions that put them in fear for their safety\".\nResponding to concerns about police actions during the incident, the Met said it would \"be reviewing our actions with a view to improving the policing of events for all Londoners\"."

      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh's death in April left a \"giant-sized hole\" in the lives of the royal family, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, has told the BBC.\nSpeaking to Radio 5 Live, she said the pandemic had \"slightly skewed things\", making it hard to spend as much time with the Queen as she would like.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Naga Munchetty, she was asked about taking on a more high-profile royal role.\nShe also spoke about her work supporting victims of rape in war.\nThe countess was speaking to the BBC, ahead of the United Nations' international day for the elimination of sexual violence in conflict, on Saturday.\nIn the emotional interview recorded two months after the death of her father-in-law, Prince Philip, at the age of 99, she said she expected the family would take longer to grieve because of the pandemic.\n\"It's only when you would do the normal things that you would have done with them, and you suddenly realise that they are not there, that you really start to have an 'oh my goodness' moment.\n\"Just talking to you now, it's a bit of an 'oh my goodness' moment,\" she said, holding back tears.\nSophie, 56, who is married to the Queen's youngest son, Prince Edward - the Earl of Wessex, is a full-time working member of the royal family and until recently has been one of the more low-profile members.\nBut, since her nephew, Prince Harry, and his wife Meghan moved to the US, senior royals including Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince William, Catherine, Prince Edward, Princess Anne and Sophie have been dubbed the Magnificent Seven.\nAsked how she felt about her elevated profile, Sophie said: \"There is increased interest in us as a family but, if it raises more awareness of the issues I care about, then that can only be a good thing.\" \nHer wish is to be an advocate for women who do not have a voice - such as survivors of rape in war - and make sure the subject does not drop off the agenda.\nShe described rape as one of the most pernicious weapons of war and said it was used to subjugate whole communities. \"People have to atone for it and that has to start at the top,\" she added.\nShe suggested there could be a case for teaching about the subject in schools.\nSophie also spoke about conversations she has with her teenage children about consent, and inappropriate sexual behaviour.\nShe said her 17-year-old daughter, Lady Louise, has \u201ca natural curiosity\u201d about her work with rape survivors and wanted to learn more.\nBut she said it was \u201cslightly harder\u201d to have the conversation with her 13-year-old son, Viscount Severn, who is at the age where he is \u201cmore aware of girls around him\u201d.\n\u201cInterestingly, he\u2019s quite conscious of this whole issue of inappropriate behaviour between girls and boys. I think that\u2019s partly to do with schools and partly what they chat about on social media. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s about having honest, open conversations as a family, but also hopefully in school settings as well,\u201d she added.\nShe said she hoped her daughter would be able to keep her life as private as she wanted it to be.\n\"I hope that she and her friends will protect her from anything that somebody might want to do. But I have to let her live her life. It's not mine to live,\" she said.\nIn the interview, Sophie also admitted to having the \"odd wobble\" during lockdown.\n\"I just couldn't see an end to it - I couldn't visualise how this was all going to pan out. \n\"Life, all the normal things that we could do, had just\u2026 it was like sand through your hands - we all got very good at managing disappointment,\" she said.\nSo what was her TV show of choice to help her through it? Line of Duty, like so many others - and she correctly guessed H's identity.\nNow, she said, her family were waiting for the pandemic to end.\n\"Every time there is a new variant, we just have to hold our breath and hope that the vaccines are good enough to stand up against them. \n\"So, how am I? Like everybody else I suppose: just taking one day at a time.\""
