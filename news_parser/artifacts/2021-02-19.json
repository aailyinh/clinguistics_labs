      "text": "Lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended until 1 April, the Stormont Executive has agreed.\nBut children in primary 1 to primary 3 (aged four to seven) will go back to school in Northern Ireland on 8 March.\nThey will then resume remote learning on 22 March to enable the return of years 12 to 14, until the start of the Easter holidays.\nHealth officials have said they want to avoid a possible rise in cases around St Patrick's Day on 17 March.\nThe restrictions were imposed on 26 December to manage the spread of Covid-19.\nAnother review of the measures will take place on 18 March. \nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said Northern Ireland knew \"from experience what looks like success is hard-won, but also fragile\".\n\"We need decisions to be safe and sustainable, with a proper sequencing of actions.\"\nThe executive will publish its pathway-to-recovery blueprint for Northern Ireland on 1 March, she said.\nIt is not expected to include indicative reopening dates and Mrs Foster said she would be focused on \"data, not dates\".\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to receive new data on the effect of vaccines on the spread of coronavirus, ahead of Monday's publication of a roadmap for easing the lockdown in England.\nMrs Foster also said the executive was concerned about a growing prevalence of the more transmissible Kent variant of coronavirus, telling a press conference that up to 70% of cases in Northern Ireland are now linked to it.\nA further six Covid-19 linked deaths and 342 new cases were reported on Thursday by Northern Ireland's health department, bringing its death toll to 2,021.\nThis decision will not exactly come as a surprise.\nWhile the rate of infection continues falling, the numbers remain higher than when restrictions were initially eased after the first lockdown.\nThe executive unanimously backed Health Minister Robin Swann's proposal and it's clear the parties all agree (for now), that any reopening will have to be careful and gradual.  \nIf the measures do end up staying in place until 1 April, that means NI will have been in lockdown for 14 weeks in total - a high price paid for Christmas easing.\nMinisters are also urging people not to get ahead of themselves when it comes to Easter yet, though it's not clear why restrictions weren't extended over Easter weekend.\nThe key message from Stormont remains that the fight to suppress coronavirus must continue, with hope for a way out starting later in the Spring.\nCarers aged 50 and over can now book the Covid-19 vaccine at a regional vaccination centre after the scheme was again extended.\nOn Thursday, Health Minister Robin Swann said he hoped to expand Northern Ireland's vaccine programme to carers of all ages soon.\nEarlier this week he announced that carers aged 60 to 64 and more people with underlying health conditions would be included in the programme. \nThe executive also agreed to a proposal from Education Minister Peter Weir at Thursday's executive meeting, allowing for a phased return of schools.\nPre-school and nursery children and pupils in primary 1 to 3 will return to school for two weeks from 8 March.\nThese children will then return to remote learning from 22 March until the Easter break.\nThe executive says this is to ensure that two large cohorts are not back in school together before Easter.\nStudents doing qualifications like GCSEs, AS, A-levels (in years 12 to 14) and other vocational qualifications will return to face-to-face teaching from 22 March.\nIt is planned that pre-school, nursery and primary schools pupils in primary 1 to 3 will then return to full-time face-to-face teaching after the Easter holidays, along with years 12-14.\nMrs Foster said the intention was to get all pupils back to school as soon as is achievable, after Easter, with the option of a separate phased return for primary 4 to primary 7 pupils and the remaining non-qualification years of post-primary.\nThe aim is \"dependent on the health situation at the time\", Mrs Foster added.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Michael Allen, principal of Lisneal College in Londonderry, welcomed the announcement but said planning was needed.\n\"We need to make sure that the examination boards, particularly the CCEA, that their timing is perfectly aligned with the pupils returning on the 22nd,\" he said. \n\"Otherwise you have a real risk that you have 30 year 12 to year 14 pupils in every class staring at the teacher not knowing what to do and teachers staring back still none the wiser in terms of  the evidence required for the centre determined grade.\"\nTullygally Primary School principal, Kirsty Andrews, said the logistics would be difficult for schools.\n\"I don't like the idea of it being only two weeks then out again, back to remote learning - we all know the children need to be back in school for face-to-face teaching,\" she said.\nStormont ministers have also agreed slight changes to click-and-collect services for some retailers.\nThose services will resume from 8 March for baby equipment shops, clothing shops, footwear shops and electrical goods shops. \nFrom that date, the number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a public space will increase to 10 people from two households.\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy said he did not want the executive to cause \"confusion\" over whether people can meet up during the Easter holidays, which begin on 2 April.\n\"The advice would be not to be booking anything for Easter weekend, but there will be a review - I think the way the advice has been given today shows it's a gradual pace, there's no rapid reduction,\" he said.\n\"This is going to be a more slow re-entry into normal life, this side of Easter there won't be any reopening into normal life.\"\nEconomy Minister Diane Dodds tweeted that she was hopeful of a \"safe and sustainable\" reopening of sectors.\nThe chief executives of Hospitality Ulster, Belfast Chamber, Londonderry Chamber of Commerce and Retail NI described the changes to click-and-collect services as \"positive steps\".\nBut they warned that the impact of repeated lockdowns would be \"severe and long-standing\". \nIt came in response to a large spike in the number of coronavirus cases, which followed a relaxation of some rules in the run-up to Christmas.\nThe restrictions have meant non-essential retailers have been closed, family gatherings have been prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons.\nIt was initially imposed for six weeks but on 21 January ministers reviewed the measures and extended them until 5 March at the earliest.\nMeanwhile, latest figures from Stormont's Department of Health show 427,569 people have received their first coronavirus vaccine in Northern Ireland.\nSome 30,012 have received both their first and second."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,G7 summits,G7",
      "text": "\"America is back\" and is fully engaged in helping resolve issues including the pandemic, climate change and Iran's nuclear ambitions, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told the BBC.\nIn his first international interview, Mr Blinken stressed the importance of worldwide vaccination against Covid-19.\nHe also criticised China for its lack of transparency in uncovering how coronavirus emerged.\nIt marks a break with the \"America First\" policy of Donald Trump. \nMr Blinken was speaking as the leaders of the G7 richest industrialised nations met in virtual session. \nBy Yalda Hakim, BBC News \nThe last four years with Donald Trump in charge, it has been all about America first. But what does the US now stand for in the world with Joe Biden as President? \nIn his first international broadcast interview, I've been speaking to Secretary Blinken about what role Washington can play in resolving conflicts and navigating a path out of the coronavirus pandemic. \nBlinken has been Biden's top foreign policy advisor for nearly two decades. He has also served as deputy secretary of state. \nArguably, not since James Baker under the first President Bush has a Secretary of State entered office with so close a relationship with the president. \nThis is what distinguishes Antony Blinken from Colin Powell, Rex Tillerson or Hillary Clinton. None of these people knew the President deeply. None of them had worked for the president previously. \nWhen Antony Blinken speaks, he speaks for the president. \nHe is a consummate foreign policy insider and like his boss he is also someone with a reputation for his civility and graciousness. \nBlinken has had a front row seat to history over the past 30 years and now he's been tasked by the president to re-frame America's relationship with the world. \nAt the centre of the Trump Administration's approach was great power competition. For Obama it was restraint. For Bush it was the war on terror. I asked Blinken what the Biden Administration's foreign policy bumper sticker was. He smiled and without hesitation said \"American engagement, American leadership\".  \nThe US is giving $4bn (\u00a32.85bn) to the Covax vaccination scheme, which aims to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year.\n\"Unless and until everyone in the world is vaccinated, then no-one is really fully safe, because if the virus is out there and continuing to proliferate, it's also going to be mutating,\" Mr Blinken said. \n\"And if it's mutating, it's also going to come back and bite people everywhere.\"\nThe US has now vaccinated more than 27 million of its own people. However, in many poorer countries, vaccination has yet to begin. \nMr Blinken also accused China of failing to share information that might shed light on the origins of coronavirus. \nA team of investigators from the World Health Organization (WHO) spent four weeks in China on a fact-finding mission at the beginning of 2021. However, two experts from the WHO team said afterwards that China refused to grant full access to the data they sought. \nThe secretary of state said a better health security system was needed to spot pandemics before they fully emerged. \n\"It requires countries to be transparent. It requires them to share information. It requires them to give access to international experts at the beginning of an outbreak - things that unfortunately we haven't seen from China,\" he said. \nYes. Under Donald Trump, the US left the deal under which world powers eased crippling economic sanctions, in return for limits on sensitive activities to show it was not developing nuclear weapons.\nNow the US is examining whether to rejoin the deal. President Biden said on Friday that the US must work with other major powers to rein in what he called Iran's \"destabilising\" nuclear ambitions. \nFor its part, Iran says that despite an EU offer to broker talks with the US to revive the deal, the US \"must act\" first and lift sanctions. \nMr Blinken told the BBC the US and its European partners were \"once again on the same page\" on Iran. \n\"President Biden has been clear for some time: if Iran returns to its obligations under the nuclear agreement, the United States will do the same thing,\" he said. \nAnd he said the US would then work with other countries to confront Iran on other issues, including its influence in the region and its ballistic missile programme. \nAsked by the BBC's Yalda Hakim how he would respond to accusations that the US had made concessions to Iran, he said the previous approach had failed. \n\"We have a policy in recent years of so-called 'maximum pressure' on Iran that has not produced results. In fact, the problem has gotten worse. Iran is now much closer to being able to produce, on short order, enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon.\"\nMr Blinken was also asked about the case of Princess Latifa, the daughter of the ruler of Dubai, who has accused her family of holding her hostage since she tried to flee in 2018.\nIn the secretly recorded videos, obtained by the BBC, the princess said she feared for her life. The story has prompted global calls for a UN investigation and the UN human rights agency has asked the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to provide proof that the princess is still alive.\nThe US secretary of state said that the US would be closely monitoring the situation, adding: \"Across the board, with adversaries, competitors, with partners and allies alike.. we take human rights seriously and the president has put it at the heart of our foreign policy and countries can expect us to follow through on that.\"\nOn Friday, Dubai's royal family said via the UAE's London embassy that Princess Latifa was \"being cared for at home\".\nBut there was no video or photo released with the family's statement which could serve as proof of life, nor did it give any details about her condition.\nThe Americans are currently reviewing their policy on Afghanistan to decide whether or not to keep troops there. Mr Blinken said the US and others would be putting pressure on the Taliban and others to honour their commitments to disassociate themselves from al-Qaeda.\nHe described the recent military coup in Myanmar as \"a tragic setback to what had been a historic democratic transition\".\nHe condemned China's decision to block BBC World News television and World Service radio, calling the Chinese information space \"one of the least open\" in the world. \n\"China uses that to spread misinformation and propaganda... I think ultimately is unsustainable and it requires countries coming together to stand up for free and open information space and we are looking at ways to do that more effectively,\" he said.\nMr Blinken refused to be drawn on calls for a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, due to be held in Beijing, over allegations of genocide against the Uighur minority, saying only: \"That's something we'll come to at the right time, in the right moment.\""

      "tags": "Sheep farming,Cattle,Agriculture,Welsh government,Dairy farming,Wales agriculture ",
      "text": "The risk posed by foot-and-mouth disease is a \"continual worry\" for Wales' most senior vet, two decades on from the last major outbreak.\nChristianne Glossop said 2001 was a year of terrible memories she will \"never forget\".\nAcross Wales a million animals were slaughtered, with farming and tourism thrown into crisis.\nThere are now \"solid contingency plans\" to minimise the chances of such widespread infection, she explained.\nAppointed chief veterinary officer for Wales in 2005 when powers over animal health and welfare were devolved, at the time of the epidemic Prof Glossop was working in private practice.\nThe first case was detected at an abattoir in Essex on 19 February 2001. \n\"Everybody involved in agriculture would remember exactly where they were and what they were doing on that dreaded day,\" she said.\nWithin a week, the virus had reached Anglesey. \nPowys and Monmouthshire were also to become among the worst-hit counties.\nDistressing scenes of billowing smoke from burning pyres and carcasses being buried in vast pits filled TV news bulletins in a year consumed by efforts to get the outbreak under control - at an estimated cost of \u00a38bn to the UK.\nFootpaths were closed, tourism nosedived, major events such as the Royal Welsh Agricultural Show and the Urdd Eisteddfod were cancelled and a general election delayed.\nHighly infectious, foot-and-mouth disease causes fever and painful blisters inside the mouth and under the hooves - and can be fatal for young animals.\nFor Wales' farmers the fact the 20th anniversary of the crisis coincides with current lockdown restrictions has brought often traumatic memories to the surface.\n\"What was very sad and emotional was watching the animals being slaughtered on the farms and then being burnt and the smoke afterwards. It was something that sent a shiver down your back really,\" said Gareth Davies, who runs an upland farm in Cwmgwilym, north of Brecon in Powys.\nHis sheep and cattle were shot after signs of infection were found on a neighbouring farm.\n\"One day you've got a farm full of livestock and the next day it's empty, like a graveyard,\" he said.\n\"It's a real shock - because we live with these animals, they're part of us - we have a respect and a loyalty and an affection for them. \n\"It's no different to the average person in the street with their pet dogs - it's the same emotional feeling you have.\"\nProf Glossop recalled visiting a pig farm and having to break the news it had been hit by foot-and-mouth to the farmer and his two grown-up sons.\n\"We stood in the farmyard and these men, they cried in my arms. It's not something you can ever forget.\"\nLessons learned from that time mean Wales and the UK are better placed to respond in future, she believes, pointing to a smaller outbreak in 2007 in Surrey that was quickly contained.\n\"A lot of things have changed since 2001. I do believe the plans we have in place are much tighter now, they're more robust and we know what to do.\"\nSystems for registering and tracing livestock have improved, particularly for sheep and pigs, so the authorities know where they are.\nA six-day standstill rule limits movement of animals on and off farms to allow time to spot signs of disease and prevent its spread.\nA UK-wide movement ban would also be introduced immediately in the event of a new outbreak - unlike in 2001 when a delay of several days was blamed for making the situation worse.\nProf Glossop believes the devolution of animal health and welfare powers is another step forward, meaning Wales can tailor its own plans to the nature of the farming industry in the country.\n\"We have a close working relationship with our farmers and our vets - we can call people together and share messages quickly and widely. I sleep with my phone by my bed and any time of day or night somebody out there could be seeing signs of a notifiable disease.\"\nJoint exercises are also carried out across the four UK nations - the last, codenamed Blackthorn, taking place in 2018.\nStephen James, chair of the Welsh Government's animal health and welfare framework group, said it was \"so important everyone sticks to the rules\".\n\"This applies if you keep hundreds of animals or even just a single pig behind your house - you mustn't keep it under the radar.\"\nStrict border controls are also vital, according to John Mercer, who worked for the state veterinary service at the time of the epidemic and is now director of the NFU Cymru farming union.\nIt is thought one way the virus could have reached the UK in 2001 was through illegally imported meat, leading to a ban on feeding animals with any catering waste or kitchen scraps.\n\"We have excellent protocols in place to stop anything coming in via the legal trade but there's always a risk when it comes to the illegal trade as we know foot-and-mouth is endemic in some parts of the world,\" Mr Mercer explained.\nThe events of 2001 had \"really pushed people to the edge\", he said. \"Let's hope we never see that again.\"\nWales' final case was identified in Crickhowell, Powys on 12 August 2001, with the country declared free of foot-and-mouth disease in December that year.\nSlowly the countryside returned to normality, which Prof Glossop describes as a \"healing in people's hearts and a healing in the land\"."

      "text": "The UK is to launch a \"high-risk\" science agency to look for ground-breaking discoveries.\nThe agency, Aria, will be run along the lines of US equivalents that were instrumental in the creation of the internet and GPS.\nAria, which has \u00a3800m funding over four years, will have a \"higher tolerance for failure than is normal\", the government said.\nLabour said the government needed to clarify what the agency would do. \nThe new body - the Advanced Research & Invention Agency (Aria) - would fund \"high-risk, high-reward\" scientific research, the government said.\nBut the amount of funding it will get is a fraction of the money pumped into existing government research bodies such as UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).\nFor 2020-21 alone, the government has allocated \u00a310.36bn for its research programmes and bodies.\nNevertheless, the government said that Aria would \"help to cement the UK's position as a global science superpower\".\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the new agency would \"drive forward the technologies of tomorrow\" by \"stripping back unnecessary red tape\".\n\"From the steam engine to the latest artificial intelligence technologies, the UK is steeped in scientific discovery. Today's set of challenges - whether disease outbreaks or climate change - need bold, ambitious and innovative solutions.\n\"Led independently by our most exceptional scientists, this new agency will focus on identifying and funding the most cutting-edge research and technology at speed,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nBoris Johnson's former senior adviser Dominic Cummings was a prominent supporter of \"blue-sky\" thinking by small groups of scientists, saying in 2019 funding should be given to \"high-risk high-payoff visions\".\nIt was the sale of the UK's artificial intelligence startup DeepMind to Google in 2014 which apparently got Dominic Cummings thinking.\nThe man who was to become Boris Johnson's chief advisor became obsessed with the idea that the UK was giving away its technological crown jewels.\nThe answer, he decided, was to create a British version of Arpa, the American agency credited with funding the development of the internet and GPS.\nDespite Mr Cummings' departure from Downing Street, the government has opted to go ahead with Aria, an agency designed to make big bets on risky projects.\nIt will have a tiny fraction of the budget of the existing research agency UKRI, which will carry on doing its job.\nBut Aria will apparently be independent, freed from bureaucracy and imbued with a Silicon Valley culture where failure is not to be feared.\nThe test, of course, will be whether there are also successes to celebrate.\nAria will be modelled on the influential US Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa), which supported research that led to the internet and GPS, and its successor Darpa, which funded the precursors to today's coronavirus vaccines.\nScience and innovation minister Amanda Solloway said: \"To rise to the challenges of the 21st Century, we need to equip our R&D community with a new scientific engine - one that embraces the idea that truly great successes come from taking great leaps into the unknown.\"\nRecruitment for a chief executive and chair for the agency will begin in the coming weeks.\nMatthew Fell, CBI UK chief policy director, said the UK had \"a unique opportunity to play to its strength\" with the new agency, to help create jobs, raise productivity and tackle the biggest challenges facing the country.\n\"Key to Aria's success will be strong business engagement to make sure the brilliant ideas developed can make it through to market,\" he added.\nSir Jim McDonald, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said: \"Engineering is central to an ambitious innovation agency of this kind, forming the bridge between research and innovation to enable technological and commercial breakthroughs.\"\nBut Labour shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said the agency needed to have a clear mandate and to be subject to Freedom of Information laws, to ensure transparency of funding. \n\"Labour has long called for investment in high ambition, high risk science,\" he said. \"But government must urgently clarify the mission and mandate of this new organisation, following strong engagement with the UK's science base - those closest to the work.\""

      "text": "Iran says that despite an EU offer to broker talks with the US aimed at reviving a nuclear deal, America \"must act\" first and lift sanctions. \n\"Gestures are fine,\" Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh tweeted, adding: \"Remember, Trump left the room.\"\nIran vowed to limit its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of economic sanctions under the 2015 deal.\nBut former US President Donald Trump abandoned the accord in 2018.\nThe move led Iran to roll back its commitments.\nThe US has now expressed intent to rejoin the deal under President Joe Biden.\nOn Thursday, the Biden administration made its firmest pledge yet to re-engage with Iran over the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\nState department spokesman Ned Price said the US would accept an invitation from the European Union to meet Iran for talks.\nSenior EU diplomat Enrique Mora tweeted he was \"ready to invite\" all parties to talks, saying this was a \"critical moment\" for the deal.\nBut Mr Khatibzadeh later said that Tehran would only \"respond\" to calls to revive the deal after the Biden administration lifted all sanctions.\nMeanwhile, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also suggested on Friday that the country would only comply with the deal fully once US sanctions had been lifted, saying it would then \"immediately reverse\" its actions. \nIran has ratcheted up pressure on the Biden administration, threatening to block international inspections of its nuclear sites within days if the US does not lift sanctions.\nSince the US withdrew from the deal, Iran, which says its nuclear programme is peaceful, has resumed or begun nuclear activities barred under its terms. This has heightened concern among the parties to the deal, who suspect Iran's intentions.\nIn response, the US and its European allies - the UK, France and Germany - have called on Iran to refrain from blocking inspections, warning jointly that the move would be \"dangerous\".\nOn Thursday, the four powers said they shared a commitment to ensuring Iran could \"never develop a nuclear weapon\".\nThe offer of an initial meeting hosted by the EU to get around the stand-off over who moves first in the complex path back to the nuclear deal would have been the first substantial diplomacy with Iran in more than four years.\nTo show good faith, the Biden administration eased stringent travel restrictions on Iran's UN diplomats imposed by Mr Trump. It also reversed his effort to restore all UN sanctions on Iran. \nWhen it comes to American sanctions, Mr Biden says he'll lift them once Iran has resumed compliance with the deal. \nBut Iran has demanded an end to US sanctions by the weekend, threatening to limit inspections of nuclear sites if it doesn't. The US and other Western powers have urged it against taking what they call a step backward when they're ready to move forward.\nIran's reaction to that statement was dismissive.\nSuspicions that Iran was using its nuclear programme as a cover to develop a nuclear bomb prompted the EU, US and UN to impose sanctions in 2010.\nIn 2015, Iran reached a deal with six powers - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - that saw it limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Iran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment and allow international inspectors to access sites and facilities.\nMr Trump abandoned the deal in May 2018 and reinstated US sanctions. He wanted a new deal that would also curb Iran's ballistic missile programme and its involvement in regional conflicts.\nIran refused and, when the sanctions took effect, was plunged into an economic crisis.\nSince sanctions were tightened in 2019, Iran has moved to stop international inspections of its nuclear sites and step up uranium enrichment in breach of the deal."

Ready to serve but denied that opportunity,\" he said.\nSame-sex relationships were decriminalised in Britain in 1967, but it took a further 24 years before the ban on hiring LGBT staff across government was lifted.\nBefore then it was wrongly thought that they would be vulnerable to blackmail and subversion, Mr Moore said.\nLGBT people who declared their sexual orientation at that time were asked to leave government service. Thousands more who wanted to join were prevented from doing so. \n\"Committed, talented, public-spirited people had their careers and lives blighted because it was argued that being LGBT+ was incompatible with being an intelligence professional,\" Mr Moore said.\n\"Because of this policy, other loyal and patriotic people had their dreams of serving their country in MI6 shattered. This was wrong, unjust and discriminatory.\"\nThe MI6 chief, who rarely makes any public statement, used his official Twitter account to broadcast his message. \nIn a separate video, Mr Moore thanked all LGBT staff for their contribution to Britain's security as he appeared alongside the actor Sir Ian McKellen, who recalled some of the homophobic discrimination he had encountered in the 1980s. \nSir Ian suggested the lifting of the ban in 1991 put MI6 in the \"vanguard\" and helped change the way society thought about LGBT people.\n\"Having so boldly accepted there had been injustice in the past within its own organisation, it gave heart for people to think 'well, perhaps you could spread that principle of honesty and equality to other areas of life',\" he said.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has ministerial responsibility for MI6, also paid tribute to the courage of LGBT colleagues, past and present, saying the UK was safer because of their dedicated service."

Around the world [we need to] make sure everyone gets the vaccines that they need, so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together.\"\n\"There is no point in us vaccinating our individual populations - we've got to make sure the whole world is vaccinated because this is a global pandemic and it's no use one country being far ahead of another, we've got to move together.\"\nHe said he wanted to \"ensure that we distribute vaccines at cost around the world - make sure everybody gets the vaccines that they need so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together.\"\nAfter the meeting, the G7 leaders issued a statement committing to \"intensify cooperation on the health response to Covid-19\".\nIt reaffirmed the group's support for \"affordable and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, reflecting the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good.\"\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has told the Financial Times richer countries should send up to 4 to 5% of their current vaccine supplies to poorer nations.\nBut Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK would be \"looking at a figure significantly greater than that\".\nHe promised the government would be a \"global force for good\" in fighting the pandemic and, unlike \"some countries\", the UK would not use the promise of vaccine supplies to other countries as \"short-term diplomatic leverage\".\nBut it was \"difficult to say\" at this stage when the sharing would happen, Mr Cleverly added.\nA government source said more than half of excess doses would go to Covax, a UN initiative intended to ensure wider access to vaccines.\nThe UK government has donated \u00a3548m to the scheme, to which the US pledged $4bn (\u00a32.9bn) in December.\nAlmost 17 million people in the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, with 573,724 of these receiving two doses, according to the latest figures.\nBy Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent\nIn the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need. \nNew figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses. \nThe UK has also given \u00a3548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries. \nBut campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism. \nSome 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk. \nAnd even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries.\nMr Johnson used his position as chairman of the G7 group of major economies to push the case for setting a 100-day target for developing vaccines when new diseases strike.\nHe also told the group that it was important to \"build back better\" from the pandemic and face the \"great challenges\" of climate change, telling the leaders that he wanted \"to get some great things done\" at the G7 and the forthcoming Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.\nFriday's virtual meeting is the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden.\nThe One Campaign, which aims to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, said Mr Johnson's commitment to Covax did not go far enough.\nUK director Romilly Greenhill said: \"The virus won't wait on us to be ready before it mutates, so we need to get these vaccines around the world as quickly as possible.\"\nAn Ipsos MORI poll of people from 18 countries showed that those in the UK were most likely to support donating surplus doses.\nAlmost seven in 10 Britons (69%) want to pass on some of the country's extra doses to be used in other countries, whereas globally just under half (46%) say they would want their country to do this.  \nA further 12,057 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Thursday, alongside another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test."

      "text": "Millions of people are out of pocket on flights they were unable to board due to coronavirus restrictions, according to consumer group Which?.\nHolidaymakers prevented from flying by travel restrictions or lockdowns may not be entitled to a refund.\nMore than two million people have not got their money back, Which? said.\nTravel restrictions remain in place in the UK, with travellers arriving from \"high-risk\" countries having to stay in quarantine hotels.\nMost of the people who were unable to take flights were hit by circumstances which meant they reasonably, or in some cases, legally, could not travel to their destination, Which? said.\nIt is warning people to be wary of booking flights for this summer and to wait until the situation around international travel becomes clearer.\nThe consumer group said in the longer-term booking a package holiday rather than a flight-only booking should give stronger passenger protections. People should only book with a trusted provider with a generous and flexible booking policy, it said.\nTravel restrictions introduced at the Spanish border on Christmas Eve meant the Howe family couldn't take their trip to Lanzarote.\nThey were able to cancel their accommodation free of charge, but it was a different story with their flights.\n\"We asked for a refund, but was told as the flight was still operating, we weren't entitled,\" Rebecca Howe told the BBC.\nIt has left the family \u00a3980 out of pocket, and they're far from alone in losing cash paid for flights.\nHopeful holidaymakers have been prevented from travelling because of local or national lockdowns and restrictions preventing entry at their destination, or the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office advising against non-essential travel.\nBut in cases where the airline did not cancel the flight, customers may not be legally entitled to a refund or guaranteed a successful claim through their travel insurance or bank.\nWhich? said passengers in these circumstances would often have only been given the choice of rebooking their flight or losing their money.\nRebecca Howe said she was offered the choice to rebook her Ryanair flights for free up until the end of March, but that was no good.\n\"For one thing all the Ryanair flights to Lanzarote between Christmas and the end of March were less than half the price as we paid a premium to travel over New Year. \n\"If we'd accepted a cheaper flight, we would have lost the difference.\"\nBut with the only practical date available for the family to go was February half-term, even that was no good.\n\"Someone at my work had already it booked as annual leave so I couldn't take the time off as we are only allowed one person out.\"\nThey're now trying to reclaim the money via a chargeback request through their bank, \"But there's no guarantee it'll be successful so at the moment we're accepting we have lost the money.\"\nDonna Smullen and her husband from Cheshire had booked flights to Spain with Ryanair in September 2019, long before the start of the pandemic.\nThey were due to travel in August 2020, but at the end of July, the FCDO warned against non-essential travel to Spain. That warning invalidates most travel insurance.\nA two-week quarantine was also introduced for flights returning from mainland Spain. Due to their jobs, quarantining was not an option for the couple. \n\"We were told by Ryanair we could change the date of our flights for a fee of \u20ac30 to \u20ac90 (\u00a326 to \u00a378) per person per flight, as long as we travelled before the end of 2020,\" she said. \nThat meant rebooking would have been more expensive than the flights themselves, so they took the hit and were left more than \u00a3500 out of pocket.\nRyanair said that passengers who book non-refundable flights are not entitled to refunds if they choose not to travel on flights which have operated. \nHowever, passengers can avoid being out of pocket by \"availing of Ryanair's change facility, even for bookings which were made prior to any Covid-19 flight restrictions being introduced.\"\nWhich? has shared its findings with the CMA to aid an investigation into whether airlines have breached consumers' legal rights by failing to offer cash refunds for flights they could not lawfully take.\nRory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: \"With non-essential travel currently illegal, airlines must play their part in protecting public health by ensuring no-one is left out of pocket for abiding by the law and not travelling.\n\"All airlines should allow passengers the option to cancel for a full refund, as well as fee-free rebooking options, while these restrictions remain in place.\""

      "text": "Teachers are being advised to wear face masks in some circumstances as schools prepare to welcome back children aged three to seven.\nOn 22 February, the foundation phase will join children classed as vulnerable and those of critical or key workers who have have been able to remain in school during lockdown.\nWhile some schools in areas with higher rates of Covid-19 infection will delay reopening, it will mean the \"nightmare\" of juggling working from home and home-schooling will end for many.\nBut some parents might be anxious about what sort of learning environment awaits their children.\nThe Welsh Government has published new safety guidance for schools ahead of the return.\nFrom school cleaning to uniforms, transport and lunches - here is everything you need to know about children's' return to school.\nAbsence will not be penalised during this period, the guidance says. \nIt adds is a parent or carer wishes for their child to be absent \"we expect schools to authorise the absence during this time\".\nIt says schools should continue to record attendance in the register and follow up on absences where learners are expected in school.\nYes. The Welsh Government says face masks should be worn by staff if social distancing cannot be maintained - it has acknowledged young children \"will not be able to maintain social distancing\".\nIt says both staff and secondary school learners should wear face masks anywhere on the school estate, including in the classroom.\nThe exception is at mealtimes and when they are outside, unless the school risk assessment indicates that additional measures are needed.\nSchools should ensure adequate waste bins on premises for those who choose to use single-use face coverings.\nVisitors to the school should also use a face covering, including parents and carers when dropping off and picking up.\nPeople need to wash their hands both before and after putting on and removing face coverings.\nNo. The Welsh Government says it recognises younger children \"will not be able to maintain social distancing\", adding it is \"acceptable for them not to distance within their group\". \nStaff need to maintain social distance from other staff and also from learners \"as much as possible, recognising this may not be possible with younger learners\".\nThe guidance says if possible, staff responsible for younger learners should remain with set groups rather than interchange between different groups.\nWhere children undertake desk-based learning, classrooms should have forward-facing desks, one metre apart, the guidance says.\nThe guidance recognises \"this may not be possible or appropriate in all schools and settings and particularly for younger learners\".\nSchools have been told to make the most of the space available, including outdoor space\nSchools have been told to ensure enhanced cleaning takes place, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often, using standard products such as detergents and disinfectants.\nWhere possible, schools should provide separate toilets for different contact groups. \nWhere this is not possible, hand sanitiser should be used before entering the toilet.\nThe guidance advises grouping learners together in \"as small a group as possible\". \n\"For example, for those learners in the foundation phase this is likely to be the size of the class,\" it adds.\nIt says mixing between separate contact groups, including during arrival at school, break/lunch times and leaving school, should be avoided. \nWhere possible, schools need to ensure appropriate ventilation, the guidance says. \nMechanical ventilation systems should be adjusted to increase the ventilation rate wherever possible.\nWindows should be opened - in cooler weather windows should be opened \"just enough to provide constant background ventilation\" and opened more fully during breaks.\nIt says opening internal doors can also assist with increasing air circulation.\nThe guidance says hands should be cleaned thoroughly more often than usual with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use a hand sanitiser if soap and water are unavailable.\nIt says small children and those with complex needs should continue to be helped to clean their hands properly.\nAutomated soap dispensers should be used where possible and hands should preferably be dried using paper towels. \nHand dryers should be avoided where possible.\nThe guidance says some schools \"may feel it is appropriate\" to relax their uniform policy during this period.\nIt points out that school uniform and general clothing shops are currently closed under the Wales-wide alert level four lockdown. \n\"This is a decision for school leaders,\" it adds. \nGloves, aprons and a fluid-resistant surgical mask should be worn if a child becomes unwell with Covid symptoms and needs direct personal care, the guidance says. \nEye protection should also be worn if a risk assessment determines there is a risk of splashing to the eyes such as from coughing, spitting, or vomiting.\nGloves and aprons should also be used when cleaning the areas where a person suspected of having the virus has been.\nGloves and aprons should continue to be used when providing personal care to a child or young person, it says. This can include personal, hands-on care such as washing, toileting, or first aid and certain clinical procedures such as assisted feeding.\nThis depends on whether catering facilities are still available within the school in question. \nIf catering facilities are open, those eligible for free school meals will be provided with lunch on each day they attend. Other learners will still be expected to pay for their meals. \nIf  the school's catering facilities are closed, those eligible for free school meals will be provided with vouchers, food parcels or payments. All learners can be required to bring in a packed lunch. \nLocal authorities remain under a statutory duty to provide free home to school transport for all eligible learners of compulsory school age who live over 2 miles from their primary, or three miles from their secondary school.\nRisk assessments must be completed and signed off by the appropriate local authority officer.\nThere is no requirement to wear a face covering on dedicated home-to-school transport.\nThere is no requirement to maintain contact groups on school transport providing a consistent group of learners travel on the same bus each day they attend."

      "text": "A life-changing accident has left a specialist who spent 20 years building artificial limbs in need of a prosthetic arm himself.\nIn a cruel twist of fate, Jim Ashworth-Beaumont lost his arm in a cycling accident in which he almost died.\nSix months on, he is back at work and is hoping to be one of the first people in the UK to be fitted with a revolutionary bionic limb.\nJim, from Edinburgh, works as a prosthetist and orthotist at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in London.  \nA former Royal Marine, he was a competitive athlete and took part in triathlons. On the day of the accident he was training.\n\"I popped out for a training session on the bike and headed to Catford in south east London and stopped at traffic lights,\" he said. \n\"An articulated lorry stopped beside me and that's when the problems happened.\"\nThe 40-ton truck rolled over Jim, severing his arm and almost killing him.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Mornings programme, he said: \"I can remember pretty much everything up until the ambulance arrived. I remember the helicopter landing and that's about it.\n\"I was aware of the wheels of the articulated lorry rolling up my arm and I was convinced the next part of my body to be hit would be my head. I was convinced that I was going to die.\"\nJim was put into an induced coma. When he came out there was an emerging awareness of how serious things were.\nHe said: \"It was only over time I was aware I had spinal fractures, rib fractures, a lot of skin had been taken off my front which needed to be grafted. \n\"The situation was a lot more than just my arm. It took a little while to realise just how bad it was.\"\nJim contracted sepsis while in the coma on top of his horrific injuries. \nHe said: \"MedicaI staff and my wife told me I was constantly on the verge of death. I had sepsis, multiple organ failure, what was left of my liver packed up and then my kidneys, as well. When I came out of the coma I had liver failure and kidney failure to deal with.\n\"I was in the critical care unit for about two-and-a-half months, actually conscious for a month of that. When I came out, the Covid pandemic was in full swing so we were pretty much restricted to our beds. I had tubes coming in and out of me so it was a difficult environment to exist in.\" \nJim said his background helped him mentally. \nHis work involves working on rehabilitation with patients who have suffered limb loss. He said that having that base knowledge, plus his research interest - neuro-rehabilitation and recovery from injury - made sure he knew what he needed to do to return to full function.\nLike the athlete he is, Jim's recovery has been fast-paced. His liver is recovering and his kidneys have also bounced back meaning he no longer needs dialysis every two days.\nHe has started building his fitness again and even began a Couch-to-5k programme two months before he was even expected to leave hospital.\nHe started back at work, from home, at the start of February. But what he wants to do is get back to his old duties. \nHe said: \"My dream is to return to the job I love which is helping people to solve their structural and functional problems, and that's quite a manual job. You need good hand skills to do that. \n\"I assess people, collect data and make and fit an artificial limb or orthotic device. So I need a device that will do what I tell it to do and that is the promise of the latest generation of components that are available, but they cost a lot of money.\"\nThe limb Jim needs is a functional bionic prosthesis and it is not available on the NHS. Jim needs a titanium post to be fitted into the end of the bone in his arm and then a prosthesis will be anchored into that to make it much more stable and usable.\nBut the arm, plus the expertise to fit it will cost more than \u00a3300,000. Jim's family is fundraising for \"Jim's Biggest Challenge\" on fundraising sites.\nHe believes that in a couple of years, he could be back doing the job he loves, and his experience will give him a new relationship with his patients.\nhe added: \"Essentially my life now is a little bit of a struggle every day and I kind of relish that in a way. The fitness hasn't stopped. I am out running, doing pilates. \n\"I am not as fit and able as I was, but the challenges are still there and I really believe in going for it every day.\""

      "text": "Covid-19 vaccine passports are \"feasible\" but not until we know more about how long immunity lasts, experts have said. \nAnd they have the potential to discriminate against the young, pregnant or those who can't have the jab for medical reasons.\nThis must be factored into any such scheme before launching, according to a Royal Society report.\nIt sets out 12 tests which should be met by any vaccine passport plan.\nThe criteria include having a way of accommodating \"changes in vaccine efficacy against emerging variants\".\nAnd a vaccine passport would need to meet ethical and legal standards including around data protection, human rights and equality and discrimination laws.\nIt is also vital to be clear about what the passports would be used for, whether that's international travel or greater domestic freedoms, the report outlined.  \nThe main scientific issues are around how long immunity lasts and whether vaccines will protect against new variants. \nIt's difficult to say how long a vaccine passport should be valid for if it's not known how long the protection conferred by the jabs hang around for.\nAnd it will need to be clear whether all the vaccines in use protect against every new variant - especially if people are travelling to parts of the world where the dominant strain is different from the one in their home country.\nThe vaccine is proving to be very good at protecting people from becoming ill with coronavirus.\nBut there are still questions around how much it stops people carrying the virus and transmitting it to others.\nUnderstanding this will be important if vaccination status becomes a pass to mix more freely with others, Prof Christopher Dye, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford who contributed to the report, explained.\nHe said the only vaccine currently mandated for travel around the world is yellow fever - and there is only one type of vaccine available, it's highly effective, and confers lifelong protection. \nThe Covid-19 vaccines are not currently in such a \"comfortable\" spot, he said.\nAs well as scientific concerns, there are also legal and ethical considerations, according to the report's lead author Prof Melinda Mills.  \n\"What would it be used for - getting a job or attending a football match or buying milk?\" she questioned.\n\"What if we start barring people from essential goods and services?\"\n\"There is a risk of unjustly discriminating in hiring, attending events, insurance, housing applications, you can think of many examples,\" Prof Mills explained. \nIf a passport scheme was rolled out before everyone in the country has been offered a jab, this could unfairly disadvantage young people or people living in certain parts of the country. \nEven then, some people are unable to or are not recommended to take the vaccine, for medical reasons or during pregnancy unless they are at particular risk, for example.\nAnd, \"people of different ethnicities have different levels of vaccine hesitancy,\" Prof Mills said, which opens up the potential for discrimination against people's \"religious or political beliefs\" - or where this hesitancy is linked to a long history of racism and marginalisation. \nIf employers implement \"no jab, no job\" policies - where the requirement to be vaccinated is written into workers' contracts - equality laws would need to be balanced with legal duties of care, Prof Mills said.\nFor example, the right of individuals working in care homes to choose not to be vaccinated would have to be balanced against the imperative to protect the vulnerable in their care. \nSome countries have already developed passport schemes, including Estonia, Denmark and Israel.\nThe 12 tests outlined by the Royal Society recommend that a vaccine passport should:"

      "text": "Texas Senator Ted Cruz has attempted to defend taking a family trip to Mexico amid a winter storm that left millions in his state without power and water. \nMr Cruz said on Thursday he planned the holiday for his daughters, \"wanting to be a good dad\", but had returned because it \"didn't feel right\".\nPhotos of the Republican lawmaker at an airport on Wednesday fuelled outrage at how he had left Texas during a crisis.\nMillions of people in Texas face water shortages, with reservoirs near empty.\nFreezing temperatures have caused power blackouts at water treatment facilities and burst water pipes supplying homes, despite attempts by some homeowners to insulate them from the cold using blankets.\nAbout 13 million Texans have been told to boil water that may be contaminated.\nMr Cruz, a high-profile Republican who ran for the US presidency in 2016, has not only drawn criticism for taking the international trip, but also for reportedly leaving his dog, Snowflake, behind. \nA New York Magazine reporter tweeted an image early on Thursday that appeared to show the senator's home, with Snowflake visible through the glass of the front door. \nThe canine was reportedly being cared for by a security guard. \nIn a written statement released on Thursday afternoon, Mr Cruz said that with schools closed in the state, he had booked the vacation for his young daughters who \"asked to take a trip with friends\".\nThe senator said he and his staff were \"in constant communication with state and local leaders to get to the bottom of what happened in Texas\". \nMr Cruz did not apologise for making the trip amid the state of emergency in Texas, but in a later interview with broadcaster ABC13, he said it was \"a mistake\".\n\"In hindsight, if I had understood how it would be perceived, the reaction people would have, obviously I wouldn't have done it,\" he said, adding that he had had \"second thoughts as soon as we left\" and understood why people were \"upset\". \n\"Leaving when so many Texans were hurting didn't feel right, and so I changed my return flight and flew back on the first available flight I could take,\" he said. \nThe Republican has now returned to Houston.\nAs a federal lawmaker, Mr Cruz does not have a direct role in Texas' emergency response, but residents often reach out to their elected officials - like Mr Cruz - during natural disasters for help accessing resources. \nThe senator's travel plans amid the crisis in Texas drew immediate criticism online. \n\"People in Texas are literally freezing to death and yet Ted Cruz went on vacation to Cancun,\" wrote Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal on Twitter. \n\"Ted Cruz not only fled the state while millions of vulnerable Texans are without heat and water but specifically diverted police resources to get him through security and crowds faster for his outgoing vacation flight,\" wrote progressive rights activist Charlotte Clymer on Twitter. \nSome criticised Mr Cruz for appearing to use his daughters to deflect blame. \nJournalist Leah Binkovitz appeared to mock the senator, writing on Twitter: \"I relate to Ted Cruz because my kids have also asked tough questions of me lately like, 'what happens if we run out of food and water'.\"\nThe chairman of the Republican Party in Texas, Allen West, said Mr Cruz \"has to answer to his constituents\" for the decisions he has made during the current winter weather crisis. \nBut some conservatives came to Mr Cruz's defence - author and activist Brigitte Gabriel wrote: \"Senator Ted Cruz is one of the hardest working men in the country, he deserves a vacation.\"\nMr Cruz's trip to Mexico also raised concerns among other parents whose children attend the same private school in Houston as his daughters.\nThe school's policy states that students who travel abroad cannot return to classrooms for seven days after returning home, the New York Times reported.\nIt adds that students must take a coronavirus test within three to five days of returning, which must then produce a negative result before they can return to classrooms. \nOthers suggested the added scrutiny may hurt Mr Cruz as he reportedly contemplates a second presidential bid in 2024. The lawmaker's current Senate term will expire in early 2025. \nAt least 47 storm-related deaths have been reported and hospitals have been placed under severe pressure.\nFood supplies in supermarkets are running low and residents are struggling to keep warm in some of the coldest temperatures the state has seen in more than 30 years - hitting 0F (-18C) earlier this week.\nTexas has opted out of the national power grids, and so has been particularly hard hit by the exceptional conditions. \nOutages are expected to continue for days. \nGovernor Greg Abbott has asked residents to shut off water to their home if possible to help keep pressure up amid concerns over the disruption in supply to hospitals.\nMr Cruz had been active on Twitter in recent days, sharing updates about power in the state. \nIn his Thursday statement, Mr Cruz said that his family had also lost heat and power, just like other Texans.\n\"The greatest state in the greatest country in the world has been without power,\" he said.

      "text": "A man has told how his \"heart sank\" when his wedding ring fell into a pile of rubbish at a tip on Valentine's Day.\nJames Ross was dropping off cardboard at North Shields recycling centre when it flew off his finger and disappeared 10ft (3m) into a container. \nIt was found \"caked in rubbish and grime\" by staff, who have been described as \"life savers\". \nMr Ross, 38, from Cullercoats, said his wife Lara, 40, thought he had made up an \"elaborate\" story.\nThe couple, who have two daughters, aged nine and five, have praised the staff for their heroics. \n\"It was a container where you push the rubbish through an opening,\" said Mr Ross.\n\"My hands were cold and, as I was shaking out the box, suddenly the ring was just gone. I don't know if it caught the edge of the box, but my heart just sank.\" \nAfter alerting staff, four workers went to help with the search on Sunday.\nMr Ross added: \"I was losing hope and dreaded the thought of going home to my wife on Valentine's Day and telling her my ring was lost. \n\"It wasn't what it cost - it was laser engraved with my wife's handwriting and the date we got married in 2009. It was irreplaceable.\n\"The team had to pull out a huge pile of rubbish and shove it all behind them and check it over and over again.\"\nThe team was said to be close to giving up when after 20 minutes, plant operator Jordan Cooper, 22, spotted it in a puddle of mud under a 10ft pile of waste.\n\"It was like looking for a needle in a haystack as there was a huge mound of waste to search through and we had the added difficulty of ensuring we kept our distance and followed the Covid guidelines,\" he said. \n\"We were just about to give up when I spotted it, I was over the moon.\"\nSite supervisor, Phil Cooper, was one of the four who went in to search for the ring alongside Adam McGregor and Brian Hellens.\nHe said: \"The lads were on their break when they shouted for us on the radio and asked us to shut down the machinery so we could enter the container and take a look.\n\"It was lying in a puddle of mud and was all scruffy. It looked like a washer at first glance but when you looked closely, it was all engraved inside and was obviously something very special. \n\"The guy was ecstatic when we handed back his ring. If it had fallen into a bag, it would have been gone.\"\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to northeastandcumbria@bbc.co.uk."

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Labour Party,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Millions of savers would be given a chance to invest in the UK's recovery from the coronavirus crisis, under proposals set out by Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe Labour leader's British Recovery Bond scheme is the centrepiece of his alternative plan for \"national recovery\", ahead of 3 March's Budget.\nHe also proposed start-up loans for 100,000 new small firms, especially in areas outside the South-East.\nThe Conservatives said Sir Keir had stolen most of his ideas from them.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak will set out the government's plans to haul the UK economy out of the deepest recession in 300 years in his Budget speech next month.\nBut Sir Keir said the Conservatives were \"incapable of seizing this moment\", adding: \"All we can expect from this government is more of the same. Labour would choose a different path.\"\nThe government said it has spent \u00a3280bn to help the economy through the pandemic, including tax breaks, grants and wage support for workers. \nBut Sir Keir told the BBC people would have to \"judge the government on its record\", with 10 years of \"weakening of our foundations, the pulling money out of our public services, the underfunding of the NHS and the failure to fix care homes\".\nIn an interview with the BBC's deputy political editor, Vicki Young, the Labour leader said: \"You can't clap your keyworkers during a pandemic, then go back to business as usual and that is where this government will head.\n\"The first step has to be a recovery and a thriving economy, and if you put taxes up or you go for austerity, you will throttle that [before] you have even got to first base.\"\n\"We have been through too much here and there is a parallel with [World War Two], where people have been through sacrifice and solidarity and they want a better future, and that is what I am setting out the path to.\"\nConservative Party co-chair Amanda Milling, accused Labour of stealing her party's policies, adding: \"After 10 months of Keir Starmer, all Labour has to offer is others' ideas, empty rhetoric and calling for things the government is already doing.\"\nThe main policy the Labour leader put forward was a British Recovery Bond.\nA Labour government would offer people a savings account with the government at a competitive interest rate - similar to the previous National Savings and Investments bonds.\nThe cash raised would then be spent on rebuilding the country post-Covid. \nIt comes off the back of figures from the Bank of England, which showed households had accumulated over \u00a3125bn in excess savings by November 2020 - estimated to hit \u00a3250bn by June 2021 - but with only around 5% of the savings expected to be spent, with much of the rest sitting in savings accounts. \nSir Keir said this money could be used to \"invest in local communities, jobs and businesses\", as well as providing security for savers and giving \"millions of people a proper stake in Britain's future\".\nThe Conservatives said the policy was the same as one proposed by the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, although that group's \"Northern Recovery Bond\" plan is not government policy. \nBut speaking to the BBC, Sir Keir said the chancellor was instead \"pinning a lot of hope on the idea that those who have saved during the pandemic... are going to spend all that money in the short term\".\nHe added: \"I don't think that is realistic and I don't think the Bank of England does. What the bond does is provide a way for people to invest in the future of their country in a secure way, and obviously then releases money for infrastructure projects.\"\nThe pandemic has blurred political lines over the last year.\nThe Conservatives have been forced to become big-spending big government.\nMeanwhile, Labour has been stuck between being criticised for being too supportive and, when it has been critical, being accused of carping from the sidelines.\nThe point of this speech was to take voters out of the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and remind them of the party politics of before.\nAlthough, of course, not exactly those politics, as this was also an opportunity for Sir Keir to address some of the pressure to start setting out his vision for Labour.\nSo, there was a promise of continuing with significant government intervention in the economy but also of financial responsibility and of making business \"pivotal\".\nThe big policy reveal of the speech -  British Recovery Bonds - neatly sums ups the aims Sir Keir set out of long-term investment, partnership and giving people a stake in society.\nBut it relies on those who have been left better off from the pandemic, rather than the many who have not. \nSaving bonds are also known for being pretty low risk.\nThe choice of this as a policy to unveil is unlikely to pacify those who would like to see Labour being more radical.\nSir Keir also proposed to provide an extra \u00a31bn of funding for the Start Up Loans Company, which provides finance for people wanting to launch their own businesses.\nThe Labour leader said the scheme had offered less than 9,500 loans per year since it started in 2012, with nearly \u00a31 in \u00a34 going into London - compared to just 5.7% going to the North East.\nSir Keir said targeting existing funding and tweaking the scheme would help to create 100,000 small businesses across the country.\nThe Labour leader also reiterated his party's calls for the government to:\nA Budget had been expected to take place in autumn last year, but it was delayed until next month because of the coronavirus pandemic. \nCovid restrictions have prompted the government to spend billions in unprecedented interventions aimed at keeping the economy afloat during the crisis.\nThis has pushed up UK debt to \u00a32.13 trillion, equivalent to 99.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. \nThe chancellor is under pressure from MPs and industry groups to extend support measures, but also to spell out when and how the UK's debts can be paid down.

This may not be done intentionally to cause upset, but that has been the effect on some individuals.\" \nHe resigned after Mr Johnson supported the home secretary, saying she retained his \"full confidence\".\nThe FDA, of which Sir Philip is a member, is seeking a judicial review of the prime minister's decision.\nIn a written submission, general secretary Dave Penman told the High Court that \"civil servants should expect to work with ministers without fear of being bullied or harassed\".\nMr Johnson's actions had \"fundamentally undermined\" the disciplinary process, he added, and the prime minister had \"misinterpreted\" the definition of bullying in the Ministerial Code.\nMr Penman said there was \"bewilderment, dismay and anger among our membership\" and there had been \"serious detrimental effects to workplace relations and confidence in the process for dealing with complaints against ministers\".\nHe added that, if Mr Johnson's decision was not \"corrected\" by the court, \"his interpretation of the Ministerial Code will result in that document failing to protect workplace standards across government\".\nFor Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Fleur Anderson said: \"Boris Johnson's assertion that Priti Patel did not break the Ministerial Code is not credible and shows why he should not act as both judge and jury. \n\"It is a sign of a broken system when a cabinet minister is found to have bullied their staff and the prime minister ignores the damning findings and protects them.\"\nCivil servants should have confidence \"that they are able to challenge ministerial decisions without fear for the consequences\", Ms Anderson added.\nA government spokesperson said: \"The prime minister has full confidence in the home secretary and considers this matter now closed. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further on live legal matters.\""

      "text": "Scotland's dental schools will not admit new students in September due to existing trainees having to repeat the academic year.\nIt was announced last week that dental students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience during the Covid pandemic. \nGraduations of final year students were postponed and all others were told they would have to repeat a year.\nUniversities Scotland said this would mean no new students this year.\nA spokesman said: \"Dentistry is an area which has been particularly badly hit by the Covid pandemic, due to the risk of spread of the virus via aerosol transmission. This has severely limited clinical training.\n\"All applicants who interviewed for September 2021 entry will still receive a final decision on their interview by 20th May 2021 but any offers made this year will be for a deferred start date of September 2022.  \n\"Our sympathies go out to these incoming students who, like so many people, are having their life plans severely disrupted.\"\nScotland's dental schools previously said students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) which can result in droplets being thrown into the air, creating the potential for Covid-19 to spread.\nAGPs, involving the use of high-speed instruments, represent the majority of dental treatments.\nGraduation for dental students at Dundee and Glasgow universities will be deferred until summer 2022 with all current year groups repeating the academic year.\nThe same will happen at Aberdeen but final year students will only be deferred until Christmas.\nSavanna Joyce, 28, from Orkney, is a final year dental student at the University of Aberdeen. \nHer graduation has been deferred until December - it's a decision she said she knew was coming.\nThe reality, however, was still overwhelming. \n\"Everybody in our year understands that patient safety is the priority, and despite being disheartened we all agree it's the right decision,\" she said. \nShe conceded that the dental school being closed \"did have quite an impact\" on learning, as practical work was not possible. \nAnd there had been a financial impact too - she ran out of money this year, and had to take on a job alongside her degree. \"Without the promise of support, I wouldn't have been able to stay on,\" she said. \nMs Joyce said: \"I wouldn't have felt safe going out this year. Covid has impacted us so much - we've had far less clinical experience so I'm glad that it's extended. \n\"We are all very accepting of the decisions,\" she added. \nThe British Dental Association Scotland had warned the lack of new students could lead to far more competition for training places.\nThey said it could translate into major problems for the NHS workforce that could be felt for years to come.\nDavid McColl, from the British Dental Association, said it would be very disappointing for people hoping to take up a place at dental school this year.\n\"What we said to the Scottish government was that we need to put something in place,\" he said.\n\"We just can't defer them for a year without them being included within dentistry in some shape or form.\n\"If they are keen we want to keep them involved in dentistry.\"\nAt Friday's lunchtime coronavirus briefing, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was an \"inevitable and pragmatic decision\" to extend the training programme of existing dental students.\nHe said: \"I am confident there will be the ability for new dental students to be able to secure places and to be able to take forward their dental training.\"\nMr Swinney said he would be discussing the issues with the dental schools and the British Dental Association."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to spend the weekend finalising his \"roadmap\" for easing Covid restrictions in England and opening up the economy.\nThe government is \"crunching the numbers\" ahead of Monday's announcement, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said.\nNew data is expected to suggest vaccines have cut transmission rates.\nBut Downing Street has refused to comment on the likely contents of the unlocking plan amid press speculation.\nThe prime minister has said his top priority will be the re-opening of schools.\nThe government has long planned to get all pupils in England back to the classroom on 8 March - but teachers' unions say the return may need to be \"staggered\" to allow for Covid testing.\nMinisters are also under pressure to re-open pubs, restaurants, shops and the tourism industry - but scientists are warning against a swift return to relative \"normality\".\nMr Cleverly told BBC Breakfast the prime minister would set out plans for easing restrictions \"in as much detail as he is able\" in his long-awaited \"roadmap\" statement to Parliament on Monday.\n\"But we cannot give guarantees, because that is not how viruses work,\" he added. \"Ultimately we want to open up society, the economy, as much as we are able, but only on the condition that it is safe to do so.\"\nMr Cleverly would not be drawn on whether the government could allow holidays to take place at home and abroad this summer, saying: \"We are assessing the numbers.\"\nThe devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds:\nBy Philippa Roxby, health reporter\nNow that more than 16 million of the UK's most vulnerable have been vaccinated, the next step is to find out the impact.\nLess than 10 weeks after the programme began, there are hints in data on over-80s in England that deaths in that age group are falling more quickly than in other age groups.\nThis was always the hope - that vaccines would prevent people dying and becoming seriously ill in the oldest first, reducing pressure on hospitals and protecting those most at risk.\nThe impact of vaccines on numbers infected may not change for a while yet though - that depends on how good the vaccines are at stopping the spread of the virus, which was always more uncertain, although the signs from early studies are promising.\nIn any case, lockdown restrictions appear to be having their own impact with infections falling every two weeks.\nWhen analysed alongside how hospitals are coping and figures on new variants, politicians will then have the difficult task of deciding on the path ahead.\nA further 12,057 Covid cases were reported across the UK on Thursday, down from a daily peak of more than 60,000 in January.\nAnother 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, from a high of more than 1,800 in January.\nAnd more than 17 million people in the UK have now received at least one dose of a Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines.\nBut concerns are high over the rapid spread, worldwide, of new coronavirus strains.\nThe Daily Telegraph is reporting that government figures - due to be published soon - will show the jabs have cut UK transmissions and infections by two thirds.\nProf Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the first English lockdown, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK could be \"a very different country\" by the end of May.\nHe added: \"We will still have rules in place but\u2026 I think society will be a lot more normal.\"\nProf Ferguson said two key bits of data - the infection rate and the effectiveness of vaccines - were \"looking promising\", but it would take \"quite a long time\" to assess the situation fully.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said it was still not clear what effect injections were having on overall coronavirus transmission.\nMost people immunised so far were \"elderly\", he said, and \"not mixing that much within the population\"."

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There has been a \"strong decline\" in levels of coronavirus infections in England since January, say scientists tracking the epidemic.\nImperial College London's React study found infections have dropped by two-thirds across England since lockdown began, with an 80% fall in London.\nBut virus levels are still high, with one in 200 testing positive between 4 and 13 February. \nThis is similar to levels seen in late September 2020.\nAlthough these are interim findings, based on more than 85,000 swab tests from randomly selected people, they suggest social distancing and restrictions are having an impact.\nProf Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial, said the drop in infection rates was \"really encouraging\". \nIt comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to receive new data on the effect of vaccines on the spread of coronavirus, ahead of Monday's publication of a roadmap for easing the lockdown in England.\nSpeaking on Wednesday he said it was \"absolutely right\" to take a \"data not dates\" approach to leaving lockdown, and stressed England would ease measures \"cautiously\".\nIn Northern Ireland, ministers have agreed to extend lockdown restrictions to 1 April, although children in primary 1 to primary 3 (aged four to seven) will go back to school on 8 March.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will make an announcement next week on whether some pupils will return to school.\nThe Welsh government is due to given an indication of its plans for coming out of lockdown on Friday.\nA further 12,057 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, and there have been another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Last Thursday, 13,494 cases and 678 deaths were reported.\nThe total number of people to have received the first dose of vaccine now stands at 16,423,082 - a daily rise of 482,110.\nAccording to the Imperial College London team, during early-to-mid-February 0.51% of people in the study tested positive in England, down from 1.57% in early January. In London, positive tests fell from 2.83% to 0.54% over six weeks.\nThe study's author Prof Steven Riley described the fall in cases in London as \"dramatic\" and said there had been \"a strong downward trend since January - better than many hoped for\", which is equivalent to a halving of infections every 15 days.\nThe researchers estimated the R number - the average number of people one infected person will pass the virus on to - was around 0.72.\nBut more than 20,000 Covid patients are currently in hospital in the UK, and although new daily cases and hospital admissions are falling, they are still relatively high.\nNHS England figures show 80% of critical care beds were occupied in the week to 14 February, a slight fall from 83% the week before.\nThere are just under 4,800 patients in critical care, with 6,000 beds available.\nProf Elliott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Nobody wants to be in lockdown any longer than they have to be but a note of warning - the prevalence rates are still very high. They are as high as they were in September when they were on the increase and the numbers of people in hospital currently are at a level that they were in the first wave so we really have to be cautious.\"\nWhile the virus is declining in all nine English regions, and substantially in the capital, South East and West Midlands, it is falling less steeply in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber.\nThis could be linked to tougher lockdown rules being introduced earlier in London and south-east England after a pre-Christmas surge in cases related to the more transmissible virus variant first discovered in Kent.\nThe latest Public Health England surveillance data also shows case rates have fallen in every region.\nThe East Midlands has the highest rate, 177 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 14 February, but this is down from 228 the previous week.\nThe React report found falls in infections across all age groups, with 18 to 24-year-olds and five to 12-year-olds currently having the highest virus levels - although still below 1%.\nIt estimates the over-65s have the lowest levels of virus at 0.3%.\nMore young children have been attending school during this lockdown than in the last one, which may have helped keep virus levels slightly higher in these age groups.\nBut the researchers stressed opening schools to all children was a high priority and there would have to be a \"trade-off\".\nDr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said in a tweet that the results of the React study made \"the strongest case for a phased reopening of schools\". \nA \"big bang\" reopening with the current high rates of infection and hospitalisation would \"jeopardise full and sustained school reopening\", she added.\nThe study identified groups that were more likely to test positive - including people of Asian ethnicity, those working in healthcare or care homes, people living in the most deprived areas and those in larger households.\nProf Elliott said the study had not seen an impact from the vaccination programme on infections yet, with all age groups seeing a drop in rates, but said the team would keep a \"close eye\" when it had an effect on transmission.\nThe researchers say signs may be visible by the time the final report is released in a matter of weeks, when a larger proportion of people will have been given protection.\nThe report is yet to be peer-reviewed or published.\nIn other developments:"

The firm is funding a marketing campaign, and is looking to sign up as many as 30,000 eligible drivers.\nA full-time driver over those six years could claim about \u00a325,000 in lost earnings, it added. The group action is aiming to bring a case to the High Court no later than the first quarter of 2022.\nThis is not the first time that London's black cabs have done battle with Uber, but today's announcement shows neither side have conceded defeat. \nThe proposed claim itself is huge - loss of earnings for up to 30,000 drivers for nearly 6 years -  and comes at a time when London black cabs and private hire vehicle drivers are struggling for work after nearly a year of lockdowns and restrictions.\nUber might now have its licence back, but the black cabs aren't willing to give them an easy ride.\nAn Uber spokeswoman said: \"Uber operates lawfully in London and these allegations are completely unfounded.\n\"We are proud to serve this great global city and the 45,000 drivers in London who rely on the app for earnings opportunities, and are committed to helping people move safely.\"\nUber has had a torrid history in the UK capital including previous lawsuits.\nIn February 2019 cab drivers lost a legal challenge which argued that Uber's London operating licence was granted by a biased judge.\nUber then went on to lose its licence to operate in London in November 2019 after safety concerns.\nBut in September last year it was spared a London ban after a judge upheld an appeal against Transport for London's decision over safety."

There is no point in [the UK's four chief medical officers] saying that 'we're writing this guidance all together' if the guidance doesn't adequately protect the people that are working on the front line day in and day out, and we believe it doesn't.\"\nOne of the organisations involved, the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, says its members routinely have to spend time close to Covid patients. \nChief executive Kamini Gadhok told BBC News: \"I'm shocked. I feel quite distraught from it all.\n\"People are dying - and there is this stonewalling in the context of this being a life-threatening virus.\n\"Not being heard for so long is incredibly distressing.\"\nIt's hard to keep track of the number of appeals and letters leading healthcare organisations have produced in their efforts to secure safer conditions.\nAnd it's not often seasoned health professionals end up in tears when talking about this.\nBut months of trying to persuade the powers that be to routinely allow a higher grade of personal protection equipment (PPE) for all staff dealing with Covid patients have got nowhere. \nOne result is an increasing sense among front-line staff of fear about the dangers they face, and of alienation from those deciding the policy on infection control.\nAnother is that all over the UK, there are growing numbers of hospitals and ambulance trusts quietly going their own way, providing better equipment regardless of the official guidelines.\nThere's a more fundamental point as well - with a division between those who insist the virus can be held at bay mainly by hand hygiene and droplet control, and those who look at the research into aerosols and judge enough is known to recognise a real risk.  \nInitially, the concern was many of the staff's tasks - assessing the ability to swallow, for example - were likely to cause coughs and therefore aerosols.\nBut as the pandemic unfolded, and more research emerged into how the virus could spread, a broader worry surfaced about being in poorly ventilated rooms for long periods protected by only a surgical mask. \nA government spokesman said the safety of NHS and social care staff is a priority and that because good ventilation can reduce the risk, there's guidance on it for businesses and health and care settings. \n\"The government will continue to closely monitor new and emerging evidence on airborne transmission, and update our advice where necessary,\" he said.\nGroups to have signed the letter include:"

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It's been a long and difficult seven weeks since Northern Ireland re-entered lockdown.\nPredictions of a post-Christmas surge in Covid-19 cases, increased hospital admissions and ultimately a rise in deaths, came true.\nRestrictions imposed by the executive to relieve pressures have been working and they'll be reviewed on Thursday.\nBut officials are again urging caution about how we exit lockdown.\nIt falls to the five parties that make up Stormont's power-sharing executive to decide whether to extend restrictions beyond 5 March, or begin the process of lifting them.\nFew on the hill believe lockdown can be eased before Easter, and Health Minister Robin Swann already hinted at that in a previous paper to his executive colleagues.\nThere are several reasons for this.\nOfficials say with St Patrick's Day and the Easter holidays around the corner, they don't want to prematurely allow more opportunities for people to mix, which would likely lead to another rise in cases.\nAt his weekly press briefing, Mr Swann said we \"must not let history repeat itself\", harking back to restrictions being eased for Christmas -  a decision,  he has since said, he regrets.\nMinisters also have to assess the latest Covid-19 statistics.\nNorthern Ireland has passed the peak of the third wave, but the number of people being treated in hospital for Covid-19 and those requiring intensive care remains high.\nThen look at Northern Ireland's reproduction (R) number, which measures how quickly the virus is spreading.\nAlthough it has fallen from a peak of about 1.9 last month, Mr Swann said it has now \"stabilised and stagnated\" at about 0.75-0.85 in the community.\nSo, while the spread of the virus has been decreasing, experts argue it is not yet close enough to last summer's levels, which allowed the executive to initially ease restrictions.\nThey want the R-number to drop even further, so that reopening can take place with infection levels starting from as low a base as possible.\nHowever, there's a recognition that lockdown cannot continue indefinitely, with the public having felt the effects of restrictions much more acutely this time.\nAs one Stormont source put it: \"We have to let the air out of the balloon - but it has to be managed.\"\nExpect to hear phrases like \"baby steps\" more often, as ministers try to maintain a careful balance between the health response and giving people hope.\nTheir new pathway to recovery paper is expected to be published in the coming weeks (we don't know when exactly), but again, it's unlikely to include any indicative dates.\nIt will be a gradual rather than total reopening, permitting one sector at a time and measuring its effects before moving to the next.\nMany businesses that have been shut for months may find their wait to reopen again getting longer, and the executive will have to consider extra financial support for those sectors being told to stay closed.\nThere are other new factors that ministers also have to weigh up while making their decisions.\nNI's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride raised eyebrows on Tuesday when he said some restrictions would likely be needed until 2022.\nBut it was what he said about new variants of coronavirus that will play into the politicians' thinking around relaxing the lockdown.\nIt's believed at least 50% of current Covid-19 cases in NI are related to the more transmissible variant that was detected in Kent before Christmas.\nDr McBride pointed out that Stormont has \"no experience\" of relaxing restrictions with a new variant present, and as long as the pandemic continues, more mutations are likely to emerge and hinder recovery from lockdown.\nNorthern Ireland is undoubtedly in a different place than last June, when the idea of having vaccines to combat Covid-19 seemed a far-off prospect.\nThe vaccination programme has been moving well, with more than 370,000 people in Northern Ireland having received their first jab.\nThere is an argument that as more vulnerable people are vaccinated, that should make it easier for restrictions to be lifted to allow some elements of pre-Covid life to resume.\nStormont ministers will take that on board, but they're likely to be advised that the effects of the programme have yet to be properly felt to allow a wider lifting of restrictions.\nMost schools in Northern Ireland are currently set to reopen on 8 March, in line with other parts of the UK.\nBut if the executive agrees to extend lockdown until Easter that could mean homeschooling and remote learning remain for longer too.\nOn Tuesday, Dr McBride said officials believe the effect of schools on the R-number is between 0.3-0.6.\nWhen it comes to keeping R below one, every little helps and that figure may give some ministers pause for thought.\nHowever, the executive previously said its top priority was to keep schools open, so perhaps it could agree to impose further safety mitigations or introduce a phased return for some key year groups.\nStormont's politicians are always keen to take a temperature check on the ground when deciding how to manage restrictions.\nThe previous rows within the executive about imposing restrictions, at a time when the Covid situation was deteriorating, drew widespread criticism.\nIn November, the DUP was left politically isolated when it twice deployed a cross-community veto to block an extension of restrictions.\nBut with a perception some people are running out of patience with the lockdown as things are improving again - could that influence some in the executive to now demand a faster reopening?\nWhatever happens, Stormont ministers are tasked with making decisions that have only got harder since the onset of the pandemic 11 months ago.\nHelping Northern Ireland navigate a way out of all this remains a bumpy ride.\nBBC News NI are keen to hear your questions about coronavirus following the executive meeting on Thursday to review restrictions.\nWe'll answer as many as possible with our reporter Jayne McCormack live at 19:00 on the BBC News NI website, iPlayer and BBC News NI Facebook Page.\nIf you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question on this topic.

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Coronavirus infections are continuing to decrease around the UK, Office for National Statistics data shows. \nThe figures, for the seven days up to 12 February, reveal fewer people are testing positive for the virus in the community than in recent weeks.\nExperts warn that infection levels remain high however, with about 553,000 people found to have the virus. \nAnd another 533 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.\nIt brings the UK total to 119,920. \nDaily figures show there were a further 12,027 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Friday. \nMore than 16.8 million people have had their first COVID vaccine dose, while 589,591 have had a second jab, bringing the total number of shots since the rollout began to nearly 17.5m.\nThe latest R number, estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.9, also suggests infection numbers are shrinking. It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 6 and 9 other people.\nOther studies of infection rates have shown a similar \"strong\" decline.\nThe ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest:\nIn England, there is some regional variation in the infection rate, although it is decreasing in all areas. \nNorth-west England had the highest proportion of people of any region in England likely to test positive for coronavirus - at around one in 85 people.\nFor London the estimate was one in 100, and for the West Midlands it was one in 110.\nElsewhere, the estimates are:\nIt comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to receive new data on the effect of vaccines on the spread of coronavirus, ahead of Monday's publication of a roadmap for easing the lockdown in England.\nDowning Street has refused to comment on the likely contents of the unlocking plan amid press speculation.\nThe Welsh government has already announced some changes. From Saturday, four people from two different households will be allowed to exercise outdoors together. And from Monday, children in Wales aged between three and seven are returning to school - as are young children in Scotland.\nExperts say any unlocking should be done slowly and cautiously to avoid a rebound surge in cases. There is still plenty of the virus circulating that people can catch. \nProf Neil Ferguson, whose modelling prompted the first lockdown last March, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was hopeful more restrictions could be lifted by the end of May. \n\"We will still have rules in place but... I think society will be a lot more normal.\"\nMeanwhile, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said it was wrong to speculate on whether summer holidays will be allowed this year: \"I get how frustrating this is, it's completely natural. We all want to get a break from this, I get that. But it would wrong for me to start speculating now.\n\"We are assessing the numbers, we are making a judgment based on the science and we will be making an announcement on Monday. I can't go further than that.\"\nA continued fall in new infections is one of the reassuring signs PM Boris Johnson will be considering this weekend, along with advisers, to decide if, when and how to start lifting some restrictions in England. \nR is below 1, even with more infectious variants of the virus circulating, which is good news too. \nBut within the wider UK figures there are some regional differences that are worth keeping an eye on. Infection rates appear to be higher in some urban areas of England, for example. \nLessons from last year tell us that the virus can take off again if you unlock too quickly or too soon. 'One size fits all' may not be the best approach for every type of easing, although a shared priority is to get children back to school. "

      "tags": "Mars,Nasa,Geology,European Space Agency,Nasa Perseverance Mars rover,Space exploration",
      "text": "The American space agency is expected to release new photos from its Perseverance rover shortly.\nThere was huge excitement at Nasa when its one-tonne robot touched down in Mars' Jezero Crater on Thursday.\nSatellites have since been flying over the ($2.7bn/\u00a31.9bn) vehicle to pull off data to relay back to Earth.\nAmong all this information should be further views from the rover - of its surroundings, and some pictures it took during the descent to the surface.\nPerseverance is sitting almost bang in the middle of its targeted landing zone, about 2km to the southeast of what remains of an ancient river delta that formed at the edge of a lake.\nEngineers were delighted to see that hazard-avoidance systems had steered the rover away from tricky terrain in the last moments before wheels down.\nThe coming days will be consumed by getting Perseverance properly commissioned. Nasa will want to check over the hardware to be sure nothing was damaged during what would have been a rough ride to the ground.\nPerseverance's mast, with its main camera system, must be raised. The software that got the vehicle to Mars's surface must also now be exchanged for a software system that enables the robot to drive across that surface.\nBut it's going to be the pictures that will enthral the public, of course.\n\"For the first time, we're going to see ourselves in high-definition video landing on another planet,\" said deputy project manager Matt Wallace.\n\"We think we've captured, hopefully, some pretty spectacular video. And they come with a microphone as well.\"\nThe Perseverance team was still revelling in the excitement of the landing hours after it had happened.\nSwati Mohan is the guidance, navigation and controls (GNC) operations lead on the project. She was given the honour of calling the rover down as the telemetry came back to Earth.\nShe told the BBC: \"I was so focused on what I needed to hear in order to know what I needed to say that it wasn't until after I called 'touchdown confirmed' and people started cheering that I realised, 'oh my gosh, we actually did this. We are actually on Mars. This is not a practice run. This is the real thing'.\"\nStrict coronavirus protocols mean Nasa is currently having to limit the number of people at its mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nGoing forward, this means that much of the management of the rover and its activities will be spread across other centres, and even in people's homes on their laptops.\n\"Normally, we would all be together in Pasadena, ready to dive right in, but it's been tough, you know, getting this mission going through the pandemic,\" explained Briony Horgan from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.\n\"But Nasa has done a fantastic job diverting resources to make it all happen. And on the science team, I think we've really learned how to work together remotely and that's going to be incredibly important in the months to come.\"\nOne near-term objective will be to run a helicopter experiment. Perseverance carried with it a mini-chopper that will attempt to make the first powered flight in another world - what might be described as a \"Wright Brothers moment\" for Mars.\nOnly after this will the robot get on with the serious business of its mission, which is to seek signs of past microbial life. It will head first to Jezero's ancient delta system.\nDeltas are built by rivers as they push out into a wider body of water and dump their sediment. Scientists are hoping that incorporated into the material that built Jezero's delta are the tell-tale signatures of ancient micro-organisms.\nPerseverance will sample the base of the delta and then move towards the rim of the crater. It's at the rim that satellites have detected carbonate rocks, which on Earth are particularly good at trapping biological activity.\nPerseverance has a suite of instruments that will examine all these formations in detail, down to the microscopic level.\nSample rocks displaying the rover's most intriguing findings will be deposited in small tubes that will be left on the floor of the crater. These will be picked up by later missions to be returned to Earth.\nClick here to see how Nasa and Esa will bring rocks from Mars to Earth."

      "tags": "UK Royal Family,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex",
      "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said.  \nThe Queen confirmed the couple would not \"continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service\".\nA statement from the palace added Prince Harry and Meghan \"remain much loved members of the family\".\nThe couple said \"service is universal\" and offered to continue supporting the organisations they have represented.\nThe duke and duchess said last January they would step back as \"senior\" royals and work to become financially independent. \nThe couple, who now live in California, formally stepped down in March, with a plan to review the arrangements after 12 months.\nThe confirmation means Prince Harry and Meghan will return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. \nUnder the arrangement agreed last year, the couple gave up using the HRH titles. But Harry retains the title of prince, having been born one.\nTheir departure follows conversations between Harry and members of the Royal Family.\nA statement from Buckingham Palace said: \"The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service. \n\"While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family.\"\nA spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: \"As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role.\"\nThey added: \"We can all live a life of service. Service is universal.\"\nThis could have been a formality - the end of the review period was coming up, it's very clear what the Sussexes' direction of travel is and equally clear that the patronages and appointments can't really be held on to from California. Thanks for your service, goodbye.\nBut instead the duelling statements - and their bizarre timing, with the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital - look as if there is a fair amount of bitterness remaining.\nThe statement from the palace lays down the Queen's philosophy; as far as she is concerned the couple have left the life of public service. That's why the honorary commands and patronages have to go. You can't do half in-half out.\nNot so fast, the couple shoot back. They remain, they say, \"committed to duty and service\" - and \"service\", far from being a matter of titles and roles, \"is universal\". There is more than a flash of anger in their words.\nLike all good family arguments it blows up at a sticky moment - Harry's grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh is in hospital.  So why now? One source says the story was all over the place already and would have been in the papers by the weekend. The suggestion: that one party is stampeding the other.\nAs to the meat of the announcement, the loss of the Captain Generalcy of the Royal Marines will sting. Harry's military life has defined him. \"Don't cock it up,\" Prince Philip told his grandson on the day he passed on the honorary command of the Marines. To yield it up now must be a heavy blow.\nSeveral of the duke and duchess's former patronages have thanked the couple for their support following the announcement.\nThe Queen's Commonwealth Trust - which was founded in 2018, with Harry and Meghan appointed president and vice-president respectively - said it was \"very lucky\" to have had their \"keen support and encouragement\" in its formative years. \n\"We are glad that they remain in our circle of supporters,\" the trust said in a statement. \nThe Association of Commonwealth Universities said Meghan had been \"a passionate advocate for our mission to build a better world through higher education\" since she took over the role of patron from the Queen in January 2019.  \nAnd the National Theatre, another of Meghan's patronages, said the duchess had \"championed\" its work with communities and young people across the UK to make theatre accessible to all. \nMeanwhile, the Rugby Football League thanked Harry \"for his time, care and commitment\" in supporting the organisation at all levels - from the children's game to the England teams. \nThe Rugby Football Union also thanked the duke for his work as patron and vice patron, adding that it had \"greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game\". \nHowever, the Invictus Games Foundation, which runs an international sporting event for injured servicemen and women, said Harry would remain a patron for the organisation.\nThe duke remained \"fully committed\" to the games, which he founded, it said in a statement. \n\"His military service and experience, combined with his genuine compassion and understanding for those who serve their countries, has raised awareness of wounded, injured and sick service personnel and the role they continue to play in society,\" the statement added. \nHarry will also continue to work with veterans' charity Walking With The Wounded as its expedition patron. \nSmart Works, a charity which helps women with clothes and coaching to get into work, and animal welfare charity Mayhew also said Meghan would remain a private patron. \nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex's military, Commonwealth and charitable association roles will be handed back to the Queen.\nFor Harry, those are:\nAnd for Meghan:\nBroadcaster and Royal Marines veteran JJ Chalmers, who is a friend of Prince Harry, said the duke's family remained \"his number one priority\" and suggested a desire to have \"an element of control\" was behind his decision to step back as a senior royal. \n\"So much of his life, particularly the way that it faces into the media, is out of his control... and any individual wants to try and take control of that,\" he told the BBC. \n\"I will continue to have the utmost respect for the service that he has given so far and I'm hopeful and optimistic that he will continue to serve in a greater purpose,\" he added. \nThe announcement comes days after the couple revealed they are expecting their second child.\nThey are due to talk about their decision to step away from the monarchy in a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey next month.\nSince stepping back from royal duties, they have also signed deals with streaming giants Netflix and Spotify.\nThe duchess recently won a High Court privacy battle against the Mail on Sunday over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.\nEarlier this month, Harry also successfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he \"turned his back\" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar",
      "text": "A young woman has become the first protester to die in the anti-coup demonstrations in Myanmar after she was shot in the head last week.\nMya Thwe Thwe Khaing was injured two days before her 20th birthday when police tried to disperse protesters.\nHer wound was consistent with one from live ammunition, rights groups said.\nAn image of the protester being cradled after she was shot was widely shared, and her death has triggered further anger against the authorities.\nMyanmar has seen days of protests following a military coup which overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government.\nThe police have denied using lethal force at the rally in the capital Nay Pyi Taw on 9 February, but doctors have said two other protesters were also struck by live rounds.\nThe hospital in the city confirmed the protester's death at 11:00 local time (04:30 GMT). A funeral service will be held on Sunday, her family said.\n\"I want to encourage all the citizens to join the protests until we can get rid of this system,\" her sister, Mya Tha Toe Nwe, told reporters. \"That's all I want to say.\"\nAuthorities said they would investigate the case.\nThe supermarket worker took part in the mass protest which saw police use water cannon against protesters who refused to retreat. Her brother had begged her not to join the demonstrations out of fear they could turn violent.\nMya Thwe Thwe Khaing travelled to the protest with her sisters from Yezin, a village north-east of the capital. Her brother warned her to stay at the back in case police started shooting. \n\"They wouldn't,\" she told him over the phone.\nVideo of the moment she was shot appeared to show her standing some distance from the police. She was placed on life support when she was taken to hospital and remained there until she died.\n\"We will look for justice and move forward,\" a doctor told AFP news agency, adding that staff had faced immense pressure since she was taken to their intensive care unit. \nMya Thwe Thwe Khaing's family are all supporters of Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD). Her brother said she voted for the first time in last November's general election, which the NLD won by a landslide. \n\"We are heartbroken and cannot talk about it much now,\" he told AFP on Friday.\n\"It was such a waste. I feel terribly sorry as if [she was] my own family,\" one woman told the BBC in Yangon. \"I also want democracy. [Only then] will her sacrificed life not be wasted.\"\nMya Thwe Thwe Khaing is the first martyr for what has grown into a nationwide civil disobedience campaign in Myanmar. Her image has become one of the defining motifs of an already visually rich and imaginative protest movement - it has been copied in paint and hung, on huge posters, from overpasses in Yangon. \nThe anger over her death is all the greater because it appeared so gratuitous; the police were not under serious pressure when they opened fire, and she was some distance from them, and appeared about to move back.\nHigh profile deaths have often been turning points for movements in other countries: the self-immolation of street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, setting off protests that led to the Arab Spring, or the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis.\nThe death of Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing may have less impact because the emotional pitch of the anti-military movement is already extraordinarily high, with outrage over the coup being expressed all over Myanmar.\nWhere it may already have had an impact is on the tactics of the security forces. Since her death they have largely avoided confrontations with the big rallies in Myanmar's cities, focussing instead on raiding neighbourhoods at night to try to arrest those involved in organising and funding the movement.\nThe current strategy of the military government appears to be to wait the protests out, rather than try to suppress them now, calculating that economic hardship and exhaustion will eventually drive people off the streets.\nMyanmar is in a year-long state of emergency after the military seized power. They claim the November election results were fraudulent but have not provided any evidence of that.\nPower has been handed to Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing. Ms Suu Kyi is under house arrest, accused of possessing illegal walkie-talkies and violating the country's Natural Disaster Law.\nProtesters are calling for her release, along with the release of other NLD members. The country is now seeing some of the largest demonstrations since the so-called Saffron Revolution in 2007, when thousands of the country's monks rose up against the military regime.\nClashes have taken place between security officers and protesters, and the military has also blocked the internet in a bid to stifle dissent. \nThousands of people gathered in the largest city, Yangon, on Friday for further demonstrations. Many wore uniforms to demonstrate that they were boycotting work.\n\"Don't go to the office!\" they chanted, according to AFP. \"Go strike! Go strike!\"\nThe mass protest marked two straight weeks of unrest in the country, but police have ramped up efforts to block the demonstrations.\nOfficers sealed off Yangon's main protest site on Friday, and set-up barricades at an intersection where a major protest was held the previous day.\nBut hundreds of people gathered at the barricades anyway, a witness told Reuters.\nElsewhere, video footage posted on social media showed clashes between police and protesters in Myitkyina in northern Kachin state."

      "text": "A group of MPs are calling for the case of a man who killed his wife in lockdown to be reviewed because of its \"unduly lenient\" five year sentence.\nLabour's Harriet Harman, Jess Phillips and Alex Davies-Jones have all written to the attorney general to look at Anthony Williams' case.\nWilliams, 70, was jailed for the manslaughter of his wife Ruth, 67, at their home in Cwmbran, Torfaen.\nHe admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility, saying \"I flipped out\".\nHowever, he was found not guilty of murder after a trial at Swansea Crown Court.\nAll three are asking the attorney general Suella Braverman for the case to be passed to England and Wales' most senior court, the Court of Appeal, and expressed concern about the use of Williams' depression in his defence against the more serious charge of murder.\nMs Harman, a former solicitor general and minister for justice, tweeted she would ask the attorney general to refer it to the Court of Appeal as an \"unduly lenient sentence\".\nThe former solicitor said she hoped it would lead to an increase in Williams' sentence and criticised what she said was a \"loophole\" in the law which allowed Williams' defence barrister to argue his depression was a defence against being convicted of murder.\n\"If he went out in the street and killed a neighbour, there would be no question of him facing a murder charge,\" she said.\n\"You get a discount for it being your wife and you get a discount for it being in her own home where she should feel safe.\"\nMeanwhile, Jess Phillips tweeted her support for Ms Harman, expressing concern that Williams may only serve half his sentence.\nThe MP for Birmingham Yardley said: \"We're looking at somebody serving around 18 months in prison when there is a woman who is dead.\n\"The areas in which I think this case needs to be examined are the difference between how men and women pleading such a defence of diminished responsibility are managed, and the way that plays out, specifically in cases of alleged domestic murder.\n\"I want some assurances as somebody who is always seeking to improve criminal justice outcomes for victims of domestic violence, about how this case was managed both by the courts, but also by the Crown Prosecution Service.\"\nPontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones, also wrote on Friday to the attorney general, urging her to intervene and refer the case to the Court of Appeal.\nIn the letter she posted on Twitter, she said she was \"horrified\" that  Williams was \"given such a lenient sentence at a time where so many are struggling with the mental strain of the pandemic\".\nShe wrote that the UK government's Domestic Abuse Bill was a \"landmark piece of legislation,\" but added: \"Sadly, there are cases such as Mr Williams' whereby the law is failing victims.\"\nShe added that she was worried the sentence could \"act as a catalyst\" and that \"we're going to see even more extremes happening, with perpetrators thinking they have an excuse or a cover\".\nMs Davies-Jones also said she was concerned that Ms Braverman is due to go on maternity leave this month, with the UK government yet to announce a replacement for her.\nDuring his Swansea Crown Court trial, the jury heard how Williams strangled his wife of 46 years after an argument on 28 March, days after the start of the first lockdown began.\nWilliams had not slept for several days after the start of restrictions in March because he was worrying over money, coronavirus and his health.\nA psychiatrist told the court the defendant's mental health had dramatically deteriorated after retiring in 2019, and the coronavirus pandemic had made things worse.\nNo evidence was heard during the trial that Williams had a history of domestic abuse.\nMrs Williams was found slumped in the porch of their home with keys in her hand - she was later pronounced dead at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport.\nWhile being driven to the police station, Williams told officers: \"It wasn't murder and I didn't mean to murder her.\n\"I just flipped, it wasn't me. I wouldn't hurt a fly, it wasn't me, I'm not like that and I don't know what came over me.\"\nAs he sentenced Williams, Judge Paul Thomas said: \"The overwhelming greatest tragedy is that a lady of 67 years who was in good health had her life ended at the hands of a man she had loved for nearly 50 years.\""

      "tags": "Nursing,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Nearly 20 major healthcare bodies are appealing to the PM for better personal protection against coronavirus.\nThey say at least 930 health and care workers have died of Covid-19 and more are experiencing long-term effects. \nIn a letter, they say measures to stop airborne spreading are \"inadequate\" and call for urgent improvement in masks and other defences against variants. \nThe government said it was monitoring evidence on airborne transmission and would update advice \"where necessary\".\nThe organisations involved represent a wide range of health professionals, from doctors and nurses to dieticians and physiotherapists. \nTheir approach to Downing Street follows repeated efforts to raise the issue with others in government.\nWith health and care workers at three to four times greater risk of becoming infected than the general public, the plea to Boris Johnson is to make an \"urgent intervention to prevent further loss of life\".\nIt says current policies focus on contaminated surfaces and droplets - for which the best defences are hand hygiene and social distancing - but not on airborne transmission by tiny infectious aerosols.\n\"There is now no scientific doubt,\" the letter states, \"that Covid-19 spreads via the airborne route.\"\n\"The evidence is clear - and lives continue to be put at risk.\"\nThe groups are demanding:\nDame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that nurses needed better protection when working with patients outside of intensive care units - such as in homes and open wards.\n\"While we've taken care of one area, people are unnecessarily exposed,\" she said.\n\"We need a different approach that recognises the evidence. There is no point in [the UK's four chief medical officers] saying that 'we're writing this guidance all together' if the guidance doesn't adequately protect the people that are working on the front line day in and day out, and we believe it doesn't.\"\nOne of the organisations involved, the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, says its members routinely have to spend time close to Covid patients. \nChief executive Kamini Gadhok told BBC News: \"I'm shocked. I feel quite distraught from it all.\n\"People are dying - and there is this stonewalling in the context of this being a life-threatening virus.\n\"Not being heard for so long is incredibly distressing.\"\nIt's hard to keep track of the number of appeals and letters leading healthcare organisations have produced in their efforts to secure safer conditions.\nAnd it's not often seasoned health professionals end up in tears when talking about this.\nBut months of trying to persuade the powers that be to routinely allow a higher grade of personal protection equipment (PPE) for all staff dealing with Covid patients have got nowhere. \nOne result is an increasing sense among front-line staff of fear about the dangers they face, and of alienation from those deciding the policy on infection control.\nAnother is that all over the UK, there are growing numbers of hospitals and ambulance trusts quietly going their own way, providing better equipment regardless of the official guidelines.\nThere's a more fundamental point as well - with a division between those who insist the virus can be held at bay mainly by hand hygiene and droplet control, and those who look at the research into aerosols and judge enough is known to recognise a real risk.  \nInitially, the concern was many of the staff's tasks - assessing the ability to swallow, for example - were likely to cause coughs and therefore aerosols.\nBut as the pandemic unfolded, and more research emerged into how the virus could spread, a broader worry surfaced about being in poorly ventilated rooms for long periods protected by only a surgical mask. \nA government spokesman said the safety of NHS and social care staff is a priority and that because good ventilation can reduce the risk, there's guidance on it for businesses and health and care settings. \n\"The government will continue to closely monitor new and emerging evidence on airborne transmission, and update our advice where necessary,\" he said.\nGroups to have signed the letter include:"

      "text": "WhatsApp is pushing ahead with controversial changes to its terms of service, but altering the way it notifies users following a backlash. \nAfter its first announcement in January, millions of users downloaded apps from WhatsApp's competitors.\nThe Facebook-owned platform previously said it had been the victim of \"misinformation\" around the change.\nBut WhatsApp now says it has \"reflected\" on how it could have explained the changes better.\nThe phrasing of the warning in the initial push led to widespread fears that it was going to share large amounts of WhatsApp data with Facebook. \nIn reality, very little had changed in that area - and almost all users had previously accepted the type of data sharing involved.\nAs part of its second attempt to convince users, WhatsApp will begin displaying a banner alert within the app in the coming weeks.\nIt encourages users to learn more about the update and what is - and is not - changing.\nMessages informing users of the update will also be displayed in the status section of the app.\nThe new terms are scheduled to come into effect on 15 May.\nWhatsApp says the data it shares with its parent company does not include messages, groups or call logs.  \nInstead, it says the new terms focus on changes to allow users to message businesses. \nWhatsApp already shares information with Facebook, such as your IP address and information about your phone, as well as purchases made via the platform. \nHowever this does not apply in Europe and the UK, where different privacy laws exist.  \nBut privacy experts say the saga highlights how unaware users are of how their data is being used.\n\"In its efforts to clarify that [it] isn't doing anything wrong, Whatsapp has in fact inadvertently highlighted that it was already harvesting huge amounts of data for Facebook,\" said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy.\nThat \"vindicates\" those who decided to leave Whatsapp, he said.\n\"The biggest takeaway from all of this is that Whatsapp was already harvesting device level identifiers, IP addresses, and purchase info on behalf of Facebook - and that until recent media attention, the general public was largely unaware.\"\nWhatsapp said it had \"reflected on what we could have done better here\".\n\u201cWe want everyone to know our history of defending end-to-end encryption, and trust we\u2019re committed to protecting people\u2019s privacy and security.\"\nIt also said it will \"be doing much more\" to be clear about changes in the future.\nIn January, government officials in India asked the messaging giant to withdraw its planned changes. \nThe country is currently WhatsApp's largest market with more than 340 million users.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "There has been a \"strong decline\" in levels of coronavirus infections in England since January, say scientists tracking the epidemic.\nImperial College London's React study found infections have dropped by two-thirds across England since lockdown began, with an 80% fall in London.\nBut virus levels are still high, with one in 200 testing positive between 4 and 13 February. \nThis is similar to levels seen in late September 2020.\nAlthough these are interim findings, based on more than 85,000 swab tests from randomly selected people, they suggest social distancing and restrictions are having an impact.\nProf Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial, said the drop in infection rates was \"really encouraging\". \nIt comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to receive new data on the effect of vaccines on the spread of coronavirus, ahead of Monday's publication of a roadmap for easing the lockdown in England.\nSpeaking on Wednesday he said it was \"absolutely right\" to take a \"data not dates\" approach to leaving lockdown, and stressed England would ease measures \"cautiously\".\nIn Northern Ireland, ministers have agreed to extend lockdown restrictions to 1 April, although children in primary 1 to primary 3 (aged four to seven) will go back to school on 8 March.\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will make an announcement next week on whether some pupils will return to school.\nThe Welsh government is due to given an indication of its plans for coming out of lockdown on Friday.\nA further 12,057 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, and there have been another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Last Thursday, 13,494 cases and 678 deaths were reported.\nThe total number of people to have received the first dose of vaccine now stands at 16,423,082 - a daily rise of 482,110.\nAccording to the Imperial College London team, during early-to-mid-February 0.51% of people in the study tested positive in England, down from 1.57% in early January. In London, positive tests fell from 2.83% to 0.54% over six weeks.\nThe study's author Prof Steven Riley described the fall in cases in London as \"dramatic\" and said there had been \"a strong downward trend since January - better than many hoped for\", which is equivalent to a halving of infections every 15 days.\nThe researchers estimated the R number - the average number of people one infected person will pass the virus on to - was around 0.72.\nBut more than 20,000 Covid patients are currently in hospital in the UK, and although new daily cases and hospital admissions are falling, they are still relatively high.\nNHS England figures show 80% of critical care beds were occupied in the week to 14 February, a slight fall from 83% the week before.\nThere are just under 4,800 patients in critical care, with 6,000 beds available.\nProf Elliott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Nobody wants to be in lockdown any longer than they have to be but a note of warning - the prevalence rates are still very high. They are as high as they were in September when they were on the increase and the numbers of people in hospital currently are at a level that they were in the first wave so we really have to be cautious.\"\nWhile the virus is declining in all nine English regions, and substantially in the capital, South East and West Midlands, it is falling less steeply in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber.\nThis could be linked to tougher lockdown rules being introduced earlier in London and south-east England after a pre-Christmas surge in cases related to the more transmissible virus variant first discovered in Kent.\nThe latest Public Health England surveillance data also shows case rates have fallen in every region.\nThe East Midlands has the highest rate, 177 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 14 February, but this is down from 228 the previous week.\nThe React report found falls in infections across all age groups, with 18 to 24-year-olds and five to 12-year-olds currently having the highest virus levels - although still below 1%.\nIt estimates the over-65s have the lowest levels of virus at 0.3%.\nMore young children have been attending school during this lockdown than in the last one, which may have helped keep virus levels slightly higher in these age groups.\nBut the researchers stressed opening schools to all children was a high priority and there would have to be a \"trade-off\".\nDr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said in a tweet that the results of the React study made \"the strongest case for a phased reopening of schools\". \nA \"big bang\" reopening with the current high rates of infection and hospitalisation would \"jeopardise full and sustained school reopening\", she added.\nThe study identified groups that were more likely to test positive - including people of Asian ethnicity, those working in healthcare or care homes, people living in the most deprived areas and those in larger households.\nProf Elliott said the study had not seen an impact from the vaccination programme on infections yet, with all age groups seeing a drop in rates, but said the team would keep a \"close eye\" when it had an effect on transmission.\nThe researchers say signs may be visible by the time the final report is released in a matter of weeks, when a larger proportion of people will have been given protection.\nThe report is yet to be peer-reviewed or published.\nIn other developments:"

      "tags": "UK press regulation,Media,Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee,Facebook,Julian Knight,Social media regulation debate",
      "text": "Facebook's decision to block news content from its platform in Australia was \"bullying\" and \"staggeringly irresponsible\", the chairman of the Commons media committee has said.\nConservative MP Julian Knight told the BBC the move represented \"the worst type of corporate culture\", coming in the middle of the Covid pandemic.\nFacebook was responding to a proposed law requiring it pay for news content.\nThe UK News Media Association said stricter regulation might be required.\nAustralians on Thursday woke up to find that Facebook pages of all local and global news sites were unavailable. People outside the country are also unable to read or access any Australian news publications on the platform.\nFacebook says the proposed legislation \"fundamentally misunderstands\" the relationship between the platform and publishers, adding that its commitment to combat misinformation had not changed.\nMr Knight, who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media & Sport Select Committee, told Radio 4's PM programme it was a \"crass move\" by the company.\nHe said: \"I think it's staggeringly irresponsible - at a time when we are facing a plethora of fake news and disinformation in relation to the Covid vaccine.\"\nMr Knight added: \"This is not just about Australia. This is Facebook putting a marker down, saying to the world that 'if you do wish to limit our powers\u2026 we can remove what is for many people a utility.'\"\nHe said the events highlighted the need for competition rules to apply to social media firms in the UK, adding: \"The problem that I see is... that these platforms make enormous sums of money, and they make them from other people's work, and they aren't returning any equitable value to those people.\" \nSearch giant Google is also opposed to the Australian law, but it has in recent days signed payment deals with major media outlets in the country.\nIn the UK, Facebook has agreed partnership deals with publishers including the Daily Mail Group, Financial Times, the Guardian, Sky News and Telegraph Media Group. And the Competition and Markets Authority has announced it will enforce a new code aimed at preventing tech firms from abusing their market dominance over advertising.\nBut in a statement, Henry Faure Walker, chairman of the News Media Association which represents UK media organisations, echoed Mr Knight's comments, describing Facebook's ban as \"a classic example of a monopoly power being the school yard bully, trying to protect its dominant position with scant regard for the citizens and customers it supposedly serves\".\nHe said: \"Facebook's actions in Australia demonstrate precisely why we need jurisdictions across the globe, including the UK, to coordinate to deliver robust regulation to create a truly level playing field between the tech giants and news publishers.\"  \nThe Guardian Media Group also said it was deeply concerned by Facebook's move \"at a time when facts and clarity are sorely needed\".\nA spokesman for the company said: \"Dominant online platforms are now a key gateway to news and information online. \n\"We believe that public interest journalism should be as widely available as possible in order to have a healthy functioning democracy.\""

      "title": "Covax: How many Covid vaccines have the US and the other G7 countries pledged?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The US has pledged to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to poorer nations from next year - bringing its total commitment to more than one billion.\n\"To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,\" US President Joe Biden told a virtual Covid-19 summit.\nThe donation will be routed through Covax - the international scheme designed to ensure low-income countries aren't left behind in the fight against Covid.\nIt came amid growing warnings over the pace of global vaccinations, and inequity of access.\nCovax was created last year to ensure that Covid vaccines are made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations.\nThe scheme hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the population in 92 low- or medium-income countries - starting with healthcare workers and the most vulnerable groups.\nIts initial goal was to provide two billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 poorer countries by early 2022. \nCovax is run by a number of international organisations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's charity, Unicef. \nGhana was the first country to receive Covax vaccines in February. \nSince then, more than 303 million doses have been shipped through Covax to 142 countries around the world, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Fiji. \nMost doses are going to poorer countries, but some have been sent to wealthier countries such as Canada, which defended its request.\nCovax works with with governments and vaccine manufacturers around the world. Supporters include the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UAE, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Portugal.  \nCountries have pledged to donate both money and surplus doses from their own vaccine supplies.\nThe UK, Japan, Canada and the European Union are among those to have committed to supplying tens of millions of doses.\nWHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously criticised wealthier nations for \"gobbling up\" the global vaccine supply. \nG7 countries have purchased over a third of the world's vaccine supply, despite making up only 13% of the global population.\nSix vaccines have been given \"emergency use authorisation\" by the WHO, meaning they can be shared via Covax: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and Sinovac.\nHowever, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses have been delivered so far. \nModerna has agreed to supply 500 million doses at its \"lowest-tiered price\", but most won't be available until 2022. \nCovax has been criticised for being slow. Some initial targets were missed, partly as a result of the poor health infrastructure in many of the recipient countries, and partly because of vaccine hesitancy. \nDeliveries were also delayed because of the deteriorating situation in India. Officials there restricted exports to protect their own population amid soaring infection rates. These are set to resume from October. \nCovax has told the BBC that too many donations have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. This makes it very hard to get them to where they are needed. \nRepresentatives of the scheme also note that only a small percentage of the pledges made earlier this year have turned into actual doses. \nUnicef executive director Henrietta Fore said countries needed to \"accelerate their donation plans\", with low-income nations unable to wait any longer. \nWhile many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford.\nCovax says it is now expecting to hit its \"key milestone\" of releasing two billion doses for delivery some time early next year. \nIn total, some six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 195 countries worldwide.\nHowever, while some countries have fully vaccinated a large amount of their population, many others have only just begun, or in some cases are still waiting for their first doses to arrive.\nCovax aims to close that gap. \"With a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe,\" the WHO says on its website. \nBut even if Covax meets its goal to vaccinate 20% of the population in its 92 target countries, that's well short of the level of immunity that experts say is needed to end the pandemic.\nThe WHO has suggested that figure is at least 70%. People may also need booster doses to remain protected. "

      "text": "Lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended until 1 April, the Stormont Executive has agreed.\nBut children in primary 1 to primary 3 (aged four to seven) will go back to school in Northern Ireland on 8 March.\nThey will then resume remote learning on 22 March to enable the return of years 12 to 14, until the start of the Easter holidays.\nHealth officials have said they want to avoid a possible rise in cases around St Patrick's Day on 17 March.\nThe restrictions were imposed on 26 December to manage the spread of Covid-19.\nAnother review of the measures will take place on 18 March. \nFirst Minister Arlene Foster said Northern Ireland knew \"from experience what looks like success is hard-won, but also fragile\".\n\"We need decisions to be safe and sustainable, with a proper sequencing of actions.\"\nThe executive will publish its pathway-to-recovery blueprint for Northern Ireland on 1 March, she said.\nIt is not expected to include indicative reopening dates and Mrs Foster said she would be focused on \"data, not dates\".\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to receive new data on the effect of vaccines on the spread of coronavirus, ahead of Monday's publication of a roadmap for easing the lockdown in England.\nMrs Foster also said the executive was concerned about a growing prevalence of the more transmissible Kent variant of coronavirus, telling a press conference that up to 70% of cases in Northern Ireland are now linked to it.\nA further six Covid-19 linked deaths and 342 new cases were reported on Thursday by Northern Ireland's health department, bringing its death toll to 2,021.\nThis decision will not exactly come as a surprise.\nWhile the rate of infection continues falling, the numbers remain higher than when restrictions were initially eased after the first lockdown.\nThe executive unanimously backed Health Minister Robin Swann's proposal and it's clear the parties all agree (for now), that any reopening will have to be careful and gradual.  \nIf the measures do end up staying in place until 1 April, that means NI will have been in lockdown for 14 weeks in total - a high price paid for Christmas easing.\nMinisters are also urging people not to get ahead of themselves when it comes to Easter yet, though it's not clear why restrictions weren't extended over Easter weekend.\nThe key message from Stormont remains that the fight to suppress coronavirus must continue, with hope for a way out starting later in the Spring.\nCarers aged 50 and over can now book the Covid-19 vaccine at a regional vaccination centre after the scheme was again extended.\nOn Thursday, Health Minister Robin Swann said he hoped to expand Northern Ireland's vaccine programme to carers of all ages soon.\nEarlier this week he announced that carers aged 60 to 64 and more people with underlying health conditions would be included in the programme. \nThe executive also agreed to a proposal from Education Minister Peter Weir at Thursday's executive meeting, allowing for a phased return of schools.\nPre-school and nursery children and pupils in primary 1 to 3 will return to school for two weeks from 8 March.\nThese children will then return to remote learning from 22 March until the Easter break.\nThe executive says this is to ensure that two large cohorts are not back in school together before Easter.\nStudents doing qualifications like GCSEs, AS, A-levels (in years 12 to 14) and other vocational qualifications will return to face-to-face teaching from 22 March.\nIt is planned that pre-school, nursery and primary schools pupils in primary 1 to 3 will then return to full-time face-to-face teaching after the Easter holidays, along with years 12-14.\nMrs Foster said the intention was to get all pupils back to school as soon as is achievable, after Easter, with the option of a separate phased return for primary 4 to primary 7 pupils and the remaining non-qualification years of post-primary.\nThe aim is \"dependent on the health situation at the time\", Mrs Foster added.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Michael Allen, principal of Lisneal College in Londonderry, welcomed the announcement but said planning was needed.\n\"We need to make sure that the examination boards, particularly the CCEA, that their timing is perfectly aligned with the pupils returning on the 22nd,\" he said. \n\"Otherwise you have a real risk that you have 30 year 12 to year 14 pupils in every class staring at the teacher not knowing what to do and teachers staring back still none the wiser in terms of  the evidence required for the centre determined grade.\"\nTullygally Primary School principal, Kirsty Andrews, said the logistics would be difficult for schools.\n\"I don't like the idea of it being only two weeks then out again, back to remote learning - we all know the children need to be back in school for face-to-face teaching,\" she said.\nStormont ministers have also agreed slight changes to click-and-collect services for some retailers.\nThose services will resume from 8 March for baby equipment shops, clothing shops, footwear shops and electrical goods shops. \nFrom that date, the number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a public space will increase to 10 people from two households.\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy said he did not want the executive to cause \"confusion\" over whether people can meet up during the Easter holidays, which begin on 2 April.\n\"The advice would be not to be booking anything for Easter weekend, but there will be a review - I think the way the advice has been given today shows it's a gradual pace, there's no rapid reduction,\" he said.\n\"This is going to be a more slow re-entry into normal life, this side of Easter there won't be any reopening into normal life.\"\nEconomy Minister Diane Dodds tweeted that she was hopeful of a \"safe and sustainable\" reopening of sectors.\nThe chief executives of Hospitality Ulster, Belfast Chamber, Londonderry Chamber of Commerce and Retail NI described the changes to click-and-collect services as \"positive steps\".\nBut they warned that the impact of repeated lockdowns would be \"severe and long-standing\". \nIt came in response to a large spike in the number of coronavirus cases, which followed a relaxation of some rules in the run-up to Christmas.\nThe restrictions have meant non-essential retailers have been closed, family gatherings have been prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons.\nIt was initially imposed for six weeks but on 21 January ministers reviewed the measures and extended them until 5 March at the earliest.\nMeanwhile, latest figures from Stormont's Department of Health show 427,569 people have received their first coronavirus vaccine in Northern Ireland.\nSome 30,012 have received both their first and second."

      "text": "Nasa's Perseverance rover is sitting on the surface of Mars after a journey from Earth of almost seven months. Here, we answer some common questions about the mission.\nThe Perseverance rover touched down on the Martian surface at 20:55 GMT (15:55 ET) on Thursday 18 February 2021. \nThe robot is designed to hunt for signs of past microbial life, if it ever existed. It is the first Nasa mission to hunt directly for these \"biosignatures\" since the Viking missions in the 1970s. \nThe rover will collect samples of rock and soil, encase them in tubes, and leave them on the planet's surface to be returned to Earth at a future date. Perseverance will also study the Red Planet's geology and test how astronauts on future Mars missions could produce oxygen from CO2 in the atmosphere. This oxygen could be used for breathing and rocket propellant.\nIn addition, a drone-like helicopter will be deployed to demonstrate the first powered flight on Mars. Perseverance will explore Jezero Crater, near the planet's equator, for at least one Martian year (about 687 Earth days).\nPerseverance was launched on 30 July 2020 from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The one-tonne, car-sized rover travelled through space enclosed in a protective aeroshell consisting of two parts: a conical backshell and a heat shield. \nThe aeroshell was connected to a cruise stage that fired thrusters to keep the spacecraft on course, ensuring it arrived at Mars in the right place for landing. \nAfter a 470-million-km journey from Earth, the spacecraft ploughed through the Martian atmosphere. During this stage, its heat shield had to endure temperatures as high as 2,100C (3,800F). \nWhen it was about 11km (7mi) above the ground, the spacecraft deployed a parachute, slowing the heaviest payload in the history of Mars exploration from a speed of Mach 1.7 (2,099 km/h; 1,304 mph) to about 320 km/h (200 mph).\nThe heat shield subsequently dropped away from the backshell and, for a short time, the rover - which was attached to a descent stage - fell freely towards the ground.\nEight retrorockets on the descent stage then fired, allowing the \"sky crane\" manoeuvre to be performed. Perseverance was lowered slowly on three nylon ropes and an \"umbilical cord\". When the rover's wheels touched the ground, the tethers were severed and the descent stage flew to a safe distance.\nThe rover's landing site, Jezero Crater, is a 49km (30 mi) -wide impact depression just north of Mars' equator. More than 3.5 billion years ago, scientists think, river channels spilled over the wall of Jezero to form a lake. \nThe large bowl is also home to one of the best preserved Martian examples of a delta, a sedimentary structure that forms when rivers enter open bodies of water and deposit rocks, sand and - potentially - organic carbon in layers. \nMicrobes could have lived in the crater when water was there. Jezero preserves a record of important geological processes such as impact cratering and volcanism, as well as the action of water. Studying its rocks will shed light on how the planet evolved over time.\nJezero's fan-shaped delta is one of the prime targets in the hunt for signs of past life. Scientists also see carbonate minerals deposited around the crater's shoreline like the ring in a bathtub. When carbonates precipitate out of water, they can trap things that are in it, including evidence of life.\n\"We'll be searching for biosignatures - patterns, textures or substances that require the influence of life to form,\" says deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan. \nWe don't know what Martian biosignatures might look like, but the ancient Earth might provide clues. A record of our planet's early life can be found in stromatolites, rocks originally formed by the growth of layer after layer of bacteria. If similar structures exist on Mars, scientists could combine measurements from different instruments to assess the likelihood of a biological origin.\nToday, Mars is cold and dry, with a thin atmosphere that exposes the surface to harmful levels of cosmic radiation. But billions of years ago, the planet appears to have been wetter, with a thicker atmosphere. Multiple lines of evidence, such as the presence of mudstones and sedimentary bands, show that there was once liquid water on the surface. \nThis is important because water is an essential ingredient for all life on Earth. Curiosity also found organic molecules preserved in sedimentary rocks three billion years old. While tantalising, it's not clear whether these organics preserve a record of ancient life, were their food, or have nothing to do with biological processes.\nPerseverance is carrying an advanced payload of science instruments to gather information about Mars' geology, atmosphere, environmental conditions and potential biosignatures:\nIngenuity is a 1.8kg (4lb) helicopter that will ride to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance. Nasa wants to demonstrate powered flight in Mars' thin atmosphere. The Red Planet's gravity is lower (about one-third that of Earth's), but its atmosphere is just 1% the density of Earth's. This makes it harder to generate the lift required to get off the ground. \nEquipped with two counter-rotating blades, the autonomous helicopter can take colour images with a 13-megapixel camera, the same type commonly found in smartphones. Rotorcraft could be a useful way to explore other worlds: flying vehicles travel faster than ground-based rovers, and can reach areas that are inaccessible to wheeled vehicles.\nPerseverance is very similar to its predecessor Curiosity in terms of overall design, but there are key differences. As well as the new science payload, Perseverance has a larger \"hand\", or turret, on the end of its robotic arm to hold a heavier suite of tools, including a coring drill. \nThe system designed to cache samples is also a new feature. Engineers have re-designed the rover's wheels to make them more resistant to wear and tear. Curiosity's wheels sustained damage from driving over sharp, pointed rocks.\nThe rover's Sample Caching System is composed of three robotic elements. The most visible is the 2.1m (7ft) -long, five-jointed robotic arm, which is bolted to the chassis. A rotary percussive drill on the arm's turret is able to cut out intact cores of Martian rock. These cores - about the size of a piece of chalk - go into a sample tube. The main robot arm then places the filled tube on a mechanism at the front of the rover called the bit carousel.\nThis mechanism, which recalls a 1960s slide projector, moves the tube inside the rover where a smaller, 0.5m (1.6ft) -long sample handling arm (also called the T. rex arm) grabs it. An image is taken before the tube is hermetically sealed and placed in a storage rack. It's driven around on the rover until the team finds a suitable place to drop it off.\nFor decades, scientists have wanted to deliver samples of Martian rock and soil to Earth for study in laboratories. Here, scientists could investigate the samples with instruments too large and complex to send to Mars. By leaving rock and soil samples on the surface in sealed tubes, Perseverance will lay the groundwork for that to happen. \nAs part of the programme known as Mars Sample Return, a separate mission will be sent to land on Mars to pick up the tubes using a \"fetch\" rover. A robotic arm will then transfer the tubes from the fetch rover into a rocket called the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The ascent vehicle blasts the samples into Martian orbit where they are captured by an orbiter. This orbiter will then deliver the sample containers to Earth, possibly by 2031. \nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "tags": "NHS Wales,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Wales is on the road out of lockdown, but what signs do we need to keep looking out for?\nThe Welsh government is allowing up to six people from six households to meet and for pubs to open outdoors after encouraging falls in case rates.\nIt followed earlier announcements of opening up travel within the UK from 12 April, the lifting of the \"stay local\" rules within Wales and tourist accommodation starting to reopen.\nScientists and health officials have been looking carefully at a number of key indicators, dubbed \"circuit breakers\".\nAny changes proposed by the Welsh government to lockdown rules after 6 May could be dependent on the outcome of the Senedd election.\nHere are a few of the main factors to keep an eye on:\nCase rates can tell us how many people with Covid-19 symptoms are presenting themselves for tests which then come back positive.\nIt looks back at the most recent week of stable data, after most test results have come back.\nIt's only a snapshot of the virus as it relies on people asking for a test - and there is a recognition that some may be reluctant to do so. Others may have the virus and not know it, as they are asymptomatic.\nBut since the summer, when tests were fully available to anyone who thought they might have Covid, it has been a good measure to look at how the virus is spreading and affecting different parts of Wales.\nThe case rate in Wales as a whole was, for a period in December, among the highest in the world. But it has been falling since January.\nFor three months, Wales has been below the other UK nations and is now at its lowest point since 1 September.\nIt has been below 50 cases per 100,000 - the case rate threshold - since 1 March. Above this has been used as the \"trigger\" figure for bringing in restrictions.\nAll of Wales' 22 council areas have had fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 since 1 April.\nNewport has the highest case rate in Wales but only 25 cases per 100,000. Merthyr and Bridgend had the highest case rates in the UK in December - but both are now in single figures.\nWhen we break down areas of Wales into smaller communities - 91% have had fewer than three Covid cases in the past week.\nThese are so-called middle-layer super output areas, which have an average population of 7,000, so cover villages and districts of towns and cities.\nEven comparatively small spikes in cases show up when numbers are otherwise low, but only three out of more than 400 of these communities have case rates above 100 per 100,000.\nAn outbreak linked to a Gwynedd cake factory is a reminder that local clusters and spikes can emerge, even when case rates are low elsewhere.\nAs restrictions ease, we might expect to see more cases like this but scientific advisers say this is only likely to result in \"manageable levels\" of Covid in Wales.\nThey also hope as more younger groups take up the vaccine, this could also have an impact on transmission.\nThis is the proportion of people who get a test who come back positive for Covid.\nPut simply, the World Health Organization suggests areas need to see a 5% positivity rate or below for a couple of weeks before restrictions are lifted.\nWales as a whole had a positivity rate of 1.3%, the lowest point since 1 September - and it has been below this threshold for nearly two months.\nAll council areas are now in single figures and within the target. \nAt the end of December and into January, we saw record numbers of patients with Covid-19 in hospital beds. \nThere were also large numbers of \"recovering\" patients - those still sick with the effects of the virus, in rehabilitation or waiting for care support to be available - so unable to be discharged. These still make up a large proportion of Covid patients.\nBut numbers have fallen quite dramatically - with confirmed and suspected Covid patients earlier this week in double figures across Wales for the first time.\nOnly 93 confirmed and suspected Covid patients were in hospital beds on Sunday, according to the latest NHS Wales figures.\nThere was more good news to end the week, with record low Covid admissions - and only nine across the whole of Wales on Thursday,\nCritically ill patients with Covid were also at a record low with just two patients across the whole of Wales.\nThere were none at all in the Aneurin Bevan health board for two weeks and no Covid patients in critical care in Cwm Taf Morgannwg hospitals for 11 days.\nThe most reliable figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show Covid-19 is no longer the leading cause of death in Wales.\nTwo thirds of communities across Wales experienced no deaths due to Covid at all in March.\nMore than half of council areas in Wales had no Covid deaths registered in the latest week.\nThe severity of the pandemic's second wave can be seen in December and January. The peak came on 11 January, when there were 83 deaths.\nPublic Health Wales, which provides a daily snapshot of deaths from confirmed Covid-19 cases, also indicates a fall.\nThe daily average is 0.7 deaths a day and for 10 days in the last month, no deaths occurred. At the peak under this measure in January, the average daily deaths reached 47.\nAnother snapshot of the virus's progress is the ongoing ONS swab survey. \nSince the summer, thousands of people in Wales have been asked to take a throat and nose swab. This can pick up people who don't even know they have the virus but who may still be unwittingly spreading it.\nThe latest survey estimates 1,900 in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 24 April, another decrease.\nThis is one in 1,570 people - or 0.06%. This compares to one in 840 people in the previous week.\nThis positivity rate estimate is lower than in the other UK nations.\nMeanwhile, we can also look at how many people are consulting their GP with suspected Covid symptoms. That too has fallen to numbers not seen since the summer.\nThe R number - the transmission rate - which is calculated using several of these key factors has been looked at for months, especially when case numbers for high.\nCurrently it is within a range estimated at between 0.7 to 1 for Wales. But with low numbers it is becoming a less reliable tool and scientists say looking at incidence and prevalence is now more useful.\nThese estimates are included in the most recent report from the Welsh government's scientific advisory group.\nOne spanner in the works is the UK Kent variant - faster-spreading and, some scientists fear, could accelerate the infection.\nPublic Health Wales (PHW) estimates it is being found in about 90% of cases in Wales in recent weeks. \nAs fewer positive cases are around in communities, more test results are being checked for variants. In addition to the South Africa variant, eight cases of the India variant have also been identified, linked to travel abroad. \nNo more cases of these or other non-Kent variants were found in the most recent week.\nPHW said: \"The dominant strain in Wales is the Kent variant, and there is currently no evidence of widespread community transmission of other variants of concern in Wales.\"\nIt said all suitable Covid samples that were suitable were being sequenced to understand the extent of variants of concern in Wales.\nWelsh government scientific advisers say we have to be \"very careful around new variants\" and that they could \"impact our way out of this period.\"\nWith this in mind, other scientists are debating what a third wave might look like.\nMutations are not unexpected with viruses but still present a public health challenge, with concern that variants will emerge which vaccines are less effective against.\nRecent modelling for the Welsh government presented scenarios - including a \"most likely\" one factoring in the existence of the new variants, a good adherence to restrictions still being in place and the effect of the vaccine.\nThese underpin a cautious road ahead out of lockdown.\nIf you continue with the road metaphor - we have passed the major incident but there are still warning signs in place. We are all being asked to drive carefully and slowly - keeping our distance obviously - to stand the best chance of arriving in one piece.\nThe message from public health officials is people still need to follow guidelines, while they will be keeping a close eye to ensure infections do not get out of control."

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nWith the UK having ordered more than 400 million doses of various coronavirus vaccines, it's expected to have many left over once all adults have been offered jabs. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson will pledge to donate a majority of that surplus to poorer countries in a speech to fellow leaders of rich nations in the G7 later.\nPrimary pupils aged eight and over may be able to return to school in Wales from 15 March, if Covid cases continue to fall. Children aged between three and seven are due back in class on Monday and First Minister Mark Drakeford will later announce proposals for the return of more pupils. However, stay-at-home lockdown rules are expected to stay in place for another three weeks.\nNearly 20 major healthcare bodies are appealing to the PM for better masks and other personal protection against coronavirus - saying current measures to stop airborne spread of the disease are \"inadequate\". They say at least 930 health and care workers have died of Covid-19 and more are experiencing long-term effects. The government says safety is a priority, it's monitoring evidence on airborne transmission and will update advice \"where necessary\".\nMore than two million people have not been refunded for flights they were unable to board due to coronavirus restrictions, and many may not be entitled to one, according to the Which? consumer group.

      "text": "A film that cast unknown east London schoolgirls in most of its main roles has been honoured with five prizes at the British Independent Film Awards.\nRocks won best British independent film, and one of its stars, Kosar Ali, 17, was named both best supporting actress and most promising newcomer.\nRocks got glowing reviews when it came out last year and is now on Netflix.\nIts other winners included D'Angelou Osei Kissiedu, who was just seven when he played little brother Emmanuel.\nHe was named best supporting actor, with a seven-decade age gap between him and the winner of the best actor award - Sir Anthony Hopkins, 83, who was recognised for playing a man struggling with dementia in The Father.\nTo find the young stars of Rocks, director Sarah Gavron and casting director Lucy Pardee auditioned about 1,300 students, most of whom had no acting experience. The chosen cast then improvised much of the film's dialogue.\nAfter Thursday's virtual awards ceremony, Ali, who plays Rocks' best friend Sumaya, told the PA news agency the film had made her \"understand myself as a person as well as an actor\"\nShe said: \"Before this whole experience I never thought I would be who I am today, winning awards and even pursuing this acting career.\"\nProducer Ameenah Ayub Allen said Rocks was a celebration of female film-making. \"We were making this film that really had a truly independent spirit. It had a truly independent methodology,\" she said.\n\"When we were filming, we always thought the film was imbued with the spirit of a teenage girl and it is just phenomenal that it has come here and that the spirit of a teenage girl has won best film, with a completely different way of film-making, with all these incredible women.\"\nBukky Bakray, 18, who plays the title character, was nominated for best actress. That award went to Wunmi Mosaku for refugee horror His House, which had four wins in total. The Father won three, while psychological horror Saint Maud won two.\nActor Riz Ahmed claimed the award for debut screenwriter for Mogul Mowgli, which also won best music, while Ahmed's The Long Goodbye won best short film.\nSee the full list of winners and nominees on the British Independent Film Awards website.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "The BBC has said Woman's Hour host Emma Barnett asked a Muslim leader about \"legitimate\" issues, after complaints that she had been \"strikingly hostile\". \nThe broadcaster promised to \"reflect on\" the concerns raised after Barnett's interview with the first woman to lead the Muslim Council of Britain.\nMore than 100 prominent figures signed an open letter about Zara Mohammed's \"mistreatment\" on Radio 4.\nThe show said it would \"think hard\" about how to reflect Muslim women.\nDirector general Tim Davie said he agreed with the programme's response to the letter, and that the BBC has \"a responsibility to explore and debate issues within all communities\".\nThe open letter, published on Wednesday, was signed by a range of politicians, writers, academics and other public figures.\nIt said Barnett \"appeared intent on re-enforcing damaging and prejudicial tropes about Islam and Muslim women\", and that the corporation \"needs to address its engagement with and representation of Muslim women\".\nIn particular, the letter took issue with the host for \"persistently\" asking how many female imams there are in Britain.\n\"Despite Mohammed's repeated claims that religious adjudication was not within the parameters of her role leading a civil society organisation, Barnett asked the question about female imams four times, each time interrupting Mohammed's answer,\" it said.\nThe interview \"mirrored the style and tone of an accountability interview with a politician, rather than authentically recognising and engaging in what this represented for British Muslim women\", the letter added.\nIn a statement on Friday, the programme said: \"While we appreciate that people can sometimes have very differing responses to our live interviews and discussions, we believe it was legitimate for the programme to seek to explore some of the issues facing Muslims in the UK.\n\"Woman's Hour however has always been a programme that listens to feedback and learns from the responses we receive; we will reflect on the issues and concerns you raise in this open letter.\n\"We always endeavour to reflect the experiences and issues impacting Muslim women as well as think hard about how we do so, and we will continue to do that.\n\"We commit to returning to this on air soon and to deepen our engagement with the issues that matter most to Muslim women, as well as looking at representation across Woman's Hour as part of the BBC's plans to more accurately reflect the society we serve.\"\nThe open letter said part of the problem was that Muslim voices were \"underrepresented at every level\" within the BBC, especially in production arm BBC Studios, which makes the long-running Radio 4 programme.\nMr Davie acknowledged that the proportion of Muslim staff at the BBC is lower than the national average, but added: \"It is not as low as you suggest.\"\nHe said: \"Improving the representation of our staff is a key priority for me and my executive team.\"\nHe invited the writers of the letter to \"meet with some senior colleagues at the BBC to talk through the issues that you raise in your letter\", in order to understand BBC plans to \"improve representation across our programmes and within our teams\".\nBut the letter's authors Mariam Khan and Yassmin Abdel-Magied said Mr Davie and Woman's Hour had \"failed to engage with the specifics of our concerns over the content of the interview\".\nThey also said it was \"frustrating\" that the director general had chosen to quote statistics for Muslim employees across the BBC, and that representation in the TV and radio production departments of commercial arm BBC Studios was \"negligible and requires urgent addressing both at staff and leadership levels\".\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's health minister has played down the prospect of lockdown restrictions being eased in time for Easter. \nOn Thursday, the executive extended restrictions until 1 April.\nA review of the current measures will take place on 18 March. \nFive more coronavirus-related deaths were reported by the Department of Health on Friday, bringing its total number of deaths to 2,026. It also recorded another 313 positive cases.\nRobin Swann reiterated that the pathway-to-recovery roadmap on easing restrictions, due to be published on 1 March, will be linked to data as opposed to specific dates. \nSpeaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said: \"One of the approaches the executive made in the first wave was to follow the data, not the dates and that approach has been replicated in other jurisdictions.\n\"So the roadmap will set a trajectory that won't be tied to dates and will be very clear about following the science.\" \nThe current restrictions were imposed in Northern Ireland on 26 December to manage the spread of Covid-19.\nMr Swann said the health service is currently supporting more Covid-19 inpatients than at the peak of the first wave. \n\"So there would be no point in saying that where we will be in a number of weeks time will be far better than where we were at the same period of the first wave,\" he said.\nThere are 403 people with Covid-19 in hospitals across Northern Ireland, of which 49 are being treated in intensive care and 41 have been ventilated.\nHowever, the vaccine does provide more cause for hope of recovery in this wave, the health minister added.\nOn Friday afternoon it was announced that all carers over the age of 18 can now book the Covid-19 vaccine at a regional vaccination centre after the scheme was again extended.\nPreviously only carers over 50 were eligible, but Mr Swann said he had decided to remove the age criteria and \"open this up to all carers\".\u00a0 \n\"If you are a carer of someone who is elderly or disabled, you can now book your vaccine online at one of the seven trust centres,\" he said.  \nThe latest NI Department of Health figures show that as of Friday, 466,524 vaccines have been administered, of which 436,143 were first doses and 30,381 were second doses.\nOn Thursday, Mr Swann said he hoped to expand Northern Ireland's vaccine programme to carers of all ages soon.\nSpeaking on Friday morning, he said: \"That will be the difference this time around that we didn't have last time - that extra support that the vaccine is actually bringing.\n\"But we're balancing hope with caution. Anything we're doing now will be reviewed on 18 March. \n\"The figures are moving in the right direction, but they started from a very high point this time around.\" \nMr Swann said the vaccine programme is beginning to make a difference. \n\"It's really starting to make progress in the over 75s, but it takes time for that vaccine to have the positive impact it needs to have.\" \nHealth officials have said they want to avoid a possible rise in cases around St Patrick's Day on 17 March.\nMr Swann said there was \"a realisation across the executive table that if we take [easing lockdown] on a measured basis, we won't end up going back... into full lockdown in a few months time\".\nThe head of the BMA in NI, Dr Tom Black, told BBC Radio Foyle it would have been difficult to justify further lifting of lockdown measures when the number of infections and hospital inpatients remains high.\"We are half way down the slope, but have another few weeks of work to do,\" Dr Black said.\"We can't afford to ease up for St Patrick's Day, we can't ease up for Easter. \"This continued lockdown is what is going to free up the summer, this is giving you the opportunity for some normality during summer.\"\nOn Thursday, it was announced that pre-school, nursery and primary school pupils in P1 to P3 (aged four to seven) will go back to school in Northern Ireland on 8 March.\nThey will then resume remote learning on 22 March to enable the return of years 12 to 14, until the start of the Easter holidays.\nMr Swann said: \"From a health point of view, it's about seeing a cohort to return for a few weeks and allowing us to asses what impact that has had on transmission and the R number.\"\nHe added that the decision over which year group returned was \"not something [the Department of Health] would get involved in\". \nStormont ministers have also agreed slight changes to click-and-collect services for some retailers.\nThose services will resume from 8 March for baby equipment shops, clothing shops, footwear shops and electrical goods shops. \nFrom that date, the number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a public space will increase to 10 people from two households.\nMeanwhile, a body representing NI hotels has published a plan it said will help the industry recover from lockdown.\nThe NI Hotels Federation said the tourism industry would be in \"survival mode\" for the immediate future.\nIts 'Return to Trading' plan sets out eight requests for the executive to consider, including the removal of the earlier closing time of 23:00 for hospitality, which was in force before the lockdown was imposed.\nThe body's chief executive, Janice Gault, said the restriction had \"little effect on the spread of the virus, but has significant impact on the viability of trading\".\nShe said extension of a reduction in VAT to 5% beyond 31 March was imperative and called for an extension of business rates relief for the next financial year, as well as a \"staged and controlled end\" to the furlough scheme.\nThe document also suggests that holiday-at-home vouchers should be issued to promote domestic tourism as Northern Ireland emerges from lockdown in the coming months."

Or maybe just despair at realising how threadbare the case for it is.\"\nThe SNP's Westminster deputy leader Kirsten Oswald claimed Mr Johnson's \"taxpayer-funded anti-independence campaign is completely falling apart\".\n\"As support for independence grows, the Tories are losing advisers like rats on a sinking ship,\" she said. \n\"People in Scotland have a right to determine their own future in a post-pandemic referendum.\" \nAside from the pandemic, protecting the union is one of Boris Johnson's key challenges in the coming months. \nThe SNP will demand another referendum if they win the Holyrood election in May - while the impact of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland is still playing out. \nOliver Lewis was appointed head of the Union unit at the start of the month and was seen as an important player in Number 10 who had Mr Johnson's ear. \nSo his departure a fortnight later shows all is not well in Downing Street. Far from it.\nSources say Mr Lewis was the victim of a(nother) power struggle - after personnel changes at the heart of government last week.\nIn particular, it seems Mr Lewis found it hard to work with another special adviser, Henry Newman, who was brought into the Number 10 operation last week. \nMr Newman is extremely close to the prime minister's fianc\u00e9e, Carrie Symonds. \nAround Westminster, these power struggles are fascinating. \nBut the fear some around Mr Johnson have is that they keep happening - and it shows an operation where the ship is still not particularly steady.\nIn the words of one source: \"Everything just needs to settle down in there.\"\nRead more from Nick.\nMr Johnson has said another referendum on Scottish independence - following the last one in 2014 - should not happen, describing it as a \"once-in-a-generation\" vote.\nMr Lewis was research director of the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 EU membership referendum, writing its manifesto.\nHe joined the UK government as an adviser on Brexit policy before taking up his role defending the union."

      "text": "Boris Johnson is pledging to donate most of the UK's surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries in a speech to a virtual G7 meeting on Friday.\nHe urged rich countries to back a 100-day target for the developing new vaccines for future emerging diseases.\nThe UK has ordered more than 400 million doses of various vaccines, so many will be left over once all adults are vaccinated.\nBut anti-poverty campaigners say the UK is not doing enough.\nDecisions on when and how much of the surplus will be distributed will be made later this year, with ministers taking into account the supply chain and whether booster shots are needed in the autumn.\nThe prime minister told his fellow leaders: \"Science is finally getting the upper hand on Covid. Around the world [we need to] make sure everyone gets the vaccines that they need, so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together.\"\n\"There is no point in us vaccinating our individual populations - we've got to make sure the whole world is vaccinated because this is a global pandemic and it's no use one country being far ahead of another, we've got to move together.\"\nHe said he wanted to \"ensure that we distribute vaccines at cost around the world - make sure everybody gets the vaccines that they need so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together.\"\nAfter the meeting, the G7 leaders issued a statement committing to \"intensify cooperation on the health response to Covid-19\".\nIt reaffirmed the group's support for \"affordable and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, reflecting the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good.\"\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has told the Financial Times richer countries should send up to 4 to 5% of their current vaccine supplies to poorer nations.\nBut Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK would be \"looking at a figure significantly greater than that\".\nHe promised the government would be a \"global force for good\" in fighting the pandemic and, unlike \"some countries\", the UK would not use the promise of vaccine supplies to other countries as \"short-term diplomatic leverage\".\nBut it was \"difficult to say\" at this stage when the sharing would happen, Mr Cleverly added.\nA government source said more than half of excess doses would go to Covax, a UN initiative intended to ensure wider access to vaccines.\nThe UK government has donated \u00a3548m to the scheme, to which the US pledged $4bn (\u00a32.9bn) in December.\nAlmost 17 million people in the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, with 573,724 of these receiving two doses, according to the latest figures.\nBy Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent\nIn the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need. \nNew figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses. \nThe UK has also given \u00a3548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries. \nBut campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism. \nSome 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk. \nAnd even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries.\nMr Johnson used his position as chairman of the G7 group of major economies to push the case for setting a 100-day target for developing vaccines when new diseases strike.\nHe also told the group that it was important to \"build back better\" from the pandemic and face the \"great challenges\" of climate change, telling the leaders that he wanted \"to get some great things done\" at the G7 and the forthcoming Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.\nFriday's virtual meeting is the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden.\nThe One Campaign, which aims to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, said Mr Johnson's commitment to Covax did not go far enough.\nUK director Romilly Greenhill said: \"The virus won't wait on us to be ready before it mutates, so we need to get these vaccines around the world as quickly as possible.\"\nAn Ipsos MORI poll of people from 18 countries showed that those in the UK were most likely to support donating surplus doses.\nAlmost seven in 10 Britons (69%) want to pass on some of the country's extra doses to be used in other countries, whereas globally just under half (46%) say they would want their country to do this.  \nA further 12,057 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Thursday, alongside another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test."

      "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh has been spending a third night in hospital after being admitted on his doctor's advice.\nPrince Philip, 99, was earlier said to be in \"good spirits\" after being taken to King Edward VII Hospital in central London as a precaution on Tuesday.\nHis stay is not related to coronavirus and is expected to last for a few days.\nThe Queen, 94, has remained at Windsor Castle and performed her first face-to-face event of the year on Thursday when she knighted a royal aide.\nVice-Admiral Sir Tony Johnstone-Burt was made Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order during a private socially-distanced ceremony at Windsor.\nSir Tony, a former Royal Navy officer, runs a department that handles official and private entertaining and hospitality across all royal residences.\nThe Duke of Cambridge carried out several virtual conversations with front-line NHS staff on Thursday, while the Princess Royal held a virtual meeting in her role as patron of the Scottish Rugby Union.\nThe Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall have also continued official duties.\nIn a pre-recorded video message for a virtual meeting hosted by the British Asian Trust, Prince Charles said on Thursday it was a \"tragedy\" not everyone was benefitting from the \"extraordinary achievement\" of the coronavirus vaccine.\nAfter feeling unwell, Prince Philip was advised to go into hospital by his doctor - though the exact reason for the admission is undisclosed.\nA palace source said the duke had walked into the hospital in Marylebone unaided.\nLast month, the palace announced that Prince Philip and the Queen had received Covid vaccinations from a household doctor at Windsor Castle.\nThe couple have been spending the recent lockdown in England at Windsor Castle with a small household staff, nicknamed HMS Bubble.\nThe Queen and Prince Philip celebrated Christmas quietly at their Berkshire residence, instead of the traditional family gathering at the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk.\nIn December 2019, the duke, who turns 100 in June, was admitted to the same hospital - King Edward VII Hospital - as a \"precautionary measure\" for treatment for a \"pre-existing condition\". \nHe was discharged on Christmas Eve after four nights and driven to Sandringham, where he spent Christmas with the Queen. \nHe has received treatment for various other health conditions over the years including a blocked coronary artery in 2011, a bladder infection in 2012 and exploratory surgery on his abdomen in June 2013.\nPrince Philip's most-recent official engagement saw him hand over his role of colonel-in-chief of The Rifles in a ceremony at Windsor to the Duchess of Cornwall, who received the role separately. \nLast November, the Queen and Prince Philip marked their 73rd wedding anniversary by releasing a photograph of themselves opening a card made for them by their great-grandchildren, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis."

      "tags": "Media,UK Royal Family,Thomas Markle,Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,The Royal Family and the media",
      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has welcomed her High Court privacy victory over the Mail on Sunday, saying the damage the publisher has done \"runs deep\". \nMeghan brought the claim against Associated Newspapers (ANL) over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father. \nThe judge said Meghan had a \"reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private\".\nANL said it was surprised and disappointed by the judgment. \nMr Justice Warby granted Meghan \"summary judgment\" in her claim for misuse of private information against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, meaning that part of the case is resolved without a trial.\nHe said there would be a further hearing in March to decide \"the next steps\" in the legal action.\nMeghan, 39, sent the handwritten letter to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018, following her marriage to Prince Harry in May that year, which Mr Markle did not attend. The couple are now living in the US with their son Archie, after having stepped back from their roles in the Royal Family.\nIn a judgment on Thursday, Mr Justice Warby ruled that the publication of the letter - which he described as \"a long-form telling-off\" - was \"manifestly excessive and hence unlawful\".\n\"It was, in short, a personal and private letter,\" he said.\n\"The majority of what was published was about the claimant's own behaviour, her feelings of anguish about her father's behaviour - as she saw it - and the resulting rift between them.\n\"These are inherently private and personal matters.\"\nHe added: \"There is no prospect that a different judgment would be reached after a trial.\"\nExtracts from the letter appeared in a double-page spread in the Mail on Sunday, alongside the headline: \"Revealed: the letter showing true tragedy of Meghan's rift with a father she says has 'broken her heart into a million pieces'\". \nIn a statement, the Duchess of Sussex said she was grateful to the courts for holding Associated Newspapers to account \"for their illegal and dehumanising practices\". \n\"For these outlets, it's a game. For me and so many others, it's real life, real relationships, and very real sadness,\" she said. \n\"The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.\"\nMeghan said her \"comprehensive win\" means \"we have all won\", adding: \"We now know, and hope it creates legal precedent, that you cannot take somebody's privacy and exploit it in a privacy case, as the defendant has blatantly done over the past two years.\"\nA spokesman for ANL said: \"We are very surprised by today's summary judgment and disappointed at being denied the chance to have all the evidence heard and tested in open court at a full trial.\n\"We are carefully considering the judgment's contents and will decide in due course whether to lodge an appeal.\" \nLawyers for ANL had claimed Meghan wrote the letter \"with a view to it being disclosed publicly at some future point\" in order to \"defend her against charges of being an uncaring or unloving daughter\".\nDuring a remote hearing in January, Mr Markle said in a witness statement he had wanted the letter published to \"set the record straight\" about his relationship with his daughter - a claim one of Meghan's lawyers described as \"ridiculous\".\nThis is a thumping victory for Meghan. \nThe court dismissed Associated Newspapers' defence on privacy and copyright; the only ongoing dispute is about whose copyright has been breached, as there is some argument over whether it was just the duchess that wrote the letter or whether she had some assistance. \nSo is Meghan and Harry's long struggle with sections of the British media now finished? Harry has settled his case against the Mail on Sunday; Meghan has won hers. \nIt seems unlikely. The couple have instructed their UK spokespeople not to talk to the country's most popular newspapers. They clearly think they simply can't get a fair hearing. \nAnd the coverage they receive is pretty critical; baiting the couple over their new lives in California is now something of a routine.\nTo the couple it may well be immaterial. Their lives are elsewhere now.  \nBut their relationship with the British public is still, largely, mediated by newspapers they will not deal with and which take delight in doing them down. \nThe couple have won - but they have also lost.\nMedia lawyer Mark Stephens said he envisages the newspaper publisher will seek to go to the Court of Appeal \"to have a more definitive ruling on what the law is going forward\".\n\"If you can't effectively report on leaked letters then in those circumstances the media holding people to account is going to be hampered,\" he said. \n\"Essentially this judgement in its widest context puts manacles on the media.\"\nMeghan is seeking damages for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act over five articles published in February 2019, which included extracts from the letter.\nThe judge made two rulings on the case for copyright infringement. \nHe found the publication of the letter infringed the duchess's copyright. But he said the issue of whether Meghan was \"the sole author\" of the letter or Jason Knauf, former communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, was a \"co-author\" should be determined at a trial.\nThe data protection claim was not considered at the hearing in January and is still outstanding.\nHowever, Mr Stephens said that by winning her privacy claim Meghan could say she had been \"vindicated\" and he expected she would drop the other parts of the case \"as soon as she can\". \nThe full trial of the duchess's claim had been due to be heard at the High Court in January, but last year the case was adjourned until autumn 2021 for a \"confidential\" reason. \nWhen his wife first began her legal action against the Mail on Sunday, the Duke of Sussex spoke about the \"painful\" impact of the \"ruthless\" press campaign against her. \n\"I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,\" he said in a statement at the time. \nReferring to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, Prince Harry said his \"deepest fear is history repeating itself\"."

      "text": "The American space agency has released an astonishing image sent back from Mars by its Perseverance rover.\nIt shows the robot heading down to the ground on Thursday to make its landing. It was acquired by the rocket cradle that placed the vehicle on the surface.\nPerseverance has a large amount of data in its memory banks which it is gradually offloading to Earth.\nAmong other pictures is a view from a satellite that captures the rover in the parachute phase of its descent.\nThis also represents an immense technical achievement because the satellite - the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter - was approximately 700km from Perseverance at the time and traveling at about 3km/s.\nNasa is promising more in the next few days.\nThis offering will include short movies shot during the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) sequence - with sound.\nPerseverance has been put in a near-equatorial Martian crater known as Jezero where it will search for signs of past microbial life.\nAdam Steltzner, the Perseverance rover's chief engineer, said the downward-looking view on to the robot would become an iconic image in the history of space exploration. \n\"This is an image of the rover Perseverance slung beneath the descent stage, its propulsion backpack, as it is being lowered to the surface of Mars,\" he explained.\n\"You can see the dust kicked up by the engines. We're probably about 2m or so above the surface of Mars. \n\"You can see the mechanical bridles that hold the rover underneath the descent stage - three straight lines heading down to the top deck. And then the curly electrical umbilical that is taking all of the electrical signals from the descent stage down to the computer inside the belly of the rover, [including] the ones and zeros that represent this image.\"\nEngineers report Perseverance to be in good health, as they gradually commission its systems.\nAll the hardware needs to be assessed to be sure nothing was damaged during Thursday's plunge through the Martian atmosphere to the ground.\nThe most detailed pictures of Jezero Crater will come next week after Perseverance has raised its navigation mast which carries the main science cameras.\n\"Once the mast is successfully deployed, which will be on Saturday, we will proceed by taking lots of images. We'll do a deck panorama of the rover. And we're also going to do a full panorama of our landscape around us,\" said Pauline Hwang, Perseverance's surface strategic mission manager.\nPerseverance's landing technologies put it down almost bang on the targeted touchdown zone, about 2km to the southeast of what remains of an ancient river delta that formed at the edge of a lake.\nIt is sitting on a flat piece of ground at the boundary of two geologic units - a smooth unit under the wheels of the rover that contains dark volcanic rocks; and a rougher unit that has rocks with a lot of the mineral olivine in them.\nThe science team was itching to start exploring the crater, said deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan. \nEven now, with just this limited first release of pictures, there were fascinating rocks to discuss, she told reporters.\n\"We're picking out different colours and tones and textures, to try to figure out what these rocks might represent and what depositional process might have put these rocks on the surface of Mars.\" \nPerseverance's landing spot is in a quadrangle that the science team has informally called Canyon de Chelly after the National Monument in the US State of Arizona. Any rocks the robot investigates in this 1.2km by 1.2km area will also now be given names that relate to the American park, which is famous for its sandstone spire known as Spider Rock. \nThe $2.7bn (\u00a31.9bn) robot is the fifth rover to be put on Mars by Nasa. \nIts initial mission will last one Martian year (roughly two Earth years), although it's hard to see the agency not extending this if all the hardware remains healthy. \nAs well as searching for signs of life, Perseverance's other key objective is to select and package rock samples that can be brought back to Earth laboratories by later missions.

      "tags": "Economics,UK economy,Office for National Statistics",
      "text": "UK government borrowing hit \u00a38.8bn last month, the highest January figure since records began in 1993, reflecting the  cost of pandemic support measures.\nIt was the first time in 10 years that more has been borrowed in January than collected through tax and other income.\nJanuary is usually a key revenue-raising month as it is when taxpayers submit their self-assessment returns.\nTax income fell by less than \u00a31bn, but the government spent \u00a319.7bn more than last year on measures such as furlough.\nGovernment borrowing for this financial year has now reached \u00a3270.6bn, which is \u00a3222bn more than a year ago, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which published the data.\nThe independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated that borrowing could reach \u00a3393.5bn by the end of the financial year in March. That would be the highest amount in any year since the Second World War.\nThe borrowing figure was lower than expected but that \"should not be interpreted as a signal that the economy is withstanding the third lockdown relatively well\", said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\"A sharp \u00a32.1bn year-over-year decline in interest payments, and the vanishing of contributions to the EU's budget, which totalled \u00a32.2bn in January 2020, helped,\" he pointed out.\nThe increase in borrowing has led to a steep increase in the national debt, which now stands at \u00a32.11 trillion.\nThe UK's overall debt has now reached 97.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s.\nThe ONS warned that although the impact of the pandemic on the public finances is becoming clearer, \"its effects are not fully captured\" in the current data, and that its estimates of tax receipts and borrowing are \"subject to greater than usual uncertainty\".\nIt is an almost unbroken rule - January is a time when the Treasury coffers fill and more is paid in than is spent.\nBut for the first time since the financial crisis, the Government had to borrow money in January to make up the gap between what it spent and what it raised in taxes.\nThis near \u00a39bn deficit though was actually better than expectations of \u00a325bn of January borrowing. Receipts from taxes on workers and businesses held up on last year.\nThe borrowing was mainly about \u00a38bn extra spending on things like vaccines, protective equipment and testing, and support for jobs and wages up \u00a35bn on last January. \nOver the course of this financial year the public finances are heading for borrowing of around \u00a3350bn - less bad than forecasts closer to \u00a3400bn, but still a peacetime record.\nThis is the backdrop to the chancellor's budget in a fortnight, where he vows to be open and honest with the public about this challenge, suggesting tax rises at some point. The immediate focus though will have to remain on supporting the economy, as it is cautiously reopened.\nHospitality companies have been excused from paying business rates and home buyers have had a break from paying stamp duty since July. Both these factors meant a drop in revenue for the government.\nBut alcohol duty has risen by a quarter and self-assessed income tax receipts were \u00a31.4bn higher. \nOverall, tax income fell about 1% to \u00a380.3bn.\nSome of the self-assessed income tax gain probably came from the government's policy of allowing some later payments that were due from July, the ONS noted. \nIn the 10 months to January, self-assessed income tax receipts were \u00a326.3bn, \u00a32bn less than in the same period a year earlier.\nMore than has been \u00a346bn spent covering salaries as part of the furlough scheme, and tens of billions of pounds on guaranteeing loans to businesses.\nIn all, the Government has launched more than 40 schemes across the UK to help households and businesses through the coronavirus crisis.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"Since the start of the pandemic we've invested over \u00a3280bn to protect jobs, businesses and livelihoods across the UK - this is the fiscally responsible thing to do and the best way to support sustainable public finances in the medium term.\"\nIn his Budget on 3 March, \"the Chancellor likely won't shy away from setting out plans for borrowing to remain very high in 2021/22, probably close to 10% of GDP,\" said Mr Tombs.\nHe predicted that the chancellor will also be able to avoid setting out future tax rises for 2022 and beyond, if the OBR maintains its upbeat view on the amount of long-term scarring caused by the recent downturn.\nBut he warned that upward pressure on spending will increase over the coming years as the population ages and the Conservatives invest more to \"level up\" the country.\n\"As a result, big tax rises eventually will have to be announced, with 2022 likely to be the worst year,\" said Mr Tombs.\nThe Budget will aim to secure the recovery, not to fix the public finances, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said earlier this week. That means substantial tax rises should not be part of the coming Budget, it said.\n\"Rishi Sunak needs to strike a balance between continuing support for jobs and businesses harmed by lockdowns, and weaning the economy off blanket support which will impede necessary economic adjustment,\" said Paul Johnson, IFS director.\n\"For now, Mr Sunak needs to focus on support and recovery. A reckoning in the form of big future tax rises is highly likely, but not as yet inevitable.\""

      "tags": "Kanye West,Kim Kardashian",
      "text": "Kim Kardashian has filed for divorce from rapper Kanye West, according to reports in the US media.\nThe couple have been married for almost seven years and have four children together. \nThe news was broken by celebrity news website TMZ after months of rumours of marital difficulties.\nReports in US media suggest the reality star, 40, has requested joint legal and physical custody of their children. Neither has publicly commented. \nThe couple are among the most recognisable stars in the world and are both hugely successful in their own right.\nKim first found fame in 2007 as the star of an E! Television reality series about her family. Keeping up with the Kardashians has remained hugely popular since, with its 21st and final series due to air next year. \nThe reality star has found success in many other areas of business, from mobile apps to make-up, and  Forbes estimates her personal wealth to be about $780m (\u00a3556m).\nKnown for huge international hits like Gold Digger, Kanye West has been one of the biggest names in rap music for over 15 years. The Grammy-winning musician has also found success as a fashion designer. \nThe pair were friends for years before they got together and West first appeared on her family's reality show in 2010. \nTheir first daughter, North, arrived in June 2013.\nWest famously hired the San Francisco Giants' baseball stadium and an orchestra to propose to her in front of her family, and their show's cameras, later that year.\nThey got married in Italy in May 2014 and a photograph of them kissing on their wedding day became, at the time, Instagram's most liked post ever. By this point she and her sisters had turned social media into an art form, with their online followings propelling their business success and fame ever further.  \nKardashian gave birth to the couple's first son, Saint West, the following year. They went on to have two other children, Chicago and Psalm, through a surrogate after the reality star suffered from health complications during her previous pregnancies.\nThe couple have rarely been away from tabloid headlines since, most notably when Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris in 2016. \nLast year, West unsuccessfully ran for US president. During his campaign, a series of erratic public appearances and online postings by the rapper sparked concern and led Kardashian to speak out.   \nShe said her husband had bipolar disorder, was a \"brilliant but complicated person\" and called for greater empathy surrounding his mental health from the public and the media. \nRumours of their divorce have been around for months amid speculation Kardashian had hired well-known lawyer Laura Wasser.\nPage Six reported the filing was imminent in January, claiming West spent the festive season away from the California-based family at his Wyoming ranch.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "England's new university regulator is facing questions about a potential conflict of interest.\nLord Wharton has been appointed chair of the Office for Students (OfS) but is also a paid adviser to a firm Aquind, which wants to build a cable linking the UK and French electricity grids.\nThe \u00a31.2bn project would be built through the University of Portsmouth, which is strongly opposed to the route.\nThe OfS says protections are in place to prevent conflicts of interest.\n\"Where there is a conflict related to an individual higher education provider we would expect the relevant board member to exclude themselves from any decisions directly related to that provider,\" said a spokesman for the OfS university watchdog.\nBut the OfS declined to say whether that would specifically apply to the University of Portsmouth and its incoming chair, Conservative peer, Lord Wharton.\nThe University of Portsmouth says any \"perceived conflict of interest\" needs to be \"transparently managed\".\nThe electricity cable \"interconnector\" plan has prompted much local protest in Portsmouth - with both Labour and Conservative MPs in the city opposing its digging through such a densely-populated area.\nThe city council's planning officials said the prospect of it being pushed through with the compulsory acquisition of land was \"draconian\" and an \"interference with human rights\".\nThe University of Portsmouth, whose land it would run through, is concerned about disruption to sporting facilities and says it would have a \"huge negative impact\" and leave it facing financial losses.\nAquind firmly rejects the university's claims, saying the impact would be \"minimal\", work would be carried out in a way that reduced disruption and the route of the \"underground cable corridor has been amended and refined\" in response to earlier feedback.\nBut the university will now face Lord Wharton both as someone working for Aquind, on the opposing side in this commercial dispute, and also the chair of the regulator, which has powers to impose fines and sanctions on universities such as itself.\nWhile there is no suggestion of impropriety in either role, as paid private adviser or incoming publicly-funded watchdog, there are questions being asked about an overlap.\nPortsmouth South MP, Stephen Morgan, questioned whether Lord Wharton could appear to be impartial.\n\"We know Aquind has links to Tory donors. But to be advising a firm responsible for this project while it is being challenged by a university Wharton is set to regulate, raises serious red flags about his impartiality, particularly if he keeps the Conservative whip.\n\"These revelations cast fresh doubt over Lord Wharton's suitability for this key role,\" said Mr Morgan, Labour's shadow minister for the armed forces.\n\"The potential conflicts of interest keep on mounting for Lord Wharton of Yarm,\" said Jo Grady, leader of the UCU lecturers' union.\nThe Department for Education says there is an \"extensive code of guidance\" to guard against a conflict of interest and that as chair, \"Lord Wharton would not be involved in individual regulatory decisions about universities\".\nIt has also rejected accusations made by Labour about \"cronyism\", where his appointment had been linked to his political connections, saying the process was \"in line with the governance code on public appointments\".\nAn Aquind spokesman says its adviser Lord Wharton had no part in \"determining the location of the underground cables or in the ongoing engagement with Portsmouth University\".\nHis work for Aquind has been recorded in the House of Lords register of interests.\nThe backers of the electricity scheme have also attracted attention. A director of Aquind is Alexander Temerko, a Ukrainian-born businessman who has become a prominent financial donor to Conservative MPs.\nMr Temerko's website has numerous pictures of himself with Aquind adviser Lord Wharton at his side, at conferences, fundraisers and social events with other prominent Conservatives, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for whom Lord Wharton was a manager of his leadership campaign.\nThe photos on Mr Temerko's website also show the businessman with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who appointed Lord Wharton to chair the Office for Students earlier this month.\nLord Wharton's links with Mr Temerko go back before his role as Aquind's adviser. Records from the Electoral Commission show Mr Temerko made four donations to him, amounting to \u00a325,000, between 2013 and 2016, when he was a Conservative MP.\nThe Office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, said Lord Wharton's work for Aquind's \"subsea electricity connector\" would be \"part-time, paid, strategic adviser to the company - acting as a sounding board for the company's ideas and future plans/ strategy of the business\".\nThis was in August 2017 when he had stopped being an MP and minister and was seeking their advice over taking up his new job with Aquind.\nThe business secretary will make the decision later this year on whether the Aquind interconnector gets the go-ahead. \nThe previous secretary of state, Alok Sharma, whose local constituency party had received a donation from Aquind of \u00a310,000, had to recuse himself from any part in the decision-making process.\nConservative MP David Morris, another recipient of a donation, had to apologise to the House of Commons for a breach of paid advocacy rules after asking a question in support of the Aquind cable project.\nAquind says that all of its political donations have \"complied with the relevant legislations\".\nLocal campaign groups opposed to putting the Aquind cable through Portsmouth have complained of the threat to the environment and the disruption caused by the construction.\nThe university says it is not against the principle of the project, but its objections are about what it will mean in practice.\n\"The objections relate to the impact on the operation of the site and future development potential. The current plans will cause disruption to the provision of facilities to students and the local community, which together will impact the university's business,\" said a university spokesman.\n\"We are continuing our dialogue with Aquind to try to reach a resolution and find a route which does not have the huge negative impact on the university as is currently proposed.\n\"Lord Wharton's appointment does not change the basis of our objection and we have full confidence in him acting in his new position. We hope that any perceived conflict of interest on this matter will be able to be appropriately and transparently managed by all those involved.\"\nBut Aquind says it has already made changes to \"minimise any impact on open spaces\" and to respect environmental concerns.\nThe energy firm says that the interconnector link would provide cheaper and greener electricity for consumers in the UK.\nThe Office for Students said its new chair Lord Wharton did not want to comment."

      "text": "NI must \"tread carefully\" when it comes to easing the coronavirus lockdown and some restrictions may remain in place long term, Robin Swann has said.\nThe health minister said that despite progress with vaccinations, serious uncertainties remain about the future.\nHis comments came amid warnings from health officials that some restrictions could remain in place until next year.\n\"If we want a better spring and summer, we need to make the utmost effort now,\" added Mr Swann.\nNorthern Ireland re-entered lockdown on 26 December, as hospitals faced severe pressures in managing a third wave of the virus.\nThe executive will review the restrictions next week but the measures are currently in place until 5 March.\nFour more coronavirus-related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland, according to the Department of Health.\nA total number of 1,957 people have now died in Northern Ireland after testing positive for the virus.\nA further 336 positive coronavirus cases were also recorded on Wednesday in the department's latest figures.\nThere are 554 people being treated in hospital for the virus in Northern Ireland, 61 are in intensive care units (ICU).\nThere are 554 people being treated in hospital for the virus in Northern Ireland, 61 are in intensive care units (ICU).\nSpeaking at the weekly health press conference at Stormont on Wednesday, Mr Swann said he wanted to offer people hope but had to \"stress the need for caution\".\nWearing face coverings in shops and on public transport may remain the \"new normal\" even if lockdown measures are eased, he added.\n\"If we continue with the progress we are making, we can consider a careful, managed, easing of some measures - but only when and if the timing is right,\" Mr Swann warned.\nThe minister set out three \"principles\" he said would guide the executive's response to easing restrictions in the coming months.\nThey are:\nMr Swann said he wanted to \"aggressively stamp down\" infection rates, in order to allow breathing space for all aspects of society to recover.\nOn new variants of the virus, he said they represented a considerable unknown and that ministers could not prematurely end lockdown and risk \"falling into another in a small number of weeks\".\nIt is believed at least 50% of current Covid-19 cases in NI could be related to the variant that was detected in Kent before Christmas.\nIt is thought to be about 50-70% more infectious than the original Covid-19 strain that emerged early last year.\nHe pointed to upcoming St Patrick's Day and Easter holidays and said history could not repeat itself by allowing increased social mixing to cause a large spike in cases. \nMr Swann said he longed for the day when all families in Northern Ireland could enjoy freedoms they previously took for granted, but stressed \"we are not there yet\".\nWednesday's Department of Health press briefing was a cooling of the jets after comments by Dr Michael McBride on Tuesday which left some thinking we would be living in lockdown well into next year. \nDr McBride and the health minister made it clear that \"some restrictions may be with us into the long term\" but that did not mean lockdown is here to stay. \nWith the public hanging onto every word during these dark times, clarity in these press conferences is essential.\nNever before have words, dates and timings been so forensically scrutinised. \nWednesday's message was about stepping out of this lockdown \"slowly and gently\", \"baby steps\" rather than giant leaps. \nWhile both men acknowledged that the public are \"fed-up\" and \"weary\" they also recognised we cannot be led out of one lockdown so quickly that \"we end up falling into another in a matter of weeks\".\nSt Patrick's Day and Easter are social stumbling blocks. While it's the executive who will decide what happens next, the minister said history must not be allowed to repeat itself (a nudge to re-opening at Christmas).\nConsidering that it's likely health officials will advise that very little will re-open before Easter, the big question is if that that will include schools.\nWith several sectors in the mix, including education, hospitality and close contact services, the plan, it seems, is to open one at a time and measure the success or damage before proceeding with the next.\nAll eyes will be on the R number - the aim is always to keep it below 1. As the gentlemen both said, it will be slow and gentle baby steps. \nAs of Tuesday, 361,430 doses of the vaccine had been administered in Northern Ireland.\nThe minister said the vaccination programme was making \"real progress\" and more than 90% of people aged over 80 in NI have now received a dose, along with 80% of those aged 75 to 79.\nNorthern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said no-one was advocating for a full lockdown to continue until 2022.\n\"We can do better than that, and we must do better than that,\" he told the press conference.\nBut he warned that if restrictions were relaxed too early, cases would grow and that would lead to further pressures on the health service and another rise in deaths.\n\"We need to allow time between relaxing one thing, assessing the impact of that before then relaxing another,\" said Dr McBride.\nHe added that \"small, careful baby steps\" were required, but insisted \"there will be a time after Covid\".\nBoth Dr McBride and Mr Swann appealed to the public to continue following the current public health advice, insisting it would remain an important part of the strategy to manage Covid-19.\nMeanwhile in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday, an additional 54 deaths were added to official figures on Wednesday, bringing the country's overall toll of coronavirus-related deaths to 3,794. \nIreland's National Public Health Emergency Team also said there have been another 1,006 confirmed cases of Covid-19.

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,NI Health,Robin Swann,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Northern Ireland's health minister has played down the prospect of lockdown restrictions being eased in time for Easter. \nOn Thursday, the executive extended restrictions until 1 April.\nA review of the current measures will take place on 18 March. \nFive more coronavirus-related deaths were reported by the Department of Health on Friday, bringing its total number of deaths to 2,026. It also recorded another 313 positive cases.\nRobin Swann reiterated that the pathway-to-recovery roadmap on easing restrictions, due to be published on 1 March, will be linked to data as opposed to specific dates. \nSpeaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said: \"One of the approaches the executive made in the first wave was to follow the data, not the dates and that approach has been replicated in other jurisdictions.\n\"So the roadmap will set a trajectory that won't be tied to dates and will be very clear about following the science.\" \nThe current restrictions were imposed in Northern Ireland on 26 December to manage the spread of Covid-19.\nMr Swann said the health service is currently supporting more Covid-19 inpatients than at the peak of the first wave. \n\"So there would be no point in saying that where we will be in a number of weeks time will be far better than where we were at the same period of the first wave,\" he said.\nThere are 403 people with Covid-19 in hospitals across Northern Ireland, of which 49 are being treated in intensive care and 41 have been ventilated.\nHowever, the vaccine does provide more cause for hope of recovery in this wave, the health minister added.\nOn Friday afternoon it was announced that all carers over the age of 18 can now book the Covid-19 vaccine at a regional vaccination centre after the scheme was again extended.\nPreviously only carers over 50 were eligible, but Mr Swann said he had decided to remove the age criteria and \"open this up to all carers\".\u00a0 \n\"If you are a carer of someone who is elderly or disabled, you can now book your vaccine online at one of the seven trust centres,\" he said.  \nThe latest NI Department of Health figures show that as of Friday, 466,524 vaccines have been administered, of which 436,143 were first doses and 30,381 were second doses.\nOn Thursday, Mr Swann said he hoped to expand Northern Ireland's vaccine programme to carers of all ages soon.\nSpeaking on Friday morning, he said: \"That will be the difference this time around that we didn't have last time - that extra support that the vaccine is actually bringing.\n\"But we're balancing hope with caution. Anything we're doing now will be reviewed on 18 March. \n\"The figures are moving in the right direction, but they started from a very high point this time around.\" \nMr Swann said the vaccine programme is beginning to make a difference. \n\"It's really starting to make progress in the over 75s, but it takes time for that vaccine to have the positive impact it needs to have.\" \nHealth officials have said they want to avoid a possible rise in cases around St Patrick's Day on 17 March.\nMr Swann said there was \"a realisation across the executive table that if we take [easing lockdown] on a measured basis, we won't end up going back... into full lockdown in a few months time\".\nThe head of the BMA in NI, Dr Tom Black, told BBC Radio Foyle it would have been difficult to justify further lifting of lockdown measures when the number of infections and hospital inpatients remains high.\"We are half way down the slope, but have another few weeks of work to do,\" Dr Black said.\"We can't afford to ease up for St Patrick's Day, we can't ease up for Easter. \"This continued lockdown is what is going to free up the summer, this is giving you the opportunity for some normality during summer.\"\nOn Thursday, it was announced that pre-school, nursery and primary school pupils in P1 to P3 (aged four to seven) will go back to school in Northern Ireland on 8 March.\nThey will then resume remote learning on 22 March to enable the return of years 12 to 14, until the start of the Easter holidays.\nMr Swann said: \"From a health point of view, it's about seeing a cohort to return for a few weeks and allowing us to asses what impact that has had on transmission and the R number.\"\nHe added that the decision over which year group returned was \"not something [the Department of Health] would get involved in\". \nStormont ministers have also agreed slight changes to click-and-collect services for some retailers.\nThose services will resume from 8 March for baby equipment shops, clothing shops, footwear shops and electrical goods shops. \nFrom that date, the number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a public space will increase to 10 people from two households.\nMeanwhile, a body representing NI hotels has published a plan it said will help the industry recover from lockdown.\nThe NI Hotels Federation said the tourism industry would be in \"survival mode\" for the immediate future.\nIts 'Return to Trading' plan sets out eight requests for the executive to consider, including the removal of the earlier closing time of 23:00 for hospitality, which was in force before the lockdown was imposed.\nThe body's chief executive, Janice Gault, said the restriction had \"little effect on the spread of the virus, but has significant impact on the viability of trading\".\nShe said extension of a reduction in VAT to 5% beyond 31 March was imperative and called for an extension of business rates relief for the next financial year, as well as a \"staged and controlled end\" to the furlough scheme.\nThe document also suggests that holiday-at-home vouchers should be issued to promote domestic tourism as Northern Ireland emerges from lockdown in the coming months."

The Dubai government and the UAE foreign ministry have not yet commented.\nPrincess Latifa's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is one of the richest heads of state in the world, the ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the UAE.\nEarlier, a lawyer who presented Princess Latifa's case to the UN, Rodney Dixon, told the BBC: \"We are hoping [a UN investigation] will be decisive in finally getting Princess Latifa released.\"\nHe said: \"The UN needs to have a very serious meeting directly with those who are holding [her] and make sure an agreement is reached so she can be released.\"\nThe UAE has close relations with a number of Western countries, including the US and UK, which consider it a strategic ally.\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said earlier this week that he would watch any developments \"very closely\". \"We are concerned about it,\" he said, adding that the \"deeply troubling\" videos showed \"a young woman in deep distress\".\nWith the help of friends, Princess Latifa tried to flee Dubai to start a new life in February 2018.\n\"I'm not allowed to drive, I'm not allowed to travel or leave Dubai at all,\" she said in a video recorded just before her escape.\nBut days later, the princess was captured by commandos on a boat in the Indian Ocean.

      "text": "Some dental practices could close as a result of the pandemic, the British Dental Association (BDA) Scotland and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd) has warned.\nThe number of patients dentists can treat has been cut by rules to stop the virus from spreading. \nThe RCSEd has warned that for NHS work the government was \"providing very little towards treatment\". \nBut the Scottish government said the sector has had \"unprecedented support\". \nProf Philip Taylor, of the Faculty of Dental Surgery at RCSEd, said that for NHS work the government was \"providing very little towards treatment\". \nFees are complex and can vary with each patient, but a dentist who fits a new metal crown for a back tooth on the NHS may receive a fee set by government of \u00a380 to \u00a3100 - with the patient paying most of that. \nHowever, if the work was done privately, the RCSEd said the dentist could charge \u00a3300 to \u00a3400. \nDentists whose businesses rely on NHS patients have warned that they are struggling to stay afloat with so few patients coming through the door. \nUnder strict Covid protocols, treatment rooms must be thoroughly cleaned between patients and need to be left empty for a period of time after some procedures.    \nThis has cut the number of patients dentists can see, and those who rely on slim margins from NHS patients have warned that they may close their practices. \nProf Taylor warned that practices closing down would create an access problem for patients. \nMany of those that closed were likely to be the ones most dependant on NHS fees - often in poorer parts of big cities - he added. \nOne dentist told BBC Scotland the number of patients his practice could see in a day had been cut from 100 to 20. \nFewer patients, he said, meant less income. \n\"I think we are in a dental health crisis,\" said David McColl, of BDA Scotland.\n\"You might see more practices saying we can't afford to run a service like this with NHS funding and turn private.\n\"Then you'd have a two-tier system where if you can afford it you can get the treatment, if you can't, you won't.\"\nHe added: \"We want to get back to treating our patients and have a fair system that is not target-driven.\n\"None of us wants this two-tier system - we need universal access for all\".\nBut the Scottish government has said it is committed to ensuring all NHS patients who want to access NHS dental services continue to receive treatment. \nScotland's chief dental officer, Tom Ferris, said that from 1 November all NHS treatments had been allowed again. \nHe said: \"If an NHS patient has been offered or provided with private dental treatment then their dentist must be able to confirm that all available and appropriate NHS alternative treatments have been discussed with the patient and informed consent obtained.\" \nMr Ferris added that where a dentist had decided to reduce or altogether withdraw their NHS dental service, then suitable alternative arrangements would be put in place for patients. \nOn the funding the government had made available to dentists during the pandemic, he said: \"The government is continuing to provide an unprecedented amount of financial support to ensure the continuity of NHS dental services.\" \nHe said payments worth up to \u00a312m per month were being made to support the incomes of NHS dental practices. \n\"As well as deploying the Scottish government budget for NHS dental services, we are investing an additional \u00a32.75m per month.\" \nHe added that dentists had been receiving a guaranteed income of 80% of gross fees during the pandemic, which had been increased to 85% from 1 November. \nPPE for dentists providing NHS care has also been provided through public money, where they previously provided this themselves. \nMr Ferris added that in December a 2.8% pay rise for dentists would be backdated to April. \n''We are working to ensure NHS dental services emerge from this crisis well placed to care for the oral health of the population and will continue to work collaboratively with the dental sector in developing a new model of care,\" he added."

currently the lowest since September - continue to improve.\nSome non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon.\nThe government said tight restrictions were still needed now to ensure a safe return to school, with the youngest pupils returning next week.\nBut the Conservatives said it was regrettable more opportunities were not given for businesses to reopen.\nPlaid Cymru said a \"stay local\" message was needed for as long as necessary.\nMr Drakeford told a press conference the new exercise rules did not mean it was \"permissible for people to drive somewhere to exercise\".\n\"It does mean exercise, not socialising,\" he said.\nThe rules do not apply in private gardens, where households are still banned from meeting up, barring support bubbles.\nFrom 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to hold wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, in line with current rules for register offices.\nMore elite athletes will be able to return to training, although it is not clear from when, while more visits to care homes are also being considered.\nTalks are taking place about reopening tourism in time for Easter, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely to be the priority.\nFriday's announcement is the latest three-week review of of the coronavirus lockdown imposed in Wales before Christmas.\nChildren aged between three and seven - those in the foundation phase - are returning to school from Monday.\nThe next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March.\nThat includes years 11 and 13, and students doing similar qualifications in college, returning in a \"safe and flexible way\", Education Minister Kirsty Williams said.\nShe added there could be some \"flexibility\" for years 12 and year 10, who have been entered for qualifications.\nThe next review of Wales lockdown rules is due around 12 March.\nMr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: \"If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'.\"  \nHe said it was \"too uncertain\" to say how far restrictions on movement might be eased, but he suggested a \"stay local\" arrangement, similar to local lockdowns which were imposed in the autumn, was a possibility. \nThe managing director of a spa in Caerphilly said she was \"really happy\" to hear close contact services may reopen in three weeks.\nBut Sarah Bruton said: \"We've been down the road before with Mark Drakeford - we've learnt the hard way not to hope too much.\n\"I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet.\"\nBut a caravan park owner said he was \"buzzing\" at the prospect of an Easter reopening.\nEd Williams, of Llansantffraid in Powys, said: \"It's the best news we've had all winter.\"\nDiscussions are taking place over allowing non-essential retailers, such as shops and hairdressers, to reopen by the middle of March. \nMr Drakeford warned there would not be a \"wholesale\" reopening of shops.\nCardiff University virologist Richard Stanton said he was concerned about the prospect of parts of the retail sector opening in three weeks. \nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"We are seeing the schools reopening fairly soon, we know that is likely to push transmission rates up slightly.\n\"I think if you add the opening of non-essential retail onto that as well we might see quite significant increases in the rates of virus transmission.\"\nElsewhere in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England will exit lockdown \"cautiously\" - a road map for easing restrictions is expected on Monday.\nIn Northern Ireland lockdown has been extended to 1 April, while in Scotland most lockdown measures are due to remain in place until the end of February.\nSpeaking at the press conference, Mr Drakeford played down any imminent reopening for pubs, restaurants and cafes.\nHe said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods over the next six weeks.\nHe added the hospitality industry did not want a \"stop-start\" reopening: \"They don't want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close.\"\nThere are no plans to reopen gyms in Wales.\nMr Drakeford said advice from scientists was the Kent variant of coronavirus made doing so \"more challenging\".\nBoth gyms and hospitality are listed as being of greater risk to reopen than non-essential retail in a plan for coming out of lockdown, published on Friday.\nThe  control plan suggested it was not clear what impact easing restrictions will have with rising concern over variants of the virus.\n\"The early signs are very promising that the vaccines will reduce transmission, but we need more evidence for this to be clear,\" the plan said.\nEarlier Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool.\nThe Welsh Government said one in three adults in Wales has been vaccinated - latest figures show 839,065 people had been given their first dose in Wales.\nThe case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas.\nIt now stands at 84 cases per 100,000 people over seven days.\nWales went into lockdown on 20 December, after a rise in cases blamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus.\nThe rules mean non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home except for work, exercise and other essential reasons.\nPubs and restaurants are closed and non-essential shops are shut.\nSpeaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave is being \"baked into what will happen during this year\".\nHe said he was \"not going to say to anybody\" that another lockdown would not be needed.\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the moves to re-open schools but was concerned that not enough was being done for businesses. \n\"We know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and students' educational pathway\".\n\"What I think is regrettable is that the First Minister didn't open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work\".\n\"I think that's an opportunity that's been missed\".\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the \"direction of travel is an incredibly positive one\" but he was still concerned about Covid variants.\n\"We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today,\" he said.\n\"The government's own advisors, as well as the TAC report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths\".\n\"So we have to be careful, because we don't yet know the effect of the new variants that are that are currently dominant in Wales\".\nPrior to the announcement Abolish the Assembly Party leader Richard Suchorzewski called for Mr Drakeford to make changes on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets and other essential retailers.\n\"At the very least, he should allow the people of Wales to have the same rights to purchase what he regards as 'non-essential items' e.g. jumpers, shoes and underwear, as they are allowed to in English supermarkets,\" he said.\nWhile Welsh shops are expected to close aisles selling goods deemed non-essential \"if reasonably practicable\", English stores can keep them open.\nHow has coronavirus affected you?

      "text": "It would be \"reckless\" to bring back all pupils in England to school together on 8 March, says a joint statement by teachers' unions. \nRather than risk another \"spike\" in infections, they are calling for a more \"cautious\" and \"phased\" return.\nNine teachers' and head teachers' unions have urged the government to commit to that date only if scientific evidence is clear that it is safe. \nThe prime minister will announce the plan for reopening schools on Monday.\nThe collective statement from education unions says they are committed to bringing children back into the classroom as soon as possible - but have concerns it may lead to another surge in the virus. \nThey say they are \"increasingly concerned that the government is minded to order a full return of all pupils on Monday 8 March\".\nThat has been the target since the prime minister announced the date in January.\nThe teachers' unions argue that uncertainty about the role that schools play in the transmission of the virus should mean a more cautious approach.\nA full return would mean 10 million pupils and staff travelling to and from school each day, says a statement from signatories including the biggest classroom union the National Education Union.\nThey call for an \"opening phased over a period of time\", similar to the \"approach being taken in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\". \n\"It allows public health experts to assess the impact of the first phase before moving to the next,\" say the teachers' unions.\nThe decisions on England's return to school will be announced on Monday, when the prime minister will set out his \"road map\" for reopening after lockdown.\nThis is expected to be accompanied by a series of announcements on schools in the following days - with funding for catch-up classes, details of how testing will work and how cancelled GCSEs and A-levels will be replaced this summer.\nThere have been suggestions that after initial Covid tests in school, testing will be carried out at home by parents.\nThere will be new guidance on face masks, which could see them being worn in secondary schools where social distancing is not possible.\nThe nine unions signing up to the joint statement are the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), GMB, National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), NASUWT, National Education Union (NEU), National Governance Association (NGA), Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA), Unison, and Unite.\nOn Thursday, the ASCL head teachers' union had warned that it would not be practical to carry out Covid tests on all secondary pupils if they arrived back together.\nIn response, England's Department for Education said: \"We know schools, parents and pupils need clarity on plans as soon as possible, which is why we have committed to providing two weeks' notice for them to prepare.\n\"The prime minister is due to set out plans for schools reopening on 22 February, and pupils will return from 8 March at the earliest.\"\nIn Scotland and Wales, younger primary school year groups will begin to return from 22 February. Older primary pupils in Wales could begin to return from 15 March.\nIn Northern Ireland, younger primary pupils will return to classrooms on 8 March.\nThey will then go back to remote learning on 22 March, with the return then of secondary pupils in exam years until the Easter holidays."

      "text": "Dubai's royal family says Princess Latifa is \"being cared for at home\" after the BBC obtained videos in which she accused them of holding her hostage since she tried to flee in 2018. \n\"She continues to improve and we are hopeful she will return to public life at the appropriate time,\" said a statement from the royal family. \nIn the secretly recorded videos, the princess said she feared for her life. \nThe footage prompted global calls for a UN investigation.\nThe UN human rights agency has asked the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to provide proof that the princess is still alive. \nBut there was no video or photo released with the family's statement which could serve as proof of life, nor did it give any details about her condition. \nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the BBC he would look into the case, adding: \"We take human rights seriously, we will closely monitor the situation. Across the board, with adversaries, competitors, with partners and allies alike... we take human rights seriously and the president has put it at the heart of our foreign policy and countries can expect us to follow through on that.\" \nThe head of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, described the family's statement as a \"cover story\" and said no-one would believe Dubai's royals until Latifa had \"the freedom to speak for herself\".\nThe FreeLatifa campaign said similar statements from the royal family had been given in the past and could not be trusted.\nIn a statement, campaigners said they feared the Dubai authorities may have subjected her to \"torture and drugging\".\n\"It is now critically urgent that an independent team from the United Nations travel to Dubai and be able to visit Latifa immediately, and that they insist that Latifa is brought to safety in a country of her choosing,\" the FreeLatifa campaign said. \nThe royal family's response came via the UAE embassy in London.\n\"In response to media reports regarding Sheikha Latifa, we want to thank those who have expressed concern for her wellbeing, despite the coverage which certainly is not reflective of the actual position,\" it said in a statement. \n\"Her family has confirmed that Her Highness is being cared for at home, supported by her family and medical professionals.\"\nPrincess Latifa's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is one of the richest heads of state in the world, the ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the UAE.\nWith the help of friends, Princess Latifa tried to flee Dubai to start a new life in February 2018.\n\"I'm not allowed to drive, I'm not allowed to travel or leave Dubai at all,\" she said in a video recorded just before her escape.\nBut days later, the princess was captured by commandos on a boat in the Indian Ocean. She was flown back to Dubai, where she has remained ever since.\nHer father said he was acting in her best interests. Dubai and the UAE have previously said Princess Latifa was safe in the care of family.\nWatch the Missing Princess on BBC iPlayer\nBut using a phone she said she was secretly given about a year after her capture, Princess Latifa recorded a number of videos over several months. \nShe recorded them in a bathroom as it had the only door she could lock. In the messages, she detailed how:\nOn Friday the UN human rights office said it had approached the UAE's permanent mission in Geneva. \n\"We raised our concerns about the situation in light of the disturbing video evidence that emerged this week,\" Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, told a news briefing. \n\"We have asked for a proof of life - we have asked for further information.\" \nResponding to the Dubai royal family's response, Human Rights Watch director Kenneth Roth said in a statement that Sheikh Mohammed \"must have an odd definition of 'care'\".\n\"When Latifa was able to communicate, we know he kept her locked up in prolonged solitary confinement - a form of torture,\" Roth said. \"We can only imagine how that 'care' has degenerated now that his cruel conduct has been exposed.\"\nHe added: \"No one will believe Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum about his feigned 'care' until he frees Latifa. Only when she is out from under his thumb will she have the freedom to speak for herself.\""

      "tags": "Keir Starmer,Labour Party,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Millions of savers would be given a chance to invest in the UK's recovery from the coronavirus crisis, under proposals set out by Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe Labour leader's British Recovery Bond scheme is the centrepiece of his alternative plan for \"national recovery\", ahead of 3 March's Budget.\nHe also proposed start-up loans for 100,000 new small firms, especially in areas outside the South-East.\nThe Conservatives said Sir Keir had stolen most of his ideas from them.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak will set out the government's plans to haul the UK economy out of the deepest recession in 300 years in his Budget speech next month.\nBut Sir Keir said the Conservatives were \"incapable of seizing this moment\", adding: \"All we can expect from this government is more of the same. Labour would choose a different path.\"\nThe government said it has spent \u00a3280bn to help the economy through the pandemic, including tax breaks, grants and wage support for workers. \nBut Sir Keir told the BBC people would have to \"judge the government on its record\", with 10 years of \"weakening of our foundations, the pulling money out of our public services, the underfunding of the NHS and the failure to fix care homes\".\nIn an interview with the BBC's deputy political editor, Vicki Young, the Labour leader said: \"You can't clap your keyworkers during a pandemic, then go back to business as usual and that is where this government will head.\n\"The first step has to be a recovery and a thriving economy, and if you put taxes up or you go for austerity, you will throttle that [before] you have even got to first base.\"\n\"We have been through too much here and there is a parallel with [World War Two], where people have been through sacrifice and solidarity and they want a better future, and that is what I am setting out the path to.\"\nConservative Party co-chair Amanda Milling, accused Labour of stealing her party's policies, adding: \"After 10 months of Keir Starmer, all Labour has to offer is others' ideas, empty rhetoric and calling for things the government is already doing.\"\nThe main policy the Labour leader put forward was a British Recovery Bond.\nA Labour government would offer people a savings account with the government at a competitive interest rate - similar to the previous National Savings and Investments bonds.\nThe cash raised would then be spent on rebuilding the country post-Covid. \nIt comes off the back of figures from the Bank of England, which showed households had accumulated over \u00a3125bn in excess savings by November 2020 - estimated to hit \u00a3250bn by June 2021 - but with only around 5% of the savings expected to be spent, with much of the rest sitting in savings accounts. \nSir Keir said this money could be used to \"invest in local communities, jobs and businesses\", as well as providing security for savers and giving \"millions of people a proper stake in Britain's future\".\nThe Conservatives said the policy was the same as one proposed by the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, although that group's \"Northern Recovery Bond\" plan is not government policy. \nBut speaking to the BBC, Sir Keir said the chancellor was instead \"pinning a lot of hope on the idea that those who have saved during the pandemic... are going to spend all that money in the short term\".\nHe added: \"I don't think that is realistic and I don't think the Bank of England does. What the bond does is provide a way for people to invest in the future of their country in a secure way, and obviously then releases money for infrastructure projects.\"\nThe pandemic has blurred political lines over the last year.\nThe Conservatives have been forced to become big-spending big government.\nMeanwhile, Labour has been stuck between being criticised for being too supportive and, when it has been critical, being accused of carping from the sidelines.\nThe point of this speech was to take voters out of the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and remind them of the party politics of before.\nAlthough, of course, not exactly those politics, as this was also an opportunity for Sir Keir to address some of the pressure to start setting out his vision for Labour.\nSo, there was a promise of continuing with significant government intervention in the economy but also of financial responsibility and of making business \"pivotal\".\nThe big policy reveal of the speech -  British Recovery Bonds - neatly sums ups the aims Sir Keir set out of long-term investment, partnership and giving people a stake in society.\nBut it relies on those who have been left better off from the pandemic, rather than the many who have not. \nSaving bonds are also known for being pretty low risk.\nThe choice of this as a policy to unveil is unlikely to pacify those who would like to see Labour being more radical.\nSir Keir also proposed to provide an extra \u00a31bn of funding for the Start Up Loans Company, which provides finance for people wanting to launch their own businesses.\nThe Labour leader said the scheme had offered less than 9,500 loans per year since it started in 2012, with nearly \u00a31 in \u00a34 going into London - compared to just 5.7% going to the North East.\nSir Keir said targeting existing funding and tweaking the scheme would help to create 100,000 small businesses across the country.\nThe Labour leader also reiterated his party's calls for the government to:\nA Budget had been expected to take place in autumn last year, but it was delayed until next month because of the coronavirus pandemic. \nCovid restrictions have prompted the government to spend billions in unprecedented interventions aimed at keeping the economy afloat during the crisis.\nThis has pushed up UK debt to \u00a32.13 trillion, equivalent to 99.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. \nThe chancellor is under pressure from MPs and industry groups to extend support measures, but also to spell out when and how the UK's debts can be paid down.

      "text": "An illness suffered by soldiers who took part in the Gulf War was not caused by inhaling depleted uranium, according to a scientific study.\nInstead, researchers believe Gulf War syndrome may be due to soldiers being exposed to the nerve agent sarin.\nThe Royal British Legion said a lack of understanding of the condition has had a \"serious impact\" on veterans.\nThe Ministry of Defence said it has no plans to conduct further studies but would monitor any research published.\nResearchers estimate around 250,000 Gulf War veterans could be living with the syndrome - which can cause symptoms such as insomnia and memory problems.\nFormer soldier Kerry Fuller was a fit 26 year old who loved outdoor activities prior to the 1991 war.\nHe suffered a stroke at 40 and now says he is so ill, it is hard just to get out of bed. \n\"My whole world and way of being changed just like that,\" he told the BBC's Caroline Hawley. \"And there's no going back. The damage is done and my ailments are only getting worse.\n\"I think myself and the thousands of other veterans would just like an acknowledgment, and being able to then move forward with the knowledge of what caused things, to access the correct treatment.\"\nScientists have been trying to work out for years what could be the cause of Gulf War syndrome.\nOne popular theory was that soldiers had become ill after exposure to depleted uranium in tank shells. \nResearchers from the University of Portsmouth tested those with the condition to examine levels of residual depleted uranium in their bodies.\nThey say their study \"conclusively proves\" that none of them were exposed to any significant amounts.\nProfessor Randall Parrish said the results of the study would \"surprise many\" who have long suspected that exposure to the chemical could have contributed to their illness.\nResearchers now believe the most likely culprit is exposure to the nerve agent sarin - which was released into the atmosphere when Iraqi chemical weapons caches were bombed. \nThey say steps meant to protect the soldiers could have compounded the problem - including anti-nerve agent medication and the extensive use of pesticides.\nPesticides were sprayed on tents and other equipment such as uniforms, and were used on skin as an insect repellent during the war to prevent malaria exposure.\n\"Being able to debunk the alleged connection between this illness and this radioactive substance allows the medical community to focus more clearly on what the likely causes actually are,\" Prof Parrish said. \n\"Finding causes is a nebulous game when you have so many options to blame. \n\"The allies' own activities destroying an Iraqi nerve agent cache or spraying pesticides liberally on troops could be seen in hindsight as an inadvertent 'own goal' and one to be avoided in future conflicts.\n\"It is important to find causes for conditions like this, even if it takes a long time and the causes might be controversial.\"\nThe Royal British Legion said research suggested up to 33,000 UK Gulf War veterans could be living with the syndrome, with 1,300 claiming a war pension for conditions connected to their service.\nAndy Pike, head of policy and research at the charity, said: \"Whilst we welcome further research that helps to improve our knowledge of the experiences faced by Gulf War veterans, there has been little meaningful research published in the UK concerning effective treatment for those suffering from Gulf War illnesses.\n\"It is likely this lack of understanding has had a serious impact, leaving many veterans living with debilitating conditions 30 years after the end of combat operations.\"\nA Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \"We are indebted to all those who served our country in the Gulf wars and have already sponsored significant research into the effects of this conflict on veterans.\n\"Although we have no plans to conduct further studies, we continue to monitor any Gulf War research that is published around the world.\"\nDid you serve in the Gulf War in 1990-91?

      "tags": "Mars,Nasa,Geology,European Space Agency,Nasa Perseverance Mars rover,Space exploration",
      "text": "There's a new robot on the surface of Mars.\nThe American space agency has successfully landed its Perseverance rover in a deep crater near the planet's equator called Jezero.\n\"The good news is the spacecraft, I think, is in great shape,\" said Matt Wallace, the mission's deputy project manager.\nEngineers at Nasa's mission control in California erupted with joy when the confirmation of touchdown came through.\nThe six-wheeled vehicle will now spend at least the next two years drilling into the local rocks, looking for evidence of past life.\nJezero is thought to have held a giant lake billions of years ago. And where there's been water, there's the possibility there might also have been life.\nThe signal alerting controllers that Perseverance was down and safe arrived at 20:55 GMT. In the past they might have hugged and high-fived but strict coronavirus protocols meant they had all been separated by Perspex screens. A respectful fist bump was about all they could manage.  \nNonetheless, the excitement was evident. And the applause continued when the first two images came in. They were taken by low-resolution engineering cameras. There was dust covering the still-attached translucent lens covers, but it was possible to see a flat surface both in front and behind the rover.\nPost-landing analysis indicated the vehicle had come down about 2km to the south east of the delta feature in Jezero that Perseverance plans to investigate.\n\"We are in a nice flat spot. The vehicle is only tilted by about 1.2 degrees,\" said Allen Chen, who led the landing team. \"So we did successfully find that parking lot and have a safe rover on the ground. And I couldn't be more proud of my team for doing that.\"\nSteve Jurczyk, the acting administrator at Nasa, also saluted the achievement: \"What a credit to the team. Just what an amazing team to work through all the adversity and all the challenges that go with landing a rover on Mars, plus the challenges of Covid. Just an amazing accomplishment.\"\nAnd Mike Watkins, the director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the home of the agency's Mars missions, added: \"There is something special about the first few days (of the mission) because we have just landed a representative of Planet Earth on a place on Mars that no-one has ever been to.\"\nLanding on Mars is never easy, and even though Nasa has become expert at it, everyone on the Perseverance team had spoken with great caution going into Thursday.\nThis is the second one-tonne rover put on Mars by the US space agency. \nThe first, Curiosity, was landed in a different crater in 2012. It trialled innovative descent technologies, including a rocket-powered cradle, that Perseverance has also now put to good effect.\nControllers will spend the coming days commissioning the new rover, checking whether any of its systems were damaged in what would have been a rough ride to the ground.\nPerseverance's mast, with its main camera system, must be raised. The software that got the vehicle to Mars's surface must now be exchanged for a software system that enables the robot to drive across that surface.\nAbove all, expect Perseverance to take many pictures in the next week or so as engineers and scientists seek to assess the nature of the nearby terrain.\nOne near-term objective will be to run a helicopter experiment. Perseverance carried with it a mini-chopper that will attempt to make the first powered flight in another world - what might be described as a \"Wright Brothers moment\" for Mars.\nOnly after this will the robot get on with the serious business of its mission. It will head to that vast delta feature detected by satellites. \nDeltas are built by rivers as they push out into a wider body of water and dump their sediment. Scientists are hoping that incorporated into the material that built Jezero's delta are the tell-tale signatures of past biology. \nPerseverance will sample the base of the delta and then move towards the rim of the crater. It's at the rim that satellites have detected carbonate rocks, which on Earth are particularly good at trapping biological activity.\nPerseverance has a suite of instruments that will examine all these formations in detail, down to the microscopic level.\nForty-five-km-wide Jezero displays multiple rock types, including clays and carbonates, that have the potential to preserve the type of organic molecules that would hint at life's bygone existence.\nParticularly enticing is the \"bathtub ring\" of sediments laid down at what would have been the ancient lake's shoreline. It's here that Perseverance could find what on Earth are called stromatolites.\n\"In some lakes you can get microbial mats and carbonates interacting to form these big structures, these large layered mounds,\" explained science team-member Dr Briony Horgan from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.\n\"If we see anything like that kind of structure in Jezero, we'll be making a beeline straight for it because that could be the holy grail of Mars astrobiology,\" she told BBC News.\nPerseverance's most interesting rock finds will be packaged into small tubes to be left on the surface.\nNasa and the European Space Agency (Esa) have devised a multi-billion-dollar plan to go fetch these cylinders towards the end of the decade.\nIt will be a complex endeavour involving a second rover, a Mars rocket and a huge satellite to ship the Jezero materials home.\nReturning samples is the logical - and necessary - next step in Mars exploration.\nEven if Perseverance discovers something that looks like a bio-signature, the evidence is almost certain to be contested - as claims for ancient life's traces here on Earth usually are.\nBringing rocks back for further, more sophisticated analysis is therefore likely to be the only way any arguments about past biology on the Red Planet will be settled. \nClick here to see how Nasa and Esa will bring rocks from Mars to Earth."

Police moved in once enough evidence had been gathered from a surveillance operation at the site. \nBody-worn footage showed armed officers breaking into storage units where the drugs had been due to be delivered.\nThe Met's Det Supt Simon Moring believes officers have cost organised criminals more than \u00a3100m in profits. \nHe said: \"By the time that's divided down into deals we could be talking about five million drug deals. \n\"That's five million deals taken off the streets of the UK - that will have a profound effect on the price in the UK and the criminals involved.\"\nJohn Coles, head of specialist operations at the NCA, said: \"Illegal drugs are a corrosive threat and those who deal in cocaine are often violent and exploitative.\n\"Cocaine supply is directly linked to the use of firearms, knife crime and the exploitation of young and vulnerable people.\"\nThe consignment is equivalent to more than half the quantity of cocaine seized in an average year.\nAbout 4,200kg of the drug was intercepted in the year to March 2020. \nFor more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel."

      "text": "Coronavirus infections are continuing to decrease around the UK, Office for National Statistics data shows. \nThe figures, for the seven days up to 12 February, reveal fewer people are testing positive for the virus in the community than in recent weeks.\nExperts warn that infection levels remain high however, with about 553,000 people found to have the virus. \nAnd another 533 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.\nIt brings the UK total to 119,920. \nDaily figures show there were a further 12,027 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Friday. \nMore than 16.8 million people have had their first COVID vaccine dose, while 589,591 have had a second jab, bringing the total number of shots since the rollout began to nearly 17.5m.\nThe latest R number, estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.9, also suggests infection numbers are shrinking. It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 6 and 9 other people.\nOther studies of infection rates have shown a similar \"strong\" decline.\nThe ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest:\nIn England, there is some regional variation in the infection rate, although it is decreasing in all areas. \nNorth-west England had the highest proportion of people of any region in England likely to test positive for coronavirus - at around one in 85 people.\nFor London the estimate was one in 100, and for the West Midlands it was one in 110.\nElsewhere, the estimates are:\nIt comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to receive new data on the effect of vaccines on the spread of coronavirus, ahead of Monday's publication of a roadmap for easing the lockdown in England.\nDowning Street has refused to comment on the likely contents of the unlocking plan amid press speculation.\nThe Welsh government has already announced some changes. From Saturday, four people from two different households will be allowed to exercise outdoors together. And from Monday, children in Wales aged between three and seven are returning to school - as are young children in Scotland.\nExperts say any unlocking should be done slowly and cautiously to avoid a rebound surge in cases. There is still plenty of the virus circulating that people can catch. \nProf Neil Ferguson, whose modelling prompted the first lockdown last March, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was hopeful more restrictions could be lifted by the end of May. \n\"We will still have rules in place but... I think society will be a lot more normal.\"\nMeanwhile, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said it was wrong to speculate on whether summer holidays will be allowed this year: \"I get how frustrating this is, it's completely natural. We all want to get a break from this, I get that. But it would wrong for me to start speculating now.\n\"We are assessing the numbers, we are making a judgment based on the science and we will be making an announcement on Monday. I can't go further than that.\"\nA continued fall in new infections is one of the reassuring signs PM Boris Johnson will be considering this weekend, along with advisers, to decide if, when and how to start lifting some restrictions in England. \nR is below 1, even with more infectious variants of the virus circulating, which is good news too. \nBut within the wider UK figures there are some regional differences that are worth keeping an eye on. Infection rates appear to be higher in some urban areas of England, for example. \nLessons from last year tell us that the virus can take off again if you unlock too quickly or too soon. 'One size fits all' may not be the best approach for every type of easing, although a shared priority is to get children back to school. "

      "tags": "Mars,Nasa,Geology,European Space Agency,Nasa Perseverance Mars rover,Space exploration",
      "text": "There's a new robot on the surface of Mars.\nThe American space agency has successfully landed its Perseverance rover in a deep crater near the planet's equator called Jezero.\n\"The good news is the spacecraft, I think, is in great shape,\" said Matt Wallace, the mission's deputy project manager.\nEngineers at Nasa's mission control in California erupted with joy when the confirmation of touchdown came through.\nThe six-wheeled vehicle will now spend at least the next two years drilling into the local rocks, looking for evidence of past life.\nJezero is thought to have held a giant lake billions of years ago. And where there's been water, there's the possibility there might also have been life.\nThe signal alerting controllers that Perseverance was down and safe arrived at 20:55 GMT. In the past they might have hugged and high-fived but strict coronavirus protocols meant they had all been separated by Perspex screens. A respectful fist bump was about all they could manage.  \nNonetheless, the excitement was evident. And the applause continued when the first two images came in. They were taken by low-resolution engineering cameras. There was dust covering the still-attached translucent lens covers, but it was possible to see a flat surface both in front and behind the rover.\nPost-landing analysis indicated the vehicle had come down about 2km to the south east of the delta feature in Jezero that Perseverance plans to investigate.\n\"We are in a nice flat spot. The vehicle is only tilted by about 1.2 degrees,\" said Allen Chen, who led the landing team. \"So we did successfully find that parking lot and have a safe rover on the ground. And I couldn't be more proud of my team for doing that.\"\nSteve Jurczyk, the acting administrator at Nasa, also saluted the achievement: \"What a credit to the team. Just what an amazing team to work through all the adversity and all the challenges that go with landing a rover on Mars, plus the challenges of Covid. Just an amazing accomplishment.\"\nAnd Mike Watkins, the director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the home of the agency's Mars missions, added: \"There is something special about the first few days (of the mission) because we have just landed a representative of Planet Earth on a place on Mars that no-one has ever been to.\"\nLanding on Mars is never easy, and even though Nasa has become expert at it, everyone on the Perseverance team had spoken with great caution going into Thursday.\nThis is the second one-tonne rover put on Mars by the US space agency. \nThe first, Curiosity, was landed in a different crater in 2012. It trialled innovative descent technologies, including a rocket-powered cradle, that Perseverance has also now put to good effect.\nControllers will spend the coming days commissioning the new rover, checking whether any of its systems were damaged in what would have been a rough ride to the ground.\nPerseverance's mast, with its main camera system, must be raised. The software that got the vehicle to Mars's surface must now be exchanged for a software system that enables the robot to drive across that surface.\nAbove all, expect Perseverance to take many pictures in the next week or so as engineers and scientists seek to assess the nature of the nearby terrain.\nOne near-term objective will be to run a helicopter experiment. Perseverance carried with it a mini-chopper that will attempt to make the first powered flight in another world - what might be described as a \"Wright Brothers moment\" for Mars.\nOnly after this will the robot get on with the serious business of its mission. It will head to that vast delta feature detected by satellites. \nDeltas are built by rivers as they push out into a wider body of water and dump their sediment. Scientists are hoping that incorporated into the material that built Jezero's delta are the tell-tale signatures of past biology. \nPerseverance will sample the base of the delta and then move towards the rim of the crater. It's at the rim that satellites have detected carbonate rocks, which on Earth are particularly good at trapping biological activity.\nPerseverance has a suite of instruments that will examine all these formations in detail, down to the microscopic level.\nForty-five-km-wide Jezero displays multiple rock types, including clays and carbonates, that have the potential to preserve the type of organic molecules that would hint at life's bygone existence.\nParticularly enticing is the \"bathtub ring\" of sediments laid down at what would have been the ancient lake's shoreline. It's here that Perseverance could find what on Earth are called stromatolites.\n\"In some lakes you can get microbial mats and carbonates interacting to form these big structures, these large layered mounds,\" explained science team-member Dr Briony Horgan from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.\n\"If we see anything like that kind of structure in Jezero, we'll be making a beeline straight for it because that could be the holy grail of Mars astrobiology,\" she told BBC News.\nPerseverance's most interesting rock finds will be packaged into small tubes to be left on the surface.\nNasa and the European Space Agency (Esa) have devised a multi-billion-dollar plan to go fetch these cylinders towards the end of the decade.\nIt will be a complex endeavour involving a second rover, a Mars rocket and a huge satellite to ship the Jezero materials home.\nReturning samples is the logical - and necessary - next step in Mars exploration.\nEven if Perseverance discovers something that looks like a bio-signature, the evidence is almost certain to be contested - as claims for ancient life's traces here on Earth usually are.\nBringing rocks back for further, more sophisticated analysis is therefore likely to be the only way any arguments about past biology on the Red Planet will be settled. \nClick here to see how Nasa and Esa will bring rocks from Mars to Earth."

      "title": "The man who taught Uber how to say sorry",
      "tags": "Companies,Lyft,Uber,Long Reads,Customer service",
      "text": "When the Uber he'd hired went to the wrong destination, one professor took his complaint to the very top - and then learned something valuable about the science of apologising.\nIn January 2017, John List was due to give a keynote speech at a prestigious gathering of economists. He picked up his phone and, using the Uber app, booked a cab to take him the 30-minute journey from his home. He looked up briefly, as the car sped along Lake Shore Drive, on the banks of Lake Michigan, and took in the view of the approaching city, with its fabulous skyline of skyscrapers. Then he settled back down to work on his talk.\nAbout 20 minutes later he looked up again. Surely he must be nearly there now? \"Oh no!!\" he screamed. He was back where he'd begun. Something had gone wrong with the Uber app, which had instructed the driver to return to the professor's home. She had not wanted to disturb him, as he was so engrossed in his work.\nList was understandably furious. But what made him more so, was that Uber never sent him an apology.  \nNot everyone who has a complaint to make with Uber has access to its chief executive, but John List did, and so he rang Travis Kalanick that evening. (This was not long before Kalanick was forced to step down as a result of shareholder pressure, following a series of controversies over company practices including its handling of sexual harassment allegations.)\nAfter List had related the tale, and let off a bit of steam, Kalanick spoke. \"What I want to know,\" he said, \"is how Uber should apologise when this sort of cock-up occurs.  What's the best way to keep Uber customers loyal, even when they've had a miserable experience?\"\nHow to apologise is a question which every company is interested to know the answer. And John List was in a unique position to find out.\nNot many people with John List's background become leading academics. He grew up in a working class family in Sun Prairie, north-east of the Wisconsin capital Madison. His Dad was a lorry driver and expected his son to enter the family business. John had other ideas. His dream was to become a professional golfer and he won a golf scholarship to college. There he discovered two things: first, he wasn't as good at golf as he had once thought, and second, he was fascinated by economics.\nHe's now on the economics faculty at one of America's top universities, the University of Chicago. But for a few years he's also been moonlighting, because Uber approached him to be their chief economist, and after he moved on from Uber, he joined another car-riding app, Lyft, where he holds the same position.\nNo doubt the job is generously remunerated, but for John List it has another appeal; for data geeks, car apps are like gold mines - in the US alone, before the pandemic, there were two million Uber drivers, making tens of millions of trips each week. John List has spent his career studying economic behaviour in the real world, so working with Uber \"was a dream come true\". With this cornucopia of information, he could analyse all sorts of consumer preferences: what kinds of cars people like, how far they typically travelled, and at what times, how they responded to a change in the price of fares. He could also learn the best way to apologise.\nHis first step was to look at what happened to Uber users after they had had a bad ride - one that had taken much longer than the app had initially predicted. The app might predict, for example, that a journey would take nine minutes, and it would end up taking 23 minutes. By crunching the numbers, he and his collaborators discovered that riders who'd experienced such a bad ride would spend up to 10% less on Uber in the future. That represented a significant loss of earnings for the car app.\nThe next move was to come up with a variety of apologies, and to randomly try them out on those who'd experienced a bad trip.\nIt turns out there's a sort of science of sorry. Social scientists - and psychologists in particular - have studied what kinds of apologies work. But John List had a big advantage; he could actually measure the impact.\nHe calls one type of sorry, the \"basic apology\" - \"We note that your trip took longer than we predicted and we sincerely apologise.\" A more sophisticated apology involves an admission that the company messed up. Another type of apology involves a commitment - \"We will try to ensure that this will not happen again.\"  \nOn Uber's behalf, John List tried them all. What's more, with some of these apologies Uber offered a $5 discount off the next trip. In the experiment there was also a group of Uber customers who received no apology at all.\nThe result was surprising. On their own, apologies in whatever form proved ineffective. But an apology coupled with the $5 coupon kept many people loyal. \"So, we end up bringing back millions of dollars by assuaging consumers with an apology and a coupon.\"\nWhat consumers want, it turns out, is for a company to demonstrate its remorse by taking a material financial hit. But looking deeper into the stats, List realised that even this device ceased to work if there was a second or third bad trip. Indeed, a second or third apology only seemed to alienate customers further.\nThese are invaluable insights for Uber, and for other businesses too.\nMany economists sit at their desks and make predictions about economic activity based on their models. What makes John List a little unusual for an economist is that he likes to test theories out in the real world. He's conducted experiments from Tanzania, to New Zealand, China to Bangladesh.  \nThe vast digital data sets held by Uber and other car apps have enabled him to identify certain quirks in human behaviour that armchair economists might not have uncovered. For example, when you book an Uber you never know whether you'll get a male or female driver, so you might expect male and female drivers to earn the same. But in fact, male drivers earn about 7% more per hour than their female counterparts. Shocked by this disparity, List set about trying to find out the reason for it.  \nHe uncovered several explanations. One is that women tend to have more childcare responsibilities, so there are fewer female drivers available at lucrative times, such as morning and afternoon rush hour. But by far the most important factor turns out to be speed: Uber-driving men drive on average about 2.5% faster than Uber-driving women, so they give more rides per hour. \nThat's not the only gender gap. Because he thought it would make Uber drivers happier, List persuaded the Uber board to add a tipping function - bringing Uber in line with other car apps. He then studied tipping behaviour. For every $4 women give as a tip, it transpired, men give around $5. What's more, women drivers receive more tips than male drivers - except when those women drivers are 65 years old or older. I think we can take this as further evidence of male shallowness.\nThe study of economic behaviour through car app data has been called Ubernomics - though John List's box of data toys is now delivered to him by Lyft, not Uber - and he continues to produce a stream of fascinating results. Analysing the behaviour of Lyft users, he's recently computed the power of what he calls \"left-digit bias\". Cutting the price of a journey from $15 to $14.99 has roughly the same impact on consumer demand as reducing it from $15.99 to $15. \nSome of the discoveries in Ubernomics are unsurprising. Consumers care about price: the lower the cost, the more likely we are to book a cab. But the analysis of how we use car apps is also revealing some of the biases and idiosyncrasies of human economic behaviour.\nBy the way, if you ever decide to become an Uber driver, and think that being nice to the customer will have a significant impact on your income, there is some bad news. I'm afraid it won't. Even when customers rate one driver 10% higher than another for niceness, John List says, they both receive the same tip.\nWe are not used to the idea of machines making ethical decisions, but the day when they will routinely do this - by themselves - is fast approaching. So how, asks the BBC's David Edmonds, will we teach them to do the right thing?\nCan we teach robots ethics?"

      "tags": "Companies,Gig economy,UK Supreme Court,Employment,Pay,Uber,Self-employment",
      "text": "Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled.\nThe decision could mean thousands of Uber drivers are entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay.\nThe ruling could leave the ride-hailing app facing a hefty compensation bill, and have wider consequences for the gig economy. \nUber said the ruling centred on a small number of drivers and it had since made changes to its business. \nIn a long-running legal battle, Uber had finally appealed to the Supreme Court after losing three earlier rounds.\nUber's share price dipped as US trading began on Friday as investors grappled with what impact the London ruling could have on the firm's business model.\nIt is being challenged by its drivers in multiple countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. \nFormer Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam took Uber to an employment tribunal in 2016, arguing they worked for Uber. Uber said its drivers were self employed and it therefore was not responsible for paying any minimum wage nor holiday pay. \nThe two, who originally won an employment tribunal against the ride hailing app giant in October 2016, told the BBC they were \"thrilled and relieved\" by the ruling.\n\"I think it's a massive achievement in a way that we were able to stand up against a giant,\" said Mr Aslam, president of the App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU).\n\"We didn't give up and we were consistent - no matter what we went through emotionally or physically or financially, we stood our ground.\"\nUber appealed against the employment tribunal decision but the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the ruling in November 2017. \nThe company then took the case to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the ruling in December 2018.\nThe ruling on Friday was Uber's last appeal, as the Supreme Court is Britain's highest court, and it has the final say on legal matters. \nDelivering his judgement, Lord Leggatt said that the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed Uber's appeal that it was an intermediary party and stated that drivers should be considered to be working not only when driving a passenger, but whenever logged in to the app.\nThe court considered several elements in its judgement:\nLooking at these and other factors, the court determined that drivers were in a position of subordination to Uber where the only way they could increase their earnings would be to work longer hours.\nJamie Heywood, Uber's Regional General Manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, said: \"We respect the Court's decision which focussed on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016. \n\"Since then we have made some significant changes to our business, guided by drivers every step of the way. These include giving even more control over how they earn and providing new protections like free insurance in case of sickness or injury.  \n\"We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see.\"\nUber has long argued that it is a booking agent, which hires self-employed contractors that provide transport.\nBy not being classified as a transport provider, Uber is not currently paying 20% VAT on fares.\nThe Supreme Court ruled that Uber has to consider its drivers \"workers\" from the time they log on to the app, until they log off.\nThis is a key point because Uber drivers typically spend time waiting for people to book rides on the app.\nPreviously, the firm had said that if drivers were found to be workers, then it would only count the time during journeys when a passenger is in the car.\n\"This is a win-win-win for drivers, passengers and cities. It means Uber now has the correct economic incentives not to oversupply the market with too many vehicles and too many drivers,\" said James Farrar, ADCU's general secretary.\n\"The upshot of that oversupply has been poverty, pollution and congestion.\"\nMr Aslam, who claims Uber's practices forced him to leave the trade as he couldn't make ends meet, is considering becoming a driver for the app again. But he is upset that the ruling took so long.\n\"It took us six years to establish what we should have got in 2015. Someone somewhere, in the government or the regulator, massively let down these workers, many of whom are in a precarious position,\" he said.\nMr Farrar points out that with fares down 80% due to the pandemic, many drivers have been struggling financially and feel trapped in Uber's system.\n\"We're seeing many of our members earning \u00a330 gross a day right now,\" he said, explaining that the self-employment grants issued by the government only cover 80% of a driver's profits, which isn't even enough to pay for their costs.\n\"If we had these rights today, those drivers could at least earn a minimum wage to live on.\"\nThat remains to be seen, but it could potentially happen.\nWhen Uber listed its shares in the United States in 2019, its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) included a section on risks to its business.\nThe company said in this section that if it had to classify drivers as workers, it would \"incur significant additional expenses\" in compensating the drivers for things such as the minimum wage and overtime.\n\"Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition,\" it added.\nUber also wrote in the filing that if Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam were to win their case, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) would then classify the firm as a transport provider, and Uber would need to pay VAT on fares.\nThis relates to a judicial review filed by Jolyon Maugham QC in 2019. \nMr Maugham, a barrister specialising in tax and employment law, applied to HMRC to ask for a judicial review and that HMRC demand that Uber pay VAT. \n\"I tried to force the issue by suing Uber for a VAT receipt, because I thought that, that way, even if HMRC didn't want to charge Uber, I would be able to force it to,\" he told the BBC.\n\"The Supreme Court has fundamentally answered two questions at the same time: one is whether drivers are workers for Uber, and the other is whether Uber is liable to pay VAT to HMRC,\" said Mr Maugham, who also heads up campaign group The Good Law Project. \n\"It makes it extremely difficult for Uber to continue to resist paying what I understand to be more than \u00a31bn in VAT and interest.\"\nHMRC and Uber are still in dispute about the firm's VAT liability.\nTom Vickers is a senior lecturer in sociology at Nottingham Trent University and head of the Work Futures Research Group, which studies the jobs that people do and how they change over time.\nHe thinks the Supreme Court's ruling has wider implications for a lot of other gig economy workers like other private hire drivers, couriers and delivery drivers.\n\"The central point for me is that the ruling focuses on the control that companies exercise over people's labour - this control also carries with it responsibilities for their conditions and wellbeing.\n\"This is even more important in the context of the pandemic.\"\nAs for Uber, Rachel Mathieson, senior associate at Bates Wells, which represented Mr Farrar and Mr Aslam, said her firm's position was that the ruling applies to all 90,000 drivers who have been active with Uber since and including 2016.\n\"Our position is that the ruling applies to all of their drivers at large,\" she said.\nDr Alex Wood, an Internet Institute research associate on gig economy at Oxford University, disagrees.\nHe told the BBC that because the UK doesn't have a labour inspectorate, these \"rules aren't enforced and it falls to workers to bring subsequent tribunals\". \nThis means that \"in reality, it's very easy for Uber to just ignore this until more tribunals come for the remaining 40,000 [drivers]\".

Today's set of challenges - whether disease outbreaks or climate change - need bold, ambitious and innovative solutions.\n\"Led independently by our most exceptional scientists, this new agency will focus on identifying and funding the most cutting-edge research and technology at speed,\" Mr Kwarteng said.\nBoris Johnson's former senior adviser Dominic Cummings was a prominent supporter of \"blue-sky\" thinking by small groups of scientists, saying in 2019 funding should be given to \"high-risk high-payoff visions\".\nIt was the sale of the UK's artificial intelligence startup DeepMind to Google in 2014 which apparently got Dominic Cummings thinking.\nThe man who was to become Boris Johnson's chief advisor became obsessed with the idea that the UK was giving away its technological crown jewels.\nThe answer, he decided, was to create a British version of Arpa, the American agency credited with funding the development of the internet and GPS.\nDespite Mr Cummings' departure from Downing Street, the government has opted to go ahead with Aria, an agency designed to make big bets on risky projects.\nIt will have a tiny fraction of the budget of the existing research agency UKRI, which will carry on doing its job.\nBut Aria will apparently be independent, freed from bureaucracy and imbued with a Silicon Valley culture where failure is not to be feared.\nThe test, of course, will be whether there are also successes to celebrate.\nAria will be modelled on the influential US Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa), which supported research that led to the internet and GPS, and its successor Darpa, which funded the precursors to today's coronavirus vaccines.\nScience and innovation minister Amanda Solloway said: \"To rise to the challenges of the 21st Century, we need to equip our R&D community with a new scientific engine - one that embraces the idea that truly great successes come from taking great leaps into the unknown.\"\nRecruitment for a chief executive and chair for the agency will begin in the coming weeks.\nMatthew Fell, CBI UK chief policy director, said the UK had \"a unique opportunity to play to its strength\" with the new agency, to help create jobs, raise productivity and tackle the biggest challenges facing the country.\n\"Key to Aria's success will be strong business engagement to make sure the brilliant ideas developed can make it through to market,\" he added.\nSir Jim McDonald, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said: \"Engineering is central to an ambitious innovation agency of this kind, forming the bridge between research and innovation to enable technological and commercial breakthroughs.\"\nBut Labour shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said the agency needed to have a clear mandate and to be subject to Freedom of Information laws, to ensure transparency of funding. \n\"Labour has long called for investment in high ambition, high risk science,\" he said. \"But government must urgently clarify the mission and mandate of this new organisation, following strong engagement with the UK's science base - those closest to the work.\""

      "text": "Homes could be hit by flooding and power cuts as heavy rain and gale force winds are set to batter parts of south and mid Wales.\nThe Met Office's amber warning for rain is in place from 20:00 GMT on Friday until 18:00 on Saturday.\nThe forecaster said some communities could be cut off by flooded roads and travel disruption was expected.\nA second yellow warning - which is less severe - is in place for almost the whole of Wales until 02:00 on Sunday.\nOn Friday and into Saturday some areas could widely see up to up to 2.7in (70mm) of rain, with up to almost 8in (200mm) on the highest ground of the Brecon Beacons. \nEleven flood warnings - mainly in mid Wales - and a number of flood alerts have been issued by Natural Resources Wales, with the organisation saying river levels could rise during the prolonged downpours.\nBlaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Swansea and Torfaen are all covered by the amber warning.\nThe Met Office said heavy rain and wind could cause flooding, difficult driving conditions and fast flowing water could cause a \"danger to life\".\nThe yellow warning - which means the weather is likely to have some impact - is in place for almost all of Wales, apart from Anglesey and Flintshire."
