      "tags": "Sexual violence,Sarah Everard murder,Boris Johnson,Metropolitan Police Service,Cressida Dick",
      "text": "Women must feel their complaints about violence are \"properly heard\", the PM has said, after concern about how a vigil for Sarah Everard was policed.\nBoris Johnson said footage of officers forcibly removing a number of women from the event was \"distressing\".\nHe added it was \"fundamental\" that women felt listened to and he was \"going to make sure that happens\".\nAsked if he still had confidence in Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, Mr Johnson said: \"Yes I do.\"\n\"The reality is that the country is united still in shock and grief about what happened to Sarah Everard and we must do everything we can to find the answers,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"I think the fundamental issue that we have to address as a country, and as a society and as a government is that ... women in particular must feel that when they make serious complaints about violence, about assault, that they are properly heard.\n\"We are going to make sure that that happens.\"\nThe prime minister's comments come after criticism that a new policing bill does not go far enough to address violence against women and girls.\nThe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill will be debated by MPs later.\nMs Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March.\nHer body was later found in woodland in Kent and Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the 33-year-old's kidnap and murder.\nHundreds gathered on London's Clapham Common on Saturday to lay flowers and pay their respects to Ms Everard.\nBut officers later handcuffed and removed a number of women from the gathering, arresting four people for public order and Covid offences.\nThe Met has faced widespread criticism for its handling of the event - but Dame Cressida has rejected a call to step down.\nOn Sunday, she said she agreed on the need for a \"sober review\" but defended how officers responded to the \"really big crowd\".\n\"They have to make these really difficult calls and I don't think anybody should be sitting back in an armchair and saying, 'Well that was done badly,' or, 'I would have done it differently,' without actually understanding what was going through their minds,\" she said.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, to conduct a review of the policing of the event.\nAsked on Monday whether he thought Dame Cressida should continue in her role, Mr Johnson said: \"Yes I do. And what she's asked is... that we look at what happened on Saturday night.\n\"The police do have a very, very difficult job. But there's no question that the scenes that we saw were very distressing and so it is right that Tom Winsor, the inspector of constabulary, should do a full report into it.\"\nFor many this is a moment. A moment for the country and for women in particular.\nThe stream of people crossing Clapham Common is never ending. And when you reach the silent bandstand it still feels so emotionally charged. \nA circular tribute of flowers that fans out as more flowers are laid. \nMany women are crying. Men have come, some alone, others with their partners. \nBecause this is a conversation women can't have on their own.\nI've reported on this story from Kent and London last week: the discovery of a body, the arrest of a police officer, the criticism of the police. \nAnd it wasn't until arriving on Clapham Common that I really understood how this has triggered something in so many women and why almost everyone here, although they didn't know Sarah Everard, cry for her and for their own experiences of harassment, abuse or rape.\nAs one card left with flowers in memory of Sarah Everard said, \"Your story is ours and ours is yours.\"\nDame Vera Baird - the victims' commissioner for England and Wales - said the focus must now return to women's experience of sexual harassment and violence rather than the police's handling of Saturday's vigil.Dame Vera told the BBC: \"Let's return to the issue, which is why is it that this number of women, when this awful event [Sarah Everard's death] has occurred, have started to talk about their appalling experiences.\"They regard, quite clearly, the streets as lawless for women when it comes to male behaviour. Men it seems, they tell us, they can do what they want and say what they want, and nobody will take action.\"\nLouise McLoughlin was one of those at the vigil on Saturday. She told BBC Breakfast it was \"a really lovely scene\" when she arrived at around 18:00 GMT, but \"it started to get a bit more riled\" around half an hour later.\n\"The decision was obviously made for [the police] to move in and take over the area,\" she said.\n\"At that point, it became a bit of a push and pull and there were a few scuffles and all of the candles and glass and the signs and the flowers that would have been put down for Sarah, you could just hear the breaking of glass now and again as these things were trampled on.\"\nOne of the women arrested, Dania Al'Obeid, said she knew the vigil had been cancelled but she still \"needed to go and pay my respects\".\nShe told Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think that is where the frustration was, the bigger picture here was lost - we felt like we were silenced.\"\nSir Peter Fahy, former chief constable for Greater Manchester Police, said HMIC had previously criticised police for not intervening enough in Black Lives Matter protests and that many officers felt they were \"damned if they do and damned if they don't\".\nHe added that current techniques for removing people from events safely \"means that they normally have about five officers - one on each limb and one holding the head\".\n\"The trouble is, when you photograph that, it then looks very heavy-handed,\" he said.\nAhead of the event, organisers Reclaim These Streets had called off the vigil, saying police had failed to \"constructively engage\" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way. When people gathered anyway, the group pointed out that they did so without the marshalling and other safety measures that had been originally proposed.\nOn Sunday, there were protests outside the Met Police's headquarters at New Scotland Yard, Downing Street and in Parliament Square."

      "text": "Almost 10 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. \nHowever, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  \nSome countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.\nWith an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. \nOverall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about three billion and 1.6 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 530 million.\nMany poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.\nCovax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of 2021, but downgraded its supply forecast as a the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.\nThe scheme has now distributed more than one billion vaccines.\nThe vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. \nUnlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.\nMost governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. \nThe Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.\nEarly studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. \nA third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 96 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.\nWorldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. \nOur World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.\nPopulation figures have been sourced from the United Nations' mid-2021 estimates provided by Our World in Data."

      "tags": "Germany,Angela Merkel,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party has had its worst-ever election result in two key regional votes seen as tests ahead of September's general election.\nThe Christian Democrats have historically enjoyed firm support in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate and had led opinion polls.\nBut early results show a marked drop widely blamed on public anger at the response to the coronavirus pandemic. \nMrs Merkel is due to step down in September, after 16 years in office.\nThe CDU's poor performance is the first major test for Armin Laschet, who was elected party leader in January.\nThe 60-year-old centrist, however, is not guaranteed to be the party's candidate for chancellor in the election on 26 September. His rival for the role is Markus S\u00f6der, leader of the CDU's Bavarian sister party the CSU. \nThe party aims to have the matter settled by late May.\nGermany is a federal state made up of 16 regions. Under this system, there are elections to regional legislatures as well as those to the national parliament, called the Bundestag.\nIn Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg the Green Party is predicted to hang on to power with about 32% of the vote, with the CDU getting 24%, less than at the previous poll in 2016. \nIn neighbouring Rhineland-Palatinate, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) are projected to retain power with about 35%.\nThe CDU had led in the opinion polls, but it is predicted to get only 27% of the vote.\nBoth results pave the way for regional alliances between the Greens, the SPD and the liberal Free Democrats. This raises the prospect of a similar coalition forming a federal, or national, government after the general election in September.\nGreen Party Chairman Robert Habeck said the party would \"take this success as a tailwind for the Bundestag election campaign\".\nOpinion polls show the CDU's national popularity slipping from 40% last June, when Germany was being praised for its initial response to the coronavirus pandemic, to about 33% this month.\nSpeaking to the BBC, CDU MP Kai Whittaker said the results were disappointing. \"It's a bad day for us,\" he said.\u00a0\"We cannot deny that there's a risk that we're losing touch with the people.\"\nAngela Merkel's CDU did not expect to do this badly. Now, alarm bells are ringing in Berlin. \nParty leaders know they are going into September's general election without their greatest asset - Chancellor Merkel herself. Her popularity remains high, but there is increasing dissatisfaction with her government's handling of the pandemic.\nThe corruption scandal that forced the resignation of three party politicians has not helped. Some fear that the CDU, which just a year ago was predicted to win a comfortable majority and form a coalition - could even be driven from the federal government in the autumn. \nIt is too soon to make serious predictions about who will be running Germany come the end of the year. After all, voters do not know who the CDU will put forward as their candidate for chancellor.\nIt will most likely be new party leader Armin Laschet, but the fallout from the regional elections could clear the way for Markus S\u00f6der.

      "tags": "France,Germany,Coronavirus vaccines,Italy,Netherlands,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries not to pause Covid vaccinations, as several major EU member states halted their rollouts of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.\nIt said there was no evidence of a link between the vaccine and blood clots. \nGermany, France, Italy and Spain joined smaller nations in halting vaccinations as a precaution while checks are made.\nThe WHO's vaccine safety experts are meeting on Tuesday to discuss the jab. \nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) will meet on the same day and is due to draw conclusions on Thursday. It has also said the vaccine should continue to be used.\nThere have been a number of cases in Europe of blood clots developing after the vaccine was administered. \nHowever, experts say these were no more than the number of blood-clot incidents typically reported within the general population.\nAbout 17 million people in the EU and the UK have received a dose of the vaccine, with fewer than 40 cases of blood clots reported as of last week, AstraZeneca said.\nGermany's health ministry announced on Monday that it would stop administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine with immediate effect, on the recommendation of the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), the country's authority on vaccines.\n\"The background to this decision follows new reports of cases of cerebral vein thrombosis connected with an AstraZeneca vaccination,\" Health Minister Jens Spahn said. \n\"In light of these newly reported cases, the Paul Ehrlich Institute today re-evaluated the situation and recommended a suspension of vaccinations and further analysis.\"\nHe said the decision was \"not political\". \"All of us are very aware of the consequences of this decision, and we did not take this decision lightly,\" he added.\nShortly afterwards, French President Emmanuel Macron said France was suspending the vaccine until new advice was given by the EMA.\n\"We have a simple guide, to be informed by science and the competent health authorities and to do it as part of a European strategy,\" he said.\nAnd Italy's medicines agency extended a ban introduced on individual batches of the vaccine throughout the country, also pending the EMA decision.\nSpanish Health Minister Carolina Darias said use of the vaccine would be suspended there for at least two weeks.\nThe suspensions came less than a day after the Netherlands did the same. Its suspension will last until at least 29 March. \nThe Irish Republic, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, Bulgaria, Iceland and Slovenia have also temporarily halted inoculations with the vaccine, while the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia have postponed the launch of their rollouts. \nSeveral European countries, including Austria, have suspended the use of certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure. \nHowever, Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic and Ukraine said they would continue to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nBelgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said that, with a high number of cases currently, Belgium could not afford to interrupt the rollout.\n\"For us, the balance is clear and clean, it's a race against time,\" he said.\nThailand announced that it would start using the vaccine on Tuesday, following a brief delay to the rollout over safety concerns. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said health experts had assured him all vaccines being administered in the country, including AstraZeneca's, were safe.\nWHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the body was investigating the reports. \n\"As soon as WHO has gained a full understanding of these events, the findings and any unlikely changes to current recommendations will be immediately communicated to the public,\" he said.\n\"As of today, there is no evidence that the incidents are caused by the vaccine and it is important that vaccination campaigns continue so that we can save lives and stem severe disease from the virus.\" \nThe EMA - which is also currently carrying out a review into incidents of blood clots - said the vaccine could continue to be administered. \nThe UK medicines regulator also said evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots, as it urged people in the country to get the vaccine when asked to do so. \nProfessor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group that developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, told the BBC's Today programme there was \"very reassuring evidence that there is no increase in a blood clot phenomenon here in the UK, where most of the doses in Europe [have] been given so far\".\nWhile vast numbers of people are being vaccinated at pace around the world, some of them will still get sick with other things unrelated to the vaccine. \nThese pauses for the AstraZeneca vaccine are not because it is unsafe to give. It's to allow time for experts to explore why a small number of people who were recently given the shot also developed blood clots.\nWhen an illness occurs shortly after vaccination, it is right to question whether the shot might have contributed in any way. \nThere is no indication or evidence, however, that the vaccine was linked or responsible. \nIn the UK, more than 11 million people have already received at least one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and there has been no sign of excess deaths or blood clots occurring. Europe's drug regulator has also backed the vaccine, saying its benefits are clear. Covid can be deadly and vaccination saves lives. \nIt said there was no evidence of an increased risk of clotting due to the vaccine. \nIt said that across the EU and United Kingdom there had been 15 events of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) - a blood clot in a vein - and 22 events of pulmonary embolism - a blood clot that has entered the lungs - reported among those vaccinated.\nAstraZeneca said these figures were \"much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed Covid-19 vaccines\".  \n\"The nature of the pandemic has led to increased attention in individual cases and we are going beyond the standard practices for safety monitoring of licensed medicines in reporting vaccine events, to ensure public safety,\" Ann Taylor, the firm's chief medical officer, said.

It replied: \"Negative\".\nThe CDF noted that marriage between a man and a woman is sacrament and therefore blessings cannot be extended to same-sex couples.\n\"For this reason, it is not licit to impart a blessing on relationships, or partnerships, even stable, that involve sexual activity outside of marriage (i.e., outside the indissoluble union of a man and a woman open in itself to the transmission of life), as is the case of the unions between persons of the same sex,\" it said.\nIn defiant response, people posted photos from their same-sex weddings - including Chasten Buttigieg, husband of 2020 US presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg.\nProgressive Catholic groups expressed their concern at the Vatican's declaration, too. \nCharlotte Clymer, from Catholics for Choice, tweeted: \"Being LGBTQ is not a choice. LGBTQ people are wonderfully made by God. We are born this way and perfectly so, regardless of what the Vatican or any other religious authority might claim.\"\nAnd Francis DeBernardo, executive director of gay Catholic group New Ways Ministry, said the Vatican's statement was \"not surprising, but still disappointing\".\nIn 2013, Pope Francis famously said: \"Who am I to judge gay people?\"\nLast year the pontiff said in a documentary by Evgeny Afineevsky that \"homosexual people have a right to be in a family... they are children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out or made miserable over it\". \nThe Vatican later attempted to clarify the comments saying they were taken out of context and did not indicate support for same-sex marriage."

Our Streets\" and \"Black Lives Matter\" could be heard.\nEarlier, Wales's first minister said no-one could be \"anything but disturbed\" by scenes of policing at a vigil in London in memory of Sarah Everard. \nMark Drakeford said it was \"particularly\" the case because of the \"allegation that a member of the Metropolitan Police had carried out a murder of somebody\". \nThe Met has faced widespread criticism for its handling of the gathering.\nHowever, the head of the force has defended how officers responded.\nHundreds of people gathered on London's Clapham Common on Saturday to lay flowers and pay their respects to Ms Everard, who was found dead a week after she disappeared on her way home in south London.\nPolice officers later handcuffed and removed a number of women from the gathering, arresting four people for public order and Covid offences.\nIn response to the scenes in London, Mr Drakeford said there was a \"contrast\" to the way events were handled in Wales. \n\"Here in Wales I think our police have always managed to respond to such events in a way that is sensitive to them, proportionate to what is going on, and allows people even in the extraordinary times we are in to mark something very significant in their lives,\" he said.\n\"In London, nobody could be anything but disturbed to see the scenes we've seen emerging, particularly as the precipitating event is the allegation that a member of the Metropolitan Police had carried out a murder of somebody.\n\"To see the same police force respond to people who wanted to mark that in a way, that I think can only give rise for very real concern.\"\nMs Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March, with her body being found a week later in Kent.\nMet Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with kidnap and murder.\nMet Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said she will not resign over the protests.\n\"Quite rightly, as far as I can see, my team felt that this is now an unlawful gathering which poses a considerable risk to people's health,\" she said.\n\"I don't think anybody who was not in the operation can actually pass a detailed comment on the rightness and wrongness... This is fiendishly difficult policing.\"\nMr Drakeford also raised concerns about the UK government's policing bill, and its provisions on protests.\n\"This is not the moment at all for the UK government to be seeking to cut back on people's ability to get together when conditions allow and express their concerns about the way that things happen in our society,\" he said.\nOpposition MPs, including Labour and Plaid Cymru, plan to vote against the bill. It has been defended by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said it was a \"very sensible package of measures\".\nIn common with the other three UK nations, coronavirus laws set in Wales by the Welsh Government restrict large gatherings.\nNo more than four people from two households can gather outside.\nEarlier this year Bianca Ali faced a \u00a3500 fine for breaching Covid rules after allegedly organising a protest in Cardiff over the death of a man who died after he was released from police custody.\nHis death prompted several days of protest. Ms Ali is understood to be contesting the fine.\nIn response to a question on the Welsh Government views' about protests under the regulations, and whether they can be lawfully held, a spokesperson told BBC Wales: \"We are in the middle of public health emergency.\n\"For everyone wishing to hold peaceful vigils, we would ask people to follow the rules which have protected us all from coronavirus and consider holding online events until larger gatherings can be held.\""

The UK must properly implement it if we are to achieve our objectives.\"\nSenior EU figures had previously made clear they'd be taking this legal action, so there was no element of surprise today.  \nThey felt they had to act in the face of what they claim is the UK breaking international law for the second time in six months. \nTriggering this sort of complaint, \"an infringement procedure\", is a weapon in the armoury the commission often reaches for when it believes member states have breached the rules. \nThe unusual element here is that the dispute with the British will be ruled on by the European Court of Justice, even though the UK has left the EU. \nIt's one legacy of Brexit that Downing Street will not want to shout about. \nSpeaking earlier, the prime minister said the actions taken by the UK were \"temporary and technical measures that we think are very sensible\".\nAsked on a visit to Coventry on Monday, Mr Johnson said: \"The protocol is there to uphold and guarantee, to buttress the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.\"\nIt had always been \"very important [that] the wishes and consent of both communities in Northern Ireland are properly reflected in the outcome and that it should guarantee trade and movement not just north-south but east-west as well\", he added. \nThe UK looked forward to discussions with its EU friends on the issue, said the prime minister.\nThe UK government had received the European Commission letters and would respond \"in due course\", said a statement.\nIt described the UK's actions as \"temporary, operational steps\" which were \"lawful and part of a progressive and good faith implementation\" of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\"Low key operational measures like these are well precedented and common in the early days of major international treaties,\" it continued.\n\"In some areas, the EU also seems to need time to implement the detail of our agreements.\"\nNorthern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster said the legal action was \"further proof that Brussels is closing its eyes to the serious problems the Protocol has caused for Northern Ireland\". \n\"Rather than showing concern for stability in Northern Ireland or respect for the principle of consent, Brussels is foolishly and selfishly focused on protecting its own bloc,\" said the DUP leader.\n\"Not one single unionist party in the Northern Ireland Assembly supports this flawed Protocol, therefore Brussels' claim to be protecting peace continues to ring hollow.  \n\"Regardless of the reaction in Brussels, the Prime Minister must deliver the unfettered flow of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\"\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \nIt does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.\nThat has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\nUnionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union.\nBut anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes."

      "text": "Boris Johnson has said he is \"deeply concerned\" by footage showing police officers detaining women at Saturday's vigil to remember Sarah Everard.\nThe prime minister will chair a meeting of the crime and justice taskforce later to discuss ways to protect women.\nOfficers handcuffed women and removed them from the gathering on Clapham Common in London on Saturday.\nMet Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has dismissed calls to resign and defended the force's actions.\nShe said she was \"more determined\" to lead the Met, and hit out at \"armchair\" critics.\nDame Cressida will join Mr Johnson at the taskforce meeting, which will discuss what further action is needed to make streets safer for women. \nGovernment sources said both Home Secretary Priti Patel and the prime minister had confidence in Dame Cressida.\nMs Patel has instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), to \"conduct a lessons learned review in to the policing of the event\", the prime minister has said.\nMr Johnson said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the scenes on Clapham Common on Saturday night and that Dame Cressida had \"committed to reviewing how this was handled\".\n\"The death of Sarah Everard must unite us in determination to drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to protect and defend them,\" he added.\nDame Cressida said she agreed on the need for a \"sober review\" and defended how officers responded to the \"really big crowd\".\n\"They have to make these really difficult calls and I don't think anybody should be sitting back in an armchair and saying 'well that was done badly' or 'I would have done it differently' without actually understanding what was going through their minds,\" she said.\nShe added that what happened to Ms Everard made her \"more determined\" to lead the organisation.\nFour people were arrested for public order and coronavirus regulation breaches, the Met said.\nHundreds gathered at the bandstand in Clapham Common, south London, on Saturday evening for a vigil for Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March.\nHer remains were later found in woodland in Kent and Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the 33-year-old's kidnap and murder.\nLouise McLoughlin was one of those at the bandstand on Saturday. She told BBC Breakfast it was \"a really lovely scene\" when she arrived at around 18:00 GMT, but \"it started to get a bit more riled\" around half an hour later.\n\"The decision was obviously made for [the police] to move in and take over the area,\" she said.\n\"At that point, it became a bit of a push and pull and there were a few scuffles and all of the candles and glass and the signs and the flowers that would have been put down for Sarah, you could just hear the breaking of glass now and again as these things were trampled on.\"\nOne of the women arrested, Dania Al'Obeid, said she knew the vigil had been cancelled but she \"needed to go and pay my respects\".\nShe told Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think that is where the frustration was, the bigger picture here was lost - we felt like we were silenced.\"\nAnother of those arrested, Patsy Stevenson, whose photograph featured on many newspaper front pages, told Sky News: \"I've been thrown into the public eye and the only way I can make this not in vain is to not make it political, not against the police, it's just about the safety of women and we need to talk about it.\"\nMaintaining public order at protests is one of the hardest jobs in modern policing. If everything goes well, the public won't notice how commanders and demo organisers have worked out how to make an event safe.\nBut when it goes wrong, then the inevitable accusations of failure come piling in.\nSunday dawned badly for the Metropolitan Police's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick. Her officers were accused of oppressing women and politicians waded in calling for her head.\nBut the seeds for Saturday's PR disaster for the force were sown in the legal dispute over whether a vigil could take place at all - and how events then seemed to run out of control.\nThe question is whether the police should have foreseen that happening. That, time and again, is the great challenge of public order policing.\nRead more from Dominic.\nAsked whether police could have used their discretion as they did when taking the knee with Black Lives Matter protesters or dancing with Extinction Rebellion, Martin Hewitt - chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council - told Today that the investigation into the Met's actions \"will look at all elements\" of the event.\nSir Peter Fahy, former chief constable for Greater Manchester Police, said HMIC had previously criticised the police for not intervening enough in Black Lives Matter protests and that many officers felt they were \"damned if they do and damned if they don't\".\nHe added that current techniques for removing people from events safely \"means that they normally have about five officers - one on each limb and one holding the head\".\n\"The trouble is, when you photograph that, it then looks very heavy-handed,\" he said.\nThe force's action at the vigil have drawn widespread criticism, with images and footage showing officers forcibly detaining women.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan described the police's actions as \"unacceptable\", adding he was \"not satisfied\" with the explanation provided by Dame Cressida and the deputy commissioner when he spoke to them.\nHe said he wanted HMIC to investigate the events and for the Independent Office for Police Conduct to investigate the actions of police officers.\nBut Dame Vera Baird - the victims' commissioner for England and Wales - said the focus must now return to women's experience of sexual harassment and violence rather than the police's handling of Saturday's vigil.\nDame Vera told the BBC: \"Let's return to the issue, which is why is it that this number of women, when this awful event [Sarah Everard;s death] has occurred, have started to talk about their appalling experiences.\n\"They regard, quite clearly, the streets as lawless for women when it comes to male behaviour. Men it seems, they tell us, they can do what they want and say what they want, and nobody will take action.\"\nAhead of the event, organisers Reclaim These Streets had called off the vigil, saying the police had failed to \"constructively engage\" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way.\nThe NPCC's Mr Hewitt tweeted that he would \"bring all police chiefs together\" on Monday to discuss \"what more we can do to better protect women\".\nIn a letter to Dame Cressida, posted on Twitter on Sunday, Reclaim These Streets accused the Met chief of putting those who attended \"at a serious health risk through a lack of Covid-safe marshalling\" and \"at risk of being manhandled, fined and arrested\" by officers.\nThe group said it believed the Met had misrepresented a High Court ruling on Friday, when a judge refused to say the event would be permitted under coronavirus regulations.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the scenes were \"deeply disturbing\", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called for Dame Cressida to resign.\nThousands congregated in central London on Sunday to protest about violence against women.\nSisters Uncut held an event outside the Metropolitan Police's headquarters at New Scotland Yard, which it said was to remember Ms Everard and demonstrate against broader \"police brutality\".\nDemonstrators chanted \"shame on you\" at police and officers erected barriers around the building near the Houses of Parliament in central London.\nIn Parliament on Monday, MPs will discuss the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which critics say could lead to further crackdowns on people's right to protest.\nHave you been affected by any of the issues raised?

The tides are strong in the next few days in combination with the wind.\"\nMore than \u00a352,000 of a \u00a375,000 target has been raised by the men's families - enough to fund a specialist boat, team and equipment to begin searching.\nA life raft from the boat was found off Kirkcudbrightshire in Scotland by HM Coastguard and has been positively identified by the Marine Accident Investigation branch (MAIB).\nAn investigation, run by the MAIB,  is taking place and has included sonar surveys.  The families are hoping their private searches will bring additional expertise to the investigation .    \nMr Minard's mother Nathania, said: \"We are so grateful for all the support and generosity of the community.  \n\"There has been so much activity around the fundraiser which in itself brings comfort and strength to the families. \n\"Thank you to everyone who has supported, donated, wished us hope and has helped us spread the word.\"\nMuch of the money to pay for the searches has been raised in one-off donations through a fundraising website. \nSupporters have also been running raffles, ultra marathons and doing sponsored head shaves. \nThe families have also received support from comedian and writer Michael Palin, who said: \"The families are trying to raise funds to continue the search.  \n\"I completely understand them not wanting to give up if there is any chance at all of recovering the sunken ship and the men who went down in her, and I hope there will be others like myself who can make a contribution.\" "

      "text": "More pupils in Wales have been returning to the classroom for the first time since December, prompting feelings of nervousness and excitement. \nAll remaining primary school children, pupils in years 11 and 13 and many college students are starting back.\nThose in year 10 and above are \"strongly encouraged\" to take rapid Covid tests twice a week.\nSecondary school pupils must wear face coverings in class if social distancing is not possible. \nThe youngest children, aged three to seven, have been back since February. \nSchools had the flexibility to bring back pupils in years 10 and 12, while offering wellbeing check-in sessions to those in years 7, 8 and 9.\nThe Welsh Government plans for all secondary-aged pupils to be back full-time from 12 April.\nAlice, a Year 13 student at Monmouth Comprehensive School, said it was \"really exciting to be back\".\n\"It's good to have some normality back and see our friends before we leave school in May or June,\" she added.\n\"It's definitely good to be back because it's nice to see teachers again and have discussions in class as opposed to just online learning.\n\"But I think the process of online learning has been good in terms of resilience and independence which will probably help us all in university or jobs or next steps.\"\nHer head teacher Hugo Hutchison said it had been a \"huge effort over quite a considerable period of time\".\n\"The main change is the masks - masks are to be worn everywhere inside the school building,\" he added.\n\"We're really well prepared for the lateral flow testing that's going to be going on for staff and for students and we're giving out the first packs for students today so that they can go home and test themselves tonight.\" \nFinley, a Year 11 student from Rhyl, Denbighshire, earlier said he was looking forward to going back after the \"massive culture shock\" of learning from home.\n\"On reflection it's shown how much I value school and how much of an important part of my life school is,\" he said. \n\"It will be great to be back in the classroom with my mates and with the teachers.\n\"The difference between sitting in front of a screen for six hours a day compared to sitting in a classroom for six hours a day is immeasurable.\n\"It's the most excited I've ever been to visit the building to be honest, but also I'm nervous in hoping that everything goes all right.\"\nFinley said he hoped fellow students would take up the offer of lateral flow tests.\n\"There'll definitely be some resistance because some people have never experienced anything like this,\" he said.\n\"At the end of the day though, if it's going to keep us all safe then it's necessary.\n\"I'm definitely going to take it up, if it's going to protect people that I know and my mates.\"\nAbi, a sixth-former at Cardinal Newman Catholic School, near Pontypridd, said she had been looking forward to returning.\nShe said: \"It's not been great sitting at the computer all day every day. It's nice to get out, have a bit of a routine again. It's not been easy doing it at home.\n\"It will be nice to get back in the classroom and be able to ask questions constantly to the teacher and get that interaction back.\"\nAnother sixth-former Tom said his younger brother has been nervous about returning.\nBut he added: \"I think a lot of younger students will be but, ultimately, when they come here and realise how safe it is and the measures that are in place, I think he and others will cope just fine.\"\nDr Llinos Jones, head of Welsh medium comprehensive Ysgol Bro Myrddin in Carmarthen, said it had been exciting preparing for the return of the pupils.  \n\"There has been daily communication between us as a school and the children to ensure that nothing worries them on their return,\" she said.\nShe said everyone had received their timetable for the next fortnight to give sufficient advance notice and the Covid-safe measures put in place before Christmas remained key.\nDr Jones said they were treading \"very carefully\" for the two weeks before the Easter holiday and were returning specific groups of pupils only.\n\"For the first two weeks there are no more than two years in the same day and then rising to three years by the end of the last week,\" she said. \nShe added pupils from years 7, 8 and 9 would have one whole day at the school during this period.\nShe said she hoped the home Covid tests would give families more confidence.\nCommenting on the wider return to schools Laura Doel, director of NAHT Cymru, said the union wanted nothing more than schools to reopen for all children but only \"as long as the science supports that it is safe to do so\".\n\"The return must be sustainable to avoid further disruption to children's education, which means everyone continuing to adhere to the rules,\" she added.\nMs Doel also said the union remained disappointed the Welsh Government did not choose to prioritise vaccinating school staff.\nProtective measures put in place in schools - including the use of face masks - will be kept \"under review\", the education minister said.\nSpeaking during Monday's press briefing, Kirsty Williams said she acknowledged the measures could \"curtail that normal educational experience\" but added that \"as soon as the advice says that we can move away from some of them, then we will do so\".\nShe said the small numbers of Covid cases in schools over the last month since the youngest pupils returned were \"not a surprise\" and health officials were advising schools on how to handle any cases."

      "tags": "UK economy,Bank of England,Andrew Bailey,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has defended himself after a former appeal court judge criticised evidence he gave to MPs over a scandal in which thousands lost their life savings. \nMr Bailey is the former boss of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nHe has been criticised by Dame Elizabeth Gloster for his role at the FCA in regulating London Capital & Finance, which collapsed in 2019. \nMr Bailey said responsibility and culpability were not the same thing.\nBefore becoming governor, Andrew Bailey was chief executive of the FCA, which was criticised in a report by Dame Elizabeth for failing to supervise and regulate LCF.\nHer report named Mr Bailey as responsible for that failure and said he had made legal representations to prevent responsibility for the FCA's failings being attributed to him by name. \nBefore the Treasury committee of MPs last month, Mr Bailey said he was \"angry\" and \"disturbed\" by her criticisms, adding it was \"not correct\" to say he did not want his name mentioned in the context of personal responsibility and that his apology for the failure had been misrepresented. \nThat prompted Dame Elizabeth to write to the committee releasing extracts of representations from Mr Bailey's legal team, revealing that they had asked for him not to be named on a number of different grounds. \nMore than 11,000 savers lost money in investing \u00a3238m in LCF, which went bust in 2019. \nBBC Radio 4 Today programme host Martha Kearney asked Mr Bailey about LCF during a wide-ranging interview.\nHe replied: \"I never said that I was not responsible for everything that went on at the FCA. That was my role as CEO.\n\"The particular issue\u2026 was that the first draft of the report introduced responsibility and culpability together in an inseparable way and they're not the same thing.\"\nSeparately, Mr Bailey has come under new criticism following a report that he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in  a scandal that saw thousands of bank customers mistreated.\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was accused of benefiting as it left some of its customers in financial ruin.\nNow it is reported that Mr Bailey did not reveal his role in the scandal.\nThe Bank of England said there was no interest to declare.\nDuring the same BBC Today interview, Mr Bailey said he was \"not out of firepower\" in defending the UK economy as it recovers from the pandemic.\nHe said he was looking at \"new tools\" to deal with the UK's biggest economic shock in 300 years.\nThese could include negative interest rates, but \"that's not a view on whether we will use them or not\".\n\"The economy will actually get back at the end of this year to where it was at the end of 2019,\" he said.\nHowever, that was \"not much more than getting back to where we were pre-Covid\".\nMr Bailey said the Bank expected inflation to start rising towards its 2% target in \"the next two or three months\".\nBut he added that the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee would need to see \"a lot more evidence\" that the inflationary trend was sustainable before acting, given the \"huge uncertainty\" over the economic effects of Covid.\n\"We are not out of tools, we are not out of firepower,\" Mr Bailey said.\nAlthough he did not commit one way or the other on the use of negative interest rates, he said it was \"appropriate to have that tool in the box\". \nThe Bank governor's comments follow months of public speculation about the possibility of negative rates, with several former and current Bank policymakers weighing in with their views.\nAt the same time, other commentators have been warning that the economy could overheat as the end of lockdown unleashes pent-up consumer demand, with a surge in inflation as a result.\nMr Bailey said he had seen \"no evidence\" to support fears that inflation could hit 4% or 5% as the recovery gathered pace.\nHe said the UK's vaccination campaign had been \"a great achievement\" and he was now \"more positive\" about the recovery, but he wanted to add \"a large dose of caution\".\nMr Bailey warned that new variants of the virus could still pose a risk to the recovery.\nHe also said the economic effects of the pandemic had been \"very unequal\".\n\"Covid has affected the low-paid more. There are more women in that section of the labour force,\" he said.\nEthnic minorities were also disproportionately affected, he added.\nBut he said it was \"very helpful\" that the furlough scheme was now projected to extend beyond the lifting of Covid restrictions, which should \"help to smooth that transition\"."

      "text": "The former editor of The Guardian newspaper has resigned from a commission set up to examine the future of the media in Ireland. \nAlan Rusbridger had faced calls to be removed after it emerged that his former media editor, Roy Greenslade, was supportive of the IRA.\nM\u00e1ir\u00eda Cahill, who told the BBC in 2014 she was raped by an IRA member, had called for the taoiseach (Irish PM) to consider his position on the panel.\nThe government decided he should stay.\nThat decision was backed unanimously by fellow members of the Future of Media Commission earlier this week.\nHowever, on Sunday, Mr Rusbridger said that he stepped down to avoid his involvement being a \"distraction\" to the \"critical\" work of the commission.\nHe said he had been pleased to be invited and the \"unanimous support\" of his colleagues had been important to him.\nOn Sunday, Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin and Media Minister Catherine Martin acknowledged the decision and thanked him for his \"significant contribution to date\".\nThe Guardian apologised to M\u00e1ir\u00eda Cahill over an article written about her by Mr Greenslade. earlier this month.\nAfter a BBC Spotlight programme on her allegations in 2014, Mr Greenslade wrote a column in The Guardian which said that Spotlight \"were too willing to accept Cahill's story and did not point to countervailing evidence\".\nMr Greenslade wrote: \"This lack of balance resulted in the Cahill story being accepted at face value across Ireland, where [Gerry] Adams and his party were forced on to the back foot as they tried to defend and explain the IRA's actions.\"\nMs Cahill received an apology from the PSNI in 2018 after a report found she had been failed by them over her claim.\nMr Greenslade, a former editor of the Daily Mirror, wrote in the British Journalism Review at the end of February that he backed the IRA's armed campaign while he was working as a journalist during the Troubles.\nHe also said he had made contributions to the republican newspaper An Phoblacht during the Troubles under the pseudonym George King.\nMs Cahill then complained to The Guardian that its 2014 article by Mr Greenslade was a \"propaganda piece against a rape victim\".\nThe Guardian confirmed on Friday evening that its current editor-in-chief, who was not in the role at the time the article was published, had sent a private apology on its behalf to Ms Cahill.\nKatharine Viner, who took up her post in 2015, acknowledged that the column \"was not handled appropriately\".\nThe Guardian has begun a review into articles about NI written by the ex-Daily Mirror editor and The Guardian commentator, after the complaint by Ms Cahill.\nA note has been added to the 2014 piece which reads: \"The lack of disclosure was especially unfair to a vulnerable individual, and The Guardian has now apologised to Ms Cahill.\"\nWriting in The Guardian, Mr Rusbridger also apologised to Ms Cahill.\nHe wrote: \"Given what he has now shared, I believe he should have avoided those topics - or, at the very least, have been consistent in letting readers know more about where he was coming from - especially as The Guardian's own guidelines have long been explicit about declaring interests.\n\"In particular, Greenslade had criticised transparency in a 2014 piece about a BBC programme on Mairia Cahill's claim of rape by an alleged IRA member. Given his own lack of transparency, that was, at best, hypocritical.\n\"The piece spectacularly fails on transparency grounds. Had Greenslade been open with me back in 2014, I would have been able to come to a different judgement about it overall.\n\"So I am sincerely sorry to M\u00e1ir\u00eda Cahill, both for the article and for the upset it must have caused her.\""

      "text": "The governor of the Bank of England has come under new criticism for failing to declare a potential conflict of interest in a scandal that saw thousands of bank customers mistreated.\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was accused of benefitting as it left some of its customers in financial ruin.\nNow, it is reported that Andrew Bailey did not reveal his role in the scandal.\nThat is despite being asked about it when he was appointed to his previous job as head of the city watchdog.\nThe Bank of England said there was no interest to declare.\nRBS, now called Natwest, was accused of putting its own interests ahead of its clients when it moved 16,000 small business customers to its Global Restructuring Group (GRG).\nMore than 90% of those customers suffered some form of mistreatment and many were financially ruined between 2009 and 2013.\nInternal emails later emerged highlighting abusive attitudes to small business customers, including one in which a banker wrote: \"Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.\"\nA government body, the Asset Protection Agency, was accused of driving the scandal after it pressured the bank to withdraw loans from business customers and obtain their assets. \nSome of those customers lost not only their livelihoods but also their marriages, which took a heavy toll on their physical and mental health.\nMr Bailey was asked about the GRG scandal in 2016 when he appeared before a Treasury Select committee to vet him for conflicts of interest before he was made chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority.\nNow, The Times reports in that, and in other more recent hearings, Mr Bailey failed to mention his role helping the Treasury design the body that oversaw the troubled division of RBS.\nAccording to court testimony given by the former boss of the scandal-hit division, the Asset Protection Agency pressured the bank to withdraw loans from business customers and obtain their assets. \nThe agency, a division of the Treasury, had close oversight of GRG, signing off key decisions and pressuring staff to withdraw loans from customers rather than maintain support. \nThe former boss of the RBS division, Derek Sach, has previously testified that the Asset Protection Agency had no interest in customers and would have preferred the bank to \"flog\" businesses rather than support them. \nAnd in October 2016, BBC Newsnight and Buzzfeed revealed a cache of internal documents showing GRG was seeking to benefit financially by withdrawing support from business customers.\nKevin Hollinrake, co-chairman of the all party parliamentary group on fair business banking, told The Times Bailey \"must explain\" why there was no disclosure of the potential conflict of interest.\n\"On Andrew Bailey's watch, the FCA repeatedly avoided the opportunities to publish key evidence about the GRG scandal and failed to hold anyone to account,\" he said.\n\"That Bailey failed to declare his interest and involvement in the agency when it featured in the FCA report as a potential cause of the scandal or to [MPs] when questioned about it is extremely disturbing.\"\nIn 2013, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was ordered to investigate the scandal and it commissioned two firms of consultants, Promontory and Mazars, who reported back three years later ,although their findings were not disclosed. \nThe contents of the report only became public when the BBC obtained a copy of the document, which showed that over 90% of GRG customers had suffered mistreatment. Mr Bailey still refused to publish the report and instead launched a hunt for the leaker.  \nIn 2018, after taking the second phase of the investigation in-house, the FCA decided not to take any enforcement action. \nThe Bank of England said Mr Bailey was not a decision maker in respect of that decision.  \nMr Bailey's role in designing the agency that oversaw GRG will add to pressure on the governor after he was named in a report by an Appeal Court judge who criticised the FCA's handling of the \u00a3238m London Capital and Finance scandal, where thousands of retail investors lost large sums.

      "text": "A probationary Met officer involved in the search for Sarah Everard has been removed from duties for allegedly sharing an \"inappropriate graphic\".\nThe force said a graphic was shared via social media on Friday and was reported by a number of officers \"who were concerned by its content\".\nThe PC has been placed in a non-public facing role and a referral has been made to the police watchdog.\nThe Met said it expected officers \"to behave professionally at all times\".\nThe constable had been deployed as a cordon officer supporting the search operation in Kent, but they have been \"placed in a non-public facing role while inquiries continue\".\n\"Given the context of the officer's duties at the time, a voluntary referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) in relation to this matter,\" the force said.\nThe Met added that the graphic did not \"contain photographic images, no images of Sarah, nor any other material obtained from or related to the investigation into Sarah's murder\", but her family had been made aware of what had happened.\nAssistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said the force \"expects its officers to behave professionally at all times and this includes how they use social media. \n\"I take allegations that any officer or officers have failed to observe these standards very seriously and have referred this matter to the IOPC,\" he added.\nThe force has faced criticism for the way it handled a vigil for 33-year-old Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March.\nHer body was later found in woodland in Kent and Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with Ms Everard's kidnap and murder.\nThe IOPC confirmed it would be \"investigating the conduct of a probationary police constable\" and said it had also started a separate investigation looking at how Mr Couzens had sustained two head injuries while in custody last week.\nIn a statement the police watchdog said it had so far \"completed assessments into four further matters linked to the tragic death of Sarah Everard\".\nHowever, the IOPC said it would not be investigating the actions of officers at the Clapham Common vigil, as called for by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, as \"this type of investigation is not within our remit\".\n\"We have discussed this further with the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Service (HMICFRS) to consider how concerns might be included in work being undertaken by HMICFRS,\" it said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nPeople should still get their Covid vaccine despite several EU countries pausing use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab amid concern about blood clots, according to the UK medicines regulator. The Netherlands is the latest country to suspend use of the jab as a precaution, following reports from Denmark and Norway about potential side effects related to clotting. But the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots. \nPizza Express investor Hugh Osmond and Greater Manchester's night time economy adviser, Sacha Lord, are threatening court action over the way the government plans to release England from lockdown. In a letter to the prime minister, they say there is no \"evidence or justification\" for opening pubs and restaurants five weeks later than shops, with the hospitality sector losing \u00a3200m a day while doors are shut. The government has insisted the lockdown easing will driven by data and not dates. At the weekend, Scottish hospitality bosses urged the Holyrood government to change its approach.\nA hospital porter whose photographs capture life on the pandemic frontline says he hopes they will help inform future generations. Adam Middleton, 19, says he had to record the images in places out of bounds to the public - such as the Covid wards and mortuary - at the Ulster Hospital, Dundonald, to present \"an honest story\". He adds: \"It wasn't a very pleasant thing in a lot of those areas but it was a duty that I felt it had to be done.\"\nWith Britons of East and South East Asian heritage reporting increased racism since the pandemic, BBC Scotland hears their stories. Edinburgh mum Wei Saik says she was physically assaulted by group of teenage boys while walking home with her two young children one evening last November. \"It was scary because there were about 10 of them,\" she says. \"These boys were laughing really hard.\" While Police Scotland recorded 474 such hate crimes last year - up about 50% - campaigners say the real figure is higher. \nA long wait comes to an end for many in Wales today, as hairdressers and barbers reopen for appointments. Salon owner Jacquie Jenkins says some clients who live alone burst into tears when she phoned them to say she was reopening. \"Some of them live alone and don't see many people... it's not just about the hair, it's the whole social thing and company.\"\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can check out the latest data on vaccinations and find out who is eligible now.\nFind more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. \nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK are being offered alternative vaccines.\nSome recently immunised people have suffered unusual clots, including a type in the brain called cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). \nThis is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. \nExperts stress the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people, but is more finely balanced for younger adults. \nAs a precaution, regulators are continuing to monitor the situation and advise symptoms, such as unusual bruising or persistent headache after vaccination, should prompt a medical check.\nAnd adults under 40 in the UK will be offered a different Covid vaccine.\nSafety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. \nThe principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.\nIf the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. \nThat means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech, the first to be approved in the UK.\nHalf are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. \nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. \nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount. \nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nApproval is only given in the UK if the regulator is happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. \nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. \nIndependent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it.\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. \nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. \nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). \nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past. \nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. \nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. \nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example.

      "text": "Cabinet ministers and senior officials have told the BBC the government should have brought in tougher restrictions in the early autumn to tackle the \"inevitable\" second wave of coronavirus. \nIn the run up to the anniversary of the lockdown, BBC News has spoken off the record to more than 20 senior politicians, officials and former officials about the key moments of the last 12 months. \nThe investigation revealed significant frustration in government about Boris Johnson's unwillingness to tighten restrictions in September, as cases again began to rise.\nOne senior minister said the government \"should have locked down more severely in the autumn\", while another said it had been \"totally ridiculous\" to be arguing about whether people should return to the office when there was inevitably going to be a second wave. \nAnd one senior figure told us: \"The biggest mistake was the rush of blood of to the head in the summer\u2026 there was a sense of denial about the second wave.\" \nOne former official added: \"We kept repeating the same mistakes over and over again, despite the masses of evidence that kept coming up.\n\"We lost an awful lot of time, and that led to more cases and more deaths.\"\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock defended the decisions taken, saying the government had \"listened to all the evidence all the way through\".\nBut, he added: \"You have to balance all the different considerations. It's only at the prime minister's desk that all these different considerations come together. \n\"I'm responsible for the health aspects and then the huge economic response the chancellor is responsible for.\"\nWe can also reveal that Boris Johnson had been briefed by officials ahead of a press conference on 3 March 2020 - right at the start of the pandemic - to discourage people from shaking hands with each other.\nInstead, when he took to the lectern, the PM boasted he \"shook hands with everybody\" during a hospital visit.\nA spokesman for No 10 said: \"The prime minister was very clear at the time he was taking a number of precautionary steps, including frequently washing his hands. \n\"Once the social distancing advice changed, the prime minister's approach changed.\"\nIt's also understood the moment Mr Johnson realised the gravity of the situation was at a small meeting of No 10 staff on 14 March 2020. \nData experts told the prime minister that the government's forecasts of how the disease was spreading were wrong, and without an acceleration of the plans to control the pandemic, the NHS would be overwhelmed. \nHe was also warned that restrictions could be needed for as long as 18 months. \nA special BBC News podcast, presented by Laura Kuenssberg, looking back at the past 12 months of the Covid crisis in the UK can be heard here."

      "text": "Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan, Olivia Colman, Daniel Kaluuya and Sir Anthony Hopkins are among the British stars nominated for this year's Oscars.\nVanessa Kirby, Gary Oldman and Riz Ahmed are among the other UK nominees.\nIt's also the most diverse Oscars ever, with nine of the 20 acting nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds.\nAnd two women were nominated for best director - the first time more than one woman has been shortlisted for that prize in the awards' 93-year history.\nChloe Zhao is nominated for directing Nomadland, and Britain's Emerald Fennell is recognised for Promising Young Woman.\nOther nominated stars include Frances McDormand, Glenn Close, Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman.\nMank, the black-and-white drama starring Oldman as Citizen Kane writer Herman Mankiewicz, leads the overall field with 10 nominations.\nThis year's winners will be announced on 25 April at a delayed ceremony that will take place at both the Dolby Theatre, the ceremony's normal home, and Los Angeles' main railway hub, Union Station.\nThe eight British acting nominees range from Ahmed, who receives his first Oscar nomination for playing a drummer who loses his hearing in Sound of Metal, to Sir Anthony, whose performance as a man who loses his grip on reality in The Father earns him his sixth nomination.\nAt 83, he is the oldest person ever to be nominated for best actor. Sir Anthony and Ahmed are joined on the award's five-strong shortlist by Oldman, who won the trophy three years ago for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour.\nColman will hope to repeat her 2019 success with The Favourite after being nominated this year for her role in The Father.\nCarey Mulligan is nominated for Promising Young Woman despite being shut out by this year's Baftas. The revenge thriller also earns Fennell - best known for her acting in Call the Midwife and The Crown - nominations for best picture and best original screenplay as well as best director.\nKirby, who also made her name on The Crown, is nominated for playing a traumatised mother in Pieces of a Woman, while Kaluuya and Baron Cohen are up for best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 respectively.\nOther British nominees include singer Celeste for best song, for her contribution to The Trial of the Chicago 7; and Aardman's A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film.\nSix black actors and actresses are nominated, equalling the record set in 2017. This year, Kaluuya, Boseman and Davis are joined by US stars Andra Day, LaKeith Stanfield and Leslie Odom Jr - who is also up for best original song.\nDavis is shortlisted for playing a 1920s blues singer in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - the fourth nomination of her career, making her the most-nominated black actress ever.\nAhmed is the first actor of Pakistani descent to get an Oscar nomination and the first Muslim to be up for best actor; and Yuh-Jung Youn is the first South Korean actress to get an Oscar nod. \n\"Never in my dreams did I ever think a Korean actress would be nominated for an Oscar, and I can't believe it's me!\" she said. She will be joined at the ceremony by Steven Yeun, her Korean-American co-star in Minari, who is nominated for best actor.\nMinari is also up for the Academy Awards' top prize, best picture, which is given to a film's producers. Its rivals for that award include Judas and the Black Messiah, which is the first best picture nominee to have an all-black line-up of producers.\nBoseman is nominated alongside Davis for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - his final role before he died of cancer at the age of 43 last year.\nThe much-loved star, who is also known for his role in Black Panther, is the favourite to be given the best actor award.\nIf he does, he will be only the second posthumous best actor winner after Peter Finch for Network in 1976.\nOnly five women had been nominated for best director before, and only one has won - Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010.\nThis year, two of the five contenders are female, with Chinese-born, US-based Zhao the hot favourite for her story of a woman, played by Frances McDormand, who lives a nomadic life in a van.\nZhao is up for a total of four awards this year - best picture, best adapted screenplay and best editing, as well as best director. If she wins them all, she will equal a record set by Walt Disney, who is the only person to have won four Oscars in the same night.\nFennell is the first British woman to be up for best director. Some predicted a third female best director nominee this year, with Regina King tipped for One Night in Miami. She won an Oscar for her acting for If Beale Street Could Talk in 2019, but will not get a directing award to go with it this year.\nOverall, a record 76 nominations went to women this year, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards.\nThe 73-year-old has her eighth Oscar nomination for playing a foul-mouthed, prosthetic-nosed grandmother in Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy.\n\"I dedicate this honour to all the grandmothers in the world who fight to give their children a better life,\" she said.\nHer previous nominations have come for films like The World According to Garp, Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons. She has never won. So could this finally be her year?\nProbably not - the favourites for best supporting actress are Yuh-Jung Youn and Maria Bakalova, the Bulgarian newcomer who is rewarded for playing Borat's daughter in Baron-Cohen's comedy sequel.\nPlus, Hillbilly Elegy was panned by many critics, and Close now has the dubious honour of being only the third person to be up for an Oscar and a Razzie (for the worst films of the year) for the same performance.\nMank, about the making of Citizen Kane, may have the most Oscar nominations with 10, but it is highly unlikely to win best picture.\nCrucially, it failed to land a screenwriting nomination. In the past 55 years, the only films to have been named best picture without one are The Sound of Music and Titanic - a musical and a film that relied on spectacle rather than script. \nIt has also missed out in best editing, a category in which, since 1981, every best picture winner has been nominated - apart from Birdman, which gave the appearance of not having been edited.\nMank's omission in these categories suggests it is a film the Academy admires, rather than loves.\nIt would appear to be destined for the same fate as the film it is about, which nominated for best picture at the 1941 Oscars, but lost out to How Green Was My Valley.\nI have the favourite as Nomadland, which has already been a winner at the Golden Globes and the Critics' Choice Awards. However, it has one thing going against it - the Academy almost never rewards female-fronted films. Last year, 68% of Oscar voters were men and of the last 15 best picture winners, only one (The Shape of Water) even managed a best actress nomination. "

      "tags": "UK economy,Bank of England,Andrew Bailey,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has defended himself after a former appeal court judge criticised evidence he gave to MPs over a scandal in which thousands lost their life savings. \nMr Bailey is the former boss of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nHe has been criticised by Dame Elizabeth Gloster for his role at the FCA in regulating London Capital & Finance, which collapsed in 2019. \nMr Bailey said responsibility and culpability were not the same thing.\nBefore becoming governor, Andrew Bailey was chief executive of the FCA, which was criticised in a report by Dame Elizabeth for failing to supervise and regulate LCF.\nHer report named Mr Bailey as responsible for that failure and said he had made legal representations to prevent responsibility for the FCA's failings being attributed to him by name. \nBefore the Treasury committee of MPs last month, Mr Bailey said he was \"angry\" and \"disturbed\" by her criticisms, adding it was \"not correct\" to say he did not want his name mentioned in the context of personal responsibility and that his apology for the failure had been misrepresented. \nThat prompted Dame Elizabeth to write to the committee releasing extracts of representations from Mr Bailey's legal team, revealing that they had asked for him not to be named on a number of different grounds. \nMore than 11,000 savers lost money in investing \u00a3238m in LCF, which went bust in 2019. \nBBC Radio 4 Today programme host Martha Kearney asked Mr Bailey about LCF during a wide-ranging interview.\nHe replied: \"I never said that I was not responsible for everything that went on at the FCA. That was my role as CEO.\n\"The particular issue\u2026 was that the first draft of the report introduced responsibility and culpability together in an inseparable way and they're not the same thing.\"\nSeparately, Mr Bailey has come under new criticism following a report that he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in  a scandal that saw thousands of bank customers mistreated.\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was accused of benefiting as it left some of its customers in financial ruin.\nNow it is reported that Mr Bailey did not reveal his role in the scandal.\nThe Bank of England said there was no interest to declare.\nDuring the same BBC Today interview, Mr Bailey said he was \"not out of firepower\" in defending the UK economy as it recovers from the pandemic.\nHe said he was looking at \"new tools\" to deal with the UK's biggest economic shock in 300 years.\nThese could include negative interest rates, but \"that's not a view on whether we will use them or not\".\n\"The economy will actually get back at the end of this year to where it was at the end of 2019,\" he said.\nHowever, that was \"not much more than getting back to where we were pre-Covid\".\nMr Bailey said the Bank expected inflation to start rising towards its 2% target in \"the next two or three months\".\nBut he added that the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee would need to see \"a lot more evidence\" that the inflationary trend was sustainable before acting, given the \"huge uncertainty\" over the economic effects of Covid.\n\"We are not out of tools, we are not out of firepower,\" Mr Bailey said.\nAlthough he did not commit one way or the other on the use of negative interest rates, he said it was \"appropriate to have that tool in the box\". \nThe Bank governor's comments follow months of public speculation about the possibility of negative rates, with several former and current Bank policymakers weighing in with their views.\nAt the same time, other commentators have been warning that the economy could overheat as the end of lockdown unleashes pent-up consumer demand, with a surge in inflation as a result.\nMr Bailey said he had seen \"no evidence\" to support fears that inflation could hit 4% or 5% as the recovery gathered pace.\nHe said the UK's vaccination campaign had been \"a great achievement\" and he was now \"more positive\" about the recovery, but he wanted to add \"a large dose of caution\".\nMr Bailey warned that new variants of the virus could still pose a risk to the recovery.\nHe also said the economic effects of the pandemic had been \"very unequal\".\n\"Covid has affected the low-paid more. There are more women in that section of the labour force,\" he said.\nEthnic minorities were also disproportionately affected, he added.\nBut he said it was \"very helpful\" that the furlough scheme was now projected to extend beyond the lifting of Covid restrictions, which should \"help to smooth that transition\"."

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,University of Oxford,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts.\nThe UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that \"adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine\".\nData from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now.\nThe risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. \nBased on the current data, the following is advised:\nThe MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\nIt found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April.\nThe MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate.\nAnd the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. \nIts head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was \"firming up\", more evidence would be needed. \nThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more \"finely balanced\".\nThe MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. \nPlatelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\nAmong these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT).\nCVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. \nAs a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke.  \nThe clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. \nThe MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice:\nCovid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA.\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clotting should be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect.\nAfter a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link.\nNevertheless, Denmark has stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - and Germany, Spain, Italy and Ireland have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. \nFrance is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, while Australia says people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead.\nIt is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness.\nOnce injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus.\nExperts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. \nThe government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is \"plenty of evidence\" the vaccines appear to be effective against the Kent variant which is dominant in the UK.\nThere is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. \nHowever a study of around 2,000 people suggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease."

      "title": "Climate change: Jet fuel from waste 'dramatically lowers' emissions",
      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "A new approach to making jet fuel from food waste has the potential to massively reduce carbon emissions from flying, scientists say.\nCurrently, most of the food scraps that are used for energy around the world are converted into methane gas.\nBut researchers in the US have found a way of turning this waste into a type of paraffin that works in jet engines.\nThe authors of the new study say the fuel cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 165% compared to fossil energy.\nThis figure comes from the reduction in carbon emitted from airplanes plus the emissions that are avoided when food waste is diverted from landfill.\nThe aviation industry worldwide is facing some difficult decisions about how to combine increased demand for flying with the need to rapidly cut emissions from the sector.\nIn the US, airlines currently use around 21 billion gallons of jet fuel every year, with demand expected to double by the middle of the century. At the same time, they have committed to cutting CO2 by 50%.\nWith the development of battery-powered airplanes for long haul flights a distant prospect at this point, much attention has focussed on replacing existing jet fuel with a sustainable alternative. \nIn fact the UK government has just announced a \u00a315m competition to encourage companies to develop jet fuel from household waste products.\nCurrent methods of making green jet fuel are based on a similar approach to making biodiesel for cars and heavy goods vehicles.\nIt normally requires the use of virgin vegetable oils as well as waste fats, oil and grease to make the synthetic fuel.\nAt present, it is more economical to convert these oils and wastes into diesel as opposed to jet fuel - which requires an extra step in the process, driving up costs. \nNow, researchers say that they have developed an alternative method able to turn food waste, animal manure and waste water into a competitive jet hydrocarbon.\nMuch of this material, termed wet-waste, is at present is turned into methane gas. However, the authors found a way of interrupting this process so it produced volatile fatty acids (VFA) instead of CH4. \nThe researchers were then able to use a form of catalytic conversion to upgrade the VFA to two different forms of sustainable paraffin.\nWhen the two forms were combined they were able to blend 70% of the mixture with regular jet fuel, while still meeting the extremely strict quality criteria that Federal authorities impose on aircraft fuels.\n\"There's exciting jet fuels that rely on burning trash and dry waste but this actually works for those wastes that have high water content, which we normally dispose of in landfill,\" said Derek Vardon, a senior research engineer at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the lead author on the study.\n\"Being able to show that you can take these volatile fatty acids, and that there's a really elegant, simple way to turn it into jet fuel - that's where I see the broader applicability of this one, and folks can continue to develop and refine it.\"\nThe new fuel has a potentially significant impact on emissions as it not only limits the CO2 that comes from fossil sources used by the airlines, but it also gets rid of the methane that would bubble up from landfill if the waste food was just dumped. \nAnother major advantage is that this new fuel produces around 34% less soot than current standards. This is important because soot plays a key role in the formation of contrails from airplanes which adds a powerful warming effect to CO2 coming from the engines. \n\"That's where we see the most potential for this technology is that you're preventing methane emissions, and dramatically lowering the carbon footprint of jet fuel. And you just can't do that with fossil fuels without getting into things like offsets,\" said Derek Vardon.\nThe research team say they are planning to scale up the production of the new fuel and aim to have test flights with Southwest Airlines in 2023.\nMany environmental groups are sceptical about attempts to develop sustainable aviation fuels, believing that it amounts to green-washing. They argue that people should just fly less. \n\"Sustainable aviation fuel is not a silver bullet,\" Derek Vardon says. \n\"So we do want to definitely emphasise that reduction is the most important and most significant change you can make. But there's also pragmatism and need for aviation solutions now, so that's where we want to strike a balance as we need a basket of measures, to really start getting our carbon footprint down in a variety of sectors, including aviation.\"\nThe study has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

Wedding ceremonies and civil partnerships, with a maximum of 20 people, including the couple, are also allowed.\nMotherwell MSP Clare Adamson described the videos, which have now been taken down, as \"very concerning\" and told BBC Scotland she had reported them to the police.\nShe said: \"While the Hope Church are entitled to their own beliefs, they are not entitled to break the law.\n\"Any activity like this could be to the detriment of the whole community if Covid is reseeded. We are looking forward to a more normal time but this behaviour that could seed the virus in the community again is to be condemned.\"\nAsked what she thought of the videos from the church - which is led Pastor Mark Ralston - the SNP MSP said she felt \"a bit of disappointment, anger and dismay. We are all in this together and we have to do everything we can for one another\".\nShe added: \"It is very concerning. To think that the rules don't apply to one church is really not very fair on everyone else.\"\nThe Scottish government's decision to close places of worship has been controversial. It has been the subject of a judicial review after 28 faith leaders took their case to court. \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed she will allow places of worship to reopen from 26 March, with attendance capped at 50 where social distancing permits.\nA Police Scotland spokeswoman said: \"We were aware of reports relating to potential gatherings at a church in the Motherwell area. Inquiries into the reports are ongoing and officers are engaging with representatives of the church.\"\nThe BBC has approached both the pastor and Hope United Church for comment. "

      "text": "Scotland's chief medical officer has said he is \"wholly confident\" in the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.\nA number of European countries have suspended use of the vaccine amid fears that it may cause blood clots.\nHowever, watchdogs including the World Health Organisation have found no link between the jab and an increased risk of developing a clot.\nDr Gregor Smith said he would \"categorically state that we remain confident\" in the vaccine programme.\nAnd First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to continue to come forward for appointments when invited, saying they provide \"significant protection\" against the virus.\nThe Republic of Ireland has joined countries including the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Denmark and Norway in pausing their use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThere have been about 30 cases in Europe of \"thromboembolic events\" - people developing blood clots - after the vaccine was administered.\nHowever, with almost five million people having been given a first dose of the vaccine across Europe, AstraZeneca said this number of clots was \"significantly lower... than would be expected among the general population\".\nBoth the WHO and the European Medicines Agency have said there is no indication that the jab was causing the blood clots.\nThe use of vaccines in the UK is governed by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which has backed the continued use of the AstraZeneca jab.\nAt the Scottish government's daily Covid-19 briefing, Dr Smith said there had been \"no causal link between any of these incidents and the AstraZeneca vaccine\".\nHe said: \"What we can say at this point in time is that looking at the data about blood clots both in Europe and the UK, it is no more common to have an episode of a blood clot than you would see in the general population - in fact it is somewhat less.\n\"Between one and two people in a thousand would suffer a blood clot in any given year. Among the 17 million or so vaccinations given with the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, we have not seen any signal coming through whatsoever to suggest there are any more blood clots than expected in that population.\n\"People in that population are going to continue to become ill anyway - they will have events that they would have had whether they had had the vaccine or not.\n\"What we are looking for in this data, what the MHRA will be looking for, is any signs of those events being over or above what is expected - and they are not seeing that.\"\nMs Sturgeon said she would be happy to be given the AstraZeneca jab, and urged others to continue to come forward.\nThe first minister said she was in the age group that should be given a first dose of the vaccine by mid-April, saying she was \"hoping to see my blue envelope appear at some point in the next couple of weeks\".\nShe added: \"As soon as I get that, I will be there without hesitation, regardless of which of the vaccines I am being offered. And I would urge everybody getting an invitation to be vaccinated to be vaccinated, because it provides you and people you live with significant protection.\"\nMs Sturgeon said \"virtually all\" Scots over the age of 65 had now had a first dose of vaccine, as had 53% of 60-64 year olds, 41% of 55-59 year olds and 33% of those aged 50 to 54.\nShe said the pace of vaccination should \"pick up significantly\" in the coming days, with supplies expected to be available for 400,000 doses to be administered over the course of the week.\nThis is projected to continue into next month, with the government \"on track\" to hit its target of completing all priority groups - including over-50s, unpaid carers and adults with underlying health conditions - by mid-April.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"That will be a really significant milestone, if and when we meet that target. It provides all of us with firmer grounds for hope for the months and weeks ahead.\"\nThe first minister will set out plans for further easing of lockdown restrictions at Holyrood on Tuesday, with moves to re-open shops and hospitality venues and lift the \"stay at home\" order expected to be scheduled through April and into May.\nIn his speech to the Scottish Conservative conference, leader Douglas Ross challenged Ms Sturgeon to \"stop putting Scotland's future on hold\" and \"publish the full plan that we're all waiting for\".\nHe said: \"The Scottish people expect to be treated as adults, and honestly told - here's what to expect. They know that dates aren't chiselled in stone - but they deserve more clarity.\"\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for a \"balanced\" approach, saying: \"We have to make sure this is the last lockdown.\"\nHe added: \"Let's not just think the silver bullet is the vaccine - it is one part of trying to drive down the virus, but if we are going to truly have an elimination strategy we have got to suppress the virus to next to zero levels and isolate it at those small levels.\n\"In order to do that we've got to up the level of testing, and then alongside that we need to isolate the virus using our tracing system in a more effective way.\""

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you in the morning. \nHome Secretary Priti Patel has warned against protests while Covid lockdown restrictions are in place, amid public anger over Sarah Everard's death. Speaking to MPs in the House of Commons, she said the case \"had rightly ignited anger\" and that she was committed to listening to women and girls, but urged people not to \"participate in large gatherings or protests\". She has started a review into policing of Saturday's vigil for Ms Everard - when police removed a number of women from the gathering on Clapham Common in south London.\nMore European countries have decided to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, after a series of incidents in Europe involving blood clots. France, Italy and Germany are the latest to halt their rollouts, joining several smaller European nations. The World Health Organization (WHO) says there is no evidence that the incidents are caused by the vaccine, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists the UK continues \"to be very confident\" about its vaccine programme. It comes as a big increase in the number of people being offered Covid jabs in the UK is expected in the coming days, made possible by a large shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute in India. Our health correspondent Nick Triggle examines whether governments are being too cautious.\nCabinet ministers and senior officials have told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that Boris Johnson should have brought in tougher coronavirus restrictions in the early autumn to prevent more deaths. An investigation reveals significant frustration in government about the PM's unwillingness to tighten restrictions in September, as cases again began to rise. One senior figure says there was a \"sense of denial about the second wave\". Health Secretary Matt Hancock has defended the decisions taken, saying the government had \"listened to all the evidence all the way through\".\nPopular pandemic items such as hand sanitiser, loungewear and hand weights - for gym-goers stuck at home - are now being used to calculate the cost of living in the UK. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has also added smartwatches and electric cars to the annual review. But white chocolate and sandwiches bought at work are out. The ONS says it decided to add men's loungewear bottoms and women's sweatshirts to the basket of more than 700 goods, which is used to calculate inflation, to reflect a move towards more casual clothing.\nThe 63rd Grammy Awards were unlike any other, as socially-distanced music stars sat in a big, anonymous marquee outside the LA Convention Center. But when they were each allowed to briefly de-mask and hit the stage, they made it a night remember. BBC music reporter Mark Savage says the ceremony reflected a year of solitude and protest.

      "tags": "Sarah Everard murder,Metropolitan Police Service,Women's rights,Cressida Dick",
      "text": "Maintaining public order at protests is one of the hardest jobs in modern policing. If everything goes well, the public won't notice how commanders and demo organisers have worked out how to make an event safe. \nBut when it goes wrong, then the inevitable accusations of failure come piling in. \nSunday dawned badly for the Metropolitan Police's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick. Her officers were accused of oppressing women and politicians waded in calling for her head. \nBut the seeds for Saturday's PR disaster for the force were sown in the legal dispute over whether a vigil could take place at all - and how events then seemed to run out of control. \nThe question is whether the police should have foreseen that happening. That, time and again, is the great challenge of public order policing. \nEarlier in the week it became increasingly clear that people up and down the UK wanted to hold vigils for Sarah Everard. \nWomen in London, organising under the Reclaim These Streets banner, approached Met commanders for their help in setting up a vigil on Clapham Common in south London, close to where Ms Everard was last seen alive. \nThe police said a demo would be illegal under the coronavirus lockdown regulations. \nAnd so the women and their lawyers asked the High Court to make a declaration that would force the police to think again.\nThe problem is that the law is not that clear cut. \nFor almost a year, the ambiguities and omissions within the coronavirus restrictions have left both the police and the public grasping for answers as to what is possible in public. It's so complex we've even seen people fined for walking while holding a cup of tea. \nGatherings in public are generally banned in England but, at the same time, the rules recognise there are \"reasonable excuses\" to be outside.\nBut the law doesn't specify whether a demonstration on a major issue of public importance - such as this vigil - is one of those excuses.\nNo matter what the Covid regulations say, there is an overarching right to freedom of expression that is enshrined in the Human Rights Act. That means the police have a legal duty to help make safe protests possible. \nBut that right is not an absolute trump card - it can be interfered with if the police can show they have good reason to stop an event happening. \nAnd after hours of difficult legal argument on Friday, the judge refused to intervene and basically told the two sides to work it out for themselves with all those legal principles in mind. \nIn the absence of further legal clarity, the organisers claimed victory. They said the police had to now negotiate a sensible well-run vigil. \nThen, the police pushed back hard. They said they too had been vindicated. They could not authorise a potentially unlimited demonstration that would become an enormous Covid-spreading event. Stay at home, they said. \nBy Saturday morning, the organisers abandoned their plans amid a very serious risk they could each face a \u00a310,000 fine for organising a lockdown-breaking gathering. \nBut by that point, it was inevitable that people would turn up at Clapham Common, whether or not there was going to be a public event. It was the talk of social media. \nSo given that racing certainty, and the lack of official marshals that Reclaim These Streets said they would have provided had the police agreed to a vigil, what was the police's plan to keep people safe?  \nThe turning point in Scotland Yard's tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, around 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear. \nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball said: \"At this point, officers on the ground were faced with a very difficult decision. \n\"Hundreds of people were packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-19.\"\nAnd so, they tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people whom they believed were contributing to the crowding. \nPatsy Stevenson, the red-haired woman caught on camera being handcuffed on the ground at the bandstand, received a \u00a3200 Covid fine as police tried to remove her from the area. \nShe has not been accused of, or charged with, violence - but was there any elsewhere? \nThere was definitely a lot of anger - with some of the crowd chanting obscenities at the police at one point. \nThe Metropolitan Police Federation, representing frontline officers, says 26 of them were assaulted yesterday at Clapham - punched, kicked and spat at.\nPictures obtained by the Press Association clearly show three instances of officers being forcibly pushed and a van's wing mirror being deliberately vandalised. Guess what? All three instances involved men, not women. \nAssistant Commissioner Helen Ball has said the Met did not want to be in the position where it had to turn to enforcement. But what's not clear is why this demonstration was considered to be so much more of a Covid risk than others that commanders couldn't find a way to make it possible. \nPolice forces elsewhere in the UK were waiting for a lead from the Met. But those that saw DIY vigils - albeit far smaller ones - appeared to take a stand-back approach. \nThe better comparison is Black Lives Matter last summer, when there were large crowds in London and elsewhere that were clearly not socially distancing. \nWhy the difference? That, and other questions about how the operation unfolded, may have been answered in the report that's been sent to Home Secretary Priti Patel. \nShe's now asked Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to carry out its own external review of the event - and what Ms Patel ultimately concludes may dictate whether Dame Cressida survives calls for her to go.\nWhile the commissioner is accountable to the Mayor of London, who has raised his own serious concerns after a meeting with Dame Cressida, the Home Secretary is jointly responsible for deciding who gets the job - and when they should go.\nDame Cressida is highly respected both in policing and government - far more so than some of her predecessors - but she remains a controversial figure for many others.  \nShe commanded the 2005 operation that led to the shooting dead of Jean Charles De Menezes, after he was mistaken for a suicide bomber - although a jury exonerated her of any personal wrongdoing. \nMore recently, she called for better powers to deal with Extinction Rebellion's repeated occupations of parts of London. The government agreed - and the home secretary's proposals to greatly expand the police's ability to curtail demonstrations goes before Parliament on Monday. \nAsk most police officers who have experience of covering public protests, and they will tell you they often feel - individual mistakes besides - it is a no-win situation when things go wrong. (Just last week I was talking about this very dilemma on BBC Newscast.)\nIt would be something of a terrible twist of fate for the commissioner - the first woman in the post - to lose her job in these circumstances.

      "text": "The top US infectious disease expert says it would be \"a game-changer\" if ex-President Donald Trump encouraged Republicans to get the Covid vaccine.\n\"It will make all the difference in the world,\" Dr Anthony Fauci told Fox News Sunday. \"He's a very widely popular person among Republicans.\" \nA recent US opinion poll showed as many as 49% of Republican male supporters did not want to get vaccinated.\nMr Trump last month said \"everybody, go get your shot\" at a conservative forum.\nIt was the first time he publicly encouraged Americans to do so. He has not commented on the issue since then. \nMr Trump, who was privately vaccinated in January, was absent when four other ex-presidents - Barack Obama, George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter - appeared last week in a public service announcement for the vaccination.\nHe remains a major force in the Republican party, getting a warm reception at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the end of last month. \nThe US has seen more than 530,000 Covid-related deaths and nearly 29.5 million infections, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nDr Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, told Fox News Sunday: \"If he [Trump] came out and said 'Go and get vaccinated, it's really important for your health, the health of your family, and the health of the country', it seems absolutely inevitable that the vast majority of people who are his followers would listen to him.\n\"He's such a strongly popular person. I cannot imagine that if he comes out that they would not get vaccinated.\"\nDr Fauci said the Trump administration was \"very successful in getting us the vaccines we have right now\".\n\"It seems like an intrinsic contradiction, the fact that you have a programme that was started during his presidency, and he's not out telling people to get vaccinated.\n\"I wish he would. He has such incredible influence over people in the Republican party - it would really be a game-changer if he did,\" Dr Fauci said.\nThe number of vaccine doses administered each day has been steadily rising in the US, and on Saturday alone about three million people got the jab - an achievement hailed by Dr Fauci.\nAbout one in five Americans have received at least one dose, with about one in nine fully vaccinated, the Associated Press news agency is quoting as saying America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nLast week, Mr Biden said in his first primetime address as president that he was hopeful America could \"mark independence\" from Covid-19 on 4 July if people got vaccinated.\nMr Biden previously set a target of 100 million vaccinations by his 100th day in office. But in his speech, he said this target would now be reached on day 60, which is 20 March.\nCorrection 7 April 2021: This article has been amended to remove a reference to the US as by far the world's worst hit country by the pandemic, which does not take account of figures on deaths and infections in relation to the population.\n"

      "text": "Hundreds of people joined a new vigil for Sarah Everard on Monday, despite the home secretary warning against such gatherings.\nPriti Patel said she understood public anger over the 33-year-old's killing but urged people not to protest while Covid restrictions were in place.\nMs Patel also said she had started a review into the policing of a previous London event for Ms Everard.\nOfficers handcuffed and removed several women from Saturday's vigil in Clapham.\nSpeaking from Monday's event in Parliament Square, Dominic Casciani, the BBC's home and legal correspondent, said there were \"far fewer\" police than there had been at Saturday's vigil, adding that officers had taken a \"hands-off\" approach similar to that seen during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations last summer. \nThe Met faced widespread criticism for its handling of the Clapham vigil but the force's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, has rejected a call to step down.\nFour people were arrested for public order and Covid offences on Saturday, after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects to Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March.\nHer body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the marketing executive's kidnap and murder.\nOn Monday evening, police began to move in on protesters in central London, after urging crowds to \"leave immediately\" or face \"enforcement activity\". \nCampaigners had marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area chanting and waving banners.\nProtesters could be heard urging others to run and \"keep moving\", with traffic in the surrounding areas brought to a stop.\nA large police presence followed the demonstrators, along with police vans and motorbikes.\nProtests and vigils have also been held in several other UK cities over the past few days, including Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Brighton, and Liverpool.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Ms Patel said: \"Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge why Sarah's death has upset so many. \n\"My heartache, and that of others, can be summed up in just five words: 'She was just walking home.'\"\nThe home secretary also confirmed she had instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, to review the policing of Saturday's vigil.\nShe said Ms Everard's killing had \"rightly ignited anger at the danger posed to women by predatory men and anger I feel as strongly as anyone\".\nHowever, she urged people not to participate in large gatherings or protests, saying that while the right to protest was a \"cornerstone of our democracy\", the government's duty was still to prevent more lives being lost during the pandemic.\nShe stressed that the government had put in place measures to ensure women and girls felt safe, including tackling domestic abuse, female genital mutilation and upskirting.\nThe Domestic Abuse bill is on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, she said, adding that it would \"transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime\".\nIn response, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: \"Let me be clear, it is not women who should change their behaviour, it is men and wider society that needs to change.\n\"And at times like this it is vital people are able to have their voices heard, of course in a way that is lawful and Covid-secure. Yet this weekend in Clapham things clearly went very wrong and I share the anger about the policing and the scenes we saw.\"\nHe also accused the government of \"a chronic failure\" to address violence against women and girls, adding that \"meetings and reopening surveys are not enough\".\nPolice took a hands-off approach at the main demonstration in Parliament Square earlier this evening.\nAfter that broke up, a few hundred protesters moved off and started randomly following a route through Westminster towards London's West End.\nAt first they tried to sit down and occupy roads - including outside Scotland Yard - but every time they stopped, they were told by police they needed to move on because of Covid regulations.\nAnd so what began as a vigil in Parliament Square became a somewhat chaotic parade through Theatreland and the quiet, locked-down London streets.\nEventually teams of police officers began trying to pick off stragglers, instructing them to go home in line with the lockdown rules - or face fines. \nSome left, some appeared to get tickets.\nThey wanted to make their voices heard against these proposed police powers to curtail demonstrations. \nBut the way they acted tonight is exactly the type of disruption that may in future be targeted.\nFollowing a meeting of the government's Criminal Justice taskforce on Monday evening, Downing Street said it would take \"immediate steps\" to give \"further reassurance\" to women and girls in the wake of Ms Everard's death.\nNo 10 said it would be doubling the size of the Safer Streets fund - which provides local measures such as better lighting and CCTV - to \u00a345m.\nPilots of so-called Project Vigilant will be rolled out across the country - with uniformed and undercover officers working to identify predatory and suspicious offenders around clubs and bars at night.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson - who chaired the meeting - said the government was bringing in \"landmark legislation\" to toughen up sentences and put more police on streets.\nHe said: \"Ultimately, we must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to better protect and defend them.\"\nLabour's Mr Thomas-Symonds said replacing \"a tiny fraction of the cuts [the Conservatives] have made to local services is nowhere near good enough\".\nA spokeswoman for Reclaim These Streets, the group that initially organised the vigil, said they welcomed additional funding but did not believe funding alone would create the structural changes which were \"so important\".\n\"Women won't be able to trust that they are safe until misogyny and racism are tackled at an institutional level within government, police and the criminal justice system,\" she said.\nOn Monday, Reclaim These Streets said it had lost confidence in Dame Cressida after talks with her earlier, claiming that she left after 15 minutes.\nAnna Birley of the group told BBC News: \"To be honest, Cressida Dick has lost our confidence and the confidence of women in the capital. We didn't want to call on her to resign until we'd at least had a meeting and given her a chance to engage.\n\"We don't have great confidence in the Met Police's willingness to work with us, unless forced to.\"\nReclaim These Streets called off Saturday's vigil, saying police had failed to \"constructively engage\" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way.\nWhen people gathered anyway, the group pointed out that they did so without the marshalling and other safety measures that had been originally proposed.\nOn Sunday, there were protests outside the Met Police's headquarters at New Scotland Yard, Downing Street and in Parliament Square."

      "title": "Is Europe's AstraZeneca jab decision-making flawed?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "A number of countries have decided to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as a precaution following reports that some people have suffered blood clots after being given the jab.\nBut is it a case of being too cautious? Are these nations missing the bigger picture?\nThe decision has been made on the basis of the precautionary principle - a well-established approach in science and medicine that stresses the need to pause and review when evidence is uncertain.\nBut in a fast-moving pandemic, when each decision can have major consequences, it is an approach which can sometimes do more harm than good.\nThe data supplied by AstraZeneca shows there have been 37 reports of blood clots among the 17m people across Europe who have been given the vaccine. \nBut the key question that has to be asked is whether this is cause or coincidence? Would these clots have happened anyway? \nAdverse events like this are monitored carefully, so regulators can assess if they are happening more than they should.\nThe 37 reports of clots are below the level you would expect. What is more, there is no strong biological explanation why the vaccine would cause a blood clot. \nIt is why the World Health Organization and UK drugs regulators have all said there is no evidence of a link.\nEven the European Medicines Agency, which is looking into the reports, has suggested the vaccine should continue to be used in the meantime given the risk Covid presents to health.\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, the decisions by individual nations to pause their rollouts have baffled experts.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the WHO's working group on Covid vaccines, says stopping rollout in this way is \"highly undesirable\" and could undermine confidence in the vaccine, costing lives in the long-term.\n\"Making the right call in situations like this is not easy, but having a steady hand on the tiller is probably what is needed most.\"\nThis is not the first time countries in Europe have exercised caution about the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThe precautionary principle was adopted by Germany, France and others when they did not initially recommend use of the vaccine for the over-65s. French President Emmanuel Macron even called it \"quasi-ineffective\".\nThe over 65s decision has now been reversed, but the impact is still being felt it seems.\nGermany and France have supplies of the vaccine going to waste, with both countries having used fewer than half their supplies of the AstraZeneca jab so far. It has left them far more reliant on the Pfizer vaccine than the UK is.\nAnd this is threatening to have deadly consequences. France, Germany and the other major European nations all have higher rates of infection than the UK, and face the prospect of things getting worse before they get better.\nIf you look back at the decision on the over-65s, you can see how it was made. The way the trials had been organised meant there was limited evidence on its use in older age groups.\nThe organisers had wanted to recruit younger adults in the initial stages for safety reasons, so when it came to regulators assessing infection rates the data was not yet ready for older people.\nBut there was evidence from blood samples that the vaccine had prompted a strong immune response in the older age groups. So there was no reason why the vaccine would not work in older age groups - it was just that insufficient time had passed to gather the evidence in the real world.\nThere was also a problem interpreting results because of the way the trial was run. There was a lack of consistency across the different sites used. \nProtocols and practices followed varied across each, including the use of a half-dose in one.\nSome have described it as four trials within a trial. It created a somewhat messy set of data to interpret.\nThe UK looked past this and took the leap though - and within months was reporting \"spectacular\" results in reduced levels of serious illness in the over-80s.\nIt was this pragmatic approach to decision-making that also led the UK to recommend up to a three-month gap between doses.\nThis caused much controversy when it was announced at the end of December.\nThe Pfizer vaccine was not tested like this in trials - the interval was three weeks.\nBut again, the absence of evidence did not mean the move would not work or was not based on logic. \nThe AstraZeneca trials did have longer intervals for some participants, which seemed to make it more effective, while evidence on the Moderna vaccine, which is a similar type of jab to Pfizer, also suggested it could work.\nIt is also well-established that with two-dose vaccines, most of the protection is provided by the first dose, while the second boosts that and provides more long-lasting protection. \nWith cases rising rapidly at the time, the UK was clear the benefit of maximising available vaccine supplies to provide some protection to more people was the right step even if the trial evidence did not directly support it.\nProf Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in understanding risk at Cambridge University, says it shows that sometimes you have to look beyond the precautionary principle and be bold in your decision-making.\n\"The precautionary principle favours inaction as a way of reducing risk. But the problem is that these are not normal times and inaction can be more risky than action.\"\nWhat is needed in circumstances like these, according to Sir David, is to work out what is most likely on the balance of probability. That requires looking at both the direct and indirect evidence and the context those decisions are being made in.\n\"Sometimes it can be harmful to wait for certainty. Not vaccinating people will costs lives.\" "

      "tags": "Domestic abuse,Sarah Everard murder,Cardiff,Women,Sexual harassment",
      "text": "It is a \"damning indictment\" that women feel unsafe to exercise alone outdoors, Wales' education minister has said.\nKirsty Williams said the safety concerns raised after the death of Sarah Everard \"tells you how far we have got to go as a society\". \nMeanwhile, First Minister Mark Drakeford said there needed to be a focus on women being and feeling safe.\nMs Everard disappeared while walking home in London last week. Her death has prompted a debate over women's safety.\nA vigil on Saturday to remember the 33-year-old marketing executive has attracted criticism after footage showed officers detaining women, prompting Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say he was \"deeply concerned\".\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has dismissed calls to resign and defended the force's actions.\nWhen asked about clarity on gyms reopening, in light of safety concerns raised after Ms Everard's death, Ms Williams said women feeling unsafe exercising alone outdoors \"tells you how far we have got to go as a society\".\nBut she did not confirm when gyms may reopen in Wales.  \nVigils were also held in Wales on Saturday night to mark Ms Everard's death - some were held online, others were attended in person.\nSpeaking at the Welsh Government's Covid briefing on Monday, Ms Williams said anyone watching events unfold at the London vigil would have been \"shocked by what they saw\".\n\"But can I say how grateful I am to women and men in Wales who, over this weekend, also carried out vigils to mark the death of Sarah, and the wider issues that that death makes us confront as a society, and the police that oversaw those gatherings in a really respectful way.\"\nPam French, an organiser of a vigil for Ms Everard at Hailey Park in Llandaff North, said she had spoken about women's safety with her two sons, aged three and six.\n\"Sometimes it's easier to talk to children about it because the response isn't defensive, it's usually, 'why are you upset and what can I do about it?'.\n\"We've just been talking to them about being kind, treating people equally and all of those really basic messages, but if we start them from that early on then hopefully, we can make a difference,\" she said.\nThe 43-year-old said issues raised in the past week \"just rips sticky plasters off a lot of stuff that I think a lot of us have held for many years\".\n\"For many of us, that brought home years of having to change our behaviour and modify our behaviour and being afraid,\" she added.\nMs Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March.\nHer remains were later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with her kidnap and murder.\nFollowing Ms Everard's death, several hotels in Cardiff have responded by offering help to anyone feeling unsafe.\nThe Angel Hotel urged women walking home who felt afraid to come to its reception. \nIt tweeted: \"In light of the devastating news regarding Sarah Everard this week, here at the Angel Hotel we would like to offer women and girls who feel intimidated, scared or at risk in Cardiff city centre a 'safe place'.\n\"Please come into our reception and a member of our team will help you call a taxi, friend or family member to ensure you get home safe.\"\nLater, the city's Indigo Hotel said it had been inspired by the Angel Hotel's offer and tweeted that staff would \"help you and ensure that you get home safely\".\nThe future generations commissioner said that misogyny \"should be an offence\" and \"something that the police should be taking seriously\".\nSophie Howe said she thought the only reason why it was not an offence was because of the \"scale of the problem\".\n\"Millions of women probably across the UK are experiencing this sort of thing everyday. \n\"So I think there is a reluctance around how you can possibly start policing this.\"\nHowever she said you have \"got to start somewhere, and it is down to what your priorities are\".\nShe added that men should be educated about calling out sexual harassment.\nMs Howe also said she had spoken to her four sons, aged nine to 21, about misogyny and harassment scenarios.\nShe said she had experienced sexually explicit remarks and \"many times\" whilst walking on the street, had been followed by men driving slowly next to her.\n\"Speaking to them over the weekend, I think there is still this issue of men not willing to challenge,\" she said.\nShe said she gave them one scenario in which they said the men involved were \"probably just having a laugh with friends\".\n\"I would like to think that my boys have been brought up to be feminists to be committed and interested in women's rights - even then that was the response I was getting,\" Ms Howe said.\n\"It might start out as a comment to make you laugh but\u2026 the more that society makes these things acceptable, the more that those people who are rapists, who are the sort of people who want to stalk, the more acceptable that becomes in their minds.\"\nMr Drakeford said that earlier this year \"women were contacting us saying they didn't safe being on their own on a dark January evening\", which prompted a change to Covid rules on exercise outdoors.\n\"Women need to be safe and there are practical things that can be done by public authorities, to try and assist that, but then it is feeling safe as well.\n\"In this instance, perception and reality both need to be addressed,\" he said.\nDeputy Minister Jane Hutt said that a \"deep change in society\" in needed to tackle violence against women."

      "tags": "NHS,Personal protective equipment (PPE),Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The owner of a dog food firm brokered personal protective equipment deals worth \u00a3258m between the government and a Hong Kong firm, a BBC investigation has found.\nLondon-based Zoe Ley is likely to have been paid at last \u00a31m by the firm for her work in securing the deals last spring when the UK was short of PPE.\nMs Ley says she was approached by the UK's Covid taskforce when it was \"seeking urgent assistance\" to get PPE.\nThe government denies this.\nMs Ley has a background in finance and banking.\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020, rising global demand for PPE - including orders for gowns, gloves and face masks - led to shortages and a scramble for supplies for NHS workers. \nBecause of this, the UK government began awarding PPE contracts under emergency terms in which deals were handed to companies based on price and quality but without direct competition.\nThis has led to concerns over a lack of clarity about why particular suppliers were chosen and accusations that a so-called high-priority lane favoured firms with political connections.\nMs Ley's company, Life Partners, was set up in May 2020 to \"supply Covid-related products\" and helped broker two deals, worth \u00a3258m, between Hong Kong firm Worldlink Resources and the UK government.\nMs Ley, a former investment banker, also owns an organic dog food company called The Rockster. It is endorsed on its website by Prince Michael of Kent and actress Liz Hurley.\nIn an effort to establish Ms Ley's role in the PPE deals, an industry insider helping the BBC's Panorama, called Worldlink posing as someone trying to buy PPE.\nHe was told Ms Ley's involvement was crucial - her company was described as \"a bridge\" to the UK government. \nThe insider was also told she was paid 30% - likely a seven-figure sum - of Worldlink's profits on the deals. But Ms Ley's lawyers would not tell the BBC how much commission she earned.\nThe lawyers added that Worldlink paid Ms Ley less than 30%, saying Worldlink's own margins were at the lower end of the scale.\nMiddlemen and women are a common feature of PPE deals. Manufacturers in China often use local brokers who then reach out to people in other countries to help them sell to customers. This can add to the overall cost of the products.\nThe contract for one of the Worldlink deals - a \u00a3178m agreement to buy protective goggles for health workers - was only made public last week, after Panorama contacted the government. It blamed an \"admin error\" for having not published the deal earlier.\nThe contract for one of the Worldlink deals was one of 100 Covid-related contracts that remained unpublished when Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs last month they were \"on the record for everyone to see\".\nAlso last month, a judge ruled that Health Secretary Matt Hancock had acted unlawfully by not publishing Covid contracts in the required timeframe.\nThe ruling came amid concern over how contracts were being awarded. Deals that have prompted questions include major PPE contracts awarded to a Tory councillor last year and a \u00a330m deal given to a firm owned by a man who used to run a pub near Matt Hancock's old constituency home. That case is being investigated by the UK's medical regulator.\nIn November last year, a Spanish businessman who acted as a go-between to secure protective garments for NHS staff in the coronavirus pandemic was paid $28m (\u00a321m) in UK taxpayer cash.\nThe government has also been accused of favouring firms with political connections with a \"high-priority lane\" - in reality an email inbox available to ministers, civil servants or MPs and peers from any party.\nThe idea of the inbox was to help the government choose between the huge numbers of offers it was getting. \nA report from the National Audit Office found that up to the end of July 2020, about one in 10 suppliers who had been put in the high-priority lane were then awarded contracts. The figure was less than one in 100 for other suppliers, outside the lane.\nThe government says all leads were subject to the same eight-stage procurement process and the inbox helped identify credible offers more quickly.\nAlmost all the companies that won contracts via the preference lane remain unidentified.\nThe government has refused to say whether the deals Ms Ley brokered were placed in the so-called high priority lane. \nIt said it has no contracts with Life Partners Limited or Zoe Ley, adding the 90 million goggles and nine million gowns supplied by Worldlink were made available to NHS workers.\n\"We've been consistently clear that work was taking place at a time when global demand was greater than ever before and rapid action was required, so we had to work at an unprecedented pace to get supplies to the frontline,\" a government statement said.\n\"Stringent checks were in place on all contracts to guarantee quality, value for money and due diligence.\" \nWatch Panorama's Cashing in on Covid on BBC One at 19:35 GMT on Monday, 15 March, or later on the BBC iPlayer (UK only)."

I've had one or two clients who've actually bought a year's worth of vouchers... it's been so lovely for them to think of it, really kind.\"\nShe had mixed emotions when she heard she could reopen.\n\"I think we were all quite apprehensive, not so much going back because of the virus, but just knowing it was quite hard last year - all the sanitising, cleaning, wearing the masks and the visors, I mean it's hard work,\" she added.\n\"On the flip side, having all of that in place has given them the confidence to go back.\"\nHaving not had a haircut since last summer, Ms Trelawny said she was \"particularly excited\" to return to her salon. \nShe said her lockdown hair was starting to get her down: \"It is just really dark, I'm desperate for a cut, I've been using a straighteners and it is breaking, frazzled, limp...\n\"I've bought a special mask for my hair, heat protective spray and a nice serum...

      "text": "Boris Johnson has promised to help make the UK \"match-fit\" when he unveils his plan for modernising the armed forces and foreign policy.\nThe prime minister said there would be \"more investment\" in infrastructure and skills around the country.\nHe also announced that 500 Foreign Office jobs would be moving from London to East Kilbride. \nThe government publishes its Integrated Review of the UK's defence and foreign relations capabilities on Tuesday.\nBut a group of MPs has warned that \"general ineptitude\" over the last 20 years has undermined attempts to re-equip the Army. \nThe Integrated Review, first announced in 2019, will set out the UK's defence and foreign affairs priorities for the next decade or so, during which cyber warfare in particular is expected to become a greater threat. \nSome details are being pre-released, including the plan to move 500 jobs to the Foreign Office's East Kilbride hub - which follows news that the Cabinet Office will transfer at least 500 civil servants to nearby Glasgow by 2024.\nThe government has promised \"further commitments\" to \"strengthening the UK's core industrial base\" in the Integrated Review, including building ships in Scotland and armoured vehicles in Wales.\nThere will also be a focus on lithium mining in Cornwall and manufacturing satellites in Northern Ireland, it added. \nThe Integrated Review is billed as the most radical reassessment of Britain's place in the world since the end of the Cold War.\nBut the prime minister wants the new strategy to make a difference at home as well as abroad. He is promising new investment in domestic industries such as defence, science and technology.\nAnd, crucially, he argues that this will provide jobs across the United Kingdom.\nMinisters argue it's only by combining the resources of the union that the UK is able to respond to global challenges and project its influence abroad.\nThe test will be whether that argument is accepted by those calling for a fresh independence referendum in Scotland. \nMr Johnson said: \"The foundation of our foreign policy is who we are as a country: our values, our strengths and - most importantly - our people. \n\"So I am determined to ensure we have a foreign policy that delivers for those people.\"\nHe added that the UK's \"international ambitions must start at home\", with investment in regional industry \"ensuring the UK is on the cutting-edge of innovation and creating an entire country that is match-fit for a more competitive world\".\nThe government has said \"further jobs\" will be created outside London by the establishment of the National Cyber Force HQ in the North of England.\nIt has also promised an increase in spending on defence of 2.6% above the rate of inflation between 2019/20 and 2020/21, with the overall figure expected to rise to \u00a341.5bn during this time.\nFrom 2010 to 2017, annual defence spending fell by \u00a36.6bn in real terms, but, since then, it has increased by \u00a33bn in real terms.\nA report by the Commons Defence Committee, published on Sunday, warned that the Army was at \"serious risk\" of being outmatched by the UK's adversaries.\nIt described efforts to modernise its fleet of armoured fighting vehicles as \"woeful\" and criticised what it called \"bureaucratic procrastination\" and \"general ineptitude\" over the past two decades.\nIn a speech last month, Labour's shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the Integrated Review should \"refocus our defence efforts on where the threats are\".\nHe added that unless it confirmed a reduction in potential dangers to the UK, it would be \"very hard to accept the case for reducing the strength of our full-time forces\"."

      "text": "People aged 50 or over in Northern Ireland can now book their Covid-19 vaccine appointment, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced.\nThose who are eligible and wish to receive the vaccine can booking it online or be contacted by their GPs.\nBooking slots are available at the seven regional vaccination centres.\nThere was some frustration about the length of time some people were having to wait in the queue to book their slot on Monday.\nHowever, Mr Swann told the assembly that in the first three hours of the slots opening 30,000 people had booked vaccines. \nThe centres will primarily be using the AstraZeneca vaccine for first doses, to maximise available vaccine supplies.\nAnyone who received the Pfizer vaccine as a first dose will still receive the Pfizer vaccine for their second dose.\nNorthern Ireland's health minister told the assembly that the \"benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks\".\nIt comes after health officials in Northern Ireland said they would continue to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after its suspension in the Republic of Ireland.\nThe temporary suspension of the vaccine is already having an impact on the republic's immunisation programme. \nAbout 30,000 vaccination appointments for health staff and those at high-risk might be delayed, according to RT\u00c9.\nIrish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly described its move as \"precautionary\", after reports of serious blood clotting events in adults in Norway. \nAstraZeneca has said there is no evidence of a link between the vaccine and increased risk of clotting, while Northern Ireland's Department of Health has said it would continue to use the vaccine after receiving guidance from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\nThe latest figures show that across Northern Ireland 629,461 people have now received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 54,636 have received two.\nOn Monday, the Department of Health recorded a further 121 cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland.\nOne additional death was reported, bringing the department's total number of deaths with Covid-19 to 2,099.\nFor a second day in a row, no additional deaths were reported in the Republic of Ireland, where there have a total of 4,534 Covid-19-related deaths.\nThe Republic of Ireland's health department said there were 575 more confirmed cases, which brings that total to 227,316.\nNorthern Ireland's health minister said vaccination was a \"bridge to better, safer and more normal times for everyone\".\nChief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the more people are vaccinated then \"the more we are all protected\".\nHe received his first jab on Monday morning.\n\"Vaccination alone will not provide 100% protection but it will change the balance in our favour against this virus. \n\"When your turn comes, don't delay, get the jab. Protect yourself and others,\" he said.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster also urged those eligible to take up the offer of a vaccine.\n\"The MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) have been very clear that it is safe to take the AstraZeneca vaccine,\" said the DUP leader.\n\"I am looking forward to taking it, either this week or next week, depending on when I am able to get my vaccine booked for, but it is very important that people continue to take the vaccine.\"\nOn Monday, Dr Alan Stout, the chair of the British Medical Association's (BMA) NI GP committee, said it was the large supply of AstraZeneca jab that allowed the vaccination programme to continue at the speed it is. \nHe advised people that it was safe to receive, and there was also a risk of blood clotting with things like long-haul air travel, the contraception pill, and some forms of surgery. \n\"These are world experts that we have in these regulators bodies and they are all saying the same thing, and they are all saying it is safe,\" he said. \nDr Stout said he was \"hopeful\" jabs would be offered to the over-40s age group by Easter, mirroring the situation reportedly happening elsewhere in the UK. \nHow bizarre. \nWhile health officials in the Republic of Ireland are choosing to pause the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, in Northern Ireland they're accelerating the programme. So who should we trust?\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) the vaccine is safe. That message has been reinforced by the British Medical Association.\nIt's hard to ignore that the MHRA has said that it has received a small number of reports of blood clots relating to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nBut it does seem that health officials in the Republic are being excessively cautious - Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly and the country's deputy chief medical officer have said as much themselves. \nRelations between the EU and AstraZeneca are somewhat toxic at present with the Republic of Ireland, where the vaccine is reportedly in short supply, having been let down so many times on delivery of the vaccine. \nWhile people in the Republic will be rolling down their sleeves, in Northern Ireland an even greater number are preparing to roll them up.\nThe rollout will continue to be prioritised based on age, in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance aimed at protecting the most vulnerable, the Department of Health has said.\nVaccines are being dispensed in parallel by GP practices and vaccination centres. \nNorthern Ireland has seven regional vaccination centres: Royal Victoria Hospital, Ulster Hospital, South Lake Leisure Centre, Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Foyle Arena,  Omagh Leisure Centre and Lakeside Leisure Centre.\nPlans are also being finalised for community pharmacies to join the programme in the coming weeks, the department added. \nAn additional regional mass vaccination centre will open at the end of March at the SSE Arena in Belfast.\nThe vaccination centres are now offering bookings to: \nCarers who have not already booked a vaccination appointment can email their health trust carer co-ordinators and they will make the necessary arrangements.\nGPs are providing vaccines to: \nThe latter clinically vulnerable (CV) group is expected to largely mirror those who receive the winter flu vaccine each year because of their medical conditions.  \nCEV and CV individuals aged 16 and 17 years of age cannot receive the vaccine being used in GP practices.\nThese individuals will receive a letter from their GP and are able to book a vaccination slot at one of the vaccination centres.\nPeople who want to book a vaccination centre appointment are asked to do so online if it all possible.\nIf online booking is not possible, then the telephone booking number is 0300 200 7813.\nThe booking line is open 08:00 GMT until 20:00 Monday to Friday."

      "text": "All post-primary staff and year 12 -14 pupils are to get twice-weekly lateral flow tests from next week, the NI Health Minister has said.\nIn a letter seen by BBC News NI, Mr Weir said that after the Easter break the programme will expand to include all primary school staff.\nPupils will be supervised for the first two tests in schools. \nMr Weir said he hoped the executive would soon confirm the phasing of schools re-opening.\nIn a letter to all schools, Mr Weir said: \"It is very much my intention that all pupils return to the classroom as soon as possible.\n\"With all of the measures schools have taken to comply with departmental guidance on operation during Covid, I reiterate that schools are safe environments.  \n\"The reason that we moved to remote learning after Christmas was because of the high level of community transmission, and the urgent need to reduce all social contact,\" he added.\nAll testing will be voluntary.\nMr Weir said that while there might be \"challenges\" the tests would add a further level of Covid security to the school setting.  \nThe department is using a self-test Lateral Flow Device (LFD) which provides a result within 30 minutes. \nThe initial batch will be delivered to post-primary schools in the coming days, meaning all post-primaries will have enough tests to conduct at least one supervised test in school, and for pupils to be able to conduct a test before they return after the Easter break.  \nMr Weir said he had read some reports concerning the effectiveness of the lateral-flow test test and the possibility of \"false positives\".\n\"No test is completely accurate, but studies indicate a very high degree of effectiveness at detecting those who are infectious,\" he said.  \n\"When infection levels are low in the community, a positive LFD test indicates that the individual may have Covid,\" he added. \nHe said this should be confirmed by a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test done in a Covid testing centre.\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said the tests were \"important as an additional measure alongside the range of existing safety measures in place to help ensure the safety of staff and pupils in schools\".\nTesting for school staff, including teaching and support staff, and pupils will be twice weekly three to four days apart using LFD tests.  \nOlder students in years 12-14 are included as prevalence of Covid-19 tends to be higher among this group, the department said. \nMr Weir said the testing programme will \"provide reassurance for pupils and teachers that the risk of large groups of exam year classes having to isolate during this important period, will be considerably reduced\".\nThe plan has three phases. \nThey and their household must isolate immediately.  \nIn-school contacts are not required to isolate at this stage.  The individual must then take a PCR test. \nIf the PCR test is negative they, and their household, can stop isolating and return to school. \nIf the PCR test result is positive the individual and their household and all other close contacts must complete a full 10 days of self-isolation.

      "text": "Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan, Olivia Colman, Daniel Kaluuya and Sir Anthony Hopkins are among the British stars nominated for this year's Oscars.\nVanessa Kirby, Gary Oldman and Riz Ahmed are among the other UK nominees.\nIt's also the most diverse Oscars ever, with nine of the 20 acting nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds.\nAnd two women were nominated for best director - the first time more than one woman has been shortlisted for that prize in the awards' 93-year history.\nChloe Zhao is nominated for directing Nomadland, and Britain's Emerald Fennell is recognised for Promising Young Woman.\nOther nominated stars include Frances McDormand, Glenn Close, Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman.\nMank, the black-and-white drama starring Oldman as Citizen Kane writer Herman Mankiewicz, leads the overall field with 10 nominations.\nThis year's winners will be announced on 25 April at a delayed ceremony that will take place at both the Dolby Theatre, the ceremony's normal home, and Los Angeles' main railway hub, Union Station.\nThe eight British acting nominees range from Ahmed, who receives his first Oscar nomination for playing a drummer who loses his hearing in Sound of Metal, to Sir Anthony, whose performance as a man who loses his grip on reality in The Father earns him his sixth nomination.\nAt 83, he is the oldest person ever to be nominated for best actor. Sir Anthony and Ahmed are joined on the award's five-strong shortlist by Oldman, who won the trophy three years ago for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour.\nColman will hope to repeat her 2019 success with The Favourite after being nominated this year for her role in The Father.\nCarey Mulligan is nominated for Promising Young Woman despite being shut out by this year's Baftas. The revenge thriller also earns Fennell - best known for her acting in Call the Midwife and The Crown - nominations for best picture and best original screenplay as well as best director.\nKirby, who also made her name on The Crown, is nominated for playing a traumatised mother in Pieces of a Woman, while Kaluuya and Baron Cohen are up for best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 respectively.\nOther British nominees include singer Celeste for best song, for her contribution to The Trial of the Chicago 7; and Aardman's A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film.\nSix black actors and actresses are nominated, equalling the record set in 2017. This year, Kaluuya, Boseman and Davis are joined by US stars Andra Day, LaKeith Stanfield and Leslie Odom Jr - who is also up for best original song.\nDavis is shortlisted for playing a 1920s blues singer in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - the fourth nomination of her career, making her the most-nominated black actress ever.\nAhmed is the first actor of Pakistani descent to get an Oscar nomination and the first Muslim to be up for best actor; and Yuh-Jung Youn is the first South Korean actress to get an Oscar nod. \n\"Never in my dreams did I ever think a Korean actress would be nominated for an Oscar, and I can't believe it's me!\" she said. She will be joined at the ceremony by Steven Yeun, her Korean-American co-star in Minari, who is nominated for best actor.\nMinari is also up for the Academy Awards' top prize, best picture, which is given to a film's producers. Its rivals for that award include Judas and the Black Messiah, which is the first best picture nominee to have an all-black line-up of producers.\nBoseman is nominated alongside Davis for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - his final role before he died of cancer at the age of 43 last year.\nThe much-loved star, who is also known for his role in Black Panther, is the favourite to be given the best actor award.\nIf he does, he will be only the second posthumous best actor winner after Peter Finch for Network in 1976.\nOnly five women had been nominated for best director before, and only one has won - Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010.\nThis year, two of the five contenders are female, with Chinese-born, US-based Zhao the hot favourite for her story of a woman, played by Frances McDormand, who lives a nomadic life in a van.\nZhao is up for a total of four awards this year - best picture, best adapted screenplay and best editing, as well as best director. If she wins them all, she will equal a record set by Walt Disney, who is the only person to have won four Oscars in the same night.\nFennell is the first British woman to be up for best director. Some predicted a third female best director nominee this year, with Regina King tipped for One Night in Miami. She won an Oscar for her acting for If Beale Street Could Talk in 2019, but will not get a directing award to go with it this year.\nOverall, a record 76 nominations went to women this year, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards.\nThe 73-year-old has her eighth Oscar nomination for playing a foul-mouthed, prosthetic-nosed grandmother in Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy.\n\"I dedicate this honour to all the grandmothers in the world who fight to give their children a better life,\" she said.\nHer previous nominations have come for films like The World According to Garp, Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons. She has never won. So could this finally be her year?\nProbably not - the favourites for best supporting actress are Yuh-Jung Youn and Maria Bakalova, the Bulgarian newcomer who is rewarded for playing Borat's daughter in Baron-Cohen's comedy sequel.\nPlus, Hillbilly Elegy was panned by many critics, and Close now has the dubious honour of being only the third person to be up for an Oscar and a Razzie (for the worst films of the year) for the same performance.\nMank, about the making of Citizen Kane, may have the most Oscar nominations with 10, but it is highly unlikely to win best picture.\nCrucially, it failed to land a screenwriting nomination. In the past 55 years, the only films to have been named best picture without one are The Sound of Music and Titanic - a musical and a film that relied on spectacle rather than script. \nIt has also missed out in best editing, a category in which, since 1981, every best picture winner has been nominated - apart from Birdman, which gave the appearance of not having been edited.\nMank's omission in these categories suggests it is a film the Academy admires, rather than loves.\nIt would appear to be destined for the same fate as the film it is about, which nominated for best picture at the 1941 Oscars, but lost out to How Green Was My Valley.\nI have the favourite as Nomadland, which has already been a winner at the Golden Globes and the Critics' Choice Awards. However, it has one thing going against it - the Academy almost never rewards female-fronted films. Last year, 68% of Oscar voters were men and of the last 15 best picture winners, only one (The Shape of Water) even managed a best actress nomination. "

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Netherlands,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The Netherlands has become the latest country to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine over concerns about possible side effects.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) say there is no indication of a link between the vaccine and reports of blood clots.\nEight countries have so far fully suspended the AstraZeneca vaccinations. \nThe WHO told Reuters it was important that vaccination campaigns continued. \n\"It is normal for countries to signal potential adverse events. This does not mean that the events are linked to vaccination but its good practice to investigate them,\" the agency was quoted as saying. \nAbout 17 million people in the EU and the UK have received a dose of the vaccine, with fewer than 40 cases of blood clots reported as of last week, AstraZeneca said.\nExperts say the number of blood clots reported after the vaccine were no more than those typically reported within the general population.\nThe Dutch government said its suspension, which will last until at least 29 March, was a precaution. \nThe Irish Republic, Denmark, Norway, Bulgaria and Iceland have paused inoculations with the vaccine, while the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia have delayed the start of their AstraZeneca rollouts. Several European countries, including Italy and Austria, have suspended the use of certain batches of the drug as a precautionary measure. \nThailand announced that it would start using the vaccine on Tuesday, following a brief delay to the rollout over safety concerns. \nThe EMA - which is currently carrying out a review into incidents of blood clots - said the vaccine could continue to be administered. \nThe UK medicines regulator also said evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots, as it urged people in the country to get the vaccine when asked to do so. \nProfessor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group which developed the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, told the BBC's Today programme there was \"very reassuring evidence that there is no increase in a blood clot phenomenon here in the UK, where most of the doses in Europe [have] been given so far\".\nFinland has also done a \"very careful study\" and not found an increased risk, he added.\nHe said it was \"absolutely critical that we don't have a problem of not vaccinating people\".\nWhile vast numbers of people are being vaccinated at pace around the world, some of them will still get sick with other things unrelated to the vaccine. \nThese pauses for the AstraZeneca vaccine are not because it is unsafe to give. It's to allow time for experts to explore why a small number of people who were recently given the shot also developed blood clots.\nWhen an illness occurs shortly after vaccination, it is right to question whether the shot might have contributed in any way. \nThere is no indication or evidence, however, that the vaccine was linked or responsible. \nIn the UK, more than 11 million people have already received at least one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and there has been no sign of excess deaths or blood clots occurring. Europe's drug regulator has also backed the vaccine, saying its benefits are clear. Covid can be deadly and vaccination saves lives. \nIn a statement, the Dutch government said it was acting out of precaution following reports from Denmark and Norway of possible serious side effects.\nDutch drug watchdog Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb later said that 10 cases of possible adverse side effects had been reported in the Netherlands, according to Reuters news agency. \n\"We can't allow any doubts about the vaccine,\" Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said. \"We have to make sure everything is right, so it is wise to pause for now.\"\nSpeaking on an early morning talk show on Monday, Mr de Jonge said he hoped the suspension would last \"no longer than a couple of weeks\", adding: \"We need vaccines to be able to put this nasty period behind us\".\nSunday's decision will now cause delays in the Dutch vaccination programme.\nThe authorities had pre-ordered 12 million doses of AstraZeneca, with nearly 300,000 jabs scheduled in the next two weeks. \nIt said there was no evidence of an increased risk of clotting due to the vaccine. \nIt said that across the EU and United Kingdom there had been 15 events of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) - a blood clot in a vein - and 22 events of pulmonary embolism - a blood clot that has entered the lungs - reported among those vaccinated.\nAstraZeneca said these figures were \"much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed Covid-19 vaccines\".  \n\"The nature of the pandemic has led to increased attention in individual cases and we are going beyond the standard practices for safety monitoring of licensed medicines in reporting vaccine events, to ensure public safety,\" Ann Taylor, the firm's chief medical officer, said.

The Dutch government said the move, which will last until at least 29 March, was a precaution based on reports from Denmark and Norway of possible serious side effects.\nThe UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it was aware of the suspension in Ireland and was \"closely reviewing reports\".\n\"But given the large number of doses administered, and the frequency at which blood clots can occur naturally, the evidence available does not suggest the vaccine is the cause,\" a spokesperson said.\nIn a statement, Northern Ireland's Department of Health said it administers vaccines under the \"expert direction of the MHRA\".\nIt said it had received guidance from the MHRA in light of the vaccine's suspension in the Republic and that the \"roll-out of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme will continue\".\nThe Department of Health also said a \"further expansion of the programme will be announced very shortly\". \nChair of the British Medical Association NI's GP committee, Dr Alan Stout, said it was important that anyone with a vaccine appointment scheduled attends it as planned.\n\"We are confident that the vaccine is extremely safe to use and it is one of the key facets of our fight against Covid-19,\" he said.\nOn Friday, the World Health Organisation said countries should not stop using the vaccine over fears it causes blood clots as there is no indication this is true.\nMore than 110,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been administered in Ireland, which is about 20% of all doses given to date.\nStephen Donnelly, Ireland's Health Minister, said he hoped the suspension was \"nothing more than a very short deferral\". \nIreland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said new information had been received from the Norwegian Medicines Agency on Saturday night and that, while there is no conclusion that there's a link to the AstraZeneca vaccine, the decision to suspend the vaccine programme came from \"an abundance of caution\".\nHe told Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 that there have been no reports of clotting events in Ireland similar to those seen in Norway and that there should still be full confidence in the vaccine programme.\nDr Glynn added that he hoped there will be more \"reassuring data\" this week and that the programme can restart.\n\"It may be nothing, we may be overreacting and I sincerely hope that in a week's time we are accused of being overcautious,\" he said. \nIn a statement, AstraZeneca said there was no evidence of an increased risk of clotting due to the vaccine. \nIt said that across the EU and UK there had been 15 events of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and 22 events of pulmonary embolism reported among those vaccinated.\n\"Around 17 million people in the EU and UK have now received our vaccine, and the number of cases of blood clots reported in this group is lower than the hundreds of cases that would be expected among the general population,\" said Ann Taylor, the firm's chief medical officer. \n\"The nature of the pandemic has led to increased attention in individual cases and we are going beyond the standard practices for safety monitoring of licensed medicines in reporting vaccine events, to ensure public safety.\"\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), warned that, given evidence of the vaccine's \"real-world effectiveness\", a \"stop-start approach\" to the vaccine programme needed to be considered carefully.\n\"If clear evidence of serious or life threatening side-effects emerges that will have important consequences,\" he said.\n\"However so far it hasn't and it's highly undesirable to disrupt a complex and urgent programme every time people develop illnesses after receiving vaccine that may be coincidental and not causally related.\" \nLast week, after Iceland, Norway and Denmark suspended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca, the MHRA said people should continue to get vaccinated.\n\"Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon. More than 11 million doses of the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine have now been administered across the UK,\" said Phil Bryan of the MHRA.\n\"People should still go and get their Covid-19 vaccine when asked to do so.\"\nThe Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland said it would \"closely monitor\" the situation.\n\"From our perspective the vaccine is safe and we're continuing to use it,\" said Dr Stephen Bergin, interim Director of Public Health.\n\"We've had good experience over the last three months now, we've had over 600,000 people vaccinated, not all of course with this particular vaccine.\""

      "text": "Beyonc\u00e9 has set a new record at the Grammy Awards with her 28th win.\nThe star is now the most-awarded woman in Grammys history, overtaking bluegrass singer Alison Krauss.\n\"I am so honoured, I'm so excited,\" she said while accepting her record-breaking trophy, for best R&B performance.\nTaylor Swift also made history at Sunday's ceremony, by becoming the first female artist ever to win album of the year three times.\nThe star was rewarded for her lockdown album Folklore - after previously winning with Fearless in 2010 and the pop opus 1989 in 2016.\nOnly three other artists have ever won the album of the year prize three times: Frank Sinatra, Paul Simon and Stevie Wonder.\nMore winners and nominees \nBeyonc\u00e9's 28th Grammy was presented in honour of Black Parade, a celebration of black power and resilience, which she released on Juneteenth last year.\n\"As an artist, I believe it's my job to reflect the times, and it's been such a difficult time,\" she said as she collected the award. \n\"So I wanted to uplift, encourage, celebrate all of the beautiful black queens and kings that continue to inspire me and inspire the world\".\nThe star has now equalled super-producer Qunicy Jones' total of 28 Grammys. Only classical conductor Sir Georg Solti has more, with 31.\nBeyonc\u00e9 was also part of another historic moment - when Megan Thee Stallion became the first female artist to win the best rap song award.\nThe Houston musician picked up the prize for her breakout hit Savage (Remix), on which Beyonc\u00e9 delivers a guest verse.\nBlack Parade was not the only award-winner song to reflect the Black Lives Matter movement: R&B singer H.E.R. won song of the year for I Can't Breathe, which quotes the last words of George Floyd.\nThe 46-year-old died while being arrested by police in Minneapolis last year. His death, along with that of Breonna Taylor, sparked a global wave of protests.\nAccepting the prize, H.E.R. said she never imagined \"that my fear and my pain would turn into impact\".\n\"That's why I write music,\" she added, \"and I'm so, so grateful\".\nThe singer, whose real name is Gabriella Wilson, was accompanied by her co-writer Tiara Thomas, and she recalled how they'd written I Can't Breathe \"over FaceTime\" last summer.\n\"I recorded this song by myself in my bedroom at my mom's house,\" she said. \"And I want to thank my dad - he cried, he was in tears when I wrote the song and I played it for him. He was the first person I played it for.\"\n\"But remember,\" she concluded. \"We are the change that we wish to see and you know that fight that we had in us the summer of 2020, keep that same energy. Thank you.\"\nAside from the awards, the four-hour ceremony deliberately put the focus on live music.\n\"I know that you haven't been able to go to a concert in a long time,\" said host Trevor Noah. \"So tonight we're bringing the concert to you.\"\nThe show kicked off with three back-to-back performances from Harry Styles, Billie Eilish and Haim, who performed from a circle of stages that recalled the set-up of Jools Holland's BBC TV show.\nStyles raised the curtain with his hit single Watermelon Sugar, sporting a lime green feather boa and an open-chested leather jacket. \nThe song went on to win best pop solo performance later in the ceremony, making him the first member of One Direction to win a Grammy - either as a solo artist or as part of the group.\n\"It's crazy to think someone that talented and handsome is from the same place as Boris Johnson,\" joked Noah as Styles' performance ended.\nBillie Eilish, who dominated last year's ceremony, followed with her ballad Everything I Wanted; while Haim played The Steps from their album-of-the-year nominated Women In Music Pt III.\nEilish's song later won record of the year - her second consecutive win in that category. Her Bond theme, No Time To Die, was also awarded best song written for visual media.\n\"It was a dream to make the song,\" said the 19-year-old. \"I have no words. I can't believe this is real. I couldn't believe it was real then\u2026\"\nThe majority of the ceremony was held in a marquee outside the LA Convention Center, with nominees sitting at socially-distanced tables.\n\"So there's more tension in that tent than at a family reunion at Buckingham Palace,\" joked Noah, who added: \"Tonight is going to be the biggest outdoor event this year, besides the storming of the Capitol.\"\nOther prize-winners included Dua Lipa, who picked up best pop vocal album; and Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande, who became the first female duo to win best pop collaboration for Rain On Me.\nOne of the most emotional speeches came from Megan Thee Stallion, who dedicated her best new artist prize to her mother, who died of a brain tumour in 2019. \n\"She couldn't be here with me tonight,\" she had said on the red carpet earlier in the night. \"But she always knew that I would be at the Grammys, and I would be like, 'Oh mom, that's so far away' but it came so quick.\n\"And I'm just so appreciative that I'm here.\"\nPerformance highlights included Taylor Swift, who sang a medley of songs from her lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore, from an enchanted forest set.\nCardi B and Megan Thee Stallion got together for the first ever TV performance of their X-rated single WAP, while Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak unveiled their new \"supergroup\" Silk Sonic, channelling the 70s soul sounds of Earth, Wind And Fire.\nThe show also highlighted the plight of music venues by having staff from venues, including New York's Apollo Theater and LA's Troubador, present some of the awards. \nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "tags": "NI Health,Coronavirus vaccines,Vaccination,Pfizer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People aged 50 or over in Northern Ireland can now book their Covid-19 vaccine appointment, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced.\nThose who are eligible and wish to receive the vaccine can booking it online or be contacted by their GPs.\nBooking slots are available at the seven regional vaccination centres.\nThere was some frustration about the length of time some people were having to wait in the queue to book their slot on Monday.\nHowever, Mr Swann told the assembly that in the first three hours of the slots opening 30,000 people had booked vaccines. \nThe centres will primarily be using the AstraZeneca vaccine for first doses, to maximise available vaccine supplies.\nAnyone who received the Pfizer vaccine as a first dose will still receive the Pfizer vaccine for their second dose.\nNorthern Ireland's health minister told the assembly that the \"benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks\".\nIt comes after health officials in Northern Ireland said they would continue to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after its suspension in the Republic of Ireland.\nThe temporary suspension of the vaccine is already having an impact on the republic's immunisation programme. \nAbout 30,000 vaccination appointments for health staff and those at high-risk might be delayed, according to RT\u00c9.\nIrish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly described its move as \"precautionary\", after reports of serious blood clotting events in adults in Norway. \nAstraZeneca has said there is no evidence of a link between the vaccine and increased risk of clotting, while Northern Ireland's Department of Health has said it would continue to use the vaccine after receiving guidance from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\nThe latest figures show that across Northern Ireland 629,461 people have now received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 54,636 have received two.\nOn Monday, the Department of Health recorded a further 121 cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland.\nOne additional death was reported, bringing the department's total number of deaths with Covid-19 to 2,099.\nFor a second day in a row, no additional deaths were reported in the Republic of Ireland, where there have a total of 4,534 Covid-19-related deaths.\nThe Republic of Ireland's health department said there were 575 more confirmed cases, which brings that total to 227,316.\nNorthern Ireland's health minister said vaccination was a \"bridge to better, safer and more normal times for everyone\".\nChief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the more people are vaccinated then \"the more we are all protected\".\nHe received his first jab on Monday morning.\n\"Vaccination alone will not provide 100% protection but it will change the balance in our favour against this virus. \n\"When your turn comes, don't delay, get the jab. Protect yourself and others,\" he said.\nFirst Minister Arlene Foster also urged those eligible to take up the offer of a vaccine.\n\"The MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) have been very clear that it is safe to take the AstraZeneca vaccine,\" said the DUP leader.\n\"I am looking forward to taking it, either this week or next week, depending on when I am able to get my vaccine booked for, but it is very important that people continue to take the vaccine.\"\nOn Monday, Dr Alan Stout, the chair of the British Medical Association's (BMA) NI GP committee, said it was the large supply of AstraZeneca jab that allowed the vaccination programme to continue at the speed it is. \nHe advised people that it was safe to receive, and there was also a risk of blood clotting with things like long-haul air travel, the contraception pill, and some forms of surgery. \n\"These are world experts that we have in these regulators bodies and they are all saying the same thing, and they are all saying it is safe,\" he said. \nDr Stout said he was \"hopeful\" jabs would be offered to the over-40s age group by Easter, mirroring the situation reportedly happening elsewhere in the UK. \nHow bizarre. \nWhile health officials in the Republic of Ireland are choosing to pause the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, in Northern Ireland they're accelerating the programme. So who should we trust?\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) the vaccine is safe. That message has been reinforced by the British Medical Association.\nIt's hard to ignore that the MHRA has said that it has received a small number of reports of blood clots relating to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nBut it does seem that health officials in the Republic are being excessively cautious - Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly and the country's deputy chief medical officer have said as much themselves. \nRelations between the EU and AstraZeneca are somewhat toxic at present with the Republic of Ireland, where the vaccine is reportedly in short supply, having been let down so many times on delivery of the vaccine. \nWhile people in the Republic will be rolling down their sleeves, in Northern Ireland an even greater number are preparing to roll them up.\nThe rollout will continue to be prioritised based on age, in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance aimed at protecting the most vulnerable, the Department of Health has said.\nVaccines are being dispensed in parallel by GP practices and vaccination centres. \nNorthern Ireland has seven regional vaccination centres: Royal Victoria Hospital, Ulster Hospital, South Lake Leisure Centre, Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Foyle Arena,  Omagh Leisure Centre and Lakeside Leisure Centre.\nPlans are also being finalised for community pharmacies to join the programme in the coming weeks, the department added. \nAn additional regional mass vaccination centre will open at the end of March at the SSE Arena in Belfast.\nThe vaccination centres are now offering bookings to: \nCarers who have not already booked a vaccination appointment can email their health trust carer co-ordinators and they will make the necessary arrangements.\nGPs are providing vaccines to: \nThe latter clinically vulnerable (CV) group is expected to largely mirror those who receive the winter flu vaccine each year because of their medical conditions.  \nCEV and CV individuals aged 16 and 17 years of age cannot receive the vaccine being used in GP practices.\nThese individuals will receive a letter from their GP and are able to book a vaccination slot at one of the vaccination centres.\nPeople who want to book a vaccination centre appointment are asked to do so online if it all possible.\nIf online booking is not possible, then the telephone booking number is 0300 200 7813.\nThe booking line is open 08:00 GMT until 20:00 Monday to Friday."

      "text": "Two of the biggest names in hospitality have threatened to take the government to court over its plans to release England from lockdown.\nPunch Taverns founder Hugh Osmond and Greater Manchester's night time economy adviser, Sacha Lord, said the industry is losing \u00a3200m a day.\nIn a letter to the prime minister, they said there is no \"evidence or justification\" to open shops five weeks before pubs and restaurants.\nThey said it is \"plainly irrational\".\nThe government has insisted the lockdown easing must be cautious if it is to be irreversible, adding that it will driven by data and not dates. \nUnder current plans, non-essential retail will be able to open from 12 April if new coronavirus infections are kept under control. Outdoor hospitality, such as beer gardens, will also be allowed to reopen then.\nBut pubs and restaurants will not be allowed to welcome customers through their doors to sit inside until at least 17 May.\nThe industry has long argued that pubs re-opening last July had a negligible effect on infections, which only began to rise after schools reopened. And the Chancellor recently defended his own Eat out to Help out scheme, arguing that it protected jobs.\nThe two men have asked the government to seek specific advice from scientists \"whether it is justifiable to prevent the hospitality industry opening whilst, at the same time, allowing non-essential shops to open\".\nThey argued that \"transmission is plainly higher in non-essential shops,\" and said they would pursue legal action if the government did not provide evidence to the contrary.\n\"This legal case will give a fighting chance to over three million people who work in hospitality, to the tens of thousands of businesses, suppliers, landlords and contractors - large and small - forced into bankruptcy, and to millions of our loyal customers who have been deprived of the human social interaction they experience in our premises,\" Mr Osmond said.\nHe added that the extended lockdown for hospitality venues could have a \"potentially indirectly discriminatory effect\" on young people and people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds working in the sector.\n\"I believe we can show that discrimination and unsubstantiated beliefs, rather than facts, science and evidence, lie at the heart of much of the government's approach to hospitality, and these wrongs need to be righted.\""

The inquiry, which will interview witnesses and look at evidence, could eventually see him thrown out of office. \nThe Democratic senators for New York, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, said Mr Cuomo had \"lost the confidence\" of New Yorkers.\nOn Sunday, Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said \"what these women have said must be treated with respect. They are credible and serious charges.\" \n\"The governor should look inside his heart - he loves New York - to see if he can govern effectively,\" Ms Pelosi told ABC's This Week.\nShe too though, like President Biden, stopped short of calling for his resignation. \nMr Cuomo, whose term in office comes to an end in 2022, was last year praised for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak in his state. However, this year he has been accused of obscuring the scale of Covid-related deaths in the state's nursing homes.\nMr Cuomo was first accused of harassment in February, when Lindsey Boylan, a former top-level aide, wrote in an essay that the governor touched her without her consent and frequently made inappropriate comments about her appearance.\nMs Boylan accused Mr Cuomo of kissing her on the lips and asking her to play strip poker while on his private jet.\nSeveral more women have come forward with allegations. The most serious allegation, that Mr Cuomo groped an unnamed woman beneath her blouse, was referred to police.\nOn Friday, Jessica Bakeman, a former statehouse reporter in Albany, accused Mr Cuomo of repeatedly touching her. She wrote in New York magazine: \"He uses touching and sexual innuendo to stoke fear in us. That is the textbook definition of sexual harassment.\"\nMr Cuomo has yet to comment on the new allegation."

      "text": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has appeared in court in Iran, a week after her ankle tag was removed having served five years in prison, her lawyer said.\nThe British-Iranian charity worker was ordered to appear on charges of propaganda against the regime.\nThe judge told her to expect a verdict within seven working days, according to the Free Nazanin campaign.\nHer husband Richard said the British embassy in Tehran had declined to accompany his wife to Sunday's trial.\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was jailed in 2016 for allegedly working against the Iranian government, which she has always denied.\nAccording to her lawyer, she was accused in Sunday's hearing of participating in a demonstration outside the Iranian embassy in London 12 years ago and giving an interview to the BBC Persian service, said BBC correspondent Caroline Hawley.\nHer lawyer said the atmosphere in court had been calm and he hoped she would be acquitted because she has already served five years on a more serious charge.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab called it \"unacceptable and unjustifiable\" that Iran has chosen to continue with the second \"wholly arbitrary\" case, saying the Iranian government has \"deliberately put her through a cruel and inhumane ordeal\". \nHe added: \"Nazanin must be allowed to return to her family in the UK without further delay. We continue to do all we can to support her.\"\nBy Caroline Hawley, Diplomatic correspondent\nThere is a good reason why Richard Ratcliffe describes his wife as a \"pawn\" in a game of chess, a bargaining chip. And she's not alone.\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - together with several other dual nationals from a range of countries - is caught up in the middle of some complicated geopolitics.\nThe backdrop to her case is the West's difficult relationship with Iran, and a growing emphasis by Iran on \"hostage diplomacy\".  \nThe charity worker was told explicitly that her imprisonment was linked to a \u00a3400m debt owed by Britain for an arms deal to Iran that was done before she was even born.   \nIn the days of the Shah, Iran had bought tanks from Britain but, after the 1979 Revolution, they were not delivered.   \nThe UK and Iran have been haggling in court over interest on the debt for years. And when UK PM Boris Johnson spoke by phone to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani last week to demand Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, the Iranian president apparently complained that no \"practical progress\" had been made by the UK to repay the debt.   \nWhatever happens in the courts, the message from Iran seems to be, if not loud, at least pretty clear.\nMuch less clear is when her ordeal will be over.\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, Labour's Tulip Siddiq, said she was \"deeply concerned about the possible outcome\" and said the anxiety of waiting for a verdict will \"just add to her ongoing mental torture\".\nShe also criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson for not being \"capable of ensuring that British officials attended her court hearing to ensure a fair trial\".\nMs Siddiq said: \"Now is the time to bring Nazanin home to the UK, and our government has a responsibility to pull every possible lever to make that happen.\"\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family fear the court case could be used to block her return to the UK because the Iranian government wants to keep her for diplomatic leverage.\nMr Johnson has called for her \"immediate release\".\nEarlier, Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had been due to report to court at 09:00 Iranian time (05:30 GMT), but did not know when her trial would be heard, what it would entail or how long it would be.\nShe was expected to appear in the Revolutionary Court, in front of the same judge who conducted her earlier hearings.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Ratcliffe said that neither he nor his wife had any idea what to expect. \"It's like trying to read tea leaves,\" he said.\n\"The charges are irrelevant. This is not a real court process. This is not a fair trial - it's an act of abuse.\n\"Nazanin is now pretty stressed. She is extremely twitchy, restless and agitated.\"\nMr Ratcliffe had hoped the British ambassador would accompany his wife to the trial, but said the British embassy in Tehran had declined.\n\"I am disappointed that the embassy has declined to accompany Nazanin to the Revolutionary Court,\" he told the BBC. \n\"To my mind, it is a missed opportunity to protect her, a missed opportunity to stand up for her as British, and it is not the first. I hope that timidity is not a choice that we come to regret.\"\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it had formally requested access to the hearing.\nAmnesty International UK said it was disappointed UK officials did not attend Sunday's hearing \"to show Nazanin the kind of support she needs and is entitled to\". \nDirector Kate Allen added: \"One trumped-up case against Nazanin was bad enough - a second one is an act of cruelty.\" \nThe case comes after a charity warned in a medical report sent to the UK government that the 43-year-old was suffering from major depression and PTSD and was in need of urgent treatment. \nThe report, commissioned by the human rights charity Redress, said she was interrogated for hours, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement at the beginning of her sentence.\nBefore her ankle tag was recently removed, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been under house arrest in Tehran since being released from jail last March due to the coronavirus crisis."

      "title": "Is Europe's AstraZeneca jab decision-making flawed?",
      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "A number of countries have decided to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as a precaution following reports that some people have suffered blood clots after being given the jab.\nBut is it a case of being too cautious? Are these nations missing the bigger picture?\nThe decision has been made on the basis of the precautionary principle - a well-established approach in science and medicine that stresses the need to pause and review when evidence is uncertain.\nBut in a fast-moving pandemic, when each decision can have major consequences, it is an approach which can sometimes do more harm than good.\nThe data supplied by AstraZeneca shows there have been 37 reports of blood clots among the 17m people across Europe who have been given the vaccine. \nBut the key question that has to be asked is whether this is cause or coincidence? Would these clots have happened anyway? \nAdverse events like this are monitored carefully, so regulators can assess if they are happening more than they should.\nThe 37 reports of clots are below the level you would expect. What is more, there is no strong biological explanation why the vaccine would cause a blood clot. \nIt is why the World Health Organization and UK drugs regulators have all said there is no evidence of a link.\nEven the European Medicines Agency, which is looking into the reports, has suggested the vaccine should continue to be used in the meantime given the risk Covid presents to health.\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, the decisions by individual nations to pause their rollouts have baffled experts.\nProf Adam Finn, a member of the WHO's working group on Covid vaccines, says stopping rollout in this way is \"highly undesirable\" and could undermine confidence in the vaccine, costing lives in the long-term.\n\"Making the right call in situations like this is not easy, but having a steady hand on the tiller is probably what is needed most.\"\nThis is not the first time countries in Europe have exercised caution about the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nThe precautionary principle was adopted by Germany, France and others when they did not initially recommend use of the vaccine for the over-65s. French President Emmanuel Macron even called it \"quasi-ineffective\".\nThe over 65s decision has now been reversed, but the impact is still being felt it seems.\nGermany and France have supplies of the vaccine going to waste, with both countries having used fewer than half their supplies of the AstraZeneca jab so far. It has left them far more reliant on the Pfizer vaccine than the UK is.\nAnd this is threatening to have deadly consequences. France, Germany and the other major European nations all have higher rates of infection than the UK, and face the prospect of things getting worse before they get better.\nIf you look back at the decision on the over-65s, you can see how it was made. The way the trials had been organised meant there was limited evidence on its use in older age groups.\nThe organisers had wanted to recruit younger adults in the initial stages for safety reasons, so when it came to regulators assessing infection rates the data was not yet ready for older people.\nBut there was evidence from blood samples that the vaccine had prompted a strong immune response in the older age groups. So there was no reason why the vaccine would not work in older age groups - it was just that insufficient time had passed to gather the evidence in the real world.\nThere was also a problem interpreting results because of the way the trial was run. There was a lack of consistency across the different sites used. \nProtocols and practices followed varied across each, including the use of a half-dose in one.\nSome have described it as four trials within a trial. It created a somewhat messy set of data to interpret.\nThe UK looked past this and took the leap though - and within months was reporting \"spectacular\" results in reduced levels of serious illness in the over-80s.\nIt was this pragmatic approach to decision-making that also led the UK to recommend up to a three-month gap between doses.\nThis caused much controversy when it was announced at the end of December.\nThe Pfizer vaccine was not tested like this in trials - the interval was three weeks.\nBut again, the absence of evidence did not mean the move would not work or was not based on logic. \nThe AstraZeneca trials did have longer intervals for some participants, which seemed to make it more effective, while evidence on the Moderna vaccine, which is a similar type of jab to Pfizer, also suggested it could work.\nIt is also well-established that with two-dose vaccines, most of the protection is provided by the first dose, while the second boosts that and provides more long-lasting protection. \nWith cases rising rapidly at the time, the UK was clear the benefit of maximising available vaccine supplies to provide some protection to more people was the right step even if the trial evidence did not directly support it.\nProf Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in understanding risk at Cambridge University, says it shows that sometimes you have to look beyond the precautionary principle and be bold in your decision-making.\n\"The precautionary principle favours inaction as a way of reducing risk. But the problem is that these are not normal times and inaction can be more risky than action.\"\nWhat is needed in circumstances like these, according to Sir David, is to work out what is most likely on the balance of probability. That requires looking at both the direct and indirect evidence and the context those decisions are being made in.\n\"Sometimes it can be harmful to wait for certainty. Not vaccinating people will costs lives.\" "

      "tags": "Depression,Mental health",
      "text": "A powerful hallucinogenic drug known for its part in shamanic rituals is being trialled as a potential cure for depression for the first time.\nParticipants will be given the drug DMT, followed by talking therapy. \nIt is hoped this could offer an alternative for the significant number of people who don't respond to conventional pills for depression.\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy might offer longer-term relief from symptoms, some researchers believe. \nA growing body of evidence indicates other psychedelic drugs, particularly alongside talking therapy, are safe and can be effective for treating a range of mental illnesses. \nThis will be the first time DMT is given to people with moderate to severe depression in a clinical trial. \nDr Carol Routledge, the chief scientific officer of Small Pharma, the company running the trial said: \"We believe the impact will be almost immediate, and longer lasting than conventional antidepressants.\"\nThe drug is known as the \"spirit molecule\" because of the way it alters the human consciousness and produces hallucinations that have been likened to a near-death experience. \nIt is also the active ingredient in ayahuasca, a traditional Amazonian plant medicine used to bring spiritual enlightenment.\nResearchers believe the drug might help loosen the brain's fixed pathways, which can then be \"reset\" with talking therapy afterwards.\nDr Routledge likened the drug to \"shaking a snow globe\" - throwing entrenched negative thought patterns up in the air which the therapy allows to be resettled into a more functional form.\nBut this hypothesis still needs to be proven.\nThe team is consulting Imperial College London, which runs the pioneering Centre for Psychedelic Research.\nAs part of the study, they hope to investigate whether the drug can be administered as a one-off or as part of a course.\nSubjects will be followed up for at least six months to see how long the effects of the treatment last. \nMeanwhile, a ketamine-assisted therapy clinic is set to open in Bristol next week.\nWhile the drug is already used for depression in clinics like the ketamine treatment service in Oxford, it is not accompanied by psychotherapy. \nRather, it is used to provide temporary relief from symptoms for people who have very serious, treatment-resistant depression. \nSo-far unpublished researched presented at a conference by professor of psychopharmacology at the University of Exeter, Celia Morgan, suggests ketamine accompanied by therapy has much longer-lasting effects. \nProf Morgan said there was mounting evidence that drugs, including psilocybin, LSD, ketamine and MDMA (Ecstasy), were safe and could play a role in the treatment of mental health disorders.\nAnd there was some early evidence they could have longer-term effects than the medicines conventionally prescribed as antidepressants, known as SSRIs, but more research was needed.\nThey also worked using a completely different mechanism, Prof Morgan explained. \nWhile conventional drugs may numb negative feelings, \"these drugs seem to allow you to approach difficult experiences in your life, sit with that distress and process them,\" she said. \n\"It might be getting at something more fundamental\" that was the root cause of the problem, Prof  Morgan said. \n\"Through that we think you can get much more long-lasting change.\"\nProf Michael Bloomfield, a consultant psychiatrist at University College London, said although it was a \"really exciting\" area of research, caution was needed in overpromising the drugs' potential. \nIt was also a field of therapy that could be open to abuse and misuse, he said.  \nProf Morgan also stressed the importance the drugs being used within the context of therapy  as there were concerns that \"people might think they can give it a go with some recreational drugs\". \n\"But it's really not how it works\" she said."

The next film, which has been delayed several times, is currently scheduled for release in December 2022.\n\"We are proud to reach this great milestone, but Jim (James Cameron) and I are most thrilled that the film is back in theatres during these unprecedented times, and we want to thank our Chinese fans for their support,\" said Avatar producer Jon Landau.\nChinese movie theatres have been open for several months now since pandemic-led shutdowns, and local movies have also been enjoying some of their strongest box-office sales ever.\nAhead of its re-release in China, Avatar grossed around $760m in the US and just over $2bn internationally. \nEarlier this month, Disney's premiered its first South East Asian heroine movie in cinemas\nRaya and the Last Dragon sees her travel around the region to reunite its people and attempt to save the world in the process."

      "tags": "EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks,Coronavirus vaccines,Moderna,Pfizer,European Union,Coronavirus pandemic,AstraZeneca",
      "text": "The rollout of Covid vaccines in European Union (EU) countries is picking up speed, with more than 300 million jabs  administered.\nAs of 20 June, nearly half of the EU's adult population have had at least one one dose, while 28% have been fully vaccinated.\nEarlier this year, the rollout was hit by delays in production and distribution and vaccine hesitancy in some countries.\nIn the week to 20 June 2021, Germany administered an average of 1 dose per 100 people a day, with Italy and France close behind on  0.9 dose per 100 people - all higher than the UK's 0.6 per 100.\nHungary - which is using Russian and Chinese vaccines as well as the EU-approved ones - has fully vaccinated 46% of its population, the same proportion as the UK. \nIn France, children who are 12 and over can be vaccinated, with parental consent. The government is hoping to avoid class closures when schools reopen after the summer holidays. \nThe EU authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12-15 at the end of May. \nGermany said it would give it to those aged 12-17 with pre-existing conditions while a number of other EU countries said they would vaccinate children before the start of the next academic year.\nIn June 2020, all 27 member states joined a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines.\nHowever, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca and there were supply problems.\nIts deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also saw early problems with production and distribution.\nIn February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine difficulties, saying: \"We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.\" \nIn January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initially refused to recommend its use for people over 65.\nFrance and Germany eventually revised their stance and approved the vaccine for 65-74 year olds at the beginning of March.\nThey were again among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again later in March, following reports that a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. \nOn 7 April, the EMA said there was a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and the clots, although it is still recommended the jab for all age groups. \nSeveral EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands now say only people over 55 or 60 should get the jab, while others like Denmark have suspended its use altogether. \nThe headlines surrounding AstraZeneca led to a drop in confidence in the jab. In March, the polling company YouGov suggested that only a third of Germans and 23% of French respondents considered it safe.\nThe EU took AstraZeneca to court to force it to deliver more doses of vaccine. The company blamed production problems but said it had \"fully complied\" with its contract.\nThe EU lost its legal battle. It had wanted AstraZeneca to deliver 120 million doses by the end of June but a court ruled that the company must instead provide 80 million doses by the end of September. \nThe EU said the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom have plants in the EU.\nEU leaders considered a ban on exports of vaccines to the UK but decided not to introduce one.\nInstead, they called for more transparency from the UK and other countries on the number of doses they export.\nThe EU says that by 1 June 2021, it had exported 245 million doses to 46 different countries. \nUnder the terms of the EU scheme, member states are not supposed to strike deals with any vaccine manufacturer with whom the EU already has an agreement, but they can make separate deals with vaccine makers which have not signed agreements with the EU.\nHungary has been using Russia's Sputnik vaccine for months and and Slovakia has also bought doses of it.\nGermany said in April it would begin talks to secure supplies of the Russian vaccine and Austria said it would buy one million doses, but only once the EU's medicines agency approves the jab for use in the EU. \nThe Czech Republic and Poland have entered talks with both Russia and China.\nThe UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November 2020, nearly three weeks before EU regulators. \nThe government claimed that being outside the EU allowed it to be more nimble in this area. \nHowever, the UK's approval of the vaccine would have been permitted anyway under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator.\nThe UK could have joined the EU vaccine scheme last year while it was still in a transition phase with the EU, but it chose not to. \nIf it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies."

      "text": "Chocolate maker Thorntons has said none of its stores will reopen after coronavirus lockdowns are lifted.\nThe decision to close its 61 shops will put more than 600 jobs at risk.\nThe company said it had been badly hit by the pandemic, which forced its stores to shut their doors during the crucial Christmas and Easter holidays.\n\"The obstacles we have faced and will continue to face on the High Street are too severe,\" said Thorntons retail director Adam Goddard.\n\"Despite our best efforts we have taken the difficult decision to permanently close our retail store estate.\"\nThorntons has been on the High Street for more than a century but these days history isn't enough to guarantee survival. \nIt was losing its way in the early 2000s with newer players, like Hotel Chocolat, entering the scene. It also embarked on a strategy of selling more chocolates through supermarkets and closing unprofitable shops. \nItalian food giant Ferrero bought the business in 2015 and has been trying to turn it around ever since. Over the last five years, it's shrunk from 252 to 61 stores. \nBut Ferrero has now thrown in the towel on Thorntons stores altogether, betting that the brand's future is now online and on the supermarket shelves. \nThis pandemic has created brutal trading conditions for so many traditional retailers. And the high street shakeout is still far from over. \nThorntons said it had spent \u00a345m transforming the business with changes to the way stores operate and the introduction of new cafes but its plans had been thrown off course by the pandemic.\nThe company, which was founded in Sheffield in 1911, said it would continue to sell its chocolate online and try to sell more through supermarkets.\nSince the beginning of the crisis, sales through its website have increased by more than 70% compared to the previous year, it said. \nIt will also try to expand the range of products made at its factory in Alfreton, Derbyshire and increase international sales.\nIn 2011, Thorntons announced plans to massively reduce the number of stores it had on the High Street and in shopping centres.\nIt said it would close up to 180 of the 364 stores it had at the time, following a strategic review.\nSince then, the number of stores has dwindled to 61.\nIn 2015, Italian food giant Ferrero bought the chocolate chain for \u00a3112m.\nIn a statement, the company said: \"We remain committed to this iconic British brand and will continue to invest further in the future potential of Thorntons to ensure we evolve with the times.\"\nThorntons is just the latest well-known name to suffer the impact that rolling lockdowns have had on the High Street as more people take to shopping online.\nMore than 17,500 chain stores and other venues closed in Great Britain last year, according to figures from the Local Data Company. That is an average rate of 48 closures a day.\nLast week, department store chain John Lewis announced plans to close more stores.  Other casualties have included PSir Philip Green's retail empire, Arcadia, which included Topshop and Dorothy Perkins.\nAre you a Thorntons employee?

It's only at the prime minister's desk that all these different considerations come together. \n\"I'm responsible for the health aspects and then the huge economic response the chancellor is responsible for.\"\nWe can also reveal that Boris Johnson had been briefed by officials ahead of a press conference on 3 March 2020 - right at the start of the pandemic - to discourage people from shaking hands with each other.\nInstead, when he took to the lectern, the PM boasted he \"shook hands with everybody\" during a hospital visit.\nA spokesman for No 10 said: \"The prime minister was very clear at the time he was taking a number of precautionary steps, including frequently washing his hands. \n\"Once the social distancing advice changed, the prime minister's approach changed.\"\nIt's also understood the moment Mr Johnson realised the gravity of the situation was at a small meeting of No 10 staff on 14 March 2020. \nData experts told the prime minister that the government's forecasts of how the disease was spreading were wrong, and without an acceleration of the plans to control the pandemic, the NHS would be overwhelmed. \nHe was also warned that restrictions could be needed for as long as 18 months. \nA special BBC News podcast, presented by Laura Kuenssberg, looking back at the past 12 months of the Covid crisis in the UK can be heard here."

      "tags": "Women,Australia",
      "text": "Tens of thousands of people have turned out to marches across Australia, protesting against the sexual abuse and harassment of women in the country.\nThey were spurred by a recent wave of allegations of sexual assault, centred around Australia's parliament.  \nThe allegations have focused scrutiny on the conservative government.\nThe protests were organised a week ago, after Attorney General Christian Porter revealed he was the subject of a 1988 rape allegation - which he denies.\nA separate case - that of Brittany Higgins, an ex-political adviser who alleged in February that she was raped in a minister's office in 2019 - has also fuelled public anger.\nProtesters feel the government's response to the sexual assault allegations has been inadequate.\nMs Higgins spoke to the thousands of protesters outside Parliament House on Monday, saying: \"There is a horrible societal acceptance of sexual violence experienced by women in Australia.\"\n\"My story was on the front page for the sole reason that it was a painful reminder to women that if it can happen in Parliament House, it can truly happen anywhere.\"\nThe protest rallies - known as the March 4 Justice - formed from noon on Monday across 40 cities and towns in Australia, including the major cities of Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne as well as smaller country towns. \nOrganisers suggested it could be the \"biggest uprising of women that Australia's seen\".\nMany attendees carried placards and wore black in protest. In Melbourne, protesters carried a long banner listing the names of women killed in acts of gendered violence in the past decade.\nOrganisers at the Canberra rally also presented a petition to lawmakers with over 90,000 signatures calling for greater accountability over sexist behaviours in parliament.\nThey have also called for Mr Porter - a senior government minister - to stand aside. Police have closed their case against the attorney general, but others have argued for a separate inquiry into the allegation against him.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison declined to meet the protesters despite their urging, and was forced to defend his decision in parliament.\nOn Sunday, he had invited a delegation to meet with him in Parliament House but protest organisers declined, arguing that he and the government's minister for women should meet with them at the rally.\n\"We have already come to the front door, now it's up to the Government to cross the threshold and come to us. We will not be meeting behind closed doors,\" tweeted march organiser Janine Hendry on Monday.\nMost government lawmakers declined to join the rallies. However the Labor opposition and several other prominent lawmakers joined the crowd in Canberra.\nWomen of all ages are here outside the government's seat of power. \nSome tell me they've been rallying for equality since the 1970s, the 1980s - that they're tired but know how important it is to capture this moment - when anger and frustration are boiling over. \nJade Catton is a mother of four: two boys and two girls all under the age of 10. \n\"It's not easy to bring them here,\" she told me. \"But I want them to know this is important. I teach my children that we treat others with kindness and respect no matter who they are, what gender they are. \n\"But these basic things don't seem to apply to the government. The message from the government is that women's voices don't matter, so I brought the kids here to show them that this is not ok.\"\nThe cases in parliament have shone a light on sexist cultures and how sexual assault and harassment is dealt with more broadly across all areas of Australian society.\nMs Higgins first spoke out on 15 February about her alleged rape by a colleague - and it has triggered a wave of other women coming forward with their stories - including in Australia's school system, workplaces and other areas.\nMany have called for the government to investigate the past allegation against Mr Porter, the nation's top law officer. They want an independent inquiry into the case as well as other alleged sexual assaults in Australian politics.\nMr Morrison has resisted such calls, arguing only police should deal with the matter. But police closed their investigation on the basis they had insufficient evidence to proceed. The alleged victim died last year.\nOn Monday, Mr Porter said he would sue the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for defamation over the allegations.\nCritics also say the government has also been too slow and ineffective in responding to wider accusations of sexism and misogyny in parliamentary culture - a problem they say extends across party lines.\nOn Monday, the Labor opposition said it would also review its culture after dozens of anonymous allegations of sexual harassment and sexism against male figures within its party.\nProtesters have also argued the government's treatment of those who have spoken out so far has been unacceptable. \nMs Higgins' former boss, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds, was forced to apologise and pay compensation to her former aide, after calling her a \"lying cow\". \nMs Higgins has also criticised Mr Morrison for using \"victim-blaming\" language in discussing her case - an assertion he rejects."

More franchising will also be introduced.\nAs part of the plan, the government has promised to deliver 4,000 new electric or hydrogen buses that will be built in the UK by the end of this parliament. \nIt will also end the sale of diesel buses and has launched a consultation to decide when the ban should come into effect.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"Buses are this country's favourite way of getting around. But services across England are patchy, and it's frankly not good enough.\"\nGovernment figures from 2019 show that 7% of people travelled to work by bus, while 68% commute by car. \nBut bus use has fallen steadily over the past decade, along with financial support from both local and central government.\nIn 2009, 4.64 billion journeys were taken on local buses. By 2019, that figure was 4.32 billion.\nThe government said it wanted to encourage more people on to buses as the UK emerges from the coronavirus crisis.\n\"As we build back from the pandemic, better buses will be one of our first acts of levelling-up,\" Boris Johnson said.\n\"Just as they did in London, our reforms will make buses the transport of choice, reducing the number of car journeys and improving quality of life for millions.\" \nBut even in the capital, the number of journeys taken by bus has fallen by 1.4% since 2009.\nIn a statement, Labour's shadow bus minister Sam Tarry said: \"This so-called strategy offers nothing for those who were looking for a bold vision to reverse the millions of miles of bus routes lost across the country.\"\n\"The Tories said deregulation would improve our buses but they're running bus services into the ground. Passengers now face a toxic mix of rising fares, cuts to services and reduced access.\"\nSarah Olney, Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for transport, said: \"It's welcome that the Conservatives have finally realised that people take buses, however today's announcement will not reverse their endless cuts to our vital bus networks. \n\"Liberal Democrats believe local authorities must be at the heart of any bus strategy. This includes giving them power to run their own bus services, instead of being shackled to unpopular private bus companies who too often fail the communities they serve.\"\nThe Unite union, which represents more than 70,000 bus workers, said the plan would not be enough to reverse a decade of service cuts that have left communities isolated.\n\"The national bus strategy is an admission that the 1980s deregulation of the bus service has been a complete failure,\" said Bobby Morton, the union's national officer for passenger transport.\n\"Fares have increased, services have reduced, private operators cherry-pick the most profitable routes and social exclusion has mushroomed as connectivity has been cut.\"\nBut bus operator Stagecoach said it welcomed the \"ambition\" of the government's new strategy.\n\"For too long, the power of buses to transform local communities and local people's lives has been overlooked,\" its chief executive Martin Griffiths said.\nHe added that it was \"critical\" the new strategy was matched with \"the right level of funding\" and consistent government policy on buses.\n\"We look forward to understanding more detail around the government's plans for the future and its proposed roadmap to bridge from the pandemic to a new era for buses.\"\nToday's strategy makes the right noises that will appeal to bus users. \nBut some passenger groups say the devil could be in the detail. They want to know how the government is going to make sure it pays for the long list of promises it has made.\nThat will come down to the plans that local authorities make with bus operators. \nSome councils and operators will already be ahead of the game, with teams that are keen to work together, particularly after the past year when many bus routes and services had to change during the pandemic. \nOther councils will find it more difficult to get people with the right skills in place to be able to work out what will be best for bus users in their area.\nThe government says it will provide support and funding to help draw up those plans. \nHow each part of the country experiences these changes will depend on how those local decisions are made.

      "tags": "Hospitality industry,Restaurants,Pubs,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Two of the biggest names in hospitality have threatened to take the government to court over its plans to release England from lockdown.\nPunch Taverns founder Hugh Osmond and Greater Manchester's night time economy adviser, Sacha Lord, said the industry is losing \u00a3200m a day.\nIn a letter to the prime minister, they said there is no \"evidence or justification\" to open shops five weeks before pubs and restaurants.\nThey said it is \"plainly irrational\".\nThe government has insisted the lockdown easing must be cautious if it is to be irreversible, adding that it will driven by data and not dates. \nUnder current plans, non-essential retail will be able to open from 12 April if new coronavirus infections are kept under control. Outdoor hospitality, such as beer gardens, will also be allowed to reopen then.\nBut pubs and restaurants will not be allowed to welcome customers through their doors to sit inside until at least 17 May.\nThe industry has long argued that pubs re-opening last July had a negligible effect on infections, which only began to rise after schools reopened. And the Chancellor recently defended his own Eat out to Help out scheme, arguing that it protected jobs.\nThe two men have asked the government to seek specific advice from scientists \"whether it is justifiable to prevent the hospitality industry opening whilst, at the same time, allowing non-essential shops to open\".\nThey argued that \"transmission is plainly higher in non-essential shops,\" and said they would pursue legal action if the government did not provide evidence to the contrary.\n\"This legal case will give a fighting chance to over three million people who work in hospitality, to the tens of thousands of businesses, suppliers, landlords and contractors - large and small - forced into bankruptcy, and to millions of our loyal customers who have been deprived of the human social interaction they experience in our premises,\" Mr Osmond said.\nHe added that the extended lockdown for hospitality venues could have a \"potentially indirectly discriminatory effect\" on young people and people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds working in the sector.\n\"I believe we can show that discrimination and unsubstantiated beliefs, rather than facts, science and evidence, lie at the heart of much of the government's approach to hospitality, and these wrongs need to be righted.\""

      "text": "The government has defended its plan for noise limits on protests in England and Wales, saying it will affect only \"very disruptive\" gatherings.\nMPs will debate the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - which would apply existing rules for marches to \"static\" gatherings - on Monday.\nHome Office minister Victoria Atkins said she \"absolutely\" supported the \"right to peaceful protest\".\nBut Labour called the bill \"poorly thought out\" and \"a mess\".\nThe party will order its MPs to vote against the legislation, which also includes stronger police powers to break up \"unauthorised encampments\" and \"longer\" sentences for people convicted of serious crimes.\nThe bill's first detailed discussion in Parliament comes after four people were arrested during a vigil on London's Clapham Common on Saturday to mourn the killing of 33-year-old Sarah Everard.\nThe Metropolitan Police have been accused of being too aggressive in their handling of demonstrators, but the force said it had acted to protect people's safety and prevent possible coronavirus infections.\nThe controversy is likely to provoke extra interest when MPs begin their debate on the legislation, which the government says will allow police to \"impose conditions such as start and finish times and maximum noise levels on static protests\" of whatever size.\nThis is intended to prevent \"intimidation or harassment\" or \"serious unease, alarm or distress\" to bystanders, it adds.\nAsked on BBC's Andrew Marr Show whether the bill would inhibit personal freedom, Ms Atkins replied: \"I want to draw a very firm distinction between the peaceful vigil that [Saturday's] was and was intended to be and some of the very, very disruptive protests that we've seen in the last few years.\"\nThese had involved people blocking a hospital entrance and \"gluing themselves to buildings and gates, and stopping members of the public going about their business\", she added.\nThere was a \"real distinction\" between activities which \"inhibit the lives of people\" and peaceful protest, Ms Atkins said.\nThe bill would update legislation put in place in 1986, which the minister described as a \"very, very different\" time.\n\"We absolutely support the right to peaceful protest,\" she added. \n\"Of course make your protest, but can we try to do it in a way that's slightly more balanced than the law will currently allow?\" Ms Atkins said.\nFor Labour, shadow justice secretary David Lammy said this was \"no time to be rushing through poorly thought out measures to impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest\".\nHe added that the government had \"brought forward a bill that is seeking to divide the country\".\nMr Lammy urged ministers to work with his party \"to legislate to tackle violence against women which is forcing so many across the country to live in fear\". \nOn Saturday, Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with Ms Everard's kidnap and murder. He was remanded in custody to appear again at the Old Bailey on 16 March.\nMs Everard disappeared when walking home to Brixton from Clapham in south London on 3 March.\nHer body was found in an area of woodland in Ashford, Kent, Westminster Magistrates Court heard."

      "text": "The Chinese capital of Beijing was covered in thick dust on Monday as it experienced what its weather bureau has called the worst sandstorm in a decade. \nThe storm caused an unprecedented spike in air pollution measurements - with pollution levels in some districts at 160 times the recommended limit. \nHundreds of flights were cancelled or grounded as the sky was covered by an apocalyptic-looking orange haze.\nThe sand is being brought in by strong winds from Mongolia.\nIn Mongolia the severe sandstorms have reportedly caused six deaths and left dozens missing. \nChina's Global Times media outlet reported that at least 12 provinces in the country, including the capital, had been affected, and the weather was likely to continue through the day on Monday before improving at night.\n\"It looks like the end of the world,\" Beijing resident Flora Zou told the Reuters news agency. \"In this kind of weather I really, really don't want to be outside,\" she said.\nThe WHO currently sets safe levels of air quality based on the concentration of polluting particles called particulate matter (PM) found in the air.\nAccording to news wire AFP quoting the Global Times, the PM 10 pollution in six central districts reached \"over 8,100 micrograms per cubic metre\" on Monday. The WHO considers levels between 0-54 as \"good\" and 55-154\" as \"moderate\" levels of PM 10. \nAFP added that schools had been told to cancel outdoor events, and those with respiratory diseases advised to stay indoors. \nBeijing was historically hit by sandstorms on a much more regular basis, but pollution reduction projects - including prohibitions on new coal-fired power plants, restrictions on the number of cars on the road and reforestation - have significantly improved air quality. Sandstorms like the one seen this week, caused by wind, are harder to control.\nBut Beijing and surrounding regions have suffered from high levels of pollution in recent weeks, with one Greenpeace activist telling AFP that it was a result of \"intense\" industrial activities. \nThese, he said, exacerbated sandstorm conditions, which were the \"result of extreme weather conditions and desertification\".

Police said he had attacked them with a stick, says the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague. \nDutch police later said a warning shot had been fired as officers cleared away the demonstrators. A statement said the incident was being investigated. \n\"There might be a virus, but the shutdown of the total society is not proportional,\" protester Michel Koot, 68, told the AFP news agency.\n\"I see that a lot of our rights are easily taken away and the majority of the people don't even notice, but there's a lot going on. So I'm concerned for my grandchildren.\"\nA night-time curfew - from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30 - imposed in January led to rioting in several Dutch cities. The Netherlands had not seen a curfew since the Nazi occupation in World War Two. It is expected to remain in place till the end of March.\nBars and restaurants remain closed, along with non-essential shops. Gatherings of more than two people are banned.\nThe Netherlands has had more than 1.1 million confirmed Covid cases since the start of the outbreak, with more than 16,000 deaths, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University in the US."

      "text": "The Met Police chief has said she is not considering her position, after the force was criticised over its handling of a vigil for Sarah Everard.\nOfficers handcuffed women and removed them from crowds on Clapham Common in London on Saturday.\nCommissioner Cressida Dick said she was \"more determined\" to lead the Met.\nThe home secretary has commissioned an independent investigation into the force's decisions, which were taken in the light of Covid restrictions.\nSources said both Priti Patel and the prime minister had confidence in Dame Cressida.\nDame Cressida said she agreed on the need for a \"sober review\" and defended how officers responded to the \"really big crowd\".\n\"Quite rightly, as far as I can see, my team felt that this is now an unlawful gathering which poses a considerable risk to people's health,\" she said.\n\"I don't think anybody who was not in the operation can actually pass a detailed comment on the rightness and wrongness... This is fiendishly difficult policing.\"\nShe added: \"What has happened makes me more determined, not less, to lead my organisation.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said Ms Patel had commissioned the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), to \"conduct a lessons learned review in to the policing of the event\".\nIn a statement on Sunday night, he said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the scenes on Clapham Common and that Dame Cressida had \"committed to reviewing how this was handled\".\nHe will chair a meeting of the government's crime and justice taskforce on Monday to \"look at what further action we need to take to protect women and ensure our streets are safe\".\n\"The death of Sarah Everard must unite us in determination to drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to protect and defend them,\" he added.\nEarlier, Ms Patel said she had read a report from Dame Cressida about Saturday night's events, but \"questions still need to be answered\". \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan had also called for an investigation, describing police actions as \"unacceptable\".\nMr Khan said he had spoken to Dame Cressida and the deputy commissioner, and that he was \"not satisfied with the explanation they have provided\".\nIn a statement posted on Twitter, he said he wanted HMIC to conduct a \"full independent investigation of events\" - and the Independent Office for Police Conduct to \"investigate the actions of police officers\".\nAn official vigil planned on Clapham Common - near where Ms Everard was last seen alive on 3 March - had been called off earlier on Saturday after organisers Reclaim These Streets said police had failed to \"constructively engage\" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way.\nMr Khan added that he had asked police to work with organisers so that the vigil could go ahead.\n\"I received assurances from the Metropolitan Police last week that the vigil would be policed sensitively. In my view, this was not the case,\" he said.\nMartin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, tweeted that he would \"bring all police chiefs together\" on Monday to discuss \"what more we can do to better protect women\".\nReclaim These Streets urged mourners not to go to Clapham Common on Saturday after it called off the official vigil, asking them instead to light candles and shine other lights on their doorsteps at 21:30 GMT - to coincide with the time that Ms Everard was last seen.\nBut several hundred people gathered there to pay tribute to the 33-year-old - whose death has prompted a public debate over women's safety - despite Covid restrictions.\nIn a letter to Dame Cressida, posted on Twitter on Sunday, Reclaim These Streets accused the Met chief of putting those who attended \"at a serious health risk through a lack of Covid-safe marshalling\" and \"at risk of being manhandled, fined and arrested\" by officers.\nThe group said it believed the Met had misrepresented a High Court ruling on Friday, when a judge refused to say the event would be permitted under coronavirus regulations.\nIt recognised that the police faced \"unprecedented challenges\", but called on Dame Cressida to work with organisations and suggested it may still take \"further legal action\".\nAmong those who attended Saturday's vigil were members of Sisters Uncut. The group also held another event outside New Scotland Yard on Sunday -  which it said was to remember Ms Everard and demonstrate against broader \"police brutality\".\nOne video posted online on Saturday showed officers removing women who were standing by the bandstand. \nCries of \"shame on you\" and \"let them go\" could be heard from onlookers. The video showed them being put in a police van and driven away.\nPolice said four arrests were made at the vigil to \"protect people's safety\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the scenes were \"deeply disturbing\", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called for Dame Cressida to resign.\nDelivering a statement in the early hours of Sunday, Met Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said hundreds of people were \"packed tightly together\", posing a risk of transmitting Covid-19.\n\"We absolutely did not want to be in a position where enforcement action was necessary. But we were placed in this position because of the over-riding need to protect people's safety,\" she said in a statement.\nJamie Klingler, from Reclaim These Streets, said the event would have been \"a lot safer\" if it had been held officially, adding the group had 50 stewards who were \"trained and ready to go\". \nThe group added in a statement that it was asking Dame Cressida \"to meet us urgently\" to explain the actions taken by police. \nLabour's shadow domestic violence minister, Jess Phillips, said the force had \"got it wrong at every single turn\".\nVictims Commissioner for England and Wales Dame Vera Baird QC said there was no real prospect of police successfully intervening in the crowd, describing the circling of the bandstand as \"quasi military\".\nConservative MP Caroline Nokes, who chairs the Commons Women and Equalities Select Committee, tweeted: \"In this country we police by consent - not by trampling the tributes to a woman who was murdered and dragging other women to the ground. Badly misjudged by #metpolice.\" \nOn Sunday, people continued to visit the bandstand on the common to pay their respects to Ms Everard. \nThe BBC's Emily Unia, who has been at the scene, said there had been a \"steady stream\" of people visiting who had laid flowers and lit candles and stopped for a \"moment of reflection\". \nOn Saturday, Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with Ms Everard's kidnap and murder.\nMr Couzens was remanded in custody to appear again at the Old Bailey on 16 March.\nHave you been affected by any of the issues raised?

      "text": "Many in Wales are looking forward to their first haircut in months as hairstylists reopen.\nHairdressers and barbers can reopen for appointments only from Monday, after a relaxation of Covid lockdown rules. \nKat Trelawny, from Rhiwbina, Cardiff, has already booked appointments for her family of four. \nSalon owner Jacquie Jenkins said some clients who live alone burst into tears when she phoned them to say she was reopening.\nSalons closed before Christmas, days before Wales went into a level four lockdown on 28 December. \nConfusion remains among mobile stylists, who feel they have been \"left in the dark\" by the Welsh government over whether they can can also get back to work on Monday.\nMs Jenkins said following Friday's announcement that she could reopen, she spent the day phoning regular clients to book them in and was \"inundated\" with phone calls and voicemails.\nHer salon, in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, is now fully booked for two weeks.\nShe said some clients were emotional at the thought of returning.\n\"Some of them burst into tears when we spoke to them and said they could come in - some of them live alone and don't see many people,\" she explained. \n\"To come back and have a haircut, it's not just about the hair, it's the whole social thing and company.\n\"I'm sure I'll be quite emotional [when we reopen] as well.\" \nShe said she had been overwhelmed with the support from her clients: \"People have given us lovely cards... people have actually taken the time to congratulate us on things like the [Covid] measures and everything and how safe they felt [when they last came in].\n\"Some have paid in advance for their hair... I've had one or two clients who've actually bought a year's worth of vouchers... it's been so lovely for them to think of it, really kind.\"\nShe had mixed emotions when she heard she could reopen.\n\"I think we were all quite apprehensive, not so much going back because of the virus, but just knowing it was quite hard last year - all the sanitising, cleaning, wearing the masks and the visors, I mean it's hard work,\" she added.\n\"On the flip side, having all of that in place has given them the confidence to go back.\"\nHaving not had a haircut since last summer, Ms Trelawny said she was \"particularly excited\" to return to her salon. \nShe said her lockdown hair was starting to get her down: \"It is just really dark, I'm desperate for a cut, I've been using a straighteners and it is breaking, frazzled, limp...\n\"I've bought a special mask for my hair, heat protective spray and a nice serum... I dry it and straighten it too much.\" \nShe said visiting her hairdresser would give her a boost: \"I'll feel loads better about myself and a lot more confident, a bit more vibrant - I just feel a bit drab at the minute.\"\nIn lockdown she has let hair grow but has been cutting her husband's and son's hair. \n\"I don't think I've done a great job but I've had a go,\" she said. \n\"I watched a few YouTube clips and bought myself some clippers.\"\nMichelle Marshall, who has two hair salons in Cardiff, said she was \"very relieved\" at the news, but \"disappointed\" hairdressers only had three days notice to reopen. \n\"I heard the rumours at the beginning of the week so I got both teams in on Friday to clean the salon,\" she said.\n\"There's lots of health and safety things we have to do when a business has been closed, and sanitation - not just because of the coronavirus we've been used to, but this new variant.\n\"It does take longer because it's like a re-style really\u2026 It's not trimming what you can see, you've got to start a fresh again so everybody takes longer. \n\"And because of sanitation, you have to take at least quarter of an hour on top of the appointment time to clean down your station, sanitise your tools.\""

      "title": "Rape prosecutions: Court of Appeal says change to CPS guidance was not unlawful",
      "tags": "Sexual violence,Crown Prosecution Service",
      "text": "The Court of Appeal has dismissed a legal challenge against the Crown Prosecution Service over its policy on prosecuting serious sexual offences.\nEnd Violence Against Women had said the CPS's move away from a \"merits-based approach\" in 2016-18 was \"unlawful\".\nThe group had claimed the change led to a \"shocking and unprecedented\" fall in rape cases leading to criminal charges.\nBut the court agreed with the CPS that the change in guidance \"was not a change of legal substance\".\nEnd Violence Against Women (EVAW) had been aiming to show there was a change in policy in the way the CPS handled rape cases, and that the way the prosecutors went about that change was unlawful.\nDuring the hearing, the group had said the CPS adopted what is known as the \"bookmaker's approach\" to cases, which saw prosecutors considering what may happen based on past experience of similar cases, rather than its earlier \"merits-based approach\" based on objective assessment of the evidence in that case alone.\nLegally binding guidance on the old approach was removed in 2017, and the CPS introduced a 60% conviction rate target in relation to rape cases.\nEVAW's lawyers had argued both the volume of cases and the charging rate fell following this change in guidance.\nIn 2019/20 fewer than 2,000 rape cases were prosecuted - less than 3% of the more than 55,000 rapes reported to the police.\nAs part of their case against the CPS, End Violence against Women Coalition used Bonny Turner's experience of reporting rape and prosecutors deciding not to charge the suspect.\nMs Turner, who has waived her right to anonymity, said a man who raped her in 2016 later apologised and voluntarily confessed - but the CPS still chose not to prosecute the suspect.\nShe believes her case did not get to court partly because the CPS changes in 2017 led to prosecutors dropping cases to \"artificially inflate their conviction figures\".\nFollowing the Court of Appeal's dismissal, she told BBC News: \"Right now I'm feeling deeply shocked, angry, devastated really. Today's judgement, for me, really sends a clear signal to violent men and boys - that they can rape with impunity.\"\n\"Effectively, rape has been decriminalised and the courts have missed this opportunity to put right or to acknowledge the fact that victims of rape like me have been robbed of justice for the last few years,\" she said.\nMs Turner has previously spoken about how she was prevented from accessing therapy after being raped, because of restrictions from the judicial system.\nThe job of the CPS is to decide whether or not someone should be charged with an offence in England and Wales, based on various factors - such as whether there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect that the defendant could be convicted. The body is independent of police and the government. \nCPS director of public prosecutions Max Hill said the court's decision confirmed that the CPS \"was neither irrational nor unlawful in its approach to updating guidance for prosecutors, and that there was no change of approach in the way the CPS prosecutes rape cases\".\n\"Today's outcome means we can now give our full focus to the extensive programme of work under way to address the gap between reported rapes and cases going to court,\" he added.\nAndrea Simon, End Violence Against Women's director, said the group was \"deeply disappointed\" by the dismissal. \nShe said the court had \"given the CPS the benefit of the doubt\" and \"we still lack alternative answers\" to why rape prosecutions have fallen.\n\"Thousands of rape victims continue to be let down by a broken criminal justice system,\" Ms Simon added.\nCourt of Appeal judges Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, Lord Justice Holroyde and Lady Justice Elisabeth Laing found the EVAW's case failed on every ground.\nThey said the evidence provided by Mr Hill \"comprehensively undermines the grounds advanced by the claimant\" and that senior CPS managers were perfectly entitled to apply a \"nudge on the tiller\" to address concerns about falling conviction rates for rape cases.\nLord Burnett said the judges also rejected a submission that the CPS's decisions \"created any risk of systemic illegality\".\nEVAW said it would seek to appeal against the court's decision.\nThe group added it would have to pay about \u00a375,000 to cover the CPS's legal fees, unless the costs were waived."

      "title": "Sarah Everard: How a woman's death sparked a nation's soul-searching",
      "tags": "Violence against women,Sarah Everard murder",
      "text": "\"Missing: Please Help Our dear friend Sarah Everard,\" read the posters that went up on south London streets and local social media forums in the days after the 33-year-old disappeared on her walk home in early March.\nIt was concerning but such appeals are not exactly a rare sight, and the hope was that she would soon turn up safe and sound. \nBut in the days that followed, as police put out a CCTV image of Sarah and gave details of her last known movements, concern grew to alarm, then dread, then fear, shock and sadness.\nSarah Everard's journey from Clapham Common to Brixton had taken her through some of the capital's most populated, brightly-lit, and well-walked parts. Hundreds of people - many of them young women - tread those pavements every day and consider the streets in and around them home.\nAs the police investigation ramped up, local women were warned to be careful about venturing out alone. When a police officer was arrested - and subsequently charged with Sarah's murder - the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick acknowledged that women in London and beyond \"will be worried and may well be feeling scared\", although she said for a woman to be abducted off the street was an \"incredibly rare\" event.\nBut the case had touched a nerve, particularly as walking is one of the few activities to have been allowed during Britain's coronavirus lockdown.\nWomen across the country took to social media to discuss their own experiences of walking the streets and the lengths they went to to feel safe. Out poured stories of being followed, harassed, catcalled, assaulted and exposed to. \nHelena Wadia was one of those. She told BBC Radio 5 Live she wanted to highlight how common it was for women to feel unsafe.\n\"The first time I was catcalled I think I was about 12 years old,\" she said. \n\"I have been self-policing since then. We moderate everything - our clothing, our drinking. We get taxis where maybe we can't afford it. We hold keys between our fingers. We don't wear headphones when we're jogging. We stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting.\"\nOne tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces was liked more than 120,000 times.\nPeople even began sharing tips on what apps were out there to help women stay safe.\nAnna Birley is one of many people in recent days to have underlined that the narrative around women's safety must change.\n\"What's so upsetting is it shouldn't be our problem,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's not our fault. Women aren't the reason women get attacked.\"\nA vigil she helped plan at Clapham Common - one of several around the country - as a way of \"reclaiming our public spaces and coming together to feel a level of solidarity\" in itself became controversial when it resulted in clashes with police and women were seen being physically restrained.\nSeveral hundred people had turned up despite being told it had to be cancelled because it breached lockdown restrictions. The organisers had criticised the police for failing to \"constructively engage\" with them on efforts to make the event Covid-safe, instead of urging mourners to hold candle-lit vigils at home. \nThe Metropolitan Police defended their actions at the Clapham vigil. They said they \"were placed in this position because of the overriding need to protect people's safety\", but have faced intense criticism from across the political spectrum.\nOn International Women's Day every year, British MP Jess Phillips reads out the names of all the women and girls killed over the previous 12 months, where a man has been convicted or charged as the main perpetrator.\nThis year it fell on the day remains were found in the hunt for Sarah Everard, and she read out 118 names. \"Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives,\" Ms Phillips told Parliament. \"Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common.\"\nIn a separate debate in the Lords, Parliament's upper chamber, Baroness Jenny Jones of Moulescoomb called for an 18:00 curfew for men on the streets.\nShe later told Sky News that while she hadn't been \"entirely serious\", she wanted to make the point that \"when the police victim-blame by asking women to stay home, we don't react. We just think it's normal.\"\nSo what has been the response of men?\nAs women took to social media to tell their stories, Stuart Edwards, who lives five minutes away from where Sarah went missing, tweeted: \"Aside from giving as much space as possible on quieter streets and keeping face visible, is there anything else men can reasonably do to reduce the anxiety/spook factor?\" The tweet received 27,000 likes and more than 3,000 retweets.\nAmong those who joined the conversation was food critic Jay Rayner, who also lives in south London. \"If I find myself walking behind a single woman on a quiet street I always cross the road to the other side and ideally accelerate away as quickly as possible. I am a big man and absolutely aware what my silhouette looks like in the darkness,\" he tweeted.\nSome however have been keen to point out that it's a tiny minority of men who are attackers - using the hashtag #NotAllMen.\nBut the issue of violence against women is not one for the UK alone.\nThe World Health Organization this week published a report saying one in three women globally, around 736 million, had been subjected to physical or sexual violence in their lifetimes.\nWHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said violence against women was \"endemic in every country and culture\", and had been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"Unlike Covid-19, violence against women cannot be stopped with a vaccine,\" he said, as the WHO called for more investment in services to help vulnerable women."

      "tags": "Aung San Suu Kyi,Myanmar coup ,Myanmar,Yangon",
      "text": "Activists say 38 protesters have been killed in one of the bloodiest days yet in Myanmar since the military coup. \nSecurity forces opened fire in an area of Myanmar's largest city, Yangon, with protesters using sticks and knives.\nThe military declared martial law in the area after Chinese businesses were attacked. Protesters believe China is giving support to the military but it is unclear who was behind the attacks.\nMyanmar has been gripped by protests since the military coup on 1 February.\nMilitary rulers have detained Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's civilian leader and head of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party. \nThe NLD won a landslide in last year's election but the military alleged there had been widespread fraud.\nSome of the ousted MPs have refused to accept last month's coup and have gone into hiding.\nIn his first public address, their leader Mahn Win Khaing Than urged protesters to defend themselves against the military crackdown during what he called a \"revolution\".\n\"This is the darkest moment of the nation and the moment that the dawn is close,\" he said, adding: \"The uprising must win.\" \nAt least 21 people were reportedly killed in Yangon on Sunday. Further deaths and injuries were reported elsewhere in the country. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group said the day's death toll was at least 38.\nMedical workers said the number of people killed in the Yangon area of Hlaing Tharyar was likely to rise, with dozens suffering gunshot wounds. \nThe junta has declared martial law in Hlaing Tharyar and neighbouring Shwepyitha after China said Chinese factories in the area had been targeted and demanded protection.\nBeijing said people armed with iron bars, axes and petrol had set alight and damaged 10 Chinese facilities - mostly clothing production or storage factories - in Yangon. A Chinese hotel was also attacked. \nOn its Facebook page the Chinese embassy said some \"factories were looted and destroyed and many Chinese staff were injured and trapped\".\nThe embassy urged Myanmar to \"take further effective measures to stop all acts of violence, punish the perpetrators in accordance with the law and ensure the safety of life and property of Chinese companies and personnel in Myanmar\".\nThe military-owned Myawaddy Media reported that firefighters had been hindered in their response to the blazes by people blocking their routes. \nGunshots were heard throughout the day and military trucks were seen in the streets. \nDemonstrators barricaded themselves in with sandbags, car tyres and barbed wire when security forces opened fire. Using makeshift shields, some were seen inching forwards to retrieve the injured. \nOne officer posted on social media that police were planning to use heavy weaponry.\n\"I will not have mercy on Hlaing Tharyar and they will fight back seriously too because there are all kinds of characters there,\" the officer said in the subsequently deleted TikTok post.\n\"Three died in front of me while I was giving treatment. I'm sending another two to hospital. That's all I can say at this moment,\" one medic told AFP.\nSeveral other deaths at the hands of the military were reported in other parts of Myanmar, including a young man shot dead by security forces in the northern jade-producing city of Hpakant, and a man and a woman killed in Bago to the north of Yangon.\nMeanwhile, state TV said one police officer had been killed. Three more were injured by protesters throwing rocks and using catapults in the Bago region, MRTV said. \nIn total, more than 120 protesters have reportedly been killed during the crackdown, according to the AAPP monitoring group. \nLater in the evening, hundreds of people sat with lit candles raised at the main junction on Hledan road in central Yangon. \nNLD MPs who managed to escape arrest after the coup formed a new group, the CRPH, or Committee for Representing the Union Parliament.\nMahn Win Khaing Than was appointed the CRPH's acting head and the group is seeking international recognition as Myanmar's rightful government. \nIn a speech on Facebook, Mahn Win Khaing Than said: \"This is the time for our citizens to test their resistance against the dark moments.  \n\"In order to form a federal democracy, which all ethnic brothers who have been suffering various kinds of oppressions from the dictatorship for decades really desired, this revolution is the chance for us to put our efforts together.\n\"Despite our differences in the past, this is the time we must grip our hands together to end the dictatorship for good. \"\nThe military considers the CRPH to be an illegal group, warning that anyone co-operating with them will face treason charges.\nIndependent international observers have disputed the military's claim of the fraudulent election held in November 2020, saying no irregularities were observed.\nLast week, the military accused Ms Suu Kyi of illegally accepting $600,000 (\u00a3430,000) and 11kg of gold. No evidence was provided and an NLD lawmaker denied the allegation.\nMs Suu Kyi has been held for the past five weeks at an undisclosed location and faces several other charges including causing \"fear and alarm\", illegally possessing radio equipment, and breaking Covid-19 restrictions.\nSince the coup the military has used violent force to try to quell protests, leaving dozens dead and prompting widespread international condemnation. \nThe US has announced sanctions on coup leaders, while steps are also being taken to block access by the military to $1bn of government funds held in the US.\nThe military has dismissed criticism of its actions, instead blaming Ms Suu Kyi for the violence."
