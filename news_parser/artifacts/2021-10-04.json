      "tags": "Abortion,NI Health",
      "text": "Stormont departments have \"no duty\" to follow a government direction to set up abortion services in NI, the High Court in Belfast has heard. \nThe remarks were made by John Larkin QC during the start of a second legal challenge over abortion laws.\nIn July, political disagreement in the executive led the government to impose a deadline to establish services by next March.\nBut Mr Larkin said there was a \"screamingly obvious\" gap in the law.\nThe formal direction was issued by Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis in a bid to force Stormont to make progress.\nIt put in place a timetable on Stormont's Department of Health to bring proposals for commissioned services to executive ministers.\nIt also directed that there should be \"immediate support\" for interim early medical abortion services in Northern Ireland.\nBut the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Spuc) is challenging the move, arguing that Mr Lewis has imposed a power grab on Stormont by overriding the devolution settlement.\nMr Larkin QC - Northern Ireland's former attorney general - is acting on behalf of Spuc.\nOn Monday, he argued there was a \"fundamental lacuna\" in how the regulations were drawn up by the Northern Ireland Office.\nHe said there had been no creation of a duty when the laws were drafted.\n\"Here we have a minister of the Crown issuing a direction, with no status given to the direction and no-one is obliged to respond in the terms of the direction,\" he told the court.\n\"In the absence of that, the rule of the requirement is precisely that, to ignore it.\"\nHe argued the formal direction had omitted details specifying the requirement for the Northern Ireland Executive, or Stormont departments individually, to comply.\n\"A minister of the Crown cannot boss people about unless the law gives them power to do it and act in accordance with his edict, and this doesn't.\n\"The Northern Ireland Office may wish such a provision had been made, it may be bitterly regretting it now, but in these regulations as it stands there is no obligation to comply with them.\"\nAbortion is a matter devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nBut in 2019 a vote by MPs at Westminster - during the suspension of devolution - brought about significant changes to Northern Ireland's abortion laws.\nStormont's institutions returned three months later and remained under a responsibility to establish a permanent, central abortion service.\nBut health trusts have been only carrying out limited services, meaning some women seeking an abortion beyond 10 weeks in their pregnancy have had to travel to Great Britain to access services.\nThe Department of Health has maintained that the matter is \"controversial\" and any decision on abortion services must be made by the whole executive.\nIn May, proposals from Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Health Minister Robin Swann on commissioning of services were blocked by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nThe party is opposed to abortion and has previously criticised Mr Lewis for taking powers to act, saying it would have \"serious consequences for devolution\".\nSinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP and Alliance have said they would support the commissioning of services being imposed by Westminster, if it remains stalled by the executive.\nIn July, Mr Lewis said the \"ongoing stalemate\" had left him with no choice but to intervene, to uphold international human rights obligations. \nThe secretary of state is already facing a separate judicial review taken by Northern Ireland's Human Rights Commission, which has criticised both Stormont and Westminster over the delay in implementing full abortion services. \nThat case was heard in May. \nThis latest challenge is scheduled to last for two days, but it could be several months before judgement is delivered in both cases.\nThe Department of Health has said in line with the secretary of state's direction, it is preparing proposals on commissioning of abortion services that will be submitted to the executive later this year or in early 2022.

      "tags": "UK economy,Fuel,Haulage",
      "text": "One in five forecourts in London and the south-east of England is still without fuel, the body that represents independent fuel sellers has said.\nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there had been a \"marked improvement\" across the rest of the UK thanks to \"steady deliveries\".\nBut conditions in the South East are \"still challenging\", the PRA said.\nThe improvement in supplies has led to forecourt firm EG Group to remove its \u00a330 cap on buying fuel at its sites.\nIt said purchases were returning to normal levels in the majority of places, apart from the south of England.\nHowever, the company, which has about 400 sites in the UK, added it expected supply issues to ease \"in the coming days\" due to the military driving tankers to restore supplies.\nAbout 200 servicemen and women from the Army and RAF have been drafted in to deliver fuel from depots to forecourts.\nThe PRA said the situation around London and the South East was \"still challenging\". In these areas, it said 62% of the sites surveyed had both grades of fuel available, 18% had only one grade and 20% were dry.\nIn the rest of the country, the trade body said 86% of sites had both grades of fuel \"thanks to steady deliveries and stabilising demand\", with 6% having only one grade and 8% being dry.\n\"We are grateful for the support lent by the government through their provision of military drivers, although further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas,\" said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA.\nThe PRA represents the interests of the independent filling stations across the UK, which account for nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,380 forecourts.\nThe government has been criticised for not deploying the military earlier after panic-buying led to chaos and queues on some petrol station forecourts.\nMore than 65 drivers will start work, with plans to increase this to 200 personnel to be deployed in total, including 100 drivers.\nThe drivers have undertaken refresher training with the fuel delivery firm, Hoyer in order to take on the work.\nHoyer said the training included company safety procedures as well as equipment familiarisation and forecourt driving manoeuvres. \nA government spokesperson said there were signs of improvement in average forecourt stocks across the UK, adding that demand was \"continuing to stabilise\".  \n\"More than half of those who have completed training to make fuel deliveries are being deployed to terminals serving London and the South-East of England, demonstrating that the sector is allocating drivers to areas most affected in this first phase from Monday,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe crisis began more than 10 days ago when BP said it had run out of petrol in a number of its outlets. That prompted motorists to fill up more than usual, leaving deliveries unable to keep up with demand. \nMany sectors of the UK economy, including food firms and petrol retailers, have been affected by a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit, an aging workforce, and tax changes.\nDavid Charman, who runs Parkfoot Garage in West Malling in Kent, told the BBC's Today programme there was a big task ahead to restore supplies.\n\"This is not panic-buying anymore, this is people that have waited as long as they possibly can and now they have no fuel. We're having to push cars that are in the queue to get to our site because they've run out of fuel,\" he said.\n\"We didn't have the normal two days of stock underground... because of Covid but we were still managing the situation perfectly well. But now, when we're all empty, it needs a huge influx of fuel deliveries to everybody, not just to me, to ensure that we can get through this.\"\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Russia,Pandora Papers ",
      "text": "The Conservative Party is facing fresh questions about donations made by the wife of a former Russian minister.\nLubov Chernukhin is one of the biggest donors to the Tories, giving more than \u00a31.8m since 2012.\nLeaked documents reveal her personal wealth comes from her husband Vladimir. He has been financially linked to people who were close to the Kremlin.\nMrs Chernukhin's lawyers say she is a British citizen and is entitled to do as she wishes with her money.\nHer donations to the Conservative Party have given the 48-year-old access to figures at the top of UK government. \nMrs Chernukhin's winning auction bids have seen her play tennis with Boris Johnson and dine with Theresa May, when she was prime minister.\nBut until now, very little has been known about the Chernukhins' wealth and where it comes from.\nThe documents in the Pandora Papers leak of internal files and correspondence from offshore financial firms show the couple are linked to a network of 32 companies, three trusts and more than \u00a3100m in assets.\nThe documents indicate that Mrs Chernukhin's wealth comes from her husband, with one email describing her as being \"financially supported by her husband\", and another as \"a housewife\".\nOne document shows Mr Chernukhin's offshore company loaned \u00a34m to his wife's UK company.\nThe latest revelations follow separate allegations about two businessmen linked to donations to the party.\nBoth men deny any wrongdoing.\nWorking with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Guardian, BBC Panorama has had access to almost 12 million documents files from 14 companies in countries including the British Virgin Islands, Belize, Cyprus and Switzerland.\nThe Conservative Party say all donations have been properly and lawfully declared and followed all the rules.\nAsked about the revelations about party donors that have emerged from the Pandora Papers investigation, the prime minister said all party donations are \"'vetted in the normal way in accordance with rules set up by the Labour government\", adding:  \"So we vet them the whole time\".\nThe main political parties including Labour and the Liberal Democrats have all faced calls to hand donations back over the years.\nMeanwhile, in response to the claims, Transparency International UK says that vetting process for all political donors in the UK is \"little more than a box-ticking exercise\".\n\"It's easy to evade the rules or not look too closely. We must do better,\" they add.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said HM Revenue & Customs will examine the leaked papers \"to see if there's anything we can learn\".\nThe Russian-born Chernukhins are both now British citizens.\nPandora Papers documents reveal how they secretly acquired properties in the UK through offshore companies.\nThey purchased a house overlooking Regents Park in London now worth \u00a338m, as well as a mansion in Oxfordshire bought for \u00a310m.\nMr Chernukhin, 52, a former deputy minister of finance under Vladimir Putin left Russia for London in 2004 after being sacked by the president.\nThe Pandora Papers investigation found evidence that suggests Mr Chernukhin abused his position as the government appointed head of a state bank to advance his private business interests.\nIn evidence to a court hearing in London in 2018, Mr Chernukhin testified how he had reached an arrangement with the former mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, to secure planning permission for a development he had a secret personal interest in.\nIn return Mr Chernukhin told the court he proposed helping the mayor in relation to two other development sites in Moscow in which his bank had an interest. \nHe told the court: \"As a part of negotiations or agreement with them how to proceed, we agreed...\u202fthat I will help them\", \"and Mr Luzhkov will help me\".\u202f\nAndrew Mitchell QC, a leading corruption barrister, told Panorama: \"That's a conflict, there's no two ways about it. Here is a man who's chairman of the bank, using the bank as a mean by which he enhances his own personal wealth. And that has corruption written all over it.\"\nPandora Papers files also show Mr Chernukhin has carried on doing business with people close to the Kremlin.\nThey reveal his secret involvement in a property deal in St Petersburg in 2017, in which his partner was the wife of a then Russian government minister. He sold his stake in the property the following year for $30m, the documents show.\nQuestioned in 2018 about the Chernukhin's wealth, Mr Johnson - then foreign secretary - said \"all possible checks have been made and... will continue to be made\" on donations.\nAsked whether the donations to the Conservatives should be declared as coming from Mr Chernukhin as well, political law expert Gavin Millar QC said: \"If it's joint money, if it's family money, why isn't he willing to have his name alongside hers in the quarterly return to the Electoral Commission, publicly identified as a donor, and the source of the money?\"\nHe added: \"When you've got somebody who's a prominent associate of people who are connected with the Kremlin and\u2026 with Russian government, you would have thought any British political party\u2026 would start to investigate it and ask why that money is being given.\"\nLawyers for the Chernukhins said Panorama's interpretation of the court case involving Mr Chernukhin was a \"gross mis-characterisation\".\nThey said \"the suggestion that he acted improperly whilst an official of the state is wholly untrue\" and he \"has not accumulated his wealth.... in a corrupt manner\".\nThe lawyers said it was not accepted that any of Mrs Chernukhin's political donations have been funded by improper means or affected by the influence of anyone else.\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats have both said the Tories should return the money donated by Mohamed Amersi.\nInvestigations by the BBC and its media partners have indicated the businessman was involved in negotiations for Swedish telecoms company Telia that resulted in $220m being paid to a Gibraltar-based company controlled by the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan. The payment was described by the US authorities as a \"$220m bribe\".\nMr Amersi has denied wrongdoing and his lawyers said the offshore company had been \"vetted and approved by Telia\" and that its involvement \"did not raise any red flags\" to him.\nRepresentatives for Mr Amersi said on Monday he had \"never knowingly facilitated corrupt transactions\" and the Pandora Papers reports sought to \"embarrass the Conservative Party\".\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: \"The Electoral Commission should launch an immediate investigation into these allegations.\"\nThe Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said the allegations were \"concerning\".\nReferring to comments by Mr Amersi earlier this year that high-spending donors have been able to gain meetings with the prime minister and chancellor, she added: \"The Conservatives should return the money he donated to them and come clean about who else is getting exclusive access\".\nElsewhere, the Russian government has dismissed allegations of financial impropriety involving President Putin contained in the documents leak.\nOther world leaders, including Jordan's King Abdullah, and the Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babis, have also rejected allegations concerning the secret purchase of properties using offshore companies.\nPakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has said his government will investigate citizens linked to the leak. Hundreds of Pakistanis, including members of Mr Khan's cabinet, are said to have had secretly moved wealth through offshore companies.\nUpdate 3 December 2021:  Following publication, Mr and Mrs Chernukhin have made legal complaints about this article.  They say that the article is defamatory of them. In their complaint, they have told the BBC that no deal (corrupt or otherwise) was ultimately concluded with Mayor Luzhkov in respect of the properties in Moscow.\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.\nImages from: BBC, London News Pictures, Central News\nPandora Papers coverage: follow reaction on Twitter using #PandoraPapers, in the BBC News app.\nWatch Pandora Papers: Political Donors Exposed on BBC One at 19.35 BST on Monday (UK viewers only) or later on iPlayer"

      "tags": "John Swinney,Vaccine passports",
      "text": "John Swinney has said the new vaccine passport app is now functioning well despite the nightclub industry brandishing it a \"shambles\".  \nThe scheme to allow only fully-vaccinated people to attend some large events  had suffered teething problems. \nBut the deputy first minister revealed that 280,000 QR codes for the scheme had been downloaded by Sunday.\nRepresentatives of the nightclub sector have claimed \"confusion reigns\" for club operators. \nMany venues did not ask for proof of vaccination over the weekend because of the bugs in the app, while others reported low numbers of people with the new vaccine passport on their phones.\nThe Scottish government had previously announced there would no enforcement of the new rules until 18 October, to give venues a chance to get their procedures up and running. \nMr Swinney told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the \"system is functioning well now and has been since during the day on Friday\".\nHe added: \"The early hours were slow because of the demand on the system. Up until 4pm yesterday over 280,000 QR codes had been downloaded through the app enabling people to access their Covid certification.\"\nMr Swinney acknowledged there were still a \"very small number of cases\" where people were unable to download a QR code as proof of vaccination.\n\"We'll try to resolve those issues with individuals, but ultimately the fallback may well be that individuals have to use the paper copy,\" he said. \nUnseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 attendees need to carry out a \"reasonable number\" of spot checks under the passport scheme, while nightclubs and smaller venues will be required to conduct more rigorous checking.\nMany people took to social media on Friday to complain of problems with the vaccine certification app which only became available to download about 12 hours before the scheme started at 05:00 that morning.\nThe Scottish government then increased capacity on the servers which support the app. \nMike Grieve, chairman of the Night Time Industries Association, and director of the Sub Club in Glasgow, described the government's suggestion the app had teething problems as the \"understatement of the century\" and said he felt the scheme was a \"complete shambles\".\nHe added: \"The messaging on this from the Scottish government is abysmal. Nobody knows what is going on, confusion reigns and we're stuck with trying to enforce this on the streets. \n\"This app was rolled out at 5pm on Thursday evening to come into force less than 12 hours later and by Friday evening almost everyone we spoke to had no idea what was required. \n\"Most people believed that the government's decision to push back on enforcement was a delay to the scheme coming into force, which of course it wasn't.\"\nMr Grieve said that the Sub Club was full to its 410 capacity on Friday night but only six people attending had the new vaccine app. \nFootball clubs hosting three premier league matches this weekend said no fans would be turned away for not having proof of vaccine status in the wake of the issues with the app.\nA number of nightclubs did the same at the weekend and did not ask people for proof of vaccination, according to the Night Time Industries Association.

Four others drowned or were killed in landslides on Sunday.\nIn Iran, state media said the bodies of two fishermen had been found.\nThree other fishermen remain missing off the coast of the south-eastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan, near the border with Pakistan. Iran's deputy parliamentary speaker initially said that six people were killed.\nInfrastructure, including electrical facilities and roads, was also damaged.\nParts of the United Arab Emirates were placed on standby as the storm moved south-westwards over land on Monday and weakened. Residents of al-Ain were told to avoid leaving home except for emergencies.\nIt is rare for storms of this power to hit Oman's northern Arabian Sea coast.\nAuthorities said 369mm (14.5 inches) of rain fell on al-Khaboura, north-west of Oman's capital city, Muscat, while more than 200mm was recorded in Muscat itself.\nShaheen's high winds also caused waves of up to 10m (32ft) along the coast. \nBefore the cyclone made landfall on Sunday, the National Committee for Emergency Management (NCEM) reported that a child who had been swept away by water in Muscat province had been found dead.\nTwo Asian workers were also killed by a landslide in an industrial zone.\nOn Monday, the NCEM announced that the body of a missing person had been found in Wadi al-Silil, in South al-Batinah province, and that six others had died in North al-Batinah.\nOman's state news agency reported the armed forces were continuing to rescue people who had been trapped by floodwater.\nIt added that they were also restoring damaged roads to get aid into the areas that needed it.\nMore than 5,000 people were moved into some 80 shelters set up in affected provinces.\nThe National Multi Hazard Early Warning System had alerted residents that there was still a risk of thunderstorms as the bad weather moved inland. People were urged to avoid wadis - valleys and ravines found in the region - and other low-lying areas. "

It was due to pay foreign bond holders $47.5m by Wednesday.\nBut bondholders told Reuters news agency and Bloomberg that they were yet to receive any payment.\nUnder agreements with investors, the company has a 30-day grace period before the missed payments officially become a default.\nEvergrande has interest debt payments of more than $160m due in the next month.\nThe company has been taking steps in recent weeks to raise money owed to customers, investors and suppliers. Last week, it said it was selling a $1.5bn stake it owned in a commercial bank.\nThe almost 20% stake in Shengjing Bank was bought by a state-owned asset management company.\nUnder the agreement, the proceeds of the sale are to be used to pay money Evergrande owes to Shengjing Bank, which is one of the main lenders to the heavily-indebted firm.\nThe company's total liabilities are equal to around 2% of China's gross domestic product.\nThat has triggered concerns that its problems could spread through the world's second largest economy and send shockwaves around the global financial system."

      "tags": "WhatsApp,Instagram,Facebook",
      "text": "Social media services Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram are back up and running after an outage that lasted almost six hours, Facebook says. \nIt blamed an internal technical issue, which not only affected Facebook's services, but reportedly also employees' work passes and email.\nThe services were down from about 16:00 GMT until around 22:00 on Monday.\nBut the company said there was \"no evidence that user data was compromised\". \nSheera Frenkel, the New York Times' technology reporter, told the Today programme part of the reason it took so long to fix was because \"the people trying to figure out what this problem was couldn't even physically get into the building\" to work out what had gone wrong.\nIn a statement, Facebook said that the faulty configuration change affected the company's internal tools and systems which complicated attempts to resolve the problem. \nDowndetector, which tracks outages, said some 10.6 million problem reports around the world. However, the real number of people affected is much higher: more than 3.5 billion people use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Whatsapp.\nMany found themselves cut off from family and friends they interact with over the various services, while small businesses which use social media to connect with customers were faced with the prospect of an unexpected financial hit.\nAccording to the business website Fortune, it also cost Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg an estimated $6bn (\u00a34.4bn) at one point as shares plummeted. \nMr Zuckerberg has apologised to those affected by the outage. \nSome people also reported problems using Facebook's virtual reality headset platform, Oculus, and apps which require Facebook logins were affected, including Pok\u00e9mon Go.\nAn outage of this scale for such a long time is rare. A disruption in 2019 left Facebook and its other apps mostly inaccessible across the world for more than 14 hours. \nSeveral other tech companies, including Reddit and Twitter, poked fun at the social media giant's predicament - prompting responses from the affected apps.\nThe disruption comes the day after an interview with a former Facebook employee who leaked documents about the company. \nFrances Haugen told CBS news on Sunday that the company had prioritised \"growth over safety\".\nOn Tuesday she will testify before a Senate subcommittee in a hearing titled \"Protecting Kids Online\", about the company's research into Instagram's effect on the mental health of young users.\nMany outages get resolved fairly quickly. They are often localised too, with some people unable to open a website that can be viewed in another country.\nThis outage, however, was global, and affected all of Facebook's many spin-offs.\nThe length of time it was off grid is also unusual. There were reports of \"mayhem\" in Facebook headquarters, as technicians scrambled to fix the problem.\nInteresting too that the outage hampered Facebook's ability to tackle the crash - bringing down internal tools needed to remedy the problem.\nIt should also be said that Facebook's statement is carefully written. It doesn't rule out foul play.\nThe week had already started off badly - after the whistleblower in the \"Facebook Files\" revelations revealed herself on Sunday.\nBut a bad week has become a terrible one for the social network."

      "tags": "France",
      "text": "One of France's most recognisable figures, the businessman, sports club owner and politician Bernard Tapie, has died at the age of 78.\nTapie, who had battled stomach cancer for the past four years, died peacefully, surrounded by his family, they said in a statement.\nAt one time he owned Adidas, Olympique Marseille and was a minister under President Francois Mitterrand.\nHe also had a string of legal problems and served time in jail.\nTapie's wife Dominique and his family announced his death with \"immense sadness\". They said he wished to be buried in Marseille, \"the city of his heart\".\nPresident Emmanuel Macron was among the many to pay tribute to him, saying his \"ambition, energy and enthusiasm... were a source of inspiration for generations of French people\".\nBernard Tapie grew up in the working class suburbs of Paris.\nHe began his career as a singer, then a race car driver - before discovering a talent for buying up failing businesses and selling them on, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from Paris.\nHe demonstrated his wealth by buying the Olympique de Marseille football club, which won the French championship while he was their owner. However, he was accused of match-fixing and the club was stripped of its league championship title and later relegated to a lower division.\nHe also bought a cycling team that twice won the Tour de France, was the majority shareholder of the sportswear brand Adidas and owned a number of newspapers.\nIn the 1990s, he dabbled in politics, briefly became urban affairs minister and later elected as a leftist French and European parliament MP in Marseille.\nHe also had a lifelong interest in entertainment. In 1966, aged 23, he recorded songs under the name Bernard Tapy, but failed to make much of impact.\nHe returned to singing in the 1980s, after making his name as a corporate raider, and collaborated with acclaimed songwriter Didier Barbelivien.\nIn the 1990s, he appeared in major films including Claude Lelouch's Men, Women: A User's Manual, as well as plays. Over the past 20 years he has starred as a police inspector in a TV drama and hosted a number of chat shows.\nTapie's late career as a showman took off as his empire crumbled amid a string of legal problems from the late 1990s.\nHe served time in jail for match fixing and other charges concerning corruption, tax fraud and misuse of corporate assets.\nEarlier this year, he and his wife were attacked in a violent burglary at their home.\nBernard Tapie faced the ups and downs of his life always with panache, our correspondent notes, and he was an admired and fascinating figure until the end."

      "text": "A David Walliams story about a Chinese boy is to be removed from one of his children's books after criticism that it contained \"harmful stereotypes\".\nA new edition of The World's Worst Children will be released next year without the story Brian Wong, Who Was Never, Ever Wrong.\nThe move comes after podcaster Georgie Ma complained the book was \"normalising jokes on minorities from a young age\".\nAfter meeting Ma, its publishers confirmed the story would be replaced.\nThe book featured short stories about 10 characters including Nigel Nit-Boy, Grubby Gertrude and Bertha the Blubberer. It sold more than 450,000 copies in the UK when it was published in 2016, with two sequels and other spin-offs released since.\n\"In consultation with our author and illustrator [Tony Ross] we can confirm that a new story will be written to replace 'Brian Wong' in future editions of The World's Worst Children,\" a statement from HarperCollins Children's said.\n\"The update will be scheduled at the next reprint as part of an ongoing commitment to regularly reviewing content.\"\nSpeaking to The Bookseller, Ma explained: \"'Wong' and 'wrong' are two words that are commonly used in playgrounds to pick on someone if their surname is Wong.\n\"Even just the way Brian has been illustrated. He wears glasses, he looks like a nerd, he's got small eyes... they're all harmful stereotypes.\"\nShe added: \"The overall character plays on the model minority myth where Chinese people are nerdy, swotty and good at maths, we're not confrontational and we're high achievers.\n\"It was just really disappointing to read about that. Personally for me, because I have a toddler, I don't want her being absorbed in these stories where Chinese culture is misrepresented.\"\nHaving criticised the character on Instagram earlier this year, Ma said she was now \"grateful\" to the publishers for \"listening and taking action\".\nTwo years ago, Walliams removed a word used to refer to people of restricted growth - the nickname given to a character called Miss Midge in the book Ratburger - after a complaint from the organisation Little People UK. It remained on his website.\nWalliams, who rose to fame on sketch show Little Britain before becoming a highly successful children's author, has not commented.\nHe and his TV writing partner Matt Lucas apologised last year for having played characters of different ethnic backgrounds in the popular BBC series.\nThey used blackface make-up in some sketches and the programme was removed from BBC iPlayer, Netflix and BritBox after objections resurfaced.\nThe pair said they were \"very sorry\" and that they \"regret that we played characters of other races\".\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "All 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales will be offered a Covid vaccine by the end of the October half-term, the Welsh health minister has said.\nThe rollout is due to gather pace this week with all health boards providing jabs, mostly at mass vaccination centres and others in schools.\nSome of the most vulnerable children have already received the vaccine.\nFamilies have been encouraged to discuss the choice to help make an informed decision.\nLast month the UK's vaccine advisory body JCVI refused to give the green light to vaccinating healthy 12-15 year olds on health grounds alone.\nIt said children were at such a low risk from the virus that jabs would offer only a marginal benefit.\nThe UK's four chief medical officers then said healthy children aged 12 to 15 should be offered one dose of a Covid vaccine as it would help reduce disruption to education.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said studies showed children were at some risk of developing long Covid despite low hospital admission rates.\n\"Vaccines remain our strongest defence from the virus, helping prevent harm and stopping the spread of Covid-19,\" she said. \n\"Some studies show one in seven children who have been infected with the virus are thought to have also developed long Covid.\n\"We have provided resources and information to help this age group make an informed choice about vaccination. I encourage parents, guardians, children and young people to discuss the vaccination together,\" she said.\nGill Richardson, deputy chief medical officer for vaccines, said: \"We have seen the benefits that come from having as many people as possible vaccinated.\n\"After careful consideration of the evidence, the four UK chief medical officers recommended the vaccination of healthy 12 to 15-year-olds after consultation with experts, such as the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.\n\"They concluded that the health benefits, combined with the additional benefits of reducing educational disruption and effects on mental health meant that vaccination should be offered.\n\"Children and their families will be receiving links to information with their invitation letters so they can make an informed decision about whether or not to have the vaccine,\" she said.\nLast month the chief medical officers agreed a single dose would help to reduce disruption to education.\nThe recommendation that only one dose be given is related to the very rare risk of a condition called myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle.\nThe risk is tiny after one vaccine dose and slightly higher after two, with 12 to 34 cases seen for every one million second doses.\nTheir decision came after the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said there was not enough benefit to warrant it on health grounds alone for most children.\nEithne Hughes, director of the Association for School and College Leaders Cymru, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers schools were already being targeted.\n\"There have been anti-vax campaigners, who are very, very well coordinated, who have made direct threats to head teachers by phone, by letter - confettis of letter with quasi-legal challenges threatening court action and huge fines, fake NHS consent letters to try and trick schools into sending those out to parents with misinformation.\" \nShe said it had caused a \"real upset in the system\".\n\"Let's be really clear about this, the virus is the enemy, not Public Health Wales, not the school, and college leaders are doing their very best to educate learners and get everything back on track again,\" she said.  \n\"So it's deeply disappointing and if these people are listening, I would urge them to desist.\"\nTrefor Jones, head teacher at Ysgol Y Creuddyn in Penrhyn Bay, Conwy, said he had received letters from people opposed to children having a Covid vaccine.\nHe said: \"It is concerning... It does reference various legal processes they want to take, so yes, it is a challenge...\n\"To be targeted in this way is a little disappointing.\""

      "text": "Adele has heightened speculation that she is about to release her first new music since 2015, after updating her website and social media pages.\nThe star's Twitter and Instagram images were changed to a blue and turquoise pattern, while her old website was scrubbed and replaced with a link urging fans to sign up for information.\nIt comes after the number 30 was projected onto several buildings around the world over the weekend. Fans are predicting this will be the name of her fourth album - after 19, 21 and 25.\nThe mysterious projections have been spotted on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Colosseum in Rome, Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, Amsterdam's Nemo Museum and New York's Empire State Building.\nThe logo has also reportedly appeared in Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Poland, Ireland, Italy, Canada, Malaysia, South Korea and the UK.\nAlthough they have not officially been confirmed as being linked to Adele, the images appear to use the font she has favoured on her previous albums.\nThe singer hinted that her fourth album would be called 30 in a 2019 Instagram post, jokingly telling fans: \"30 will be a drum and bass record to spite you all.\"\nUsing the title would also connect the album to Adele's previous pattern of naming records after a pivotal year in her life.\nShe has previously said she would retire the system, saying that she had settled into family life.\nBut the singer separated from her ex-husband Simon Konecki when she was 30 (she is now 33) and has subsequently kept a low public profile.\nThe one exception was a stint hosting US comedy show Saturday Night Live last year. \nAt the time, she addressed the rumours that new music was imminent.\n\"I know there's been a lot of chatter about me just being the host. Like, 'Why isn't she the musical guest?' and stuff like that,\" she said. \n\"And there's a couple of reasons. My album's not finished, and I'm also too scared to do both\u2026 I'd rather just put on some wigs, have a glass of wine or six and just see what happens.\"\nFraser T Smith, who co-wrote Adele's global smash hit Set Fire To The Rain, recently told the BBC he \"didn't know\" whether the star's new album was complete.\n\"Adele is incredibly secretive, and I think that that's the way you want it - building that suspense,\" he said.\n\"A testament to her is that you just don't know the next direction she'll take. It could be R&B, it could be rock, it could the ballads. \n\"But whatever it's going to be, it will be of the highest standard.\"\nAdele's last album, 25, was also announced with a mysterious marketing campaign. Viewers of The X Factor in the UK were surprised during an advertising break when a 30-second excerpt of a new song (later revealed to be Hello) was broadcast against a blank screen.\nThe album went on to sell more than 3.5 million copies in the UK alone, making it the country's 14th best-selling record of all time.\nIt also broke sales records in the US and won the star a Grammy for album of the year - which she memorably tried to give to Beyonc\u00e9.\n\"I can't possibly accept this award,\" she said through tears. \"My artist of my life is Beyonc\u00e9. And [her] album to me, the Lemonade album, is just so monumental.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

      "text": "Courts will get new powers to stop disruptive activists attending protests, the home secretary has said.\nIn a Tory conference speech, Priti Patel said new orders would stop the \"small minority of offenders\" intent on \"causing disruption\".\nA Tory source said they will target people with a \"history of disruption\", or those likely to commit crime. \nClimate activists blocking roads have previously been warned they could face fines and up to six months in prison.\nProtests from Insulate Britain have continued in recent days, despite three court injunctions banning activists blocking the M25, and other major roads in London.\nOn Tuesday the High Court heard that more than 100 protesters associated with the group have now been served with injunctions.\nThe group has apologised for disruption - but added that \"the reality of our situation\" on climate change has to be faced. \nIn her conference speech in Manchester, Ms Patel unveiled plans to increase the maximum sentence for disruption of a motorway.\nShe also announced a new criminal offence for interfering with critical national infrastructures such as roads, railways and newspaper printing presses.\nPolice are also expected to be given wider stop and search powers allowing officers to inspect activists for \"lock on\" equipment used to prevent them from being moved.\nThe new measures to be announced by Ms Patel are to be included in the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill currently going through Parliament.\nMs Patel said the actions of climate activists, who in recent weeks have blocked the M1, M4 and M25, \"amounted to some of the most self-defeating environmental protests this country has ever seen.\"\n\"Freedom to protest is a fundamental right our party will forever fight to uphold. But it must be within the law,\" she added. \nThe campaign by Insulate Britain has been running for over three weeks and has led to hundreds of arrests.  \nThe group wants the government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to help cut carbon emissions.\nOn Tuesday, the High Court heard that 111 activists associated with the group had been served with injunctions. \nA hearing on the injunctions has been adjourned to next week, after government lawyers argued all three should be dealt with together. \nSpeaking outside the court, an Insulate Britain spokesman said the group \"wishes to profoundly apologise for the disruption caused over the past three weeks.\"\nHe added: \"We cannot imagine undertaking such acts in normal circumstances. But we believe that the reality of our situation has to be faced.\"\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Insulate Britain activists as \"irresponsible crusties\".\nHe told LBC: \"There are some people who call those individuals legitimate protesters.\"\nHe added: \"They are not. I think they are irresponsible crusties who are basically trying to stop people going about their day's work and doing considerable damage to the economy.\"\nOn Monday, Insulate Britain activists were confronted by angry drivers as they blocked more London roads, including the entrance to the Blackwall Tunnel, Wandsworth Bridge, Arnos Grove and the Hanger Lane gyratory.\nIn a video captured by LBC, a motorist told demonstrators she was desperate to see her 81-year-old mother in hospital, asking them: \"How can you be so selfish?\"\nIn other footage shared by Talk Radio, angry motorists at Wandsworth Bridge were filmed dragging protesters out of the road, where an ambulance appeared to be blocked.\nBut in an open letter to Ms Patel, Insulate Britain said: \"You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere.\"\nOne activist told BBC News: \"We have tried lobbying, we have tried targeting political leaders, government departments, people have been doing this for two, three, four, five decades, without any success at all.\n\"We know through history that disruptive direct actions work. The government are forcing our hand because they are not taking the biggest threat to humanity seriously.\"\nMeanwhile, Dominic Raab used his first speech as the new justice secretary to promise \u00a3183m with the aim of doubling the number of offenders in England and Wales on electronic tags by 2025.\nHe told delegates this included an expansion in the \"game-changing\" use of alcohol-monitoring ankle tags on offenders, to see if they breach court-ordered drinking bans. \nMr Raab, who was also made deputy prime minister in last month's cabinet reshuffle, also pledged \u00a390m to pay for more hours of community payback by offenders.\nReferencing the \"harrowing\" murder of Sarah Everard, he also vowed to make tackling violence against women and girls his \"number one priority\".\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

      "text": "The King of Jordan secretly spent more than \u00a370m ($100m) on a property empire in the UK and US.\nLeaked financial documents identify a network of secretly-owned firms used by Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein to buy 15 homes since he assumed power in 1999.\nThey included houses in Malibu, and in London and Ascot in the UK.\nLawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so.\nJordan receives substantial international aid, including from the US and UK. The UK government is one of the regime's biggest financial backers, doubling its funding to \u00a3650m over five years in 2019.\nAnd King Abdullah is seen as a moderate Western ally in the Middle East.\nBut his property interests have been built up between 2003 and 2017 as he has been accused of presiding over an authoritarian regime at home - with protests taking place in recent years at a time of austerity measures and tax rises.\nThe Jordanian authorities announced a crackdown in June 2020 to target money being sent abroad by its citizens.\nOne dissident has been quoted as saying King Abdullah appears to rule Jordan by \"remote control\" - and a former government employee suggested to Panorama he spends four to six months a year away from the country.\nThe revelations about the King of Jordan are contained in newly-obtained financial documents dubbed the Pandora Papers. They detail the work of companies that offer secretive financial services - and the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet.\nBBC Panorama and the Guardian in the UK have worked with other media partners to access more than 12 million files from 14 companies in the British Virgin Islands, Belize, Panama, Hong Kong, Cyprus, Switzerland and other countries.\nKing Abdullah also bought four apartments in Georgetown, an expensive part of Washington DC, between 2012 and 2014.\nIt is possible the $16m purchases were connected to his son, Crown Prince Hussein, who was attending Georgetown University around the time.\nThe seven-bedroom home sits among the multi-million dollar cliff-top properties overlooking the Pacific in the Point Dume peninsula of Malibu, California.\nSir Anthony Hopkins, Julia Roberts, Simon Cowell, Gwyneth Paltrow and Barbra Streisand have all lived in the area.\nThe property was bought for $33.5m in 2014 by Nabisco Holdings SA, a company in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) - a record price for the area at the time.\nTwo different BVI companies bought the homes either side of the property in 2015 and 2017, taking the total spend to $68m - and all three are being developed into one huge property.\nThe documents in the Pandora Papers reveal the three companies are among those represented by a Panama law firm, and all were secretly owned by the King of Jordan.\nAn anonymous blogger who writes about celebrity house sales in California said at the time: \"Someone has gone to a hell of a lot of trouble to cover their tracks here. Yes, very rich people often like to stay anonymous. But this level of deliberate opacity is practically beyond anything we've ever witnessed.\"\nThe King of Jordan was able to to keep his property ownership secret because he used offshore companies to make the purchases.\nThe people who set up the companies for the king were careful not to identify him, referring to him in one internal document as \"You know who\".\nThere are also suggestions that international efforts to improve financial transparency can face difficulties.\nThe British Virgin Islands passed a law in 2017 - compelling the owners of all companies on the island to be identified on an internal register held by the government. \nBut a document shows that eight months after the Beneficial Ownership Secure Search System Act came into force, a number of BVI companies linked to King Abdullah had still not submitted his details to the authorities.\nThe king also does not appear to have been identified as a politically-exposed person - someone in a prominent public position - a requirement on financial firms under anti-corruption rules.\nAnnelle Sheline, a Middle East analyst, suggests the revelations could have an impact in Jordan.\nShe told Panorama: \"It's just very, very difficult for the average Jordanian to, achieve a basic level of home and family, and a good job. And so to have it really thrown in Jordanians' faces that he's just been funnelling money abroad all this time? That, that would look really bad.\"\nLawyers for King Abdullah said the information about his properties was not accurate or up to date.\nThey said all his overseas properties were bought with his personal wealth, which he also uses to fund projects for Jordan's citizens.\nThey added the offshore structures were not used to hide the king's wealth and it is common practice practice for high profile individuals and corporations to acquire and hold assets through such corporate structures for privacy and security reasons.\nThey said the management is \"handled by professionals to ensure smooth running of day-to-day operations and compliance with all legal and financial obligations in the relevant jurisdiction in which they are incorporated\".\nIt was not just Malibu, where the king secretly bought property. Eight were in London and south-east England, the Pandora Papers indicate.\nThey included six houses on some of the capital's most exclusive streets - in Kensington and Belgravia.\nThere were also two house in Ascot, Surrey.  \nHe also purchased the four flats in Georgetown, Washington DC.\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet.

We would ask any protesters to please allow our crews to pass to ensure we are able to reach people who need our help as quickly as possible.\" \nAnother driver held up was Dr Malik Saleh, a dentist who was stuck at the Hanger Lane gyratory. \nHe said the protest had caused \"a crazy amount of inconvenience\" and that he had to cancel his appointments. \n\"The point is valid but there must be a better way around it,\" he said.\nA father, who wanted to be identified only as Will, said he was worried his 15-year-old autistic daughter, who has stress-related epilepsy, could have a seizure brought on by the fear of missing school, after she was stuck in the traffic for 45 minutes.\nHe said the \"beeping and shouting\" did not help because of her sensory problems and she did not have her ear-defenders.\n\"If she does carry on stressing out at school today it will bring on a seizure. These protesters don't realise the consequences of their actions at all, and who it affects.\"\nMinisters plan to enact tougher powers to tackle their direct action which has seen blockages to key arteries around London, including on the M25 and M4.\nLast month, the government won a High Court injunction, warning climate change protesters they could be jailed if they continued their campaign of blocking the M25.\nHundreds of protesters have been arrested since the group's demonstrations started last month.\nA reference by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to \"Insulate Britain or whatever they are calling themselves these days\" was met with boos at a fringe Maritime UK drinks reception at the Conservative Party conference on Sunday evening.\nInsulate Britain wants the government to commit to providing insulation for 29 million homes.\nResponding to criticism of the disruption caused to drivers, spokesman Craig Scudder said current government policies did not go far enough and disruptive action worked.\nHe told BBC News: \"We have tried lobbying, we have tried targeting political leaders, government departments, people have been doing this for two, three, four, five decades, without any success at all.\n\"We know through history that disruptive direct actions work. The government are forcing our hand because they are not taking the biggest threat to humanity seriously.\"\nMr Scudder said Insulate Britain had a policy of allowing blue light emergency vehicles to pass its roadblocks and the group provided video footage of activists moving to accommodate ambulances and medical cars.\nThe government has said it is investing \u00a31.3bn to support people to install energy efficiency measures.

Those films sit at numbers two and three in the all-time UK box office chart.\nMany in the industry are hoping No Time to Die will kickstart the box office after cinemas shut during the pandemic.\nIt was directed by US film-maker Cary Joji Fukunaga and also stars Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch.\nMost critics praised the film, with many giving five-star reviews after its premiere at the Royal Albert Hall earlier this week. But some suggested the movie did not quite justify its 163-minute running time.\nUniversal said No Time to Die opened in 772 cinemas in the UK and Ireland on Thursday - 25 more than the previous record-holder, Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker, in 2019.\nWhen Skyfall made its big screen debut nine years ago, it opened in 587 cinemas.\nFocus will soon switch to how No Time to Die performs on the other side of the Atlantic when the film opens there on 8 October.\nOther major countries yet to experience 007's latest adventures include France, Russia, China and Australia, with release global dates scheduled for later this month and November.\nThe box office market in the US and Canada currently appears to be in rude health, with Venom: Let There Be Carnage taking $90.1m (\u00a366.3m) on its debut this weekend, setting a new pandemic-era record. \nThe supervillain sequel starring Tom Hardy also beat the original film's first weekend haul of $80.1m in 2018."

We simply do not know.\"\nMorgan was arrested later that day and has been in custody since, pleading guilty to murder at a hearing on 31 August.\nSentencing, Judge Thomas told only-child Morgan his mother stuck up for him when he previously stole from her.\n\"She tried to help you with your problems,\" he said. \"She worried about your substance misuse, and she let you live with her despite the disruption and anxiety your presence in the house no doubt caused her.\n\"In short, you were pretty much her life. You repaid those 43 years of devotion by bludgeoning her to death with a hammer. Not once, not twice, but no fewer than 14 times to the head, intending to kill her.\n\"She was, on that day, when you had that hammer in your hand, entirely at your mercy.\n\"Although she probably begged you for it, you showed none. It was a savage, sustained attack on a defenceless, vulnerable woman - your own mother.\n\"Even after you had killed her, your callous attitude continued, and you tied a plastic bag around her head and left her lifeless body slumped in the bedroom.\n\"You did not even afford her the dignity of a timely burial. You just left her to decompose while others fretted about her whereabouts.\"\nSenior investigating officer, Det Supt Jayne Butler, said: \"Judith Rhead was the victim of an horrific attack. \n\"The fact that it was at the hands of her own son and in her own home only adds to the cruelty and horror of what she went through.\"\nA family statement said: \"We cannot come to terms with what has happened to Judith and we never will. \n\"Judith was a well-respected woman in her community and with a wide circle of friends. \n\"She was such a gentle person, who did not deserve to die in such a horrific way. \n\"This is something that will haunt our family for the rest of our lives.\""

      "tags": "Sweden,Denmark",
      "text": "Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who sketched the Prophet Muhammad's head on a dog's body, has died in a traffic accident. \nVilks was reported to be travelling in a civilian police vehicle which collided with a truck near the town of Markaryd in southern Sweden. \nInvestigators said the collision, which also killed two police bodyguards, showed no signs of foul play. \nThe 75-year-old artist had been living under police protection after receiving death threats over the cartoon. \nThe cartoon, published in 2007, offended many Muslims who regard visual representation of the Prophet as blasphemous. It came a year after a Danish newspaper published cartoons of the Prophet. \nAfter the accident, a large fire broke out and a number of emergency vehicles attended the scene. The driver of the truck was injured and taken to hospital, where he was questioned by investigators.\nA statement from police said it was still unclear how the collision occurred, but initially there was nothing to suggest that anyone else was involved. \n\"This is being investigated like any other road accident. Because two policemen were involved, an investigation has been assigned to a special section of the prosecutor's office,\" a police spokesperson told news agency AFP, adding that there was no suspicion of foul play.\nOne eyewitness told the Aftonbladet newspaper that the car Vilks was thought to be in seemed to lose control and came over to his side of the motorway at high speed. The truck in front did not have time to swerve and then they collided with a loud bang at \"incredible speed\", he told the newspaper.\nStefan Sinteus, chief of the South Sweden regional investigation unit, told a press conference that officers were attempting to determine why the car had swerved off the road. \n\"We don't know yet the reason why the bodyguard car was on the wrong side of the road,\" he said. \"But we're talking to witnesses, we have found remnants of tyres on the E4 road before the accident so we're looking into the possibility that it could have been a tyre explosion or something similar.\" \nVilks made headlines around the world after his 2007 cartoon caused outrage, leading then Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt to meet ambassadors from 22 Muslim countries in an attempt to defuse the situation. \nShortly afterwards, al-Qaeda in Iraq offered a $100,000 (\u00a373,692) reward for his murder. \nIn 2015, Vilks attended a debate on free speech that was targeted in a gun attack in Copenhagen. He said he was probably the target of the attack, which killed a film director. \nBut police said on Monday there had been no new threats made against him recently. \nAlthough he is most famous for his sketch of Muhammad as a dog, Vilks was an artist and activist who often worked with paint or created installations. \nOne of his creations was a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden which he erected without permission and which triggered a lengthy legal battle.

      "text": "The secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires has been exposed in one of the biggest leaks of financial documents.\nSome 35 current and former leaders and more than 300 public officials are featured in the files from offshore companies, dubbed the Pandora Papers.\nThey reveal the King of Jordan secretly amassed \u00a370m of UK and US property.\nThey also show how ex-UK PM Tony Blair and his wife saved \u00a3312,000 in stamp duty when they bought a London office.\nThe couple bought an offshore firm that owned the building.\nThe leak also links Russian President Vladimir Putin to secret assets in Monaco, and shows the Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis - facing an election later this week - failed to declare an offshore investment company used to purchase two villas for \u00a312m in the south of France.\nIt is the latest in a string of leaks over the past seven years, following the FinCen Files, the Paradise Papers, the Panama Papers and LuxLeaks.\nThe examination of the files is the largest organised by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), with more than 650 reporters taking part.\nBBC Panorama in a joint investigation with the Guardian and the other media partners have had access to nearly 12 million documents and files from 14 financial services companies in countries including the British Virgin Islands, Panama, Belize, Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Switzerland.\nSome figures are facing allegations of corruption, money laundering and global tax avoidance.\nBut one of the biggest revelations is how prominent and wealthy people have been legally setting up companies to secretly buy property in the UK.\nThe documents reveal the owners of some of the 95,000 offshore firms behind the purchases.\nIt highlights the UK government's failure to introduce a register of offshore property owners despite repeated promises to do so, amid concerns some property buyers could be hiding money-laundering activities.\nThe Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and his family, who have been accused of looting their own country, are one example.\nThe investigation found the Aliyevs and their close associates have secretly been involved in property deals in the UK worth more than \u00a3400m.\nThe revelations could prove embarrassing for the UK government, as the Aliyevs appear to have made a \u00a331m profit after selling one of their London properties to the Crown Estate - the Queen's property empire that is managed by The Treasury and raises cash for the nation.\nMany of the transactions in the documents involve no legal wrongdoing.\nBut Fergus Shiel, from the ICIJ, said: \"There's never been anything on this scale and it shows the reality of what offshore companies can offer to help people hide dodgy cash or avoid tax.\"\nHe added: \"They are using those offshore accounts, those offshore trusts, to buy hundreds of millions of dollars of property in other countries, and to enrich their own families, at the expense of their citizens.\"\nThe ICIJ believes the investigation is \"opening a box on a lot of things\" - hence the name Pandora Papers.\nThe leaked financial documents show how the King of Jordan secretly amassed a property empire in the UK and US worth more than \u00a370m (over $100m).\nThey identify a network of offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands and other tax havens used by Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein to buy 15 homes since he assumed power in 1999. \nThey include \u00a350m on three adjacent ocean view properties in Malibu, California, and properties in London and Ascot in the UK.\nHis property interests have been built up as King Abdullah has been accused of presiding over an authoritarian regime, with protests taking place in recent years amid austerity measures and tax rises.\nLawyers for King Abdullah said all the properties were bought with personal wealth, which he also uses to fund projects for Jordan's citizens.\nThey said it was common practice for high profile individuals to purchase properties via offshore companies for privacy and security reasons.\nAmong the other revelations in the Pandora Papers:\nThere is no suggestion in the Pandora Papers that Tony and Cherie Blair were hiding their wealth.\nBut documents show why stamp duty was not payable when the couple bought a \u00a36.45m property.\nThe former Labour prime minister and his barrister wife Cherie acquired the building in Marylebone, central London, in July 2017 by buying the offshore company that owned it.\nIt is legal to acquire properties in the UK in this way and stamp duty does not have to be paid - but Mr Blair has previously been critical of tax loopholes.\nThe townhouse in Marylebone, central London, is now home to Mrs Blair's legal consultancy, which advises governments around the world, as well as her foundation for women.\nMrs Blair said the sellers had insisted they buy the house through the offshore company.\nShe said they had brought the property back under UK rules and will be liable to pay capital gains tax if they sell it in future.\nThe ultimate owners of the property were a family with political connections in Bahrain - but both parties say they did not initially know who they were dealing with.\nOther documents show how Azerbaijan's ruling Aliyev family have secretly acquired UK property using offshore companies.\nThe files show how the family - long accused of corruption in the European nation - bought 17 properties, including a \u00a333m office block in London for the president's 11-year-old son Heydar Aliyev.\nThe building in Mayfair was bought by a front company owned by a family friend of President Ilham Aliyev in 2009.\nIt was transferred one month later to Heydar.\nThe research also reveals how another office block owned by the family nearby was sold to the Crown Estate for \u00a366m in 2018.\nThe Crown Estate said it carried out the checks required in law at the time of purchase but is now looking into the matter.\nThe UK government says it is cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows.\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet.

Up until 4pm yesterday over 280,000 QR codes had been downloaded through the app enabling people to access their Covid certification.\"\nMr Swinney acknowledged there were still a \"very small number of cases\" where people were unable to download a QR code as proof of vaccination.\n\"We'll try to resolve those issues with individuals, but ultimately the fallback may well be that individuals have to use the paper copy,\" he said. \nUnseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 attendees need to carry out a \"reasonable number\" of spot checks under the passport scheme, while nightclubs and smaller venues will be required to conduct more rigorous checking.\nMany people took to social media on Friday to complain of problems with the vaccine certification app which only became available to download about 12 hours before the scheme started at 05:00 that morning.\nThe Scottish government then increased capacity on the servers which support the app. \nMike Grieve, chairman of the Night Time Industries Association, and director of the Sub Club in Glasgow, described the government's suggestion the app had teething problems as the \"understatement of the century\" and said he felt the scheme was a \"complete shambles\".\nHe added: \"The messaging on this from the Scottish government is abysmal. Nobody knows what is going on, confusion reigns and we're stuck with trying to enforce this on the streets. \n\"This app was rolled out at 5pm on Thursday evening to come into force less than 12 hours later and by Friday evening almost everyone we spoke to had no idea what was required. \n\"Most people believed that the government's decision to push back on enforcement was a delay to the scheme coming into force, which of course it wasn't.\"\nMr Grieve said that the Sub Club was full to its 410 capacity on Friday night but only six people attending had the new vaccine app. \nFootball clubs hosting three premier league matches this weekend said no fans would be turned away for not having proof of vaccine status in the wake of the issues with the app.\nA number of nightclubs did the same at the weekend and did not ask people for proof of vaccination, according to the Night Time Industries Association.

      "text": "New simplified travel rules have come into force in the UK, with the traffic light system replaced by a single red list. \nMost fully vaccinated travellers arriving from non-red list countries will no longer have to take a test before setting off for the UK.\nAirlines UK said it would make travelling abroad easier and cheaper.\nBut those coming from red list destinations must still pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. \nUnder the changes, which came into force at 04:00 BST, the green and amber lists have been scrapped. \nTesting rules are also being eased for people travelling from non-red list destinations who have been vaccinated in the UK, the EU, the US, or any of 18 other recognised countries. \nAnyone under 18 who is resident in those countries can also travel to the UK without testing.\nThese groups were already able to avoid self-isolating on their arrival back in the UK. \nAll travellers - except children under five years old - will still have to pay for a PCR test two days after arrival. \nPeople who are not fully vaccinated will need a pre-departure test and a PCR test on days two and eight after they return, and must self-isolate for 10 days at home. \nAnd those arriving from red list countries, including Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines and South Africa, must quarantine for 10 days in a government-approved hotel, at a cost of \u00a32,285 for one adult. Only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, are allowed to enter the UK if they have been in a red country in the previous 10 days. \nThe red list is due to be updated later this week. \nThe government may also announce additions to the list of countries whose vaccination certificates are recognised by the UK. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"We are accelerating towards a future where travel continues to reopen safely and remains open for good, and today's rule changes are good news for families, businesses and the travel sector.\n\"Our priority remains to protect public health but, with more than eight in 10 people now fully vaccinated, we are able to take these steps to lower the cost of testing and help the sector to continue in its recovery.\"\nThere was a surge in holiday bookings after the government announced the changes last month and the travel sector has welcomed the move.\nThe industry previously criticised the government for being too slow to ease and simplify rules on testing and quarantine. \nFrom later in October, the government has said fully vaccinated people coming to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival and can take a cheaper lateral flow test instead. \nNo date has been set for this change but ministers are aiming to have it in place for the half-term school break. \nSo far, no other UK nation has followed suit. \nScotland has said it will \"align with the UK post-arrival testing regime\" but has not announced further details. The Welsh government said it had \"concerns\" about easing its testing regime. \nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents UK carriers, said: \"Things are moving in the right direction and the removal of these restrictions will make it easier and cheaper for people to travel.\"\nHowever, he said the UK remained \"an outlier on arrivals testing for vaccinated passengers\".\nAirlines UK hopes to see more countries removed from the red list at the next update and further mutual recognition of vaccine status for those jabbed in other countries, he added. \nWillie Walsh, head of industry body the International Air Transport Association, welcomed the change as a \"positive step\", saying the government's testing and quarantine restrictions had been both unscientific and costly. \n\"People have been led to believe that the risk is people flying into the country. The risk was inside the country,\" he said. \nAlan French, chief executive at Thomas Cook, said more options would now be available for travellers. \n\"They will be more confident if they book the holiday, they can travel safely there and be able to return in a transparent way, which is something they've not been able to do,\" he said. \nMr French said since the government announced the changes, three weeks ago, his company had seen bookings more than double.  \nThe UK recorded 30,439 cases on Sunday, with the total number of cases in the past seven days up one per cent on the previous week. \nHowever, the number of Covid deaths and hospital admissions are falling, with 43 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported on Sunday.\nHow will the new system affect you?

In the UK the investigation has been led by BBC Panorama and the Guardian. \nThe files are the latest in a series of whistleblower-led investigations that have rocked the world of finance in recent years.\nSo let's round up the other major leaks of the past decade.\nIn September 2020 the FinCEN Files exposed the failure of major global banks to stop money laundering and financial crime. They also revealed how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash.\nThe files included more than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs), filed by financial institutions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Agency, or FinCEN, a part of the US Treasury Department. They also include 17,641 records obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and other sources.\nThey were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the ICIJ and 400 journalists around the world, including BBC Panorama, which led the investigation in the UK.\nA huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which revealed the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders.\nWho was named? The documents contained details about investments made by the Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance scheme used by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys and showed that Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his \u00a316.5m luxury jet. They also revealed how Apple protected its low-tax regime by using the Channel Island of Jersey and that Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreements without disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting.\nWho leaked the data? The BBC does not know the identity of the source. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the ICIJ. Panorama led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including the Guardian, in 67 countries.\nA confidential settlement was later reached between the BBC, the Guardian and Appleby over the reporting of the leaked documents, which Appleby said were taken by hackers. The Guardian and BBC said the reports were in the public interest but did not give more detail about the settlement.\nUntil Pandora this leak was seen as the daddy of them all in data size. If you thought the Wikileaks dump of sensitive diplomatic cables in 2010 was a big deal, this carried 1,500 times more data.\nThe Panama Papers came about after an anonymous source contacted reporters at German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung in 2015 and supplied encrypted documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. It sells anonymous offshore companies that help the owners hide their business dealings.\nOverwhelmed by the scale of the dump, which eventually grew to 2.6 terabytes of data, the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung called in the ICIJ, which led to the involvement of about 100 other partner news organisations, including the BBC's Panorama.\nAfter more than a year of scrutiny, the ICIJ and its partners jointly published the Panama Papers on 3 April 2016, with the database of documents going online a month later.\nWho was named? Where do we start? A few of the news partners focused on how associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin shuffled cash around the globe. Not that the Russians cared much. The prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan came to far stickier ends, the former quitting and the latter being thrown out of office by the Supreme Court. Overall the financial dealings of a dozen current and former world leaders, more than 120 politicians and public officials and countless billionaires, celebrities and sports stars were exposed. \nWho leaked the data? John Doe. Yes, we know. It's not a real name. In US crime series it is mostly used to label anonymous victims but Mr (or Ms) Doe's manifesto, released a month after publication, reveals a self-styled revolutionary. The real identity is still unknown.\nFive months after the Panama Papers, the ICIJ published revelations from the Bahamas corporate registry. The 38GB cache revealed the offshore activities of \"prime ministers, ministers, princes and convicted felons\", it said. Former EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted an \"oversight\" in failing to disclose her interest in an offshore company.\nThis ICIJ investigation, involving hundreds of journalists from 45 countries, including BBC Panorama, went public in February 2015.\nIt focused on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), a subsidiary of the banking giant, and so lifted the lid on dealings in a country where banking secrecy is taken for granted.\nThe leaked files covered accounts up to the year 2007, linked with more than 100,000 individuals and legal entities from more than 200 countries.\nThe ICIJ said the subsidiary had served \"those close to discredited regimes\" and \"clients who had been unfavourably named by the United Nations\".\nHSBC admitted that the \"compliance culture and standards of due diligence\" at the subsidiary at the time were \"lower than they are today\". \nWho was named? The ICIJ said HSBC had profited from \"arms dealers, bag men for Third World dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws\".\nIt also cited those close to the regimes of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian President Ben Ali and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.\nWho leaked the data? Actually, we know this one. The ICIJ investigation was based on data originally leaked by the French-Italian software engineer and whistleblower Herv\u00e9 Falciani, though the ICIJ got it later from another source. From 2008 onwards he passed information on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) to French authorities, who in turn passed them to other relevant governments. Mr Falciani was indicted in Switzerland. He was held in detention in Spain but was later released and now lives in France.\nOr LuxLeaks for short. Another extensive ICIJ investigation, which revealed its findings in November 2014.\nIt centred on how professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers helped multinational companies gain hundreds of favourable tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010.\nThe ICIJ said multinationals had saved billions by channelling money through Luxembourg, sometimes at tax rates of less than 1%. One address in Luxembourg was home to more than 1,600 companies, it said.\nThe leak of documents was first exposed in 2012 after a joint investigation between Panorama and France2 which lifted the lid on the tax agreements of UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline and media company Northern & Shell. \nWho was named? Pepsi, IKEA, AIG and Deutsche Bank were among those named.\nA second tranche of leaked documents said the Walt Disney Co and Skype had funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars in profits through Luxembourg subsidiaries. They and the other firms denied any wrongdoing.\nJean-Claude Juncker had been PM of Luxembourg when it enacted many of its tax avoidance rules. He had been appointed president of the European Commission just a few days before the leak came out. He said he had not encouraged avoidance.\nEurosceptics went to town and pushed a censure motion against him and his commission. It was rejected. But the EU did investigate, and by 2016 had proposed a yet-to-be realised common tax scheme for the EU.\nWho leaked the data? Frenchman Antoine Deltour, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee, was the main man, saying he had acted in the public interest. Another PwC employee, Raphael Halet, helped him.\nThe pair, along with journalist Edouard Perrin, were all charged in Luxembourg after a PwC complaint. A first verdict was later revisited, watering down sentences, with Deltour given a six-month suspended jail term which was later quashed. Halet received a small fine and Mr Perrin was acquitted.\nThis was about a tenth of the size of the Panama Papers but was seen as the biggest expos\u00e9 of international tax fraud ever when the ICIJ and its news partners went public in November 2012 and April 2013.\nSome 2.5 million files revealed the names of more than 120,000 companies and trusts in hideaways such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cook Islands.\nBBC Panorama exposed a flourishing tax evasion industry in the UK in an undercover investigation based on the files. \nWho was named? The usual suspects. A mix of politicians, government officials and their families, with the Russians notable, but also those in China, Azerbaijan, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia and Pakistan. The Philippines - in the form of the family of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos - get a dishonourable mention. To be fair, the ICIJ does point out that the leaks are not necessarily evidence of illegal actions.\nWho leaked the data? The ICIJ cites \"two financial service providers, a private bank in Jersey and the Bahamas corporate registry\" as the sources, but says nothing more other than it was \"data obtained\".\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. \nMore than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet.

      "title": "Rishi Sunak: No magic wand to solve supply problems",
      "tags": "Conservative Party,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Conservative Party Conference,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said there is no \"magic wand\" to make disruption to fuel and food supplies disappear overnight.\nHe told the BBC supply problems were global, and ministers were doing everything they can to mitigate them.\n\"Pragmatic controlled immigration\" could be part of the short-term solution, he said.\nHe was speaking ahead of addressing the Conservative party conference amid concerns over living standards.\nThe Chancellor's first in-person speech to Tory members comes against a backdrop of rising food and energy prices, alongside cuts to universal credit benefits and tax rises to fund the NHS and social care. \nSupply chain issues are continuing to affect several sectors, with the military due to begin driving fuel to petrol stations. \nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Sunak said \"challenges\" to supply chains are not unique to the UK but were a problem across the world as a result of lockdowns and the rapid re-opening of economies.\nBut he said the government was doing \"everything we can to mitigate the bits of that that we can\". \n\"There are things that we can do and should do and it is reasonable that people expect us to do what we can,\" he said. \n\"Whether it's short-term visas, speeding up testing capacity for HGV drivers, of course we should do all those things and we are doing all those things, but we can't wave a magic wand and make global supply chain challenges disappear overnight.\"\nBut he said the problems \"we are seeing at the moment will be transitory and will pass through the system\". \nPM Boris Johnson also insisted supply problems were part of an international trend, telling reporters they were due to the global economy \"coming back to life\" after Covid shutdowns.\n\"There's a shortage of lorry drivers actually around the world,\" he added.\nThe prime minister tried on Sunday to present this as short-term pain as part of what he believes will be very significant long-term gains because of Brexit.\nNow, the prime minister and other ministers would not say, 'oh, suck it up, enjoy the fact that you have to queue for petrol'.\nBut they have, in the last few days, woven this narrative: to take some of the things that we see happening, acutely, whether in agriculture, whether in fuel supply - and to turn them into this story of short-term pain for a long-term gain.\nThat was not Rishi Sunak's language. \nHe talked rather soberly about global supply shortages, things that the government can mitigate, clearly he believes the government does have a role.\nBut he was very different in tone, which was something on the day of a big chancellor's speech at this conference, very well worth noting.\nIn his speech later, Mr Sunak will say the best protection against cost of living challenges is to give people the skills and opportunities to get better paid work.\nThe chancellor will commit \u00a3500m to renew job support programmes and  promise to \"double down\" on help for the jobs market after Covid.\nHe will also promise to reshape the economy around technology and scientific innovation. \nAhead of his speech, Mr Sunak praised the UK's economic recovery but warned the \"job is not done yet\".\n\"At the start of this crisis I made a promise to do whatever it takes, and I'm ready to double down on that promise now as we come out of this crisis,\" he said.\nHe will also promise to make the UK the \"the most exciting place on the planet\" through better infrastructure and improved skills.\nHis speech will come on the second day of conference, and he will say the Kickstart Scheme - which subsidises eligible jobs for young people on universal credit - will be extended by three months to March 2022.\nThe scheme, launched in September last year, was allocated \u00a32bn in funding to create 250,000 jobs by the end of 2021. \nHowever, only 76,900 have actually started Kickstart roles, according  to latest figures, with 196,300 roles in total made available for youngsters to apply for. \nThe Federation of Small Businesses had been calling for the scheme to be extended, amid reports that firms had encountered delays and found the scheme slow.\nMr Sunak will also announce the extension of the JETS scheme to help long-term unemployed people on universal credit until September 2022.\nA separate scheme paying employers \u00a33,000 per apprentice they take on will also be prolonged by four months until the end of January.\nAnd the government is promising more help finding work for those coming off the furlough scheme, which closed last week, having paid the wages of 11.6 million workers during the pandemic. \nThe various extensions will be paid for with \u00a3500m of funding, with the Treasury saying that details will be confirmed at the Spending Review on 27 October.\nLabour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government's plan to support jobs was \"struggling\" and had \"failed to hit its original targets\".\n\"An extended deadline will do nothing to compensate for the chancellor's tax rises, cost of living crisis and cuts to universal credit,\" he added."

      "tags": "Tax,Tony Blair,Pandora Papers ",
      "text": "Tony and Cherie Blair did not have to pay \u00a3312,000 in stamp duty when buying a \u00a36.45m London townhouse, leaked documents show.\nThe ex-Labour prime minister and his barrister wife bought the property as an office for her business in 2017 by buying the offshore firm that owned it. \nMrs Blair said the sellers had insisted the building was sold in this way but they had brought it under UK control.\nShe said they would be liable to pay capital gains tax if they sell it.\nWhen the property was put up for sale, the ultimate owners were a family with political connections in Bahrain - but both parties say they did not initially know who they were dealing with.\nMrs Blair said her husband's only involvement in the transaction was that the mortgage for the property used their joint income and capital.\nThe revelation is contained in the Pandora Papers, a leak detailing the work of companies offering offshore financial services in the British Virgin Islands, Singapore, Panama, Belize, Switzerland and other countries.\nBBC Panorama in a joint investigation with the Guardian and other media partners have had access to nearly 12 million documents and files.\nSince leaving Downing Street in 2007, the Blairs have built up a significant property portfolio. Altogether they are reported to have spent more than \u00a330m on 38 residential properties before they bought the office.\nDocuments show how the way the property in Harcourt Street, Marylebone, was acquired in July 2017 saved the Blairs a bill for stamp duty.\nThe four-floor building is now home to Mrs Blair's legal advisory firm, Omnia Strategy, and her foundation for women.\nThe previous owner of Harcourt Street is listed in UK Land Registry records as Romanstone International Limited - a British Virgin Islands firm.\nRomanstone itself had been owned by another BVI company, whose shareholders were members of the Al Zayani family. Among them was a minister in Bahrain's government - Zayed Rashid Al Zayani, Bahrain's minister for industry, commerce and tourism.\nThe leaked documents show the Blairs bought the building by setting up a UK company to acquire Romanstone. Mr and Mrs Blair each held a 50% stake in the British company. They closed the offshore company after the purchase.\nBuying the property in this way meant the Blairs did not have to pay stamp duty.\nStamp duty is paid by the purchasers of a property or land over a certain price.\nThe tax is not paid when a company owning a property is acquired because the shareholder of a company is switching hands, rather than the actual ownership of the property. \nNo laws were broken in buying the Harcourt Street office but Mr Blair had previously been critical of tax loopholes, once saying \"the tax system is a haven of scams, perks, City deals and profits\".\nIn his first speech as Labour leader in 1994, Mr Blair said: \"Millionaires with the right accountant pay nothing while pensioners pay VAT on fuel.\n\"Offshore trusts get tax relief while homeowners pay VAT on insurance premiums. We will create a tax system that is fair which is related to ability to pay.\"\nRobert Palmer from campaign group Tax Justice UK told Panorama: \"It partly doesn't look great because most people cannot do the same thing\u2026 even if what the Blairs did was perfectly legal, perfectly legitimate in the business world, it feels instinctively really unfair because they got access to an advantage, a potential advantage that the rest of us don't have.\"\nMrs Blair stressed that Harcourt Ventures had been formed to bring Romanstone and its building under UK tax and regulatory rules. \nShe said: \"It is not unusual for a commercial office building to be held in a corporate vehicle or for vendors of such property not to want to dispose of the property separately.\"\nThe Blairs said \"the acquisition of a company comes with different tax consequences\" and they \"will of course be liable for capital gains tax on resale\".\nLawyers for the Al Zayani family say their companies have complied with all UK laws past and present.\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires.

      "title": "Pandora Papers: Why are donations to political parties often so controversial?",
      "tags": "Pandora Papers ,Electoral Commission ",
      "text": "The Pandora Papers leak has once again cast a spotlight on the funding of UK political parties by wealthy donors.\nThe Conservative Party are under scrutiny after files included in the Pandora Papers leak revealed how a prominent donor was involved in a corruption scandal.\nIn the past, Labour and the Lib Dems have also been exposed for accepting money in questionable circumstances.\nParties need to be able to raise money in order to run. But there are concerns when it looks like those giving cash expect something in return\nRunning a political party costs money, particularly in the build-up to elections. Some \u00a350m was spent by parties during the 2019 general election.\nMost income comes in the form of donations including those from individuals and companies.\nTo give money as an individual you have to appear on a UK electoral register. Companies must be registered in the UK and carry out business in the country. \nOther sources of income for parties include membership fees, loans and a limited amount of public money.\nA vast majority of the Conservative Party's donations come from individuals: 68% during the 2019 election campaign.\nThe Labour Party's income looks different. During the 2019 general election campaign, 93% of donations came from trade unions. National parties only have to record donations above \u00a37,500, so the totals do not pick up the large base of Labour supporters who give small amounts.\nThe largest union backer of Labour is Unite the Union. Last year it gave the party \u00a31.6m in donations. This is on top of the fees that union members pay to \"affiliate\" with the Labour Party. \nAt the start of his premiership, Tony Blair faced criticism over his interactions with Formula One tycoon Bernie Eccleston. New Labour had received \u00a31m from Mr Eccleston months before coming to power in 1997, with another possible chunk on the way. It was later revealed that he had met Mr Blair to lobby him to exempt F1 from a tobacco advertising ban.\nA \"cash for honours\" scandal hit Tony Blair's government in 2006, when it emerged that a number of large secret loans had been made to the Labour Party before the 2005 general election. Some of the lenders had subsequently been nominated for the House of Lords.\nTony Blair became the first prime minister to be questioned by the police during an investigation. However, the long and expensive probe led to no charges from the CPS. \nOffering seats in the House of Lords is still a controversial issue. In 2020 Prime Minister Boris Johnson nominated Peter Cruddas - who had given \u00a350,000 to Mr Johnson's campaign to be party leader - for a seat in the House of Lords, going against official advice.\nA businessman who was later convicted for perjury became the Liberal Democrats' largest donor in 2005, giving \u00a32.4m to the party. The party faced criticism for not returning the donation, despite Michael Brown not being a registered UK voter and donating through a newly-created company.\nIt's not always wealthy individuals. This summer the police launched an investigation into the SNP's finances after the party had raised money in a crowdfunding drive. Donors had complained about how the money went on to be used. \nMPs can accept their own donations and gifts, as long as they declare them. The register of MPs' interests - which includes outside employment and free tickets to horse races - is updated every two weeks.\nPoliticians are frequently found to have failed to declare interests in the correct way - usually resulting in an apology in Parliament. In 2018 DUP MP Ian Paisley admitted \"deep personal embarrassment\" after failing to declare two luxury holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.\nParties themselves must report donations and loans of more than \u00a37,500 to the Electoral Commission - the organisation which regulates political donations in the UK. This register is updated every three months.\nEach party has a treasurer, who is legally responsible for checking whether a donor is legitimate.\nGuidance from the Electoral Commission says: \"As soon as you receive a donation, you must make sure you know who the donor is, and start checking their permissibility. You have 30 days to decide whether to accept or refuse the donation.\"\nIf a party breaks the rules about making declarations to the Electoral Commission a range of sanctions are available - including fines of up to \u00a320,000. Very serious offensives can also be referred to the police.\nA parliamentary report published this year recommended steps to address the \"risk that the current rules on donations from companies provide a route for foreign money to influence UK elections\".\nThe committee argued that donations should only be made \"from profits generated in the UK,\" and that new checks should be put in place \"for identifying the true source of a donation\".\nThe report was welcomed by pressure groups including the Electoral Reform Society and Transparency International.\nIn its 2019 election manifesto, the Conservative Party said it would \"protect the integrity of our democracy\". It has introduced new legislation, currently going through parliament, that includes measures to tighten the rules that prevent foreign money being used in campaigning.\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations.

      "tags": "Oil,Environment,California",
      "text": "An oil slick off the coast of California has started washing ashore, killing fish, contaminating wetlands and closing beaches. \nAbout 3,000 barrels of oil have spread over an area covering 13 square miles (33 sq km), off the Orange County coast. \nHuntington Beach Mayor Kim Carr said portions of the coastline were covered in oil. \nAn investigation into the pipeline breach that caused it is under way. \nThe slick, about five miles off the coasts of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, was discovered on Saturday morning. \nIt is thought to be one of the largest oil spills in the state's recent history, according to the Associated Press news agency. \nAuthorities are now attempting to contain the oil by using protective booms - a type of floating barrier. Divers are also working at the scene to determine how the leak occurred. \nThe US Coast Guard has so far deployed 14 boats to conduct oil recovery operations, and three to enforce a safety zone in the area. Four aircraft have also been dispatched to conduct assessments of the spill.\n\"Wildlife is dying. It's very sad,\" Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley told CBS News. She added that there were reports of dead animals along the shore and that Talbert Marsh, an ecological reserve had also suffered \"significant damage\". \nOn Monday morning, the Coast Guard said that approximately 3,150 gallons (14,320 litres) of oil have so far been recovered from the water. \nAmplify Energy Corp, which owns three off-shore platforms, said it stopped operations and shut its pipeline on Saturday. \nCEO Martyn Willsher said the pipeline had been suctioned to ensure that no more oil would spill. \nThe area, 40 miles (64km) south of Los Angeles, is extremely popular with surfers. Beaches have been closed and the last day of the Pacific Airshow was cancelled.\nResidents have been told not to approach animals affected by the spill and to instead call authorities. \nAdditionally, officials in Orange County issued a health advisory recommending that anyone who may have encountered contaminated materials seek medical attention. \nMichelle Steel, a Republican representative for part of the affected area, has asked President Joe Biden to declare a major disaster, which would allow for funds to help with clean-up operations. \nIn 2010, the Deep Water Horizon incident off the Gulf of Mexico saw nearly 300,000 tonnes of oil spill, resulting in the death of thousands of species ranging from plankton to dolphins. \nThere were also other longer-term impacts on marine life including impaired reproduction, reduced growth, lesions and disease."

Her paternal grandfather is Nigerian.\nGrowing up, Cass went to the Glasgow Gaelic School, Sgoil Gh\u00e0idhlig Ghlaschu, which teaches at both primary and secondary school levels. \nCass' parents, who do not speak Gaelic, chose the school because they thought she would get a good education there.\nBut Cass says she felt \"a little lost\" in immersive Gaelic-medium education, and among peers whose families were from the Highlands and Islands - the Western Isles are Gaelic's \"heartland\".\nShe says she argued with her mum about having to go to the school, and even felt angry about it.\nThe 27-year-old says: \"The impression I had when I left school was that I didn't feel part of the Gaelic world. \n\"I didn't see myself represented in the culture so there was something of a disconnect.\"\nBut she says she has since gained an appreciation of her education and describes herself as an Afro-Gael. \nThrough making the documentary, which also examines racism and Scotland's historical links with the slave trade, Cass met other women of African and Caribbean descent who are also Gaelic speakers.\nThey include Amina Davidson, a traditional musician who lives in the Partick area of Glasgow.\nDuring the first lockdown last year, she joined her neighbour Robert Robertson - singer with the Scottish band Tide Lines - in singing the Gaelic song Teann a-Nall from the windows of their tenements to entertain other residents. A video of the performance on social media went viral.\n\"It now has 1.5 million views,\" says Amina.\nThe singer says she enjoys being part of the traditional Scottish and Gaelic music scene, adding: \"It's a small, friendly world which I enjoy.\n\"Everyone knows one another and there are lots of traditional musicians in this area where I live.\"\nCarrie Prescott, of Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, started learning Gaelic as an adult as part of a degree and is actively involved in the language and culture.\nShe says: \"Sometimes when I'm at Gaelic events, or I'm speaking to somebody, and it transpires that I speak Gaelic they find it very unusual.\n\"They're not expecting us to be able to speak Gaelic.\"\nTawana Maramba, of Tranent, East Lothian, is a student and Gaelic singer. \nHer parents are from Zimbabwe and they raised her to speak their Shona language, but also encouraged her interest in other languages and placed her in a Gaelic-medium education primary school.\nShe says: \"In high school the only Gaelic-medium subject was Gaelic language, but in primary school every subject was in Gaelic.\n\"That was so good in primary school because it meant that we spoke Gaelic every day.\"\nTawana now teaches Gaelic singing and participates at the Royal National Mod, an annual celebration of the language and culture.\nLast year, she appeared in a Gaelic short film about Eliza Junor, a girl from Guyana and the descendant of slaves who grew up in Fortrose in the Highlands in the early 19th Century.\nTawana says: \"I feel some people react like: 'Oh you speak Gaelic?'\n\"But I'm quite proud of that. It plays a huge part in my life.\"\nThe documentary, Trusadh: Afro-G\u00e0idheil - Afro-Gaels, will be shown on BBC Alba on Monday at 21:00 and will later be available on iPlayer."

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Pandora Papers ,Portsmouth",
      "text": "A businessman whose companies have backed 34 Tory MPs made millions from an allegedly corrupt Russian pipeline deal, leaked files show.\nFormer oil executive Victor Fedotov owns a firm currently seeking UK government approval for a controversial energy link between the UK and France. \nA BBC investigation shows he secretly benefitted from the alleged $4bn fraud in Russia.\nHis lawyers said \"there is no evidence whatsoever\" he behaved improperly.\nThe revelations come from the Pandora Papers, a leak of 11.9 million offshore files obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). An investigation of the documents in the UK has been led by BBC Panorama and The Guardian . \nThe BBC discovered documents revealing Mr Fedotov as a secret owner of a company called VNIIST that benefitted from hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts from Transneft, the Russian state-owned oil and gas pipeline company. \nA 2008 audit report suggested Transneft had lost huge sums to corruption and that one of the contractors that had benefitted was VNIIST. \nIt was alleged VNIIST was paid for work it hadn't carried out and that Transneft had lost around $143 million in just two contracts.\nThe audit report was leaked to Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny who estimated $4bn had been embezzled. No charges were brought against any of those involved.\nWhat the audit report did not reveal was that one of Mr Fedotov's secret business partners in VNIIST was the President of Transneft, Semyon Vainshtok. The documents in the Pandora Papers show he was secretly benefitting from contracts Transneft had awarded.  \nThey reveal a scheme to funnel profits from the Transneft deals through layers of companies in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Malta and the British Virgin Islands under the ownership of trusts of which Mr Fedotov and Mr Vainshtok were secret beneficiaries. A second Transneft executive was also profiting from the cash.\nThe files show millions of dollars flowing into the trusts and that by 2007 Mr Fedotov's trust held some $97m in assets. \nThe evidence suggests some of the money from Transneft ended up paying for Mr Fedotov's \u00a37m house in the English countryside.\nAndrew Mitchell QC told Panorama the scheme appeared to be \"a pure attempt to slice money out of government and, when you factor in that the CEO of the government-owned entity organised and did the subcontracting with a couple of mates, um, that's fraud.\"\nMr Vainshtok's lawyers said the allegations of fraud were \"unfounded\" and made for \"political purposes\".\nThey said: \"The allegations were investigated at the time by the Audit Committee of Russia, the Ministry of Interior Affairs of Russia and the General Prosecutor's office in Russia, who all found that there was no basis for making the allegations, and no grounds to take any action against our client.\"\nMr Fedotov's lawyers said the 2008 audit report is not an official reliable document and that he denies any allegation of wrongdoing.\nBut it is not just property that Mr Fedotov has funded in the UK. His money has funded the Conservative Party. \nLast year Mr Fedotov was revealed to be the owner of Aquind, the company behind a \u00a31.24bn project to build an electricity cable linking the UK to France. Aquind is currently seeking UK government approval for the project and a decision will be made in weeks.\nHis connection to Aquind has been hidden through an exemption to UK company laws granted to people with personal security concerns. \nMr Fedotov is now identified on the company's public records, alongside Alexander Temerko, the Ukraine-born public face and part owner of Aquind.\nMr Temerko is a Conservative Party activist and personal friend of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. \nHe is a regular at Conservative Party fundraisers and has personally donated more than \u00a3700,000 to the party. \nResearch by the BBC has established that in addition to Mr Temerko's donations to the Conservative Party, Mr Fedotov's businesses have donated another \u00a3700,000 to 34 MPs and their local parties since the Aquind project began.\nAquind's relationship with the Conservative Party does not end there. \nLord Callanan, currently a business minister responsible for corporate responsibility, is a former director of the company, while former minister Lord James Wharton took up a role as a paid adviser when he lost his House of Commons seat in 2017.\nIn an interview for the BBC, journalist Peter Oborne says this raises questions about Aquind. He says \"You have to ask yourself why \u2026 Aquind feels it needs to go to such elaborate efforts and spend such money and so much time to get access to the Conservative Party.\"\nA Conservative spokesman said donations are properly and transparently declared and the party \"perform compliance checks in line with the \u2026 legislation and requirements enacted by the last Labour government\".\nThe spokesman said \"Fund raising is a legitimate part of the democratic process. Government policy is in no way influenced by the donations the Party receives\" and that the party is \"motivated by the priorities of the British public, acting in the national interest\"\nLawyers for Aquind and Mr Temerko said their donations were \"entirely lawful, properly declared and have not been made in return for any special treatment\". They said there was \"no evidence that funds were embezzled\" from Transneft.\nMr Fedotov \"denies any allegation of wrongdoing\" and says that he \"has never had any interest in British politics and has operated in an open and transparent manner throughout the course of his career.\"\nAquind announced its plan to build an electricity cable under the English Channel in 2016. \nThe proposed route starts at an electricity substation in Lovedean, near Portsmouth, and ends up near Le Havre in Normandy, France.\nIt is not the first of its kind. Another cable was laid undersea between the two countries in 1986.\nBut if the new one comes online, it is expected to provide two gigawatts to the UK National Grid, enough to power four million homes.\nLocals protesting against the project claim the construction will destroy allotments and wildlife habitats.\nLocal MP Penny Mordaunt has joined them, delivering a petition to the government in June, calling for the proposals to be rejected by the government. \nShe has said it would be \"strategically wrong\" to go ahead with a project that would make the UK \"reliant on another country [France] to power us\". \nStephen Morgan, Labour MP for Portsmouth South, is worried about the inclusion of communications and data cables as part of the underwater connector. He has said that having these cables that are \"available for hire by third-party clients\u2026raises similar concerns to those about the UK's 5G network and Huawei\".\nThe company submitted its plans in 2019 and the decision now sits with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. His predecessor Alok Sharma recused himself from the decision following revelations he had shared a table with Mr Temerko at a Conservative fundraising event.\nFormer energy minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan also recused herself after her local party group received several donations from Aquind and Mr Temerko. \nIn 2019 Conservative MP David Morris was found to have breached parliamentary rules when he spoke in favour of Aquind in the House of Commons, only weeks after having received a \u00a310,000 donation from the company.\nGavin Millar QC, an elections expert, said: \"The question is: if you're a political party in government, why aren't you recognizing the risk that there's a connection between the money you're receiving and the person who's giving that money?\u202f\"\u202f \nHe added: \"It's in their interests not to look too hard. And it's lucrative to not look hard if you're good at raising the money.\"\nIn a statement, the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) told the BBC Lord Callanan has recused himself from any decisions relating to Aquind. \nA spokesperson for the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: \"The Secretary of State is currently considering the Planning Inspectorate's report on the application for development consent for the proposed project.\n\"No decision has yet been taken. The decision will be made solely by the Secretary of State who has a quasi-judicial role in determining this planning application.\"\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC which has led the biggest ever global investigation.More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet.

It is based on church, court and police archives, as well as interviews with victims.\nThe inquiry was commissioned by the French Catholic Church in 2018, following a number of scandals in other countries.\nMr Sauv\u00e9, a senior civil servant, told France's Le Monde newspaper that the panel had handed over evidence to prosecutors in 22 cases where criminal action could still be launched.\nHe added that bishops and other senior church officials had been told of other allegations against people who were still alive.\nCommission members included doctors, historians, sociologists and theologians. More than 6,500 victims and witnesses were contacted over two and a half years. The final report is 2,500 pages long.\nChristopher Lamb, of the Roman Catholic publication The Tablet, told the BBC that abuse scandals had plunged the Church into \"its greatest crisis in... 500 years\".\nEarlier this year Pope Francis changed the Catholic Church's laws to explicitly criminalise sexual abuse, in its biggest overhaul of the criminal code for decades.\nThe new rules make sex abuse, grooming minors, possessing child pornography and covering up abuse an offence under Canon Law."

      "tags": "Companies,Morrisons,Retailing,Supermarkets",
      "text": "The chairman of supermarket chain Morrisons has insisted the supermarket will be able to deliver a \"good\" Christmas for customers despite supply chain issues.\nAndy Higginson said he was \"not worried\" about logistical issues with supermarkets supplying products. \nHe said the issues were \"well publicised\" and \"slightly overblown\".\nHis comments come just two days after US private equity firm CD&R won an auction to buy Morrisons.\nThe \u00a37bn ($9.5bn) bid for the UK's fourth-largest supermarket chain from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) just trumped an offer from rival suitor Fortress.\nThe takeover will mark a return to the UK grocery sector for Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, who is a senior adviser to CD&R.\nThere has been speculation that Mr Leahy will become the new chairman of Morrisons, as Mr Higginson will stand down from his post once the deal with CD&R is completed. \nMorrisons owns a quarter of its suppliers, including fisheries and meat production operations, and Mr Higginson said that was one of the reasons the private equity firm had found the business attractive.\n\"Private equity gets a bit of a bad rap sometimes,\" Mr Higginson said. \nHe added that private equity is \"focused on growth and trying to grow businesses - it's the way they make returns... and that's very much the case here\". \nThe supermarket chain has arrangements with 2,700 British farmers, who deliver livestock and produce directly to its 17 food processing facilities, which supply 493 stores.\n\"Supply chains in the UK are incredibly efficient and I'm sure we'll be able to deliver a great Christmas for customers as we go through,\" Mr Higginson added. \n\"I think it'll be a good Christmas for people, I think they'll want to treat themselves\". \nRewind to the start of the summer, and the supermarket chain Morrisons is a stock market plodder, a company to be invested in for its healthy dividend rather than any hope of a big rise in the share price. It's a British supermarket, and we all know that the UK grocery market is fiercely competitive with big players that are well-entrenched and little hope of rapid growth.\nThat was the orthodoxy, and the events of the past four months have made it look a little silly. Then, Morrisons shares hovered around 180p. On Saturday, a private-equity-led consortium won an auction to buy the company at 287p a share. Those fund managers who dismissed Morrison's prospects and chose not to own the shares have missed out on a pound-a-share payday.\nWhat did the City miss? According to Andy Higginson, Morrison's outgoing chairman - like the company's other non-executive directors, he will leave when the deal is completed - the Square Mile's fund managers could not see the \"inherent strength\" of the chain, which owns many of its store freeholds, has its own food production assets, and a pension scheme in surplus.\nMr Higginson said Morrisons was not alone in having been undervalued, describing it as a \"sector problem\". That idea that supermarkets in general are neglected by the City raises the intriguing prospect that other chains may find themselves being wooed by private investor groups.\nLast month, the supermarket warned that it expected the UK's lorry driver shortage to push up prices this year. It said the lack of drivers, plus higher freight charges and commodity prices, could lead to higher prices.\nHowever, it also said it would seek to mitigate those and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred in maintaining good product availability.\nMorrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The group has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff.\nThe business was founded by William Morrison, and his son, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for 50 years. "

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow.\nScotland's new vaccine passport app is now functioning well, says deputy first minister John Swinney, despite the nightclub industry calling it a \"shambles\". The scheme to allow only fully vaccinated people to attend some large events has suffered teething problems, with some in the nightclub sector calling it confusing. Many venues did not ask for proof of vaccination over the weekend because of the bugs in the app, while others reported low numbers of people with the new vaccine passport on their phones. Mr Swinney said 280,000 QR codes for the scheme had been downloaded by Sunday.  But he acknowledged there was still a \"very small number of cases\" of people being unable to download a QR code as proof of vaccination. \nPolice forces across Wales have been \"assisting illegal evictions\" during the pandemic, according to Shelter Cymru. The housing charity told a Senedd committee it had seen it happen in all four police force areas. The Welsh government banned evictions during the first part of the pandemic. This ended in June but landlords now have to give tenants six months' notice of eviction. The charity said it had dealt with a significant number of illegal evictions. Welsh police forces have been asked to comment.  \nParents have been urged to allow their 12 to 15-year-olds to get a Covid jab in Northamptonshire, which has some of the highest case rates in England. In the week to 29 September, Kettering had the highest rate and Daventry the fifth highest. Corby, Northampton and Wellingborough were also in the top 20. Public health officials said positive cases in the 10 to 19-year-old age group were driving the increase, which was \"not completely unexpected\". Public Health Northamptonshire said it was \"urging young people to get the vaccination when offered to help reduce the growing number of infections locally\". \nIndia's top court has approved the government's decision to pay 50,000 rupees (\u00a3498) as compensation for every death caused by Covid-19. The order, from the Supreme Court, follows a petition from lawyers seeking compensation under India's disaster management laws. There have been more than 447,000 coronavirus-related deaths officially recorded in India but experts believe as many as 10 times more people than that could have died during the pandemic. Justice MR Shah said the next of kin should be paid compensation within 30 days of an application being submitted. \nThe new James Bond film - Daniel Craig's last outing in the franchise - has had the highest opening weekend UK takings of any 007 movie. Many in the industry are hoping No Time to Die will kickstart the box office after cinemas had to shut their screens during the pandemic. It made \u00a321m between Friday and Sunday, according to box office trackers Comscore. That beat Skyfall's first weekend takings of \u00a320.2m and Spectre's \u00a319.8m.  \nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nThe rules on international travel have been updated today, with \"traffic-light\" system being replaced.

      "tags": "Network Rail,Transport,Rail travel,University of Sheffield,Northern",
      "text": "A new way of removing leaves more efficiently from railway lines to reduce delays is to be trialled across northern England. \nThe technique, developed by University of Sheffield engineers, involves blasting tracks with dry ice from a passenger train.\nIt will be trialled by operator Northern in the coming weeks. \nLeaves cause a slippery layer on railway lines, leading to delays as trains must run at slower speeds. \nUnder the new method, pellets of dry ice are fired in a stream of air, making leaves frozen and brittle. \nThe dry ice then quickly turns back into gas, causing it to expand and destroy the leaves.\nAt the moment, leaves are cleared by 61 special trains, which use high-pressure water jets followed by a gel containing sand and steel grains to help with braking. \nThe engineers behind the new system say their method is significantly more efficient as it can be used by passenger trains, which can cover greater distances than the limited fleet of cleaning trains. \nIt also does not leave a residue that can damage rails and train wheels, and can be used on the same stretch of track more than once a day.\nThe method has previously been trialled on test tracks and could be rolled out more widely by 2023.\nProf Roger Lewis, who is leading its development, said: \"This technology will make a step change in train performance during autumn, improving safety.\n\"It will provide more predictable braking and traction than current technology, and will help to improve train performance, reduce delays, increase passenger satisfaction and support the use of new technologies to enable greater network utilisation of the UK's railways.\"\nRob Cummings, seasonal improvement manager at Northern, said: \"One of the biggest risks to our performance during October and November is leaves on the line, but by helping to develop new technology we aim to deliver the very best service for our passengers.\""

      "tags": "Travel,Travel & leisure industry,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "New simplified travel rules have come into force in the UK, with the traffic light system replaced by a single red list. \nMost fully vaccinated travellers arriving from non-red list countries will no longer have to take a test before setting off for the UK.\nAirlines UK said it would make travelling abroad easier and cheaper.\nBut those coming from red list destinations must still pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. \nUnder the changes, which came into force at 04:00 BST, the green and amber lists have been scrapped. \nTesting rules are also being eased for people travelling from non-red list destinations who have been vaccinated in the UK, the EU, the US, or any of 18 other recognised countries. \nAnyone under 18 who is resident in those countries can also travel to the UK without testing.\nThese groups were already able to avoid self-isolating on their arrival back in the UK. \nAll travellers - except children under five years old - will still have to pay for a PCR test two days after arrival. \nPeople who are not fully vaccinated will need a pre-departure test and a PCR test on days two and eight after they return, and must self-isolate for 10 days at home. \nAnd those arriving from red list countries, including Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines and South Africa, must quarantine for 10 days in a government-approved hotel, at a cost of \u00a32,285 for one adult. Only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, are allowed to enter the UK if they have been in a red country in the previous 10 days. \nThe red list is due to be updated later this week. \nThe government may also announce additions to the list of countries whose vaccination certificates are recognised by the UK. \nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"We are accelerating towards a future where travel continues to reopen safely and remains open for good, and today's rule changes are good news for families, businesses and the travel sector.\n\"Our priority remains to protect public health but, with more than eight in 10 people now fully vaccinated, we are able to take these steps to lower the cost of testing and help the sector to continue in its recovery.\"\nThere was a surge in holiday bookings after the government announced the changes last month and the travel sector has welcomed the move.\nThe industry previously criticised the government for being too slow to ease and simplify rules on testing and quarantine. \nFrom later in October, the government has said fully vaccinated people coming to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival and can take a cheaper lateral flow test instead. \nNo date has been set for this change but ministers are aiming to have it in place for the half-term school break. \nSo far, no other UK nation has followed suit. \nScotland has said it will \"align with the UK post-arrival testing regime\" but has not announced further details. The Welsh government said it had \"concerns\" about easing its testing regime. \nTim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents UK carriers, said: \"Things are moving in the right direction and the removal of these restrictions will make it easier and cheaper for people to travel.\"\nHowever, he said the UK remained \"an outlier on arrivals testing for vaccinated passengers\".\nAirlines UK hopes to see more countries removed from the red list at the next update and further mutual recognition of vaccine status for those jabbed in other countries, he added. \nWillie Walsh, head of industry body the International Air Transport Association, welcomed the change as a \"positive step\", saying the government's testing and quarantine restrictions had been both unscientific and costly. \n\"People have been led to believe that the risk is people flying into the country. The risk was inside the country,\" he said. \nAlan French, chief executive at Thomas Cook, said more options would now be available for travellers. \n\"They will be more confident if they book the holiday, they can travel safely there and be able to return in a transparent way, which is something they've not been able to do,\" he said. \nMr French said since the government announced the changes, three weeks ago, his company had seen bookings more than double.  \nThe UK recorded 30,439 cases on Sunday, with the total number of cases in the past seven days up one per cent on the previous week. \nHowever, the number of Covid deaths and hospital admissions are falling, with 43 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported on Sunday.\nHow will the new system affect you?

      "tags": "Coronavirus lockdown measures,Employment,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "For the past 18 months the government has been subsidising the wages of employees hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe furlough scheme was the centrepiece of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's \"unprecedented\" intervention in the economy, designed to stave off a wave of job losses as the country closed down in the face of the virus.\nIt protected the incomes of millions of people across the UK working sectors that could no longer operate, such as live music, nightclubs, the travel industry, business events, hospitality and retail businesses. \nNow that scheme is ending, requiring firms to shoulder full responsibility for those employees again or let them go.\nDuring the lifetime of the scheme about 11.6 million jobs were supported, with a steep take-up in the first few months especially.\nThat doesn't mean the government was ever paying 11 million people's wages at the same time.\nAccording to data from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the number of people on furlough peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May last year. It then fell steadily until late 2020, when it picked up again, without ever hitting the heights of the first lockdown.\nSince then, numbers have continued to fall, although around 1.6 million were still relying on the scheme at the end of July, the last date for which figures are available from HMRC.\n\"To all those at home right now, anxious about the days ahead, I say this: you will not face this alone,\" the chancellor said, announcing the furlough scheme in March 2020.\nAlthough he has since become one of the country's best-known politicians, Mr Sunak was fairly new in his post at the time, and he had just kicked off his chancellorship with a Budget that included a jawdropping a \u00a330bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the virus outbreak.\nBut it turned out to be nowhere near enough. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, to give furlough its official title, along with other support measures, would end up incurring a far bigger bill, requiring the government to borrow much more than it would in normal times, month after month.\nUnder the scheme, the government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nBut by the end of the scheme the government was contributing only 60%, with employers shouldering a 20% share themselves\nOverall it cost the government nearly \u00a370bn, but has been praised by the Resolution Foundation think-tank as a \"great success\", protecting people's living standards and preventing what many feared would be a catastrophic rise in unemployment.\nWhile workers were furloughed in every age group it was younger workers who accounted for a large proportion of those on furlough.\nYounger people were more likely to be employed in the sectors of the economy worst hit by the coronavirus lockdown measures including hospitality and retail.\nSince March 2020, more women than men have been furloughed although according to the latest figures more men remained on furlough towards the end of the scheme.\nSome sectors of the economy made more use of the furlough scheme than others.\nWith pubs and restaurants particularly badly affected by coronavirus curbs, the hospitality industry saw a high number of workers furloughed.\nAnd non-essential shops were closed at the height of the lockdown, so retailers made big claims on the government's resources. However, some large employers in that sector, notably supermarkets - who remained open during lockdowns, have since repaid the cash.\nPeople working in the arts, entertainment and other leisure activities were also more likely to find themselves on furlough than those in other walks of life.\nThe scheme was designed to keep people connected to jobs that would return after the pandemic peak passed. \nHowever over the last 18 months some of those on furlough have been made redundant, especially during the period late last year when it looked as though the furlough scheme was coming to an end.\nIn recent months, as the economy reopened and continued to grow, the number of redundancies has fallen.\nThe Resolution Foundation has described the furlough scheme overall as \"a very successful and well-implemented policy intervention\".\nBut its recent research suggested there remained a \"real risk\" to the jobs of those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly for those in parts of the travel sector, which still hasn't returned to normal operation, and for older workers.\nAnd doubts have been voiced in other quarters over some aspects of the scheme.\nIt has drawn fire from the Commons Public Accounts Committee, which wants all firms benefiting from the scheme to be named publicly in the interests of transparency.\nThe committee has spoken dismissively of \"hastily drawn up economic support schemes\" that provided \"unacceptable room for fraud against taxpayers\".\nHMRC, which administered the furlough scheme, has suggested that up to 10% of the money delivered by the scheme to mid-August 2020 - \u00a33.5bn - may have been paid out in fraud or error.\nApart from that, there is the question of whether it has delayed the process of people making the shift from jobs that are no longer viable to take up new opportunities.\nThe number of vacancies fell sharply during the early stages of the pandemic, but job vacancies are now considerably up on last year with staff shortages affecting several sectors.\nSome have blamed furlough for keeping workers out of action during the last few months, waiting to see if their old jobs will still be there for them, when some firms have been desperately trying to recruit new workers. \nAre you coming to the end of your furlough?

      "text": "The first new sickle-cell treatment in 20 years will help keep thousands of people out of hospital over the next three years, NHS England has said.\nSickle-cell disease is incurable and affects 15,000 people in the UK.\nAnd the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said the hope of reducing health inequalities for black people, who are predominantly affected and often have poorer health outcomes due to a number of social factors, made the drug worth recommending.\nIt called it \"an innovative treatment\".\nThe drug, crizanlizumab, made by Novartis, is injected into a vein and can be taken on its own or alongside standard treatment and regular blood transfusions.\nAnd in a trial, patients taking the crizanlizumab had a sickle-cell crisis 1.6 times a year on average, compared with nearly three times a year normally.\nThese painful episodes, which can require hospital treatment and lead to other health complications, are caused by by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking the small blood vessels .\nBut because the trial was small and lasted only a year, it remains unknown how long the benefits last for - and that makes it difficult to judge how cost-effective crizanlizumab is.\nNevertheless, NICE, which recommends treatments in England and Wales, is recommending its use for over-16s, albeit under a special arrangement rather than routinely, on the NHS.\nAnd additional data on the treatment will be collected through clinical trials.\nThe charity Sickle Cell Society said the new treatment brought \"new hope\" for people living with the world's most common genetic blood condition.\nNHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said: \"The moment that a new drug comes that is approved to be used, our job is to make sure that we can do a deal to ensure it's affordable and get it out as quickly as possible.\"\nDiagnosed at birth, Sarah-Jane Nkrumah, 27, had her first crisis aged six months and has chronic pain in her joints.\n\"Every day is pain,\" she says.\n\"I don't remember the last time I had zero pain.\" \nSarah-Jane prefers to take breaks from taking painkillers -  but some days cannot get out of bed.\n\"You just have to try and manage it,\" she says.\n\"I don't have a choice.\n\"It's all about having a lot of mental strength and support.\"\nAnd every six weeks, she has a blood transfusion to boost her energy levels.\n\"I feel weak and exhausted leading up to them and refreshed and stronger afterwards,\" she says.\n\"Thanks to donors, I get a chance to live another day.\"\nSarah-Jane had to give up her ambition to become a nursery teacher because it put her at risk of serious infection.\n\"Now, I have found my true purpose and love spreading awareness of sickle-cell disease,\" she says.\nMeindert Boysen, deputy chief executive and director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, at NICE, said: \"Treatment for sickle-cell disease has been limited for years and there has been a lack of treatments for patients whose lives are affected by the condition. \n\"Crizanlizumab... has shown the potential to improve hundreds of lives and we are delighted to be able to recommend it as the first new treatment for sickle cell disease in two decades.\"\nSource: Sickle Cell Society / NHS UK"

      "text": "A panel has called for a public inquiry to be held into institutions for unmarried mothers in Northern Ireland.\nThe three experts also advised that there should be immediate redress payments to survivors.\nThe devolved government committed to an investigation after research into mother-and-baby homes and Magdalene Laundries was published. \nWomen said they were detained against their will, used as unpaid labour and had to give up babies for adoption.\nThe primary recommendation in Tuesday's report is to establish an \"integrated investigation\" by a non-statutory independent panel, feeding into a statutory public inquiry.\nThere are also further recommendations for supporting measures to ensure that victims and survivors can participate in the investigation, including access to records legislation.\nFirst Minister Paul Givan, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Health Minister Robin Swann are due to meet the panel on Tuesday evening.\nThey welcomed the report and added that the Northern Ireland Executive would consider the recommendations and \"next steps will be set out by the executive as soon as possible\".\nMr Givan said the issue was a priority for the executive.\n\"I would hope within the next number of weeks the executive will be in a position to take definitive decisions around what the next steps should be,\" he said. \nMs O'Neill said the report was \"another step forward for victims and survivors\", adding that she supported a full public enquiry. \n\"The barbaric way in which women and girls were treated over many decades is utterly shameful and a stain on our society,\" she said. \nThe Truth Recovery Design Panel recommends:\nThe panel, along with victims and survivors, called on \"all state, religious and other institutions, agencies, organisations and individuals complicit in the processes of institutionalisation and forced labour, family separation and adoption to act without delay in issuing unqualified apologies\".\nThey said that they should clearly state their role, \"accept responsibility for harms done; demonstrate sincerity in their apology; and demonstrate the safeguards now in place to ensure there will be no repetition of the inhumanity and suffering to which they contributed\".\nMaria Cogley, who was born in the Marianvale home in Belfast, told the BBC's Evening Extra programme that \"now is the time to take it [an inquiry] forwards\".\n\"This is the start,\" she said.\n\"Now we need the Department of Health and Robin Swann to sign this off as quickly as possible, in full, and the recommendations that are made today, in the report, that's the only way we're going to get the answers to the questions and shine some light on the truth.\"\nThe homes and laundries across the island of Ireland have in recent years come to the attention of United Nations (UN) human rights monitors. \nDr Lia Nadaraia, who sits on the UN's Committee Against Torture, and Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), told the BBC there was evidence of \"systematic torture and ill-treatment\".\n\"Girls and women were involuntarily detained, stripped of their identities, forced to work constantly, and not paid wages,\" she said. \nDr Nadaraia said any investigation should be aimed at uncovering the full truth about what happened in the institutions, bringing about prosecutions if possible, and providing financial redress for victims.\nThe Truth Recovery Design Panel, which was established by the Stormont Executive in March, has been working with survivors to come up with recommendations.\nThe three members are Professor Phil Scraton from Queen's University law school, Dr Maeve O'Rourke from the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland (NUI) Galway, and Deirdre Mahon, executive director for social work at the Western Health Trust. \nProf Scraton said that \"lives and futures lost through the cruelty within these institutions cannot be recovered, but we must acknowledge the inter-generational pain and suffering inflicted on victims, survivors and families\".\nAt a press conference, Prof Scraton thanked the victims and survivors, and their families, but said that their pain \"will never, ever, be assuaged by whatever we do because this is one of the great scandals of our time\".\nDr O'Rourke said that any future investigation must be accessible to everyone involved, in particular those with disabilities.\n\"The key priorities raised by survivors and the relatives are that funding and resources should be sufficient to ensure effective and sustainable implementation of all the panel's recommendations; that the human rights of survivors and relatives are central to the recommendations' implementation; that all of the measures recommended must ensure full access for victims, survivors and relatives of the deceased to information,\" she said.\nThe research report, published in January, found at least 10,500 women passed through mother-and-baby homes. \nThere were eight institutions in Northern Ireland, run by Catholic and Protestant religious organisations.\nMore than 3,000 women spent time in a Magdalene Laundry.\nThese institutions were, in effect, workhouses, and were situated in Londonderry, Belfast, and Newry. \nThe researchers recommended there should be more investigations into levels of infant mortality among children who were born to mothers in the homes. \nThey also said there were more questions to be asked about potential illegal adoptions, including the movement of babies across the border with the Republic of Ireland. \nReligious orders, and the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, have said they will co-operate with the new investigation.\nThere has already been a state inquiry into mother-and-baby homes in the Republic of Ireland. \nCampaigners in Northern Ireland - including the survivors' group Birth Mothers and Their Children For Justice NI - have said the investigation must have the power to compel religious organisations and state agencies to provide records and witnesses.

      "text": "All 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales will be offered a Covid vaccine by the end of the October half-term, the Welsh health minister has said.\nThe rollout is due to gather pace this week with all health boards providing jabs, mostly at mass vaccination centres and others in schools.\nSome of the most vulnerable children have already received the vaccine.\nFamilies have been encouraged to discuss the choice to help make an informed decision.\nLast month the UK's vaccine advisory body JCVI refused to give the green light to vaccinating healthy 12-15 year olds on health grounds alone.\nIt said children were at such a low risk from the virus that jabs would offer only a marginal benefit.\nThe UK's four chief medical officers then said healthy children aged 12 to 15 should be offered one dose of a Covid vaccine as it would help reduce disruption to education.\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said studies showed children were at some risk of developing long Covid despite low hospital admission rates.\n\"Vaccines remain our strongest defence from the virus, helping prevent harm and stopping the spread of Covid-19,\" she said. \n\"Some studies show one in seven children who have been infected with the virus are thought to have also developed long Covid.\n\"We have provided resources and information to help this age group make an informed choice about vaccination. I encourage parents, guardians, children and young people to discuss the vaccination together,\" she said.\nGill Richardson, deputy chief medical officer for vaccines, said: \"We have seen the benefits that come from having as many people as possible vaccinated.\n\"After careful consideration of the evidence, the four UK chief medical officers recommended the vaccination of healthy 12 to 15-year-olds after consultation with experts, such as the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.\n\"They concluded that the health benefits, combined with the additional benefits of reducing educational disruption and effects on mental health meant that vaccination should be offered.\n\"Children and their families will be receiving links to information with their invitation letters so they can make an informed decision about whether or not to have the vaccine,\" she said.\nLast month the chief medical officers agreed a single dose would help to reduce disruption to education.\nThe recommendation that only one dose be given is related to the very rare risk of a condition called myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle.\nThe risk is tiny after one vaccine dose and slightly higher after two, with 12 to 34 cases seen for every one million second doses.\nTheir decision came after the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said there was not enough benefit to warrant it on health grounds alone for most children.\nEithne Hughes, director of the Association for School and College Leaders Cymru, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers schools were already being targeted.\n\"There have been anti-vax campaigners, who are very, very well coordinated, who have made direct threats to head teachers by phone, by letter - confettis of letter with quasi-legal challenges threatening court action and huge fines, fake NHS consent letters to try and trick schools into sending those out to parents with misinformation.\" \nShe said it had caused a \"real upset in the system\".\n\"Let's be really clear about this, the virus is the enemy, not Public Health Wales, not the school, and college leaders are doing their very best to educate learners and get everything back on track again,\" she said.  \n\"So it's deeply disappointing and if these people are listening, I would urge them to desist.\"\nTrefor Jones, head teacher at Ysgol Y Creuddyn in Penrhyn Bay, Conwy, said he had received letters from people opposed to children having a Covid vaccine.\nHe said: \"It is concerning... It does reference various legal processes they want to take, so yes, it is a challenge...\n\"To be targeted in this way is a little disappointing.\""

      "tags": "Apps,Microsoft",
      "text": "Windows 11, the latest version of Microsoft's computer operating system, launches worldwide on Tuesday as a free upgrade for Windows 10 users.\nWindows chief product officer Panos Panay, told the BBC the latest version was built to be \"clean and fresh and simpler\" for the user.\nHe promised that the new operating system would not be an \"extreme departure\" from what people know.\nAnd even the least tech-savvy users can upgrade easily, he added.\n\"I use the frame of my father - he's 89,\" Mr Panay said. \"I'm so excited for him to hit that button and upgrade, you have no idea. \n\"Not because he's my dad - because I just want it to be easy for him.\"\nHe said expert users had already tested it extensively through Window's Insider trial programme and was confident there would be no teething issues, adding the upgrade is \"ready now\".\nWindows 11 has some significant design changes, along with some alterations on how the system works under the hood. \nBy default, the Start menu is centred on screen, along with icons in the taskbar. When clicked on, the Start button opens a menu of frequently used apps.\nIn some ways, it mimics the appearance of a smartphone app menu or launcher. Microsoft has also dropped the \"tiles\" which were present on Windows 10's start menu.\nMr Panay said the team had learned from Windows 8, which got rid of the start menu entirely, upsetting many users.\n\"You learn from that, of course, and then you adapt,\" he said. \nDeveloping Windows 11's interface involved watching how people use their computers - \"what they want to click on, where their eyes are on the machine when they come into our labs,\" he explained. \n\"You get this confidence of learning from history,\" he added. \nFor Windows 11, \"the Start button is right there. It's right in the middle of the screen. It's not gone.\" \nWhen Windows 10 came out, Microsoft declared it would be the \"last version\" of the system. That has obviously changed.\n\"We're in a time where there is a bit of a new era for the PC happening right now,\" Mr Panay said.\n\"I think Windows 11 kind of stamps that moment and it is a signal for that moment.\"\nAcross the operating system, the design favours rounded corners, and has simplified most menus and folder views. And there are new, improved options for arranging windows and \"snapping\" them into grids. \nWidgets, a major selling point of 2007's Windows Vista, also make a comeback - but instead of \"floating\" on the screen where the user puts them, they live in a sidebar on the left, and are also linked to Microsoft services.\nSome changes go deeper than the interface and design. \nSystem integrations for Microsoft Teams - replacing Skype - and the Xbox app both feature heavily in Microsoft's advertising. \nThe Microsoft Store - the Windows version of an app store - has been completely redesigned and will allow third-party apps to sell inside it, without taking a substantial cut. \nAnd one new feature which raised eyebrows in the technology world was that Windows 11 would run Android smartphone apps through the Amazon app store. \nEarly adopters have reported that the in-built search function of the new version is significantly faster on most devices - but also that it favours Microsoft's own services, Bing and the Edge browser, when delivering web results. \nFor gamers, Microsoft promises that its new drive technology - Direct Storage - will lead to much better loading times in games by allowing a graphics card to access storage drives without going through the central processor. \nBut that feature, like some others, needs newer hardware to work. \nAs a result, not every computer will see all the potential advantages to upgrading - and some machines may not be able to upgrade at all. \nThe minimum requirements include a type of security chip - called a TPM - only installed on modern computers.  \n\"If your device does not meet these requirements, you may not be able to install Windows 11 on your device and might want to consider purchasing a new PC,\" Microsoft says. \nThe company has just launched a range of its own new hardware devices to coincide with the new Windows version. \nBut users already running Windows 10 do not need to go to this expense if the computer is still working. Windows 10 will continue to be supported and receive security updates until October 2025. "

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Rishi Sunak,UK economy,Conservative Party Conference,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said there is no \"magic wand\" to make disruption to fuel and food supplies disappear overnight.\nHe told the BBC supply problems were global, and ministers were doing everything they can to mitigate them.\n\"Pragmatic controlled immigration\" could be part of the short-term solution, he said.\nHe was speaking ahead of addressing the Conservative party conference amid concerns over living standards.\nThe Chancellor's first in-person speech to Tory members comes against a backdrop of rising food and energy prices, alongside cuts to universal credit benefits and tax rises to fund the NHS and social care. \nSupply chain issues are continuing to affect several sectors, with the military due to begin driving fuel to petrol stations. \nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Sunak said \"challenges\" to supply chains are not unique to the UK but were a problem across the world as a result of lockdowns and the rapid re-opening of economies.\nBut he said the government was doing \"everything we can to mitigate the bits of that that we can\". \n\"There are things that we can do and should do and it is reasonable that people expect us to do what we can,\" he said. \n\"Whether it's short-term visas, speeding up testing capacity for HGV drivers, of course we should do all those things and we are doing all those things, but we can't wave a magic wand and make global supply chain challenges disappear overnight.\"\nBut he said the problems \"we are seeing at the moment will be transitory and will pass through the system\". \nPM Boris Johnson also insisted supply problems were part of an international trend, telling reporters they were due to the global economy \"coming back to life\" after Covid shutdowns.\n\"There's a shortage of lorry drivers actually around the world,\" he added.\nThe prime minister tried on Sunday to present this as short-term pain as part of what he believes will be very significant long-term gains because of Brexit.\nNow, the prime minister and other ministers would not say, 'oh, suck it up, enjoy the fact that you have to queue for petrol'.\nBut they have, in the last few days, woven this narrative: to take some of the things that we see happening, acutely, whether in agriculture, whether in fuel supply - and to turn them into this story of short-term pain for a long-term gain.\nThat was not Rishi Sunak's language. \nHe talked rather soberly about global supply shortages, things that the government can mitigate, clearly he believes the government does have a role.\nBut he was very different in tone, which was something on the day of a big chancellor's speech at this conference, very well worth noting.\nIn his speech later, Mr Sunak will say the best protection against cost of living challenges is to give people the skills and opportunities to get better paid work.\nThe chancellor will commit \u00a3500m to renew job support programmes and  promise to \"double down\" on help for the jobs market after Covid.\nHe will also promise to reshape the economy around technology and scientific innovation. \nAhead of his speech, Mr Sunak praised the UK's economic recovery but warned the \"job is not done yet\".\n\"At the start of this crisis I made a promise to do whatever it takes, and I'm ready to double down on that promise now as we come out of this crisis,\" he said.\nHe will also promise to make the UK the \"the most exciting place on the planet\" through better infrastructure and improved skills.\nHis speech will come on the second day of conference, and he will say the Kickstart Scheme - which subsidises eligible jobs for young people on universal credit - will be extended by three months to March 2022.\nThe scheme, launched in September last year, was allocated \u00a32bn in funding to create 250,000 jobs by the end of 2021. \nHowever, only 76,900 have actually started Kickstart roles, according  to latest figures, with 196,300 roles in total made available for youngsters to apply for. \nThe Federation of Small Businesses had been calling for the scheme to be extended, amid reports that firms had encountered delays and found the scheme slow.\nMr Sunak will also announce the extension of the JETS scheme to help long-term unemployed people on universal credit until September 2022.\nA separate scheme paying employers \u00a33,000 per apprentice they take on will also be prolonged by four months until the end of January.\nAnd the government is promising more help finding work for those coming off the furlough scheme, which closed last week, having paid the wages of 11.6 million workers during the pandemic. \nThe various extensions will be paid for with \u00a3500m of funding, with the Treasury saying that details will be confirmed at the Spending Review on 27 October.\nLabour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government's plan to support jobs was \"struggling\" and had \"failed to hit its original targets\".\n\"An extended deadline will do nothing to compensate for the chancellor's tax rises, cost of living crisis and cuts to universal credit,\" he added."

      "tags": "Policing,Sarah Everard murder,Metropolitan Police Service,Cressida Dick",
      "text": "An independent review is set to be carried out into the Met Police's standards and culture after the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard.\nCommissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who has rejected calls to resign, said it would be led by a high profile person.\nThe force has faced questions ever since Wayne Couzens, a serving police officer, killed the 33-year-old.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a \"massive job\" to do in restoring women's confidence in the police.\nLast week, Couzens, 48, was jailed for a full-life term for the brutal attack.\nHe abducted the marketing executive in March as she walked home from a friend's house under the guise of an arrest, before raping and killing her. He later burned her body.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Dame Cressida said Ms Everard's murder had made \"everyone in the Met furious and we depend on public trust\".\n\"In this country policing is done by consent and undoubtedly the killing of Sarah and other events has damaged public trust,\" she said, adding she was determined to rebuild it.\nDame Cressida said the review would specifically look into its internal culture and its professional standards such as systems, processes, leadership and training. \nShe also called for a national review of police vetting standards. \nIt comes as Labour raised concerns about checks on parliamentary police in a letter to security officials.\nAn ongoing Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) review of how Couzens became a Met officer has found that vetting procedures missed that two of his previous cars had been linked to allegations of indecent exposure.\nCouzens was known as \"the rapist\" by former colleagues at the Civil Nuclear Constabulary because he made female colleagues feel so uncomfortable, and had been accused of indecent exposure in 2015, and in the days before the murder.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct is now investigating \"offensive and abusive\" sexist messages shared by a WhatsApp group that involved Couzens.\nFormer Met Police detective Paige Kimberley won an employment tribunal against the force last month, after a job offer was withdrawn when she complained about \"vulgar and sexist\" WhatsApp group messages involving police officers.\nMs Kimberley said the group, which did not involve Couzens, was set up to \"facilitate working practices\".\nOver time the comments became \"more sexualised, and more and more derogatory towards women\", she said.\n\"When I was approached to go back to work... I did bring up the WhatsApp group, I did say that it needed to be addressed,\" she said.\n\"And the next day I was told there was no position available for me.\"\nMs Kimberely, who reached the rank of deputy superintendent, said: \"What has really shocked me is that the extent to which the Met fought me, the way the Met have defended this.\n\"They clearly do think it's okay.\"\nBaroness Nuala O'Loan, whose inquiry into Daniel Morgan's murder concluded that the Met was \"institutionally corrupt\", said the murder of Ms Everard raised similar issues.\nShe said: \"We said that in their failure to be honest, for reputational reason, the conduct of senior officers of the Metropolitan Police, and of the institution, was corrupt. It was all about protecting the Met.\n\"Can you trust when you don't see actions to address the problems which you've pointed out to them?\"\nDame Cressida said: \"I absolutely recognise the grave level of public concerns and the need to take urgent action.\n\"I hope the announcement today of an independent person to work with us helps demonstrate how seriously we take this and our commitment to making the changes needed.\" \nWhen asked if she offered to resign, Dame Cressida said: \"People will be entitled to their opinion. I've got a job to do, I'm getting on with it. My job now is to lead the Met.\" \nEarlier, the prime minister rejected calls for an immediate public inquiry from the chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Yvette Cooper, who said there should be one into the vetting process used by the Met Police when recruiting officers.\nMr Johnson said the investigations by the Met and police watchdog should be allowed to proceed.\nHe added although the government was investing in CCTV and street lighting, the culture of policing had to change and that more women should be recruited as police officers.\n\"I want to be clear, I believe people should be confident in the police,\" he said. \n\"I believe police officers, men and women up and down the country, will be absolutely sickened by what has happened, and they will be doing everything they can, and I know they do everything they can to help and reassure the public. So, it is vital that the public trust the police.\""

      "tags": "UK economy,Fuel,Haulage",
      "text": "One in five forecourts in London and the south-east of England is still without fuel, the body that represents independent fuel sellers has said.\nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there had been a \"marked improvement\" across the rest of the UK thanks to \"steady deliveries\".\nBut conditions in the South East are \"still challenging\", the PRA said.\nThe improvement in supplies has led to forecourt firm EG Group to remove its \u00a330 cap on buying fuel at its sites.\nIt said purchases were returning to normal levels in the majority of places, apart from the south of England.\nHowever, the company, which has about 400 sites in the UK, added it expected supply issues to ease \"in the coming days\" due to the military driving tankers to restore supplies.\nAbout 200 servicemen and women from the Army and RAF have been drafted in to deliver fuel from depots to forecourts.\nThe PRA said the situation around London and the South East was \"still challenging\". In these areas, it said 62% of the sites surveyed had both grades of fuel available, 18% had only one grade and 20% were dry.\nIn the rest of the country, the trade body said 86% of sites had both grades of fuel \"thanks to steady deliveries and stabilising demand\", with 6% having only one grade and 8% being dry.\n\"We are grateful for the support lent by the government through their provision of military drivers, although further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas,\" said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA.\nThe PRA represents the interests of the independent filling stations across the UK, which account for nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,380 forecourts.\nThe government has been criticised for not deploying the military earlier after panic-buying led to chaos and queues on some petrol station forecourts.\nMore than 65 drivers will start work, with plans to increase this to 200 personnel to be deployed in total, including 100 drivers.\nThe drivers have undertaken refresher training with the fuel delivery firm, Hoyer in order to take on the work.\nHoyer said the training included company safety procedures as well as equipment familiarisation and forecourt driving manoeuvres. \nA government spokesperson said there were signs of improvement in average forecourt stocks across the UK, adding that demand was \"continuing to stabilise\".  \n\"More than half of those who have completed training to make fuel deliveries are being deployed to terminals serving London and the South-East of England, demonstrating that the sector is allocating drivers to areas most affected in this first phase from Monday,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe crisis began more than 10 days ago when BP said it had run out of petrol in a number of its outlets. That prompted motorists to fill up more than usual, leaving deliveries unable to keep up with demand. \nMany sectors of the UK economy, including food firms and petrol retailers, have been affected by a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit, an aging workforce, and tax changes.\nDavid Charman, who runs Parkfoot Garage in West Malling in Kent, told the BBC's Today programme there was a big task ahead to restore supplies.\n\"This is not panic-buying anymore, this is people that have waited as long as they possibly can and now they have no fuel. We're having to push cars that are in the queue to get to our site because they've run out of fuel,\" he said.\n\"We didn't have the normal two days of stock underground... because of Covid but we were still managing the situation perfectly well. But now, when we're all empty, it needs a huge influx of fuel deliveries to everybody, not just to me, to ensure that we can get through this.\"\nAre you affected by issues covered in this story?

      "tags": "Conservative Party,Rishi Sunak,Conservative Party Conference",
      "text": "Rishi Sunak has told Conservative party members that future tax cuts are conditional on repairing the UK's public finances after Covid.\nIn his first conference speech as chancellor, he said he wanted lower taxes - but funding the pandemic recovery \"comes with a cost\".\nVowing that \"we need to fix our public finances\", he said allowing borrowing to rise further would be \"immoral\".\nThe comments come three weeks before his autumn Budget on 27 October. \nHe also told party delegates that leaving the EU was in the UK's long-term interests, despite current disruption to fuel and food supplies.\nAnd he added he was \"proud\" to have backed Brexit, in spite of warnings before the 2016 referendum it could end his political career.\nMr Sunak's speech comes amid a difficult backdrop of rising food and energy prices, alongside supply chain disruption caused by a shortage of lorry drivers.\nThe government has so far rejected demands from the haulage industry for it to increase the 5,000 temporary visas it plans for foreign drivers to plug shortfalls. \nIn his speech, Mr Sunak insisted that despite \"challenges\", Brexit would foster a \"culture of enterprise\" and help the UK adapt to the modern world.\nHe also defended raising taxes to pay for the NHS and social care, insisting that it would be \"irresponsible\" to pay for investment with higher borrowing instead. \nHe told delegates the country should be grateful for \"sound Conservative management\" of the economy by his predecessors since 2010. \nAnd whilst he acknowledged tax rises were unpopular and perceived as \"un-Conservative\", he said they were a better option than more debt.\n\"I'll tell you what is un-Conservative: Unfunded pledges, reckless borrowing, and soaring debt,\" he added. \n\"Yes, I want tax cuts. But in order to do that, our public finances must be put back on a sustainable footing.\"\nThere was no whizz-bangery in the chancellor's speech - no cranking of the huge economic levers on tax or spending, no huge headline grabbing policy.\nAnd, a little like Rishi Sunak himself, it was quite short.\n(He made a little joke about his stature himself...)\nThis felt like the first draft of Sunak-ism: where the chancellor has come from, what he's all about, where he might go in the future, to an audience where many will wonder if he might one day be prime minister.\nThere were repeated references to his time in California, that spot so often associated with sunshine and innovation.\nAfter the public spending splurges of the pandemic, he portrayed himself as a traditional Conservative: cautious in how taxpayers' money is spent, drawn to cut taxes when he can - even though he's put them up.\nThis hoodie-wearing chancellor - although he did wear a suit for his speech - made 16 references to the \"future,\" including the line \"the future is here.\"\nWhom could he have been referring to?\nAgainst the backdrop of the withdrawal of a \u00a320-a-week universal credit top-up, Mr Sunak also attacked Labour - which opposes the cut - for wanting struggling families to \"lean ever more on the state\".\n\"Is the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits?,\" he asked, adding: \"Be in no doubt, that is the essence of the Labour answer\".\n\"Not only does Labour's approach not work in practice, it is a desperately sad vision for our future.\"\n\"But there is an alternative. An approach focused on good work, better skills, and higher wages.\"\nMr Sunak also announced the government would give funding to double the number of Turing research fellows investigating the potential of artificial intelligence. \nHe also committed \u00a3500m to renew job support programmes set up during the Covid pandemic, after the end of the furlough scheme last month.\nThe Kickstart Scheme - which subsidises eligible jobs for young people on universal credit - will be extended by three months to March 2022.\nAnd the JETS scheme, which helps long-term unemployed people on universal credit, will be prolonged until September 2022.\nThe Treasury said that details will be confirmed at the Spending Review, which will take place alongside the Budget later this month.

      "tags": "Facebook,Social media regulation debate",
      "text": "A former Facebook whistleblower responsible for a series of bombshell leaks has revealed her identity. \nFrances Haugen, 37, who worked as a product manager on the civic integrity team at Facebook, was interviewed on Sunday by CBS.\nShe said the documents she leaked proved that Facebook repeatedly prioritised \"growth over safety\".\nFacebook said the leaks were misleading and glossed over positive research conducted by the company. \nIn the interview, on CBS's 60 Minutes programme, Ms Haugen said she had left Facebook earlier this year after becoming exasperated with the company. Before departing, she copied a series of internal memos and documents.\nShe shared those documents with the Wall Street Journal, which has been releasing the material in batches over the last three weeks - sometimes referred to as the Facebook Files.\nRevelations included documents that showed that celebrities, politicians and high profile Facebook users were treated differently by the company. The leaks revealed that moderation policies were applied differently, or not at all, to such accounts - a system known as XCheck (cross-check).\nAnother leak showed that Facebook was also facing a complex lawsuit from a group of its own shareholders.\nThe group alleges, among other things, that Facebook's $5bn (\u00a33.65bn) payment to the US Federal Trade Commission to resolve the Cambridge Analytica data scandal was so high because it was designed to protect Mark Zuckerberg from personal liability.\nBut it's allegations about Instagram that have been particularly worrying to US politicians.\nInternal research by Facebook (which owns Instagram) found that Instagram was impacting the mental health of teenagers but did not share its findings when they suggested that the platform was a \"toxic\" place for many youngsters.\nAccording to slides reported by the Wall Street Journal, 32% of teenage girls surveyed said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.\nMs Haugen will testify before a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday in a hearing titled \"Protecting Kids Online\", about the company's research into Instagram's effect on the mental health of young users.\nLast week, a Facebook executive testified to US senators that the leaks had failed to highlight the positive impact the platform had on teens. \nHowever, Ms Haugen was damning in her assessment of her former employer. \n\"There were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,\" she said. \n\"Facebook over and over again chose to optimise for its own interests, like making more money.\"\nFacebook strongly denied that claim, saying it had spent significant sums of money on safety.\"To say we turn a blind eye to feedback ignores these investments, including the 40,000 people working on safety and security at Facebook and our investment of $13 billion (\u00a39.6 billion) since 2016,\" said Lena Pietsch, Facebook's director of policy communications.\nMs Haugen also talked about the deadly Capitol Hill riots in January - claiming that Facebook helped fuel the violence. \nShe said Facebook turned on safety systems to reduce misinformation during the US election - but only temporarily.\n\"As soon as the election was over they turned them back off, or they changed the settings to what they were before, to prioritise growth over safety, and that really feels like a betrayal of democracy.\" \nAppearing on CNN, Vice President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg said it was ludicrous to suggest Facebook was responsible for the riots. \n\"I think it gives people false comfort to assume that there must be a technological, or technical, explanation for the issues of political polarisation in the United States,\" he said."

      "tags": "Edinburgh",
      "text": "An Edinburgh woman who was assaulted in the street when she was a teenager has discovered her assailant went on to attack two others. \nJenna Pike was 16 when a man approached her from behind, attacked her and squeezed her throat until she started to black out. \nNine years later, advances in DNA technology have linked her attack to two others. \nThe man went on to sexually assault one woman and rape another in 2015.\nMs Pike has waived her anonymity in a bid to help trace the man responsible for the attacks. \nShe told BBC Scotland she was coming home from a party in the early hours of 28 October 2012 when she heard someone behind her.\nShe said: \"It was the road I walk home all the time. I became aware of a man about six feet behind me. \n\"Thinking I was just blocking the road, I stepped aside and I guess I ruined his plan to surprise me.\n\"The next thing I knew he had spun me round, pulled me to the ground and put his hands around my throat trapping my arms and my hands so I couldn't pull him off me and started putting pressure on my neck to the point where I was blacking out.\"\nShe was not sexually assaulted but since then has been unable to walk alone day or night. No one has ever been charged for the crime.\nNow in her 20s, she considers herself \"lucky\" her attacker suddenly stopped and ran off.\nEarlier this year, police in the capital made social media appeals for information as part of a renewed investigation into the 2015 incidents.\nA 21-year-old woman was sexually assaulted in Craiglockhart Quadrant on 5 August that year and, just over three weeks later, a 19-year-old woman was raped in the Newmills Road area.\nJenna Pike was attacked in Colinton Road. All three are in the south-west of Edinburgh.\nAfter seeing the appeals, Ms Pike contacted police.\nShe said: \"I read it and just thought this area is similar, the situation with it being a lone female and then one male and I thought the age and description was so similar and I thought I might waste someone's time - but I might not.\n\"It turned out they hadn't made that connection and it subsequently was the same male who had committed a further two assaults.\"\nIn the wake of the sentencing of Sarah Everard's killer, Wayne Couzens and public anger surrounding her murder, Ms Pike is asking women to come forward if they have experienced similar attacks in a bid to trace her attacker.\n\"I want to encourage anybody else who has been in a similar situation to phone in, check and make sure it isn't the same person. If you didn't report it then, report it now,\" she said.\n\"It helps us get an understanding of what this guy's been up to. Two-and-a-bit years is a long time to not have done anything and it makes me really concerned whether he has gone on to do more. Because it is definitely an escalation from what happened to me to his last attack.\"\nShe is concerned that other women could also have been victims of his who have not come forward.\nShe said: \"I wasn't affected as badly as the other two women. I guess I will never know if that was his end goal or whether he was just seeing how far he could push a human but I was let go of, he let me go and he walked back up the road like nothing had happened.\"\nShe made this appeal: \"Maybe there's a niggle in the back of your mind, someone has said something to you at some point that didn't quite click then, but is making you think about it now. Maybe a family member you know wasn't always around in the middle of the night as he seemed to enjoy a late-night walk and just women in general if something has happened to you whether you think it's related to this or not, report it now. \n\"It makes me annoyed more so that he has lived his life scot-free. He is not worried. It makes me concerned that he could be in a relationship, he could have a child even. He is capable of anything.\nDetectives have a full DNA profile of the suspect thanks to more sensitive testing systems and the ability to test smaller amounts of material. Samples taken at the time were retested and the 2012 attack was linked to the two three years later. His profile has not been matched on any databases so far.\nDet Insp Jon Pleasance, the investigating officer for the renewed inquiries, said: \"I want to sincerely thank Jenna for bravely speaking out.\n\"Using advanced DNA technology we've been able to review the forensics from Jenna's case and determine that these attacks are all linked.\n\"It's incredibly concerning that the man responsible was targeting lone women as far back as 2012, especially given what we know now.\n\"It leads me to believe, due the proximity of these incidents, that the answer may very well lie in the local community. \n\"Anyone who can help is strongly asked to come forward, no matter how small the information or their concerns may seem. We have the ability to very quickly rule people out of our investigation.\"\nThose with information can contact Police Scotland or pass tips anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."

      "tags": "Caernarfon,Bus travel,UK driving licence,Haulage",
      "text": "A lack of examiners is largely to blame for the UK shortage of HGV drivers, a lorry driving instructor has said.\nSteven Flynn, who runs Carmel Driving School in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, said he has dozens of drivers waiting to take their tests.\nWaiting times and delayed paper work contributed to the \"heart-breaking\" situation, he said.\nThe Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency said it was \"tackling this issue through increasing testing\".\nThe shortage of HGV drivers is due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors, and has led to growing concerns about deliveries of food and fuel.\nFor Mr Flynn, the problem is there are not enough examiners available to book tests. \n\"There hasn't been an investment in examiners in the last few years and the pandemic hasn't helped either... but they could do a lot more than what they actually are doing,\" he said.\n\"We've got in excess of at least 30 to 35 people waiting to go for their tests. We have enough vehicles, we have enough instructors, but we simply don't have the tests.\"\nMr Flynn said that after spring's lockdown, some of his drivers had to wait three months to book a test.\nAlthough the situation has now \"massively improved\", he said the waiting times are still \"too long\", claiming more examiners would have helped.\n\"We have built brand-new facilities here and all we would need is an examiner to come,\" he said.\n\"The test centre is just around the corner - which they're proposing to close - and some of the days there aren't any examiners there, simply because of the lack of investment in examiners.\"\nMr Flynn said he cannot expand the business and employ more instructors until more tests become available.\nHe also said booking tests online was not always possible, and it was \"heart-breaking\" spending up to two hours every day on hold, trying to book by phone.\nWhile testing is covered by the DVSA, Mr Flynn said waiting for documentation was also a serious problem, with \"paperwork taking weeks and weeks\" to come back from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).\nAndrew Lloyd, national officer for the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said the DVLA must take responsibility.\nHe said: \"If there is anyone waiting for their driver's licence from DVLA, just to let you know PCS asked DVLA management a number of months ago now to prioritise key workers' driver's licences and correspondence. That would include lorry drivers. DVLA have not even bothered to respond to their trade union. This crisis is on the DVLA management.\"\nA DVLA spokesman said there were no delays in processing HGV provisional licence applications which were currently being issued in about five days, adding: \"We are looking at ways to speed up this process even further.\" \nHe added: \"More complex transactions, for example if medical investigations are needed as part of a driving licence application, may face longer delays.\n\"We have made it a priority to process provisional and vocational HGV licences as quickly as possible.\"\nIn the Conwy Valley, Llew Jones Coaches has had to suspend part of one of its bus routes \"due to a lack of driving staff\".\nSteve Jones, managing director, said Covid had seen an increase in the number of drivers retiring from the industry and \"so very few new people have come into the industry\" due to limited training in that period. \nMr Jones said they were \"running about 10 drivers short of where we would want to be\" and called for a simpler process of acquiring a test and dealing with the governing agencies.\n\"We need to reduce the red tape and get people through quicker,\" he said.\nThe DVSA said it recognised the haulage industry fuels the economy and had \"listened to its concerns about the current lorry driver shortage\".\n\"We have responded by doing all we can to support the industry in tackling this issue through increasing lorry driver testing,\" it said.\nCurrent waiting times for vocational tests were on average 3.3 weeks, compared with a pre-Covid rate of 2.7 weeks.\nAnd 3,000 vocational tests were being done a week, compared with 2,000 pre-Covid, the DVSA said."

      "tags": "Depression,Mental health,California",
      "text": "An electrical implant that sits in the skull and is wired to the brain can detect and treat severe depression, US scientists believe after promising results with a first patient. \nSarah, who is 36, had the device fitted more than a year ago and says it has turned her life around. \nThe matchbox-sized pack in her head is always \"on\" but only delivers an impulse when it senses she may need it. \nThe experimental study is described in Nature Medicine journal. \nThe researchers, from University of California, San Francisco, stress it is too soon to say if it might help other patients, like Sarah, with hard-to-treat depression, but they are hopeful and plan more trials. \nSarah is the first person to have had the experimental therapy. \nShe'd had a succession of failed treatments, including anti-depressants and electroconvulsive therapy in recent years. \nThe surgery may sound daunting, but Sarah said the prospect of gaining \"any kind of relief\" was better than the darkness she had been experiencing.\n\"I had exhausted all possible treatment options. \n\"My daily life had become so restricted. I felt tortured each day. I barely moved or did anything.\"\nThe surgery involved drilling small holes in her skull to fit the wires that would monitor and stimulate her brain. \nThe box, containing the battery and the pulse generator, was tucked into the bone, beneath her scalp and hair.\nThe procedure took a full working day and was done under general anaesthetic, meaning Sarah was unconscious throughout. \nSarah says when she woke, up she felt euphoric. \n\"When the implant was first turned on, my life took an immediate upward turn. My life was pleasant again. \n\"Within a few weeks, the suicidal thoughts disappeared. \n\"When I was in the depths of depression all I saw is what was ugly.\"\nA year on, Sarah remains well, with no side-effects.\n\"The device has kept my depression at bay, allowing me to return to my best self and rebuild a life worth living.\"\nShe can't feel the device as it fires, but says: \"I could probably tell you within 15 minutes that it has gone off because of a sense of alertness and energy or the positivity I will feel.\"\nResearcher Dr Katherine Scangos, who is a psychiatrist at the university, said the innovation was made possible by locating the \"depression circuits\" in Sarah's brain. \n\"We found one location, which is an area called the ventral striatum, where stimulation consistently eliminated her feelings of depression. \n\"And we also found a brain activity area in the amygdala that could predict when her symptoms were most severe.\"\nThe scientists say a lot more research is needed to test the experimental therapy and determine if it can help more people with severe depression, and perhaps other conditions too. \nDr Scangos, who has enrolled two other patients in the trial and hopes to recruit nine more, said: \"We need to look at how these circuits vary across patients and repeat this work multiple times. \n\"And we need to see whether an individual's biomarker or brain circuit changes over time as the treatment continues.\n\"We didn't know if we were going to be able to treat her depression at all because it was so severe. \n\"So in that sense we are really excited about this. It's so needed in the field right now.\"\nDr Edward Chang, the neurosurgeon who fitted the device, said: \"To be clear, this is not a demonstration of efficacy of this approach. \n\"It's really just the first demonstration of this working in someone and we have a lot of work ahead of us as a field to validate these results to see if this actually is something that will be enduring as a treatment option.\"\nProf Jonathan Roiser, a neuroscience expert at University College London in the UK, said: \"Although this kind of highly invasive surgical procedure would only ever be used in the most severe patients with intractable symptoms, it is an exciting step forward due to the bespoke nature of the stimulation. \n\"It is likely that if trialled in other patients, different recording and stimulation sites would be required, as the precise brain circuitry underlying symptoms probably varies between individuals. \n\"As there was only one patient and no control condition, it remains to be seen whether these promising results hold in clinical trials.\""

      "text": "A man who raped a woman in a city centre park has been given a 15-year extended sentence.\nTyler Higgins, of Brithdir Street in Cathays, Cardiff, pleaded guilty to two counts of rape in the city's Bute Park.\nCardiff Crown Court heard the attack happened during the early hours of 15 July.\nHiggins, 20, was jailed for 10 years and will spend five years on licence because of his risk of causing serious harm to the public.\nThe court heard he \"confused, disorientated and took advantage\" of his victim, who was enjoying a night out with friends.\nJudge David Wynn Morgan described the rape as \"cold-blooded\" and said the victim \"thought she was going to die\".\nIn a victim impact statement, the woman said the rape left her \"scared of doing anything\" by herself.\nCardiff Crown Court heard the victim was visiting the city with friends and staying in a hotel near Queen Street.\nAfter visiting some bars, she went to a house party in Cathays with a friend.\nUpon leaving, the woman stopped on Cathays Terrace and asked Higgins for directions to her hotel.\nCCTV showed him walking in one direction before changing direction after spotting the woman.\nMatthew Roberts, prosecuting, said Higgins walked with the woman at 02:44 BST and told her the hotel was 10 minutes away.\nFurther CCTV evidence revealed he took her away from the city centre and towards the entrance of Bute Park, near the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.\nMr Roberts said Higgins told the woman there was a short cut, at which point the victim \"felt uncomfortable\" and thought \"something bad\" was going to happen.\nIn the park, Higgins stepped in front her and asked her for a kiss, but she refused and said she wanted to get back to her hotel.\nAs the pair approached an exit on to Castle Street, Mr Roberts said this was the last opportunity for Higgins to rape the woman.\nHiggins put his hand around her neck and \"slammed\" her to the floor. He was too strong for her she was unable to fight him off, the court heard.\nMr Roberts said Higgins' victim \"thought she was going to die\" and tried to speak \"but no words came out\".\n\"She again tried to push the defendant off with her hands and tried to pull his hair,\" he added\n\"It was clear that she could not overpower the defendant at all, so in fact she pretended that what he did was OK. It patently wasn't.\"\nHiggins giggled as he raped his victim, the court heard, and apologised after the attack, saying he \"sometimes gets like that\".\nThe victim suffered injuries to her body in the attack, which Higgins initially denied when he was arrested. \nHe admitted rape once he was shown DNA evidence.\nThe woman said she used to be \"sociable, a happy and positive person,\" but now feels \"completely different\".\nShe said recently she was watching TV when she had a flashback.\n\"I immediately felt dirty and felt a lot of sadness and felt emotional,\" she said.\n\"This is something I cannot control. I immediately overthink and question myself about the incident and whether there's anything I could have done to stop it.\n\"The visions make me feel as though I don't have any freedom. Making me feel trapped in my thoughts.\"\nHashim Salmman, defending, said Higgins was an only child and made to leave home by his step-father at 16. \nHis relationship with his mother had broken down and his client was remorseful and had \"strong feelings of regret and shame\".\n\"He has caused untold damage and he wishes he could take back what he did,\" Mr Salmman said.\nJudge Wynn Morgan said Higgins treated the young woman \"as an object\".\n\"The victim was alone, unaware of her geography, confused and intoxicated,\" he said.\n\"So far as culpability is concerned there was a significant degree of planning, indeed almost cunning.\""

I instinctively moved away, looking back at Robin Thicke,\" she writes.\nThe model said she felt \"humiliation pump through [her] body\".\nRatajkowski appeared in the video alongside Thicke, singer Pharrell Williams and rapper TI.\nThe video's director, Diane Martel, told the Sunday Times that she recalled the alleged incident.\n\"I remember the moment that he grabbed her breasts. He was standing behind her as they were both in profile,\" she was quoted as saying.\nThe director said Thicke later apologised.\nBlurred Lines topped charts around the world, becoming the UK's most-downloaded song of all time in 2014.\nBut its lyrics and music video have been criticised by some who claimed they referred to non-consensual sex. Pharrell later admitted he was \"embarrassed\" by the lyrics.\nThicke has defended the video, telling the BBC in 2013 his critics didn't \"get\" the song.\nAnd in 2015, he told the New York Times that the lyrics were not intended to have sexual connotations. \"I have never and would never write a song with any negative connotation like that,\" he said."

      "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. \nChancellor Rishi Sunak will use his Conservative Party conference speech to commit \u00a3500m to renewing job support schemes introduced as part of the pandemic response. The \u00a32bn Kickstart Scheme - subsidising eligible jobs for young people on universal credit - will be extended to March. Programmes to help long-term unemployed people on universal credit and to pay employers \u00a33,000 per apprentice taken on will also be extended. Labour says it will not compensate for tax rises, a raised cost of living crisis and universal credit cuts.\nSimplified travel rules announced weeks ago have come into force in the UK, with the traffic-light system replaced by a single red list. It means most fully vaccinated travellers arriving from non-red list countries will no longer have to take a test before setting off for the UK, although those coming from red list destinations must still pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days.\nAll 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales will be offered a Covid vaccine by the end of the October half-term, Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan says. The rollout is due to gather pace this week with all health boards providing jabs, mostly at mass vaccination centres and others in schools.\nWhile Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he's not prepared to \"pause\" the requirement for care staff in England to be fully vaccinated by 11 November, a row is raging in the US over mandatory jabs for certain workers. With a legal battle looming in Florida, we hear from those arguing for both personal freedom and public health.\nIf you live in Northern Ireland, it could be time to treat yourself. The first 100,000 Spend Local cards - worth \u00a3100 - are being posted to applicants to the high street voucher scheme. More than 970,000 people have applied for the cards, which the Northern Ireland Executive's Economy Minister Gordon Lyons says will \"deliver the timely boost\" businesses need to help them emerge from the pandemic.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page. \nThe rules on international travel have been updated today, with \"traffic-light\" system being replaced.

      "title": "Morrisons chair promises 'good Christmas' for shoppers",
      "tags": "Companies,Morrisons,Retailing,Supermarkets",
      "text": "The chairman of supermarket chain Morrisons has insisted the supermarket will be able to deliver a \"good\" Christmas for customers despite supply chain issues.\nAndy Higginson said he was \"not worried\" about logistical issues with supermarkets supplying products. \nHe said the issues were \"well publicised\" and \"slightly overblown\".\nHis comments come just two days after US private equity firm CD&R won an auction to buy Morrisons.\nThe \u00a37bn ($9.5bn) bid for the UK's fourth-largest supermarket chain from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) just trumped an offer from rival suitor Fortress.\nThe takeover will mark a return to the UK grocery sector for Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, who is a senior adviser to CD&R.\nThere has been speculation that Mr Leahy will become the new chairman of Morrisons, as Mr Higginson will stand down from his post once the deal with CD&R is completed. \nMorrisons owns a quarter of its suppliers, including fisheries and meat production operations, and Mr Higginson said that was one of the reasons the private equity firm had found the business attractive.\n\"Private equity gets a bit of a bad rap sometimes,\" Mr Higginson said. \nHe added that private equity is \"focused on growth and trying to grow businesses - it's the way they make returns... and that's very much the case here\". \nThe supermarket chain has arrangements with 2,700 British farmers, who deliver livestock and produce directly to its 17 food processing facilities, which supply 493 stores.\n\"Supply chains in the UK are incredibly efficient and I'm sure we'll be able to deliver a great Christmas for customers as we go through,\" Mr Higginson added. \n\"I think it'll be a good Christmas for people, I think they'll want to treat themselves\". \nRewind to the start of the summer, and the supermarket chain Morrisons is a stock market plodder, a company to be invested in for its healthy dividend rather than any hope of a big rise in the share price. It's a British supermarket, and we all know that the UK grocery market is fiercely competitive with big players that are well-entrenched and little hope of rapid growth.\nThat was the orthodoxy, and the events of the past four months have made it look a little silly. Then, Morrisons shares hovered around 180p. On Saturday, a private-equity-led consortium won an auction to buy the company at 287p a share. Those fund managers who dismissed Morrison's prospects and chose not to own the shares have missed out on a pound-a-share payday.\nWhat did the City miss? According to Andy Higginson, Morrison's outgoing chairman - like the company's other non-executive directors, he will leave when the deal is completed - the Square Mile's fund managers could not see the \"inherent strength\" of the chain, which owns many of its store freeholds, has its own food production assets, and a pension scheme in surplus.\nMr Higginson said Morrisons was not alone in having been undervalued, describing it as a \"sector problem\". That idea that supermarkets in general are neglected by the City raises the intriguing prospect that other chains may find themselves being wooed by private investor groups.\nLast month, the supermarket warned that it expected the UK's lorry driver shortage to push up prices this year. It said the lack of drivers, plus higher freight charges and commodity prices, could lead to higher prices.\nHowever, it also said it would seek to mitigate those and other potential cost increases, such as any incurred in maintaining good product availability.\nMorrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The group has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff.\nThe business was founded by William Morrison, and his son, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for 50 years. "

      "title": "Furlough scheme ends with almost 1 million left in limbo",
      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Employment,UK economy,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "The furlough scheme closes on Thursday, with uncertainty ahead for people who have not yet fully returned to work.\nNearly one million workers were expected to be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation.\nOf those on furlough in late July, about half on the scheme were able to work some of the time, the HMRC says.\nSince the start of the pandemic, it has helped pay the wages of 11.6 million workers.\nBut many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment as it ends.\nThe chancellor said he was \"immensely proud\" of the near \u00a370bn scheme, but now was the right time to close it, despite calls for further support from some badly-hit companies. \nThe travel sector has suffered more than most during the pandemic, with businesses being affected by changing restrictions and lower consumer confidence.\nMark Andrew, the director of Animal Aircare, which helps pets travel overseas via Gatwick Airport, said some of his staff may be made redundant if business does not improve.\nThe firm has not yet had to lay off staff, which Mr Andrew said was \"purely down to furlough\".\n\"Furlough ending means there's a real question mark for our business. We're still waiting for Gatwick to pick up... it seems the airline industry is not buoyant enough yet,\" he said.\nAlthough the end of the scheme comes amid a record number of job vacancies, Fidelity International's investment director, Maike Currie, told the BBC that \"no-one really knows what is next\".\n\"I think what we can be certain of is that we'll see under-employment, where employees return to work but possibly not on a full-time basis and that they might need to supplement their income.\"\nFurlough was introduced in March 2020 after Covid-19 forced large parts of the UK economy to close.\nOfficially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it saw the government pay towards the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nAt first it paid 80% of their usual wage, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%.\nThere have been big recruitment drives for hospitality staff, HGV drivers and warehouse workers as businesses get back on their feet.\nLatest official figures show the UK's economy grew by 5.5% between April and June - revised up from the initial estimate of 4.8%.\nThe uplift was largely driven by household spending rebounding after lockdowns, although many firms are now being held back by current labour shortages.\n\"Any hope that the end of the furlough scheme might be the magic wand to solve the supply chain crisis is likely to be wishful thinking,\" said Susannah Streeter, from Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThere is likely to be a big mismatch of skills and experience between those leaving the furlough scheme and the jobs on offer, she added.\nChief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke told the BBC: \"We think there are probably two million fewer people unemployed than would have been the case if this scheme hadn't been introduced. \n\"I think it's done an enormous amount to shield our economy and our society from the worst of Covid.\"\nThe scheme has also been praised by the Resolution Foundation think tank as a \"great success\".\nIts senior economist Dan Tomlinson said furlough had been \"as critical to fighting the Covid crisis as nationalising the banks was to fighting the global financial crisis\".\nBut the foundation's recent research suggested that a small rise in unemployment was a \"real risk\" for those still on the scheme as it ends, particularly older workers or those in the travel sector.\nWhen the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme started, it was described as a bridge over the pandemic uncertainty. \nIt has succeeded in keeping the official unemployment numbers at less than half pre-pandemic expectation. For that reason it has proven value for money, despite costing over \u00a368bn.\nBut there is now some uncertainty over the fate of the million or so workers still having their wages subsidised. \nNew analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies points to regional differences, with London workers for example the most likely still to be furloughed. Older workers are also disproportionately still on the scheme.\nIndustries that are yet to return to normal, such as the airport sector, had called for the scheme to be kept in some form. Unions also argue that the UK should follow Germany in maintaining a form of the scheme for future crises. \nCertainly a precedent has been set in that the government is willing to spend billions on wage increases if large-scale increases in unemployment are avoided. \nAlthough a million vacancies do not map on to the same number still on furlough, it is clear that many industries are having to welcome back more furloughed workers. Partly out of fear of being caught out by worker shortages later down the line.\nFor many of those returning to work, conditions will not be the same as pre-pandemic.\nJess Pitman was furloughed from her job as marketing manager at a travel firm two weeks after the scheme was introduced.\nThe company she works for specialises in organising trips abroad to raise money for charities, but travellers cancelled their plans when Covid hit.\nThe firm's payroll has been reduced from 27 to just five and the 29-year-old will return to work part-time, topping up her income with freelance work.\n\"I feel really torn about the end of furlough, and I'm really sad for the travel industry as a whole,\" Jess said.\n\"I know a lot of people in the industry will be made redundant... I think we'll lose a lot of talented people, which is really disappointing.\"\nA spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) warned that companies in the sector still face \"extreme difficulties\" because of continued travel restrictions.\nAbta called for sector-specific support for smaller firms in particular, who have lost two summers of sales, as well as those which specialise in destinations still subject to red list rules.\n\"The government needs to look at how it can support these businesses... through a package of tailored financial support,\" the spokesperson added.\nElsewhere, the Federation of Small Businesses also cited concerns over a \"colder environment\" for business.\nEmployers and workers alike will have to cope with the end of the furlough scheme, as well as the scrapping of an incentive for hiring apprentices, rising energy bills and the planned cut to Universal Credit in October.\nHowever, the Treasury said generous support was being provided through its \"Plan for Jobs\", which it said was part of a \u00a3400bn spending package.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said he was \"immensely proud of the furlough scheme, and even more proud of UK workers and businesses whose resolve has seen us through an immensely difficult time\".\nAre you using the furlough scheme?

      "tags": "Companies,Media,United States,Broadcasting",
      "text": "In an about-turn, the scandal-hit US media firm Ozy Media has re-launched just days after it shut itself down.\nBoss Carlos Watson told broadcaster NBC that the firm was \"open for business\" again and this was its \"Lazarus moment\" - referring to the biblical character brought back to life by Jesus.  \nOzy shut on Friday after reports its co-founder had deceived potential investors during a conference call.\nMajor advertisers cut ties and its chairman Marc Lasry stepped down.\nOn Monday, Mr Watson told NBC that the previous week had been \"traumatic\" and \"heartbreaking\".\nHowever, he said the media firm had a change of heart: \"Over the weekend we spoke to advertising partners, we talked to our readers, our viewers our investors. \n\"I think Ozy is part of this moment. I think what we do... has a place.\"\nLaunched in California in 2013, Ozy Media produces left-leaning podcasts, television series and events. The firm has won an Emmy for its work.\nIn late September, the New York Times reported that co-founder Samir Rao impersonated a senior leader at YouTube during a conference call with Goldman Sachs in February. At that point the investment bank was considering making a $40m investment in the media company.\nMr Rao reportedly claimed that Ozy's videos were highly popular on YouTube.\nAccording to the Times, the investors realised something was wrong and did not go through with the deal. Mr Watson later apologised and Mr Rao was allowed to stay at the firm. \nAmid growing scrutiny last week, Ozy began an internal investigation and Mr Rao took a leave of absence.\nIt prompted veteran journalist Katty Kay - who joined Ozy in June after 30 years at the BBC - to quit, followed by Mr Lasry. Ford and Ally Financial cut ties with the media firm, amongst other advertisers. \nMr Watson told NBC that what Mr Rao had done was \"sad\" and \"wrong\". \nHe accepted that it was a \"fair question\" as to whether people would be able to trust him again as chief executive. The latest scandal is just one in a long string of allegations that has emerged, including claims the firm inflated its audience figures. \nMr Watson said he had been given \"incredibly bad advice\" last week \"to go silent\", when he should have engaged with the press. \nAs a result, he said \"half truths\", inaccuracies and \"cheap shots\" were reported in the media and that Ozy was not a \"house of cards\".\nMr Watson added Ozy intended to \"own\" the mistakes that had come to light around its use of data and marketing. \nThe firm could struggle to get back on its feet. It has lost most of its staff and only two people are currently on its board - Mr Watson and Michael Moe, founder of the Silicon Valley investment company GSV Holdings, which backs Ozy.\nIn a statement, Ozy told the BBC it was reaching out to its team to encourage them to return. It added that its newsletters will resume this week and TV production at the end of the month. \nThe firm added that several advertising partners had expressed excitement about the firm re-launching and intended to meet with Ozy in the coming days to discuss \"next steps\".\nOzy spokesman Phil Singer told the BBC: \"The bottom line is that we hit a bump in the road, but are committed to getting past this moment and renewing our commitment to being the kind of media company that delivers amazing content about topics and people that are too often overlooked.\" "

      "text": "A victim of the UK's most prolific rapist Reynhard Sinaga has spoken of the sheer horror at discovering he had been attacked by the sexual predator.\nSinaga was jailed for life last year after being convicted of drugging and raping 48 men in his Manchester flat. \nPolice believe the post-graduate student had targeted more than 200 men.\nDaniel, the first victim to waive his right to anonymity, said he \"couldn't remember anything\" when he woke up in Sinaga's flat.\nIt was only when Greater Manchester Police detectives showed him photographs of the attack two years later that he found out he had been raped.\n\"It is just horrible to see yourself that vulnerable in photographs that someone else has taken,\" he said.\n\"You can see I am comatose... I look dead.\"\nSinaga is serving a minimum of 40 years in jail after being convicted of 159 sexual offences in January 2020.\nThe 38-year-old, originally from Indonesia, \"stalked\" his victims who had became separated from friends on nights out before leading them to his Princess Street flat in Manchester city centre.\nSpeaking in BBC Two documentary Catching a Predator, Daniel said he decided to speak out to help other victims.\n\"To say as a man I have been raped is a hard thing,\" he said.\n\"It makes you feel so vulnerable.\" \nDaniel had been on a night out in Manchester in 2015 celebrating his birthday with his partner and friends when they left to get a taxi home.\n\"I needed to go to the toilet so I went up an alleyway. I don't remember anything after that,\" he said.\nThe following morning he woke up on a sofa fully dressed feeling \"groggy\" and said he \"could not remember anything\". \n\"Then I saw someone's feet walking round and I just froze,\" he said.\n\"And then they left the room and I just got up and ran out the door.\"\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by any issues raised in this story, support and information is available at BBC Action Line.\nDaniel said he never considered reporting it to police because he was \"doubting himself\", \"felt stupid\" and \"didn't have a clue what had happened\".\nIt was only when a detective working on the Sinaga investigation - which was launched in June 2017 - came to see him that the truth of those missing hours emerged.\n\"I could see the way she looked at me [that] she recognised me,\" he said.\nDaniel said she showed him photographs of the attack, adding: \"There was no denying it was me. You could see my tattoo.\"\n\"There is a bit of relief because you know what has happened finally and you can make sense of it but probably not the relief you want,\" he said.\nSinaga was caught when one victim regained consciousness during the assault and fought him off before reporting it to police.\nWhen officers seized Sinaga's phone they found he had filmed each of his attacks - amounting to hundreds of hours of footage - and launched the largest rape inquiry in British history.\nDet Sgt Kimberley Hames-Evans said the footage found on the phone was \"horrendous\". \n\"There were videos upon videos of young men being sexually abused and raped,\" she said.\n\"We get lots of reports of rape but seldom do you actually see one happen with your own eyes.\" \nDet Sgt Hames-Evans had to travel the \"length and breadth of the country, even overseas\" telling people what Sinaga had done to them. \n\"They just went very quiet and you [could] see the colour drain from their face. Just an 'oh my God' look on their face,\" she said.\n\"And I knew giving them that information that I've just ruined this person's life and you could see it.\"\nDet Con Dorothy Orr said the videos were \"shocking\" and \"horrific\", particularly because of the \"helplessness\" of the victims. \n\"When someone can take advantage of someone when they are physically ill and vomiting it is hideous,\" she said.\nIain Simkin, lead prosecutor in the case against Sinaga, described him as \"savage\" and said in one of the videos he filmed himself raping two men in his flat for hours. \nHe said it was \"worse than a Gothic horror story\".\nThe Crown Prosecution Service barrister said he hoped the case had raised awareness of male rape, describing it as \"a graphic representation of the worst parts of human nature\".\nDaniel said he had been offered counselling \"but nothing has been as helpful as talking to my dad\".\n\"Men don't talk about male rape but his response was amazing,\" he said.\nYou can watch Catching a Predator on BBC Two at 21:00 GMT on Wednesday 6 October and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

      "text": "The home secretary will be watching the Metropolitan Police chief \"very closely\" over the vetting of officers in light of Sarah Everard's murder, Solicitor General Alex Chalk has said.\nMs Everard was killed by Wayne Couzens - a serving police officer - in March, leading to questions for the force over its failure to stop him.\nA number of politicians have called for Commissioner Cressida Dick to resign.\nMr Chalk warned Ms Patel would be keeping a close eye on the situation. \nCouzens was jailed for a full-life term on Thursday after details emerged of the brutal attack. \nHe abducted the 33-year-old as she walked home from a friend's house under the guise of an arrest, before raping and killing her. \nDame Cressida said she recognised that a \"precious bond of trust\" had been damaged by Couzens, who had \"brought shame on the Met\".\nBut she soon faced calls to resign, with Labour MP Harriet Harman saying women's confidence in the police \"will have been shattered\" by the case.\nMs Patel said she would \"continue to work with\" Dame Cressida, and continue to hold her and the Met to account \"as everybody would expect me to do\".\nSpeaking at a Conservative Young Women's event at the party's conference, Mr Chalk told the BBC that the police commissioner needed to look at the vetting issue that allowed Couzens to \"slip through the net\".\nHe said a lot of people would be concerned by the case, and \"want to be absolutely satisfied that things are about to improve\". \nBut he also issued a warning to Ms Dick that she may not keep the confidence of the home secretary if the issue was not sorted out.  \n\"[Priti Patel] says she has confidence in her, but I suspect the home secretary will be watching very closely to see that the vetting issue is properly investigated and scrutinised,\" he added. \nMeanwhile, the Speaker of the House of Commons has asked for an urgent meeting with the Met after it was confirmed Couzens was on duty five times at Parliament last year.\nSir Lindsay Hoyle said it was \"extremely concerning\" and also raised questions about police vetting policy.\nThe Met confirmed Couzens was on armed protection duties at Parliament between February and July 2020."

      "text": "Petrol supplies are still not getting to London and south-east England, with more than a fifth of forecourts still dry, retailers have said.\nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said it hoped the Army driving tankers would help increase fuel deliveries.\nBut it said the \"crisis is virtually at an end\" in Scotland, Wales, the North and Midlands.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson earlier did not rule out supply chain problems continuing until Christmas.\nBrian Madderson, chairman of the PRA, said: \"The fuel is still not going to the pumps that need it most in London and the South East.\"\nOn Sunday morning up to 22% of filling stations in the UK's most populous region were dry and only 60% had both grades of fuel available. The PRA said only 6% of stations were dry in the Midlands, northern England and Scotland.\nMr Madderson said the PRA, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations, was \"disappointed that no concerted action is being taken to address the supply problems\" in the South.\nFilling stations need to get more information ahead of time about deliveries, he said.\nHowever, he said in the North there was a \"plentiful supply at filling stations\" and little queuing.\nMr Madderson added he hoped the army being deployed \"will help to increase fuel deliveries\".\nFrom Monday military personnel will start to be available for hauliers to use, with more than 65 drivers available initially.\nThere are plans for 200 members of the army to be deployed in total, including 100 drivers.\nA government spokesman said: \"Stocks in London and the South of England have been recovering at slightly slower rates than other parts of the UK, so we have begun deploying military personnel to boost supply in these areas.\"\n\"More than half of those who have completed training to make fuel deliveries are being deployed to terminals serving London and the South-East of England.\"\nSupermarket Sainsbury's said it was still seeing \"high demand\" for fuel at its petrol stations.\n\"We're working closely with our supplier to maintain supply and all our sites continue to receive fuel,\" a spokeswoman said.\nMany sectors of the UK economy, including food firms and petrol retailers, have been affected by a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit, an aging workforce, and tax changes.\nOn Sunday Boris Johnson told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that labour market problems would not be solved by pulling \"the big lever marked uncontrolled immigration\" to allow in large numbers of foreign workers.\nHe insisted the lack of lorry drivers was not just a problem for the UK, and claimed the US, China, and some countries in Europe were having similar issues.\nHowever, there have been no reports of fuel problems or interruptions to food supply linked to driver shortages in those countries.\nThe rush of people filling up their cars in the past week was triggered by reports that a shortage of tanker drivers was affecting deliveries.\nThe prime minister said the UK economy was going through a \"period of adjustment\" and the way to get more HGV drivers was for the industry to ensure they were \"decently paid\".\nHe added: \"We have got to make sure people come on stream as fast as we practically can.\n\"When people voted for change in 2016, when they voted for change again in 2019 as they did, they voted for the end of a broken model of the UK economy that relied on low wages and low skills and chronic low productivity. We are moving away from that.\"\nMore than a week on from the first forecourt queues and closures, what began as a problem mainly affecting Southern parts of the country has returned to being just that.\nFollowing limited supply issues caused by a tanker driver shortage, pleas not to panic buy were seemingly ignored. The resulting crisis has shown the impact a sudden hike in demand can have on the finely balanced supply chain. \nMeasures aimed at helping the distribution system cope have included temporarily relaxing competition laws, so oil firms could better share information and target fuel deliveries.\nThe situation appears to have improved markedly in many regions of the UK but less so in the densely-populated capital and the South East.\nBusinesses, the government and of course millions of motorists will hope the deployment of military drivers from Monday helps to plug remaining gaps.

      "text": "A runner who climbed 189 mountains in a month said he felt \"incredible\" after he raised almost \u00a310,000 for charity.\nWill Renwick completed his run at Conwy Castle on Monday, after clocking up at least 24 miles a day over a month.\nThe challenge he set himself was to run up every mountain peak over 2,000ft (600m) in Wales.\nHe said the 500 mile route was fuelled by instant mash, noodles and chocolate, and despite the lows, the money raised for charity made \"every mile worth it\".\nWill, from Llancarfan in the Vale of Glamorgan, initially set out to raise \u00a32,000 for charity Mind Over Mountains, but has raised almost \u00a310,000.\nThe 31-year-old said being outdoors had always helped him mentally and fundraising spurred him on and \"put miles in my tank\".\n\"The whole thing has been a challenge right to the bitter end,\" he said, adding the weather \"was not on my side.\"\n\"I told everyone I'd be at the castle and I rocked up two hours late.\n\"I'm worn out, all my injuries have flared up but I just can't believe I have finished.\n\"It hasn't sunk in and it only will when I'm sunk into a nice warm bath.\"\nThe YouTuber and editor of Outdoors Magic has been documenting his journey on social media.\nHis first challenge was as a long-distance walker, when he completed the 870-mile Wales Coast Path in 63 days.\nNow Will runs ultra-marathon distances and recently completed the 100-mile route around the Isle of Man.\nBut he said this challenge had been the toughest physically and mentally.\n\"One of the reasons I set out on this challenge was to have a huge adventure in my own country and see all the different sides of it,\" he said.\n\"Wales is really spectacular. I live in a wonderful country and I can't get enough of it. It's been amazing to explore.\"\nHe said the people he has met across Wales have helped spur him on with their acts of kindness as simple as a cup of tea.\nThe highlight, he said, was the moment after a long day when he had camped and \"just take in the surroundings and think, wow I am very lucky to be right here right now.\"\nHowever, he said the journey has been tough, especially after a spell of windy and wet weather.\n\"There have been a lot of lows but it is all worth it to stand here at the finish line to be cheered on by strangers and raised money for a charity for such amazing things.\n\"I can't believe how the money has just gone up and if it makes a difference to one person's life then every mile will be worth it.\""

      "text": "The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents that reveals hidden wealth, tax avoidance and, in some cases, money laundering by some of the world's rich and powerful.\nMore than 600 journalists in 117 countries have been trawling through the files from 14 sources for months, finding stories that are being published this week.\nThe data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington DC, which has been working with more than 140 media organisations on its biggest ever global investigation.\nBBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.\nThe Pandora Papers leak includes 6.4 million documents, almost three million images, more than a million emails and almost half-a-million spreadsheets.\nStories revealed so far include:\nThe files expose how some of the most powerful people in the world - including more than 330 politicians from 90 countries - use secret offshore companies to hide their wealth.\nLakshmi Kumar from US think-tank Global Financial Integrity explained that these people \"are able to funnel and siphon money away and hide it,\" often through the use of anonymous companies.\nThe Pandora Papers reveal complex networks of companies that are set up across borders, often resulting in hidden ownership of money and assets.\nFor example, someone may have a property in the UK, but own it via a chain of companies based in other countries, or \"offshore\".\nThese offshore countries or territories are where:\nThe destinations are often called tax havens or secrecy jurisdictions. There is no definitive list of tax havens, but the most well known destinations include British Overseas Territories such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, as well as countries such as Switzerland and Singapore. \nLoopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is often seen as unethical. The UK government says tax avoidance \"involves operating within the letter, but not the spirit, of the law\".\nThere are also a number of legitimate reasons people may want to hold money and assets in different countries, such as protection from criminal attacks or guarding against unstable governments.\nAlthough having secretive offshore assets is not illegal, using a complex network of secret companies to move around money and assets is the perfect way to hide the proceeds of criminality.\nThere have been repeated calls for politicians to make it harder to avoid tax or hide assets, particularly following previous leaks such as the Panama Papers. \nBut Mr Ryle said the Pandora Papers show that \"the people that could end the secrecy offshore\u2026 are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it\".\nAll you need to do is set up a shell company in one of the countries or jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists in name only, with no staff or office.\nIt costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately behind the business.\nIt is impossible to say for sure, but estimates have ranged from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion, according to the ICIJ. The International Monetary Fund has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.\nMs Kumar said it is detrimental to the rest of society: \"The ability to hide money has a direct impact on your life... it affects your child's access to education, access to health, access to a home.\"\nThe UK has been criticised for allowing property to be owned by anonymous companies overseas. \nThe government published draft legislation in 2018 that would require the ultimate owners of UK properties to be declared. But it is still waiting to be presented to MPs.\nA 2019 parliamentary report said the UK system attracts people \"such as money launderers, who may wish to use property to conceal illicit funds\".\nIt said criminal investigations are often \"hindered\" because police cannot see who ultimately owns properties.\nThe government recently raised the risk of money laundering through property from \"medium\" to \"high\".\nIt says it's cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows.\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet.

      "tags": "Sweden,Telecommunication,Pandora Papers ,Uzbekistan",
      "text": "A prominent Tory donor who contributed to Boris Johnson's leadership campaign was involved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals, a BBC investigation has discovered.\nMohamed Amersi has given nearly \u00a3525,000 to the party since 2018.\nLeaked documents reveal how he worked on a series of controversial deals for a Swedish telecoms company that was later fined $965m (\u00a3700m) in a US prosecution.\nMr Amersi denies any wrongdoing.\nThe 61-year-old is a corporate lawyer who worked as a consultant for Telia between 2007 and 2013.\nWorking with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Guardian, BBC Panorama has obtained documents that show how Mr Amersi was involved in a controversial $220m payment to a secretive offshore company in 2010.\nThe firm was controlled by Gulnara Karimova - the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan - and the payment was described by the US authorities as a \"$220m bribe\".\nMr Amersi's lawyers said the offshore company had been \"vetted and approved by Telia\" and that its involvement \"did not raise any red flags\" to him.\nQuestions about the sources of Mr Amersi's wealth come as the Conservative Party's annual conference is under way in Manchester.\nHis donations have included more than \u00a3100,000 towards the 2019 general election campaign and \u00a310,000 to the prime minister's leadership bid.\nMr Amersi's Russian-born partner, Nadezhda Rodicheva, has also donated money to the Conservatives - more than \u00a3250,000 in 2017 and 2018.\nPolitical law expert Gavin Millar QC believes the Conservatives should return the money.\n\"I think they should give it back\u2026 if serious questions are being asked about the donor,\" he said.\nBut Mr Millar added \"the bottom line is they don't have to, and there's nothing in the law or the regulation of our system that compels them to do that\".\nThe main political parties including Labour and the Liberal Democrats have all faced calls to hand donations back over the years.\nAt the moment individual donors only need to be on the UK electoral register.\nOnce a party has checked that, they can accept as much money as they like.\nMr Millar said: \"You would have thought\u2026 that there should be some sort of obligation placed on them in law, to enquire a little bit into where that large sum of money comes from.\nIn recent months, Mr Amersi has been drawn into a \"cash for access\" row centred around claims that high-spending Tory donors were able to gain regular meetings with the prime minister and chancellor.\nMr Amersi's name is featured in a leak of almost 12 million documents and files known as the Pandora Papers.\nThey detail the workings of offshore financial firms in locations including the British Virgin Islands, Panama and Singapore.\nOn Sunday, the BBC revealed how documents showed the King of Jordan amassed a secret property empire, and the Azerbaijani president and his associates have been involved in property deals in the UK worth more than \u00a3400m.\nThe leaked documents also showed how the former UK prime minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, bought a London property for \u00a36.45 million in an offshore deal that saved them \u00a3312,000 in stamp duty.\nThe documents show Mr Amersi purchased two properties in the UK - a Mayfair townhouse and country home in Gloucestershire using secretive offshore companies.\nFurther investigations by the BBC and its media partners have indicated Mr Amersi was involved in negotiations that resulted in $220m being paid to a Gibraltar-based company.\nThe firm was secretly owned through an offshore company by Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov.\nTelia had given her shares in one of its companies in 2007 and three years later agreed to buy most of the stock back for $220m - a move US authorities described in a criminal prosecution as a \"bribe payment... in order to continue its telecoms business in Uzbekistan\".\nTelia was seeking new mobile operating licences for its business in the country at the time, and prosecutors say Ms Karimova - a one-time pop star and UN ambassador - had \"influence\" with the Uzbek regulator.\nThe incident formed part of the case brought by the US Department of Justice against Telia and some of its officials.\nThe proceedings were settled in 2017 without going to trial after Telia agreed to pay a penalty of more than $965m and accepted responsibility for breaking anti-corruption laws.\nTelia officials were charged in Sweden over their dealings with Ms Karimova - but they were acquitted after a court ruled that the country's bribery laws did not apply in the case.\nInternal Telia emails seen by the BBC connect Mr Amersi to the company's dealings with Ms Karimova's offshore firm Takilant.\nOne message shows a Telia executive wrote to Mr Amersi, saying: \"I do not want to be involved on day to day negotiations so maybe you... can handle it\".\nMr Amersi responded: \"Sure... I agree.\" An invoice for his \"success fees\" for \"Project Uzbekistan\" - for $500,000 - is among the internal Telia documents.\nPanorama has also obtained evidence about how Mr Amersi was involved in other deals for Telia.\nLeaked details from an internal company report describe the activities of a consultant referred to as Mr XY who was paid more than $65m over six years.\nThe payments included expenses for \"lavish corporate entertainment\" - usually between $100,000 and $200,000 a month - that were not  evidenced by receipts.\nThe report states that some of the payments to Mr XY \"may have been utilised to improperly acquire regulatory benefits and/or secure the go-ahead of transactions\".\nIt recommended that Telia's relationship with Mr XY be terminated.\nFormer Telia executive Michaela Ahlberg, who was brought in to clean up the company, told Panorama that Mr Amersi was the consultant referred to in the report.\n\"It is important that people around him, that trust him, that listen to him, understand the whole context of his career, and wealth,\" she said.\nMs Ahlberg said: \"He has been involved in one of the biggest corruption scandals that we have seen in Sweden in modern times.\nPanorama has confirmed that Mr Amersi was the \"adviser\" referred to at Telia's annual general meeting in 2014 as having had \"agreements\" with the company terminated after \"certain transactions in Eurasia\".\nIn the AGM speech, Telia's then chief mentioned the \"inadequate governance\" of its Eurasian operations and operations \"not aligned with [Telia's] ethical requirements\", as well as \"questionable lobbying activities\u2026 on behalf\" of Telia.\nTelia has since exited central Asia and divested all of its business there to concentrate on its Scandinavian and northern European businesses and made changes to its corporate governance.\nIt says it has now committed itself to transparency and openness.\nMr Amersi's lawyers say it is \"entirely false\" to suggest his contract was terminated.\nThey said he met senior political figures with Telia managers but \"only dealt with individuals... who were not considered politically exposed persons by mainstream institutions\".\nThey said his fees and expenses were \"entirely in keeping with industry practice\" and Telia \"did not require regular sight of the receipts\".\nThey added that: \"Any allegation that our client operated as a conduit to help Telia acquire regulatory benefits and secure telecoms deals... is categorically false.\"\nThe Conservative Party said \"fund raising is a legitimate part of the democratic process\" and that all donations to the party are properly and lawfully declared. \nIt said the party performs compliance checks in line with legislation enacted by the last Labour government.\nThe BBC searched for information about donors to all of the political parties among the Pandora Papers documents but the stories that emerged from the files were about Conservative donors.\nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations.

      "text": "Billie Eilish has been announced as the first headliner for the 2022 Glastonbury Festival.\nThe pop star first hinted at the news on Instagram, where she posed in a Glastonbury hoodie, with the caption \"2022\".\nGlastonbury organiser Emily Eavis later confirmed the booking, and said the 20-year-old would be \"the youngest solo headliner in our history.\"\n\"This feels like the perfect way for us to return and I cannot wait!\"  \nEilish will also be the first female headliner since 2016 - although Taylor Swift was booked to play in 2020, before the Covid pandemic put an end to the summer festival season. \nGlastonbury was also cancelled this year, although organisers staged a virtual event with artists including Coldplay, Wolf Alice and Jorja Smith.\nEilish's first appearance at Glastonbury in 2019 was hailed as a triumph by critics. \nThe NME called it a \"once-in-a-generation\" show, while Variety called it a \"mesmerising\" and \"life-affirming\" performance.\nDressed in a Stella McCartney outfit, the singer bounded around the stage as fans sang back every word of songs like Bad Guy, All The Good Girls Go To Hell and You Should See Me In A Crown.\nDuring Ocean Eyes, she sat cross-legged on the stage and asked fans to give the show their full attention.\n\"If you want to film me, that's OK - but put the phone next to your face and look me in the eye.\n\"Because we're right here now together and this is the only moment we ever get together, ever.\"\nShe needn't have worried. Approximately 40,000 rapt fans watched her every move. Not bad, when you consider her set had been upgraded from the 10,000-capacity John Peel tent just weeks before the festival.\nSince then, Eilish has gone on to win multiple Brit and Grammy Awards for her debut album, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go, and recently topped the charts with the follow-up, Happier Than Ever.\nLast week, the star was in London for the premiere of the James Bond film, No Time To Die, for which she wrote the theme song.\nEavis, who made a point of watching Eilish at the side of the stage in 2019, said she \"couldn't be happier\" to welcome the star back to Worthy Farm.\nThe festival also posted its first line-up poster for 2022... featuring just one name.\nEilish will be 20 years and six months old when she hits the Pyramid stage next June - just three months older than Mark Hamilton of the Northern Irish band Ash when they headlined in 1997.\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

      "text": "Several people have been killed by a bombing at a mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul, the Taliban have said.\nTwenty were also injured by the blast near Eid Gah mosque, where a prayer ceremony was being held for the late mother of a Taliban spokesman.\nIt is the first major explosion in Kabul since Western forces withdrew in August.\nHours later, the Taliban launched attacks on suspected Islamic State militant hideouts. \nThree suspected IS militants are said to have been killed in the Taliban operation. However, these reports have not been verified. \nSo far no group has said it is behind the attack, but IS recently said it carried out several bombings in the eastern city of Jalalabad.\nThe Islamist group is violently opposed to the Taliban, which regained nearly full control of Afghanistan in a lightning offensive as international forces started to leave.\nTaliban leaders are under pressure from the international community to renounce ties with IS and al-Qaeda, and they have continually denied that militants from either group operate in the country.\nWhile the attack happened outside the mosque, it is unclear if it was directly targeting the ceremony, which was for the late mother of Taliban official, Zabihullah Mujahid.\nMr Mujahid has become one of the group's most public faces as its spokesman\nFor years, he had operated in the shadows - only speaking to reporters over the phone. But since the Taliban takeover he has addressed the media at several public news conferences."

      "tags": "Russia,Pandora Papers ,Jordan,Ukraine",
      "text": "A huge leak of financial documents has put the spotlight on the hidden assets of some of the world's most powerful people.\nUnsurprisingly, the Pandora Papers have hit headlines worldwide. But what's the reporting like in some of the countries where leaders' financial dealings have been exposed?\nThe Pandora Papers revealed that King Abdullah II of Jordan secretly spent more than \u00a370m ($100m) on a property empire in the UK and US.\nBut stories on the leak were notably absent in Jordan where - observers say - local media censor themselves and avoid subjects that are implicitly off limits. \nOn Monday morning, the state-run Petra news agency, as well as the privately-owned Al-Ghad, Al-Dustour and Jordan Times newspapers, were all leading instead on the king's comments about democratic reforms in the country.\nThey were also prioritising stories about King Abdullah meeting the World Bank president, and his first phone call with Syria's President Bashar al-Assad since the start of the Syrian civil war a decade ago.\nLawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so.\nThe palace also put out a statement saying that it was \"no secret\" that the king owned a number of properties abroad.\n\"Any allegations that link these private properties to public funds or assistance are baseless and deliberate attempts to distort facts,\" it said. \nThere was also deafening silence over the leak in much of the media in Kenya, where the family of President Uhuru Kenyatta were revealed to have secretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades.\nThe Star newspaper was leading with the story on its website, under the headline \"No evidence Kenyatta's stole state assets - Pandora Papers\". Others either did not cover it at all, or put the focus outside of Kenya. \nThe country's leading daily newspaper The Nation published a story written by a news agency with the headline \"Pandora Papers expose leaders' offshore millions\", using a picture of Jordan's king. The story included four lines about the Kenyattas. \nCitizen TV - the biggest TV station in Kenya - also published agency copy on its website, in which the revelations about Mr Kenyatta's family were at the end. \nThe Standard and The People Daily newspapers did not publish the findings on their websites. \nHowever, the leak was sparking a lot of conversation on social media in Kenya, with the hashtag #PandoraPapers and #client 13173 - the code name the Kenyattas were given by their asset managers - trending on Twitter. \nMr Kenyatta's family have not yet responded to requests for comment.\nThe leak linked Russian President Vladimir Putin to secret assets in Monaco.\nHowever, Russia's main Sunday evening TV news reviews made no mention of the allegations, which were published shortly before the programmes aired.\nThe Russian part of the investigation was published by the website Vazhnyye Istorii (Important Stories). The English-language Moscow Times news site had the Pandora Papers as its top story on Monday, with the headline: \"Leaked papers link Putin associates to offshore dealings\".\nRussian social media users have also been talking about the revelations. \nHowever a number of media outlets steered stories away from President Putin. The state-owned Gazprom-Media's NTV aired a brief report on the investigation on Monday morning, focusing on allegations against foreign officials, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \nMeanwhile, state news agency Tass highlighted findings related to the US being used as a tax haven.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday called the findings \"a collection of fairly groundless claims\". \nThe Pandora Papers revealed that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky transferred his stake in a secret offshore company just before he won the 2019 election.\nUkraine's Slidstvo.info website published an investigation based on the data obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and the English-language Kyiv Post had the findings as its top story with the headline: \"Pandora Papers reveal offshore holdings of Zelensky and his inner circle\". \nHowever, it was not a major story in most Ukrainian media.\nThe findings were widely discussed online, including in a number of blogs, with many arguing that the revelations would not affect Mr Zelensky's popularity. \nThe papers revealed that Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis - who is facing an election later this week - failed to declare an offshore investment company used to purchase two villas for \u00a312m in the south of France.\nThe findings were initially published by Investigace.cz, and then picked up by a number of media outlets, including the Pravo newspaper, which ran the story on its front page.\nMr Babis' denial of having done anything illegal was being widely reported on Monday. \nThe Novinky news site also quoted opposition figure Petr Fiala as calling for answers.\n\"Andrej Babis must prove that he used taxed money for the transaction. If not, he has no right to be in politics and take care of taxpayers' money,\" he said.\nBut despite the leak being widely covered, most media focus has remained on general election coverage. It is not clear whether the leak will have an impact on the outcome of the vote. \nThe leak found that Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's inner circle, including cabinet ministers and their families, secretly own companies and trusts holding millions of dollars.\nAll of Pakistan's major newspapers covered the revelations.\nThe leak was discussed on Pakistan's Dunya TV talk show \"Think Tank\" on Sunday. The website of Dawn newspaper - the largest and oldest English-language newspaper in Pakistan - was leading on Monday with a number of stories about the Pandora Papers and the Pakistani findings. \nThe coverage has been met with cautious or defensive reactions from those who were named. \nMr Khan said his government would investigate all citizens mentioned in the report.\n\"We welcome the Pandora Papers exposing the ill-gotten wealth of elites, accumulated through tax evasion & corruption & laundered out to financial 'havens',\" he tweeted. \nThree presidents and 11 former presidents from Latin America have been mentioned in the investigation. One of them is Ecuador's Guillermo Lasso, a former banker, who replaced a Panamanian foundation that made monthly payments to his close family with a trust based in South Dakota, in the US, in 2017. \nReacting to the revelations, Mr Lasso said all his investments, in and out of Ecuador, were legal.\nThe news involving the president is the main headline on the website of newspaper Expreso, but many Ecuadorean outlets have given it little or no coverage.\nThe website of newspaper El Universo ran several items about the findings, including those related to the president. They also reported on the revelation that Spanish singer Julio Iglesias, a star in Latin America, has a \"property empire\" in Florida of an estimated value of up to $120m.\nAnother Latin American leader mentioned in the papers is Chile's President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, a billionaire businessman, who is accused of selling a copper and iron mine in an environmentally sensitive area to a childhood friend, as detailed in Spain's El Pa\u00eds newspaper.\nIn 2010, nine months after Mr Pi\u00f1era took office, his family sold their shares in the mine for $152m. Part of the deal took place in the British Virgin Islands.\nThe Chilean presidency said Mr Pi\u00f1era had no role in, or information about, the sale of the mining project, and that he had not been involved in the management of any company for more than 12 years. \nMany Chilean outlets are covering the leaks, with the website of newspaper La Naci\u00f3n giving a lot of prominence to local reaction, with Senator Manuel Jos\u00e9 Ossand\u00f3n, who belongs to the president's party, calling for an investigation.\nThe Pandora Papers showed that the law firm founded by Cyprus's President Nicos Anastasiades appears to have provided fake owners to disguise the real owner of a series of offshore companies - a former Russian politician who had been accused of embezzlement. \nThe findings were given prominent coverage on many Cypriot news sites, including the Greek-language Politis and Phileleftheros. \nMr Anastasiades told local media he had \"no knowledge\" of what the company was claimed to have done. The law firm has denied any wrongdoing. \nOther documents showed how Azerbaijan's ruling Aliyev family have secretly acquired UK property using offshore companies.\nThe files show how the family - long accused of corruption in the European nation - bought 17 properties, including a \u00a333m office block in London for the president's 11-year-old son, Heydar Aliyev.\nThe leak received little or no coverage in most of the country's media outlets. However, the daily Azerbaijani newspaper Azadliq - which is not accessible inside the country - was leading with the story on its website on Monday. \nThe findings related to British officials were widely reported in UK media. \nThe leaked documents showed how the former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, bought a London property in an offshore deal that saved them \u00a3312,000 in stamp duty.\nMrs Blair said the sellers had insisted the building was sold in this way but they had brought it under UK control. She said they would be liable to pay capital gains tax if they sell it.\nThey also showed how prominent Conservative Party donor Mohamed Amersi worked on a series of controversial deals for a Swedish telecoms company that was later fined \u00a3700m in a US prosecution. Mr Amersi denies any wrongdoing.\nThe Guardian and i newspapers both led with reports about the Pandora Papers on their front pages on Monday. \nBBC Monitoring contributed to this report. \nThe Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC which has led one of the the biggest ever global investigations.\nMore than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet.

      "tags": "Nobel Prize",
      "text": "Scientists who discovered how our bodies feel the warmth of the sun or the hug of a loved one have won the Nobel Prize. \nDavid Julius and Ardem Patapoutian, from the US, share the 2021 prize in Medicine or Physiology for their work on sensing touch and temperature. \nThey unpicked how our bodies convert physical sensations into electrical messages in the nervous system.\nTheir findings could lead to new ways of treating pain.\nHeat, cold and touch are crucial for experiencing the world around us and for our own survival.\nBut how our bodies actually do it had been one of the great mysteries of biology. \nThomas Perlman, from the Nobel Prize Committee, said: \"It was a very important and profound discovery.\"\nProf David Julius's breakthrough, at the University of California, San Francisco, came from investigating the burning pain we feel from eating a hot chilli pepper. \nHe experimented with the source of a chilli's heat - the chemical capsaicin.\nHe discovered the specific type of receptor (a part of our cells that detects the world around them) that responded to capsaicin.\nFurther tests showed the receptor was responding to heat and kicked in at \"painful\" temperatures. This is what happens, for example, if you burn your hand on a cup of coffee. \nThe discovery led to a flurry of other temperature-sensors being discovered. Prof Julius and Prof Ardem Patapoutian found one that could detect cold. \nMeanwhile, Prof Patapoutian, working at the Scripps Research institute, was also poking cells in a dish.\nThose experiments led to the discovery of a different type of receptor that was activated in response to mechanical force or touch. \nWhen you walk along a beach and feel the sand under your feet - it is these receptors that are sending signals to the brain. \nProf Patapoutian actually missed multiple attempts by the Nobel Prize committee to let him know he was a winner. His phone was set to do-not-disturb so the flurry of phone calls from Sweden (at 0200 California time) went unanswered. \n\"They somehow got to my 94 year old father who lives in Los Angeles and he was able to call me and wake me up and tell me the news, which was ended up being a fantastic way to find out,\" he said.\nThese touch and temperature sensors have since been shown to have a wide role in the body and in some diseases. \nThe first heat sensor (called TRPV1) is also involved in chronic pain and how our body regulates its core temperature. The touch receptor (PIEZ02) has multiple roles, from urinating to blood pressure. \nThe Prize Committee said their work had \"allowed us to understand how heat, cold and mechanical force can initiate the nerve impulses that allow us to perceive and adapt to the world around us.\"\nIt added: \"This knowledge is being used to develop treatments for a wide range of disease conditions, including chronic pain.\"\nThe pair will share the 10m Swedish kronor (\u00a3845,000) prize.\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Human spaceflight,Blue Origin,Jeff Bezos,Star Trek,Space,Space exploration",
      "text": "The actor who played Captain Kirk in the Star Trek series is set to embark on a real-life journey into space.\nUS tech billionaire Jeff Bezos's space travel company Blue Origin confirmed that William Shatner would be blasting off from Texas on 12 October.\nAged 90, the actor will become the oldest person to have flown into space. \n\"I've heard about space for a long time now. I'm taking the opportunity to see it for myself. What a miracle,\" Shatner said in a statement.\nShatner will be joining three other people aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket for the company's second human spaceflight. \nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos joined the first crewed flight in July, along with his brother, an 82-year-old pioneer of the space race and an 18-year-old student. \nAs with the previous flight, the October voyage is expected to last about 10 minutes and will take the crew just beyond the Karman Line - the most widely recognised boundary of space which lies 100km (60 miles) above the Earth. \nBlue Origin said its vice president of mission and flight operations, Audrey Powers, would also be on board the flight, as well as a former Nasa engineer and the co-founder of a software company specialising in clinical research. \nA Canadian actor, Shatner famously played Captain James T Kirk of the USS Enterprise in the original Star Trek TV series in the 1960s, and later appeared in films of the franchise. \nReports in 2013 said he had turned down Sir Richard Branson's offer to fly him into space with Virgin Galactic - the billionaire's space travel company which took Sir Richard to the edge of space in July.\nSir Richard told The Sun newspaper at the time it was because Shatner has a fear of flying. But in 2011 the actor said he had turned down the offer because the billionaire allegedly wanted him to pay for the journey.\n\"He wanted me to go up and pay for it and I said: 'Hey, you pay me and I'll go up. I'll risk my life for a large sum of money.' But he didn't pick me up on my offer,\" Shatner told reporters.\nThe Star Trek star will not however be the first original cast member to leave the planet. \nLast year The Times revealed that the ashes of James Doohan, who played Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott, were smuggled on board the International Space Station in 2008, three years after Doohan's death.\nNew Shepard, built by Bezos' company Blue Origin, is designed to serve the burgeoning market for space tourism. \nDubbed \"NewSpace\", an increasing number of entrepreneurs are joining in the race to create cheap, commercialised space travel.\nBezos's Blue Origin hit headlines in recent days after 21 current and former employees claimed it had ignored safety concerns to gain an advantage in the space race, and complained of a culture of sexism. \nBlue Origin rejected the charges and said it stands by its safety record.
