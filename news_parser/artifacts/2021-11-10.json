      "title": "COP26: Draft deal calls for stronger carbon cutting targets by end of 2022",
      "tags": "Boris Johnson,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "Countries are being urged to strengthen their carbon-cutting targets by the end of 2022 in a draft agreement published at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit.\nThe document says vulnerable nations must get more help to cope with the deadly impacts of global warming.\nIt also says countries should submit long-term strategies for reaching net-zero by the end of next year. \nCritics have said the draft pact does not go far enough but others welcomed its focus on the 1.5C target.\nThe document, which has been published by the UK COP26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks. \nCOP26 president Alok Sharma said he expected \"near final texts\" to be published overnight, adding that the agreement that comes out of the conference would \"set the future for our children and grandchildren\".\nScientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century.\nWith the world off track to meet the goal, the draft document urges countries to \"revisit and strengthen\" the targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans to align them with the Paris Agreement goal of well below 2C or 1.5C by the end of 2022.\nLoss and damage - an issue of key importance to the developing world - has been included in the draft, calling for more support from developed countries and other organisations to address the damage caused by extreme weather and rising seas in vulnerable nations. \nIt also recognises that more finance is needed for developing countries beyond the long-promised $100bn a year by 2020, which will not be delivered until at least 2022.\nBut campaigners say these parts of the text are weak and essentially a \"box ticking exercise\".\nThe document also calls on countries to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - but has no firm dates or targets on this issue.\nIt also asks UN secretary general Antonio Guterres to convene world leaders in 2023 to consider how efforts to reach targets for 2030 are shaping up.\nSome 200 countries are meeting at COP to try to keep the lid on rising temperatures. Today, a document that forms the basis of what they could sign up to in Glasgow has been released by the hosts of the conference, the UK presidency.\nIt sums up everything that has been discussed so far, but is very much a draft.\nThere are bits missing and a number of contentious issues, which could get strengthened or watered down over the next few days.\nThe reference to phasing out fossil fuels will undoubtedly be opposed by some nations. \nAnd countries vulnerable to the most destructive effects of climate change will want assurances that more money is coming their way to help protect their people against rising sea levels, drought and storms.\nAt COP26 nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and getting a consensus among so many countries is never easy.\nCOP veterans expect \"one hell of a fight\" ahead - with all to play for in the next few days.\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature said the call for enhanced 2030 targets and references to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, among other proposals, \"must stick\". \nManuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF Global Lead Climate & Energy said it was essential ministers worked to include \"a clear plan to close the 2030 ambition gap and the timeframe to do this\", adding that the draft text \"must be a floor not a ceiling\". \nBut there have been warnings that there would be opposition to the idea of coming back with new plans next year.\nDavid Waskow, from the World Resources Institute, said: \"The Saudis and Russians have been quite clear on that, others have been less blunt.\"\nHe added many of the other countries pushing back were vulnerable and either did not produce a large percentage of global emissions or had \"very limited resources to develop nationally-determined contributions and then to implement them\".\nThe Alliance of Small Island States, whose members are among the nations least responsible for climate change, said the text needed to be strengthened in \"key areas\" to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable countries, particularly on finance.\nAnd Jennifer Morgan, from Greenpeace International, said the draft deal was \"not a plan to solve the climate crisis\" but an agreement that \"we'll all cross our fingers and hope for the best\".  \nLabour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Prime Minister Boris Johnson needed to \"take charge of a summit that is not on track to deliver\". \n\"We are miles off where we need to be in the halving of emissions required by 2030,\" he said.\n\"It's time the government faced this truth, stopped the greenwash, and put maximum pressure on all parties to step up and agree a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive.\"\nIn a video made on the train up to Glasgow as the UK prime minister returned to COP26, Boris Johnson said all countries had made \"significant progress\" in the last few days but there was \"still a long way to go\".\nNo 10 said that Mr Johnson spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia earlier on Wednesday about the country's climate pledges and the need to make \"progress in negotiations\" taking place in Glasgow.\nSaudi Arabia was among a number of countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels, according to leaked documents. \nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"They discussed the importance of making progress in negotiations in the final days of COP26, including on finalising the outstanding elements of the Paris rulebook.\n\"The prime minister said all countries needed to come to the table with increased ambition if we are to keep the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C alive.\"\nResearch published at the summit on Tuesday indicated the short-term plans put in place by countries would see a rise of 2.4C.\nWhile about 140 nations have pledged to reach net zero emissions by around the middle of the century, scientists have said their short-term plans for 2030 are not strong enough to limit the rise in temperatures."

      "text": "The injured caver stranded underground for more than two days while 300 volunteers tried to get him to safety was fit, experienced and not frightened, said a rescue expert.\nGeorge Linnane, 38, fell while caving in the Brecon Beacons on Saturday.\nVolunteers from across the UK came together to help before he was carried up after 54 hours on Monday evening.\nMr Linnane, who lives in Bristol, is in hospital, having broken a tibia, fibula, jaw, and with chest injuries.\nHe is being treated at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff and Vale health board confirmed.\nThe rescue was one of the UK's longest cave rescue operations after 300 volunteers came together from across the country to put their caving expertise to the test. \nMartin Grass, chairman of Mendip Cave Rescue, said Mr Linnane was an experienced caver.\n\"He was fit, so he wasn't frightened of the cave environment, he knew what it was about and has probably been on cave rescues or certainly practice rescues and that would have all helped him.\n\"He knew he was in good hands and he knew a lot of the people.\"\nMaxine Bateman, a friend of Mr Linnane who is originally from Southampton, was part of the first rescue mission in Ogof Ffynnon Ddu.\nShe told BBC Radio Bristol: \"We received a text message on Saturday afternoon, when we came out of our own caving trip to say a rescue was taking place in south Wales and then a few personal messages came through to say who the casualty was and could we make our way up there so we did.\n\"It was incredibly organised, so many people came to help out and as people were arriving it transpired that the rescue was going to be a very long rescue and quite a serious undertaking.\"\nShe added that they were then organised to go into the caves in teams so they could work shifts in order to allow the rescuers not to get too tired.\n\"I initially went into the cave at 6am on Sunday morning for a 13-hour shift, carrying in rescue kit, then I moved on to the stretcher and then onto communications with the surface in order to give them updates as to how the casualty was doing and how the team was progressing - so quite busy really,\" she said.\nIt took 16 cave rescue teams across England, Wales and Scotland coming together to make sure the rescue ended safely.\nAnother caver who was with Mr Linnane notified police about the incident at about 14:30 GMT on Saturday.\nThis was the longest cave rescue undertaken in Wales. Previously, the longest had been a 41-hour operation.\nFoggy and wet conditions in the Brecon Beacons meant an air ambulance helicopter was unable to land. \nMr Linnane had to be moved on a stretcher by specialist crews working in shifts.\nMs Bateman said it was overwhelming when they finally got Mr Linnane to the entrance of the cave.\n\"I had moments when I was able to hold his hand, talk to him and it was quite special to feel him squeeze my hand and know that he knew we were there for him. \n\"That feeling of relief when he came out of through the entrance and was handed over to the next team to take him to hospital,\" she said. \nThe Ogof Ffynnon Ddu cave system is the second largest in Wales and one of the deepest in the UK.\nThe cave system is near Penwyllt, a small hamlet in the Swansea valley, in the county of Powys. \nIt is about 902ft (275m) at its deepest point and is Britain's third longest cave.\nThe caves were discovered by the South Wales Caving Club in 1946, according to Natural Resources Wales, and contain a number of underground streams and waterfalls.\nThey can only be accessed by cavers with a permit from the caving club. \nDue to the size and very technical nature of the cave complex, it is challenging even for experienced cavers.

      "text": "A man with autism who has spent nearly half his life detained in a mental health hospital has been released after a long campaign by his mother. \nRyan Clarke, 32, had been in hospital since 2006.\nHis mother, Sharon, from Doncaster said he was \"over the moon\" to return home after 15 years.\nIn July the National Autistic Society (NAS) said the number of autistic people confined to mental health units in England was a \"national scandal\".\nMr Clarke was admitted to hospital over concerns he would self-harm.\nHe was originally diagnosed with schizophrenia, but received a revised diagnosis of autism when he was 28.\nUntil Monday he had spent the past five years in a forensic psychiatry unit, which also cared for patients with criminal convictions.\nMrs Clarke said her son was \"ecstatic\" to have been discharged and would now live independently in his own accommodation with carers.\n\"He was over the moon, he loved it,\" she said.\nAutism is a lifelong developmental disability which affects how people communicate and interact with the world. It is a spectrum condition and affects people in different ways.\nPatients can be admitted to hospital due to the lack of a care package, the need for family or carers to have some respite or because an autistic individual has mental health problems.\nMrs Clarke, who is originally from Hull but lives in Doncaster, said she had fought \"tooth and nail\" for her son over the past 15 years.\n\"He's autistic and he has repetitive phrases but I just think that was his coping mechanism whilst he was in hospital. Now I think that will stop. It will fade until it's no more.\n\"He will have bad days but they'll get fewer and fewer.\"\nHer husband, Peter, said his step-son was \"so happy\" to live a \"normal life\".\n\"We thought he'd be overwhelmed but actually he took it really well, in his stride, and he just got so excited he wanted to do everything at once and see everything at once,\" he said.\n\"But he was just laughing and dancing and really happy.\"\nNHS figures show the number of autistic patients detained in hospital rose from 1,105 to 1,215 between 2015 and 2021.\nSpeaking at the time, the Department of Health and Social Care said it was investing \u00a362m in community services and supporting discharges from hospitals.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

      "title": "Kyle Rittenhouse: Accused teen takes stand in his own defence",
      "tags": "Wisconsin,United States",
      "text": "A US teenager charged with shooting three people during civil unrest on the streets of Wisconsin last year has taken the stand in his own defence.\nKyle Rittenhouse broke down in tears, forcing a brief recess, as he described how he was \"cornered\" by several men and acted in self-defence.\nProsecutors say Mr Rittenhouse, 18, was looking for trouble that night.\nThe teen has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.\nBut the entire case was thrown into jeopardy on Wednesday when the defence called for a mistrial after the judge angrily accused the prosecution of improper questions to the defendant.\nMr Rittenhouse is facing counts of reckless, intentional and attempted homicide after he shot two men dead and wounded another in the city of Kenosha on 25 August 2020.\nRiots had erupted on the streets of the city two days earlier, after police shot a black man, Jacob Blake. Mr Rittenhouse had travelled to the city from his home in Illinois and, with a semi-automatic rifle in tow, he said he sought to help protect property from unrest on the streets.\nTaking the stand in a risky move for any defendant in a murder trial, Mr Rittenhouse said: \"I didn't do anything wrong. I defended myself.\"\nDescribing scenes of chaos to the jury, he said he had heard people shouting \"get him\". \nVideo evidence shows the gun-toting teen shouting out \"friendly, friendly, friendly\" to the crowd.\n\"The person that attacked me first threatened to kill me,\" he said of Joseph Rosenbaum, the first person he shot. He told the jury he believed Mr Rosenbaum was carrying a chain with him at one point, though he later learned it was a plastic bag. \nThe judge called for a break after Mr Rittenhouse burst into tears as he began to describe to the jury the moments before the fatal shootings. His mother was also seen sobbing in the gallery.\nUpon his return to the stand, the teen said he had nowhere to run at the time, later adding: \"I didn't intend to kill. I intended to stop the person who was trying to kill me and trying to steal my gun.\"\nMr Rittenhouse said he shot and killed Mr Rosenbaum after Mr Rosenbaum laid a hand on his rifle.\nVideo from the scene shows the teen fall to the ground as he is chased. Mr Rittenhouse said it led him to fear for his life even more, as several men converged upon him.\nHe testified that Anthony Huber, the second person shot by Mr Rittenhouse, hit him with his skateboard and also tried to grab his rifle.\nHe said Gaige Grosskreutz, the man he wounded in the arm, had approached him with a pistol pointed at his head.\nMr Grosskreutz, the third person to be shot by Mr Rittenhouse, testified this week he thought Mr Rittenhouse was an \"active shooter\" when he drew his own gun and advanced on him.\n\"I brought the gun for protection but I didn't think I would have to use the gun in defending myself,\" Mr Rittenhouse responded.\nProsecutors argue that Mr Rittenhouse inserted himself into the situation and intended to kill everyone he shot that evening.\nIn a testy cross-examination, prosecutor Thomas Binger contested the teen's right to possess a rifle and sought to cast doubt on the extent of his medical training.\nMr Binger - the assistant district attorney of Kenosha - also questioned the sincerity of Mr Rittenhouse's tears, making specific reference to a social media post in which Mr Rittenhouse said he was \"just trying to be famous\" and photos prosecutors say show him posing with far-right provocateurs.\nBut Mr Binger's line of questioning drew several furious reprimands from Judge Bruce Schroeder, who accused him of violating pre-trial rulings on introducing evidence not relevant to the trial.\n\"You're an experienced trial lawyer,\" yelled the judge. \"I don't know what you're up to.\"\nThe legal teams continued to butt heads into the afternoon, as prosecutors continued to raise issues with Mr Rittenhouse's testimony and accused him of changing his story to fit a narrative.\nDefence attorneys argued \"prosecutorial overreaching\" and called for a mistrial with prejudice.\nA successful motion for mistrial with prejudice cannot be appealed by prosecutors. \nJudge Schroeder did not rule on the motion on Wednesday, but agreed to take it \"under advisement\" based on the future behaviour of the prosecution team.\nLead attorney Corey Chirafasi even suggested that prosecutors may have been angling for the mistrial because the case was \"going badly\" for them.\nMr Rittenhouse said on the stand he was in town because he had seen the destruction caused by the unrest. In particular, he mentioned seeing on social media that a police officer had a brick thrown at his head.\nHe detailed how he had joined up with other armed civilians to protect a series of local car dealerships, adding the owner \"was happy we were there\".\nBefore the shootings, Mr Rittenhouse claimed, he provided medical assistance to at least two people. He said he had worked as a firefighter and first responder cadet in his hometown, so he was able to administer first aid and basic emergency care.\nHe also testified that he and others had been moving around to put out fires and clean up graffiti.\nThe state rested its case on Tuesday. Mr Rittenhouse is the third witness on the stand for the defence and his testimony may be pivotal in deciding his fate."

      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "The UK presidency team have set out an ambitious stall in their first attempt to capture progress here at COP26.\nAs well as the specific items mentioned in the document, it also gives us a sense of how the negotiations are going more generally.\nIt's clear that there's a sense of urgency, and a willingness to go high on the key question of cutting carbon more rapidly.\nIf this idea survives the next couple of days, then Glasgow may well be seen as a success.\nBut there's a long way to go until the final gavel comes down.\nThe idea of getting countries to come back more regularly started with the most vulnerable nations.\nThis meeting floated the idea of countries coming back with new plans every year - and this draft nods to that by asking everyone to come back next year with a new nationally determined contribution (NDC), which outlines their pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut there are some interesting wrinkles in that request.\nParties are urged to come back in 2022 with plans that \"align with the Paris temperature goal\".\nWhich one do they mean - 1.5C or 2C?\nThat will need clarifying in the hours and days ahead. \nThe UK have attempted to copper-fasten the idea of rapid improvement in national plans by asking all countries to attend a high-level ministerial meeting on climate change every year.\nThey've also asked the UN Secretary-General to convene a world leaders meeting in 2023, just ahead of a global stock-take, which will examine how countries are performing on restricting emissions.\nThat all sounds like a nice day out for presidents and prime ministers, but doesn't commit them to do anything.\nThere is also some quite progressive language in this draft decision that will hearten campaigners, specifically the mention of coal. \nAccording to seasoned observer this is the first mention of the \"c\" word in a UN climate change document. \nHowever, before everyone gets carried away, the give and take nature of the drafting process means that there is no end date given, meaning it is an aspiration and not a timeline. \nThe same paragraph also mentions the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, but there's no specific mention of oil and gas.\nIs that to try and keep Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major producers on board?\nThere is some nice language on doubling the amount of finance given for adaptation. \nBut there's no baseline against which to measure the increase and no timeline for delivery.\nThe issue of loss and damage finally gets its own significant section in the draft decision. This is the idea that rich nations bear a historical responsibility for global warming and should compensate poorer ones for the harms visited on them. \nIts inclusion will hearten many developing nations, which have been asking for a clear financial commitment to tackle the impacts of climate change that they can't adapt to. However, the document is very woolly on this question.\nNow that the UK has played its main negotiating card, much will likely change over the next two days of hardball negotiations.\nThere will be pressure from countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, China and India to water down the idea of coming back next year with a new plan.\nStrangely there are many developing nations who might also oppose this - the time, effort and costs associated with a new NDC should not be underestimated. \nDeveloping nations will also seek more clarity on two key issues. \nThey will want a strengthening of the language around finance so that a new goal for 2025 represents a significant increase on the much derided $100bn. \nThey will also want to see a stronger emphasis on spending up to half that money on adaptation.\nThe other question is over the loss and damage issue.\nRight now, the UN's response to this amounts to a single website for countries affected. \nEmerging economies will want to see this strengthened in the draft decision, with a new secretariat dedicated to the question - and most importantly a separate stream of funding. \nThe serious horse trading has already started.\nMatt McGrath has been covering climate change for the past 15 years, reporting from 10 COPs along the way.

      "tags": "Geoffrey Cox",
      "text": "Labour has called for a standards investigation into a possible rule breach by Sir Geoffrey Cox - after a clip appeared to show him using his MP's office to carry out private work for the British Virgin Islands inquiry. \nThe Conservative MP has earned more than \u00a3700,000 for advising the inquiry. \nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said he appeared to be in \"brazen breach of the rules\". \nThe BBC has contacted Sir Geoffrey, a former attorney general, for comment.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said MPs should not use \"anything that is funded by the taxpayer\", including their parliamentary offices, for outside work.\nMPs are forbidden, under their code of conduct, from using any \"public resources\" to confer \"personal or financial benefit on themselves or anyone else\".\nLast month, Conservative Owen Paterson was found to have broken rules by lobbying the government on behalf of companies who were paying him - and for using his Commons office for business meetings, which is prohibited.\nHis case has raised questions about the extra work some MPs do on top of their parliamentary jobs.\nThe Commons is in recess this week, meaning Boris Johnson will not be facing questions in Parliament at Prime Minister's Questions later.\nMPs are allowed to do extra jobs - for example, some work as doctors or lawyers, while others write books or give speeches - but they must declare their additional income along with gifts and donations.\nSir Geoffrey, 61, the MP for Torridge and West Devon since 2005, has continued to practise as a barrister - earning almost \u00a3900,000 for this in the past year. \nHis work includes advising the British Virgin Islands government inquiry into alleged corruption.\nVideo footage from September is available online of Sir Geoffrey participating in a virtual hearing for the inquiry from what appears to be his Commons office. \nAt one point he gets up from his chair, returning to it around half an hour later. His absence occurred at about the same time as MPs, including Sir Geoffrey, were voting on the government's health and social care funding reforms.\nAt a later point, he excuses himself for the rest of the hearing, saying: \"Would you forgive me for not being present this afternoon? I'm afraid I have compelling other commitments...\n\"Forgive my absence during some of the morning. I'm afraid the bell went off.\"\nThis appears to be a reference to the division bell, which rings when MPs are summoned to the Commons to vote.\nLabour has suggested that, in apparently using his Commons office for outside work, Sir Geoffrey breached the parliamentary code of conduct, which states that MPs should ensure facilities paid for by the public purse \"always support their parliamentary duties\".\nIt adds that the use of public resources should not \"confer any undue personal or financial benefit on themselves\".\nMr Javid told BBC Breakfast: \"For any MP, if they do have external interests, they should of course be open and transparent about that. They should be following all the rules all the time, including no lobbying.\"\n\"If you have an external interest, I can't see why you would be using anything that is funded by the taxpayer... I think that would include your office space,\" he added.\nLast month, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone found that Mr Paterson had breached these rules by holding meetings in his parliamentary office with companies who were paying him. \nLabour has now asked Ms Stone to carry out an investigation into Sir Geoffrey. \nMs Rayner said: \"A Conservative MP using a taxpayer funded office in Parliament to work for a tax haven facing allegations of corruption is a slap in the face and an insult to British taxpayers.\n\"The prime minister needs to explain why he has an MP in his parliamentary party that treats Parliament like a co-working space allowing him to get on with all of his other jobs instead of representing his constituents.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has earned more than \u00a3100,000 from legal work since he became an MP in 2015.\nAsked on BBC Radio Leicester whether MPs should have a second job, and whether he had had one himself, Sir Keir said there were \"different types of second jobs\".\nHe added: \"There's a million miles between what Owen Paterson was doing and Rosena Allin-Khan, one of our MPs in Tooting (south London).\n\"She is a qualified health professional. She's been working on the front line during Covid in A&E in her local hospital. So I think we need to have a clear distinction between those two types of cases.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats' chief whip Wendy Chamberlain urged Sir Geoffrey to \"save everyone the time and trouble of an investigation\" and \"come clean now\"."

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex questioned whether she should call her father \"daddy\" in a letter and whether it would \"pull at the heartstrings\" if leaked, the Court of Appeal has heard.\nThe letter is at the centre of a legal battle over privacy between the duchess and publishers of the Mail on Sunday.\nThe paper claimed it was written with an awareness it could be made public.\nThe duchess won a previous court case that found publishing the letter was a misuse of her private information.\nAssociated Newspapers' legal team are seeking to overturn this judgement.\nThey are disputing that this was simply a private and personal letter - and have argued that it was crafted with the \"possibility of public consumption\" in mind.\nThe court heard lawyers for the duchess reiterate that this was a \"highly personal\" family letter touching on her private feelings, and that its publication was against the rights to a private life, family life and the protection of private correspondence.\nIn the second day of the appeal hearing, lawyers for the publisher challenged the extent to which it was really a \"private\" letter, sent by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to her estranged father Thomas Markle.\nThe newspaper's lawyers highlighted a witness statement from Jason Knauf, former communications secretary to Meghan and Prince Harry.\nThe court heard of text messages between the duchess and Mr Knauf about the drafting of the letter, sent in August 2018.\nThis included whether it should begin by addressing Mr Markle as \"daddy\".\nThe court heard that the duchess had written: \"Given I've only ever called him 'daddy' it may make sense to open as such, despite him being less than paternal, and in the unfortunate event that it leaked it would pull at the heartstrings.\" \nAndrew Caldecott, representing the news organisation, quoted Meghan in a further exchange, saying the letter was \"real, honest and factual, and if he leaks it, then that's on his conscience, and at least the world will know the truth. Words I could never voice publicly\".\nAnd the court heard, quoted from the exchange, that: \"Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked, so I have been meticulous in my word choice.\"\nJustin Rushbrooke, representing the Duchess of Sussex, said this was a more straightforward case than might appear from the challenges against it.\nExtensive parts of a private, family letter had been shared without the consent of the sender, he said.\nAnd he told the court that if it had become public, that was because it had been published by the news organisation.\nIn a statement sent to the Press Association, the duchess said she had never expected the letter to be leaked and that it was \"absurd\" to see the recognition that a letter could be leaked as being the same as expecting that to happen.\nThe duchess said that Mr Markle's involvement in media coverage was putting pressure on Prince Harry and the letter was a way of addressing that.\n\"I felt that, even if my attempt to stop my father talking to the media failed, at least my husband would be able to say to his family that I had done everything I could to stop it,\" said the statement from the duchess.\nThe letter had been sent to Mr Markle a few months after the duchess had married Prince Harry and it challenged her father's dealings with the media.\nMr Markle, who was said to be unhappy at other media accounts of his relationship with his daughter, had given the letter to the Mail on Sunday.\nLawyers for the newspaper suggested he wanted to challenge a \"false narrative\" of the run-up to his daughter's wedding and that revealing the letter was a form of right of reply.\nThe duchess's legal team is seeking to uphold the finding of the earlier court.\nWelcoming the earlier ruling, Meghan had said it was a victory against \"dehumanising\" media behaviour. \n\"The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep,\" she said.\nThe Mail on Sunday faced a requirement to publish a front-page statement on the Duchess of Sussex's case, which has been put on hold pending the outcome of the appeal.\nThe hearing is due to end on Thursday."

      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Despite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows.\nIt calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to.\nCOP26 \"has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap\", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT).\nThe Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change.\nBut the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements that included a vow to stop deforestation.\nCOP26 is expected to finish this week.\nThe projection comes as the UK's Met Office warns that a billion people could be affected by fatal heat and humidity if the global average temperature rises by 2C above pre-industrial levels.\nThe report by Climate Action Tracker looks at promises made by governments before and during COP26. \nIt concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree.\nScientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening.\nThe COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included \"pursuing efforts\" to keep warming under 1.5C.\nBut when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.\n\"This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,\" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan.\nHowever, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C.\nClimate Action Tracker blames \"stalled momentum\" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\nIt says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low.\nReaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere.\nMore than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions.\nBut Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated \"acceptable\", covering a fraction of the world's emissions.\n\"If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,\" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker.\nThe main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes.\nWith one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference. \nFor days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C.\nThat seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference. \nSo how has the confusion come about?\nThe problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050. \nMore than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070.\nAccording to the CAT, these goals are giving \"false hope\". \nBased on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C.\nIf every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible.\nBut the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised.\nThat's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years. \nAny deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure. \nThe summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week:"

      "text": "Frontline NHS staff in some Welsh hospitals were not regularly tested for Covid-19 until near the end of the second wave, BBC research has found.\nRoutine testing was announced in December, but it was not introduced in some hospitals until as late as March.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said it \"seemed to take an inordinate amount of time\" to introduce testing.\nThe Welsh government said the NHS in Wales had followed \"UK infection prevention and control guidance\".\nTo date, Public Health Wales has recorded 8,075 cases of Covid probably or definitely caught in hospitals.\nMore than half of those infections happened between the beginning of October 2020 and the end of February 2021.\nNow information obtained by the BBC's Wales Live programme shows while some frontline workers had routine lateral flow tests from December, the policy was not rolled out to many hospitals until mid-February.\nMiranda Evans, who lost two relatives after they contracted Covid in hospital, called for answers, saying hospitals should have been \"safe\".\nHer aunt Ann Smith, 75, and grandmother Pearl Higgins, 94, died within a fortnight of each other last winter.\n\"Their funerals were a day apart,\" she said. \"The whole situation was very surreal, like a nightmare, it didn't feel like normality\".\nHer grandmother was admitted to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend with a stroke in September, while her aunt attended a few weeks later with a water infection.\n\"Hospitals should be a safe place, you're going in to be cared for, to be treated, to be cured. However that was not the case for my relatives.\"\nShortcomings with testing, ventilation, personal protective equipment, and difficulties segregating patients have all been blamed as factors that may have contributed to the spread of Covid in hospitals.\nIn July, it was revealed that a quarter of Covid deaths in Wales were from hospital-acquired infections.\nCampaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families For Justice Cymru, which has long been calling for a Wales Covid public inquiry, said hospital-acquired coronavirus was the biggest single issue raised by its members.\nMs Evans has called for answers over why her grandmother was moved around different wards, and about the level of staff testing that was taking place last winter.\nShe wants their deaths to be looked into, but said she has had no communication from the health board. \nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board said it could not comment on individual cases but was keen to engage with and support the family \"to help them get the answers they need\".\nIn January, Ann O'Hanlon visited hospital after spilling boiling water on herself while making a cup of coffee.\nAt the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff she was kept in for physio when it was discovered that she had broken a bone in her pelvis during the accident.\n\"I thought I was sending her to a safe place,\" said her daughter Therasa O'Hanlon.\nAnn tested negative for Covid on admission to UHW but around a fortnight later contracted the virus. She died days later at the age of 71.\nMs O'Hanlon said she felt \"angry and annoyed,\" adding: \"I just want answers. You send people to be safe and to be looked after and to me she wasn't looked after.\"\nAn investigation by Cardiff and Vale health board found the likely transmission of the virus was from a \"confused and wandering patient\".\nHowever, Ms O'Hanlon believes deaths caused by hospital-acquired Covid are a reason for a Wales-based public inquiry.\nIn December, then health minister Vaughan Gething said routine testing of \"frontline health workers\" would begin to be introduced from the 14th of that month.\nBut not all health boards implemented this step immediately. \nAneurin Bevan added asymptomatic testing of staff working with \"extremely vulnerable patients\" began in October 2020.\nHowever, it did not start regularly testing all frontline staff at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport and Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr in Ystrad Mynach until mid-February, and those at the Grange Hospital in Cwmbran and Nevill Hall in Abergavenny until the beginning of March.\nSwansea Bay said testing started \"in selected areas\" on 20 December, before a \"wider rollout\" on 11 January. \nHywel Dda did not introduce regular testing until 25 February.\nBetsi Cadwaladr started testing all \"roving, high-risk and medium-risk areas\" from 15 February. \nIt had previously started testing a \"small cohort of staff\" at Wrexham Maelor hospital on 21 December.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg began introducing tests to all staff on 14 December. \nCardiff and Vale did not provide dates.\nDr Phil Banfield, chairman of the BMA's consultants committee, said routine testing with lateral flow devices \"seemed to take an inordinate amount of time\" to introduce.\n\"We hit Christmas and the expected second wave and still the routine testing wasn't readily available in all hospitals in all health boards,\" he said.\nBut he thinks Covid spread in hospitals due to it not always being possible to \"space patients out in the way that was needed and was recognised as being necessary\".\n\"There were frustrations throughout hospitals in Wales because we knew this was going to happen and knew that if you invested in the estate and temporary expansion of physical space that it would help us in the longer run.\n\"Our difficulty was we went into the pandemic with too few beds and not enough staff in the first place.\"\nWelsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the lack of routine testing in the second wave was \"shocking and strange\", \"and goes a long way to explaining how a quarter of Covid deaths in Wales were due to infections acquired in hospitals\".\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Tragically, we are now hearing of the consequences of our NHS staff not being routinely tested. We need reassurance that all incidents of patient harm will be fully investigated.\"\nBoth parties reiterated calls for a Wales-only Covid inquiry.\nThe Welsh government said: \"Coronavirus is a highly-transmissible virus, especially in closed settings such as hospitals. \n\"Throughout the pandemic, the NHS in Wales has followed the UK infection prevention and control guidance which has been regularly updated.\n\"Guidance has also been issued to the NHS and regularly updated about social distancing, bed spacing, staff and patient testing and mask wearing. \n\"But, despite all these measures to protect staff and patients in hospitals, unfortunately people have caught coronavirus while in hospital and, very sadly, some have died.\""

      "tags": "Scottish government,John Swinney,Hospitality industry,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People may be able to show a negative lateral flow test result in place of a vaccine passport in the future, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said. \nHe said there was a \"stronger case\" for allowing people to use test results to gain entry to venues if the scheme was widened. \nThe Scottish government is considering the move amid fears of a surge in Covid-19 cases over winter.\nCritics have said there is no evidence base for expanding the passport scheme. \nPeople over the age of 18 currently need to show proof of vaccination in order to enter nightclubs and large events such as football matches and concerts.\nMr Swinney said this could now be expanded to more hospitality and leisure venues with any changes set to be confirmed at the next review of the restrictions on 16 November.\nOther countries with vaccine certification schemes, such as Wales, allow people to show proof of a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours as an alternative to showing a certificate.\nAsked on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland if this testing alternative would be introduced, Mr Swinney said: \"We didn't do it in the first place because the purpose of applying the vaccination certification scheme was to drive up vaccine certification levels. \n\"If we're going to apply this in a more widespread level then there is a stronger case for using a negative later flow device test to gain entry.\"\nPeople who take lateral flow test are asked to register their results online but there is no way of checking an accurate result has been entered. \nThe deputy first minister insisted that no decisions have yet been taken, arguing instead that ministers are simply being open that changes to the passport scheme is a possibility.\nAsked which parts of hospitality and leisure it could be applied to, Mr Swinney said: \"We've not made any decisions.\n\"The reason we've not made any decisions is that government has got to be satisfied any decisions it takes are proportionate in the context of the state of the pandemic - that is the legal test we are obliged to follow.\" \nScotland's vaccine passport scheme was introduced at the start of October and applies to nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event where more than 10,000 people are present.\nThe controversial vaccine passport scheme had no shortage of critics when it was introduced in October including an unsuccessful legal challenge mounted by the hospitality industry.\nJohn Swinney says its \"core purpose\" was to drive up vaccine uptake, which he argues has been achieved if you look at the jump in vaccination rates among the younger people who are most likely to go to bars and clubs.\nHe said that in September, 53% of 18 to 29-year-olds were vaccinated and by 1 November that had risen to 68%.\nNow the Scottish government is considering expanding the scheme in a move tied to concerns about a surge in Covid cases over the winter months.\nThe idea has set off alarm bells in parts of the hospitality industry which feels it has been disproportionately affected by the government's Covid-tackling public health measures.\nIt has also raised questions about how an expansion of the certification scheme would work.\nIn Wales, its Covid passes are used for entry into nightclubs and this is to be extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls from 15 November. \nTheir NHS Covid pass shows your vaccination status but also if you have tested negative for Coronavirus in the last 48 hours via a lateral flow test where a person has reported the results. \nAnyone caught using a fake Covid pass or lateral flow test result faces a fine of up to \u00a360. \nThe introduction of lateral flow tests would \"would alleviate some of the problem but it will not solve everything\" says the Scottish Hospitality Group. \nAnd the move to start using lateral flow tests would also likely win opposition party support in Holyrood. \nOpposition politicians have criticised the Scottish government for considering expanding the scheme which they say will be of \"significant concern\" to businesses. \nStephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents some of the country's bars, restaurants and clubs, said: \"We expect the Scottish government to work constructively, intensively, and with proper consultation with our industry should there be an extension of vaccine passports to all indoor hospitality venues. \n\"We would hope that this would include discussion of appropriate government support for additional staffing and costs, with many businesses in the hospitality sector currently struggling to cope with the financial burden of the pandemic as well as an acute recruitment crisis.\""

      "tags": "Boris Johnson,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson is returning to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow - urging nations to \"pull out all the stops\" to limit warming.\nThe first draft of an agreement setting out how countries will cut emissions to avoid temperature rises of above 1.5C has been published.\nThe agreement - or \"cover decision\" - sets out what negotiators hope will be the outcome of the COP26 talks.\nIt encourages richer countries to scale up support for poorer nations.\nThe seven-page draft agreement focuses on adaptation - helping countries deal with the effects of climate change - and finance, a controversial issue because poorer countries blame richer countries for not contributing enough.\nThe document says meeting the goal to limit global warming to 1.5C - which countries pledged to try to pursue under the Paris climate accord - needs meaningful and effective action in \"this critical decade\".\nThe agreement, which was published by the UK Cop26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks.\nScientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century.\nThe document may be just seven pages long but it attempts to steer COP26 towards a series of significant steps that will prevent global temperature rises going above 1.5C this century.\nPerhaps the most important part of that is getting countries to improve their carbon cutting plans.\nTo that end this draft decision urges parties to \"revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally-determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022\".\nIt will be interesting to see how countries such as China, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia respond to this request to put new plans on the table by the end of next year.\nThere is some comfort for developing countries to see that their financial needs are recognised as countries are asked to mobilise climate finance \"beyond $100bn a year\" and the draft welcomes steps to put in place a much larger, though as yet unspecified, figure for support from 2025.\nLoss and damage, an issue of key importance to the developing world, is included in the draft with encouragement to richer countries to scale up their action and support including finance for poorer nations.\nThe document also calls on countries to accelerate the phase out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - but has no firm dates or targets on this issue. Campaigners will welcome the inclusion and will hope it survives into the final text.\nDespite the promises made at the summit so far, the planet is still heading for 2.4C of warming above pre-industrial levels, according to a report by Climate Action Tracker.\nA global average temperature rise of just 2C could mean a billion people are affected by fatal heat and humidity, the Met Office has warned.\nAhead of his return to the summit, Mr Johnson said: \"Negotiating teams are doing the hard yards in these final days of COP26 to turn promises into action on climate change. There's still much to do.\"\nThe prime minister said he would be meeting ministers and negotiators to hear about the progress made and where gaps must be bridged.\n\"This is bigger than any one country and it is time for nations to put aside differences and come together for our planet and our people,\" he said.\n\"We need to pull out all the stops if we're going to keep 1.5C within our grasp.\"\nA coalition of nations which are vulnerable to climate change, along with the US and European nations, is pressing for countries to submit action plans in the next year in line with limiting warming to 1.5C, and by 2023 to produce their long-term plans to meet the target.\nThe summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week:\nWith Wednesday named as transport day at COP26, the UK announced that new heavy goods vehicles sold from 2040 will need to have zero emissions.\nThirty countries have agreed to work together to increase the use of zero emissions vehicles, while plans for \"green shipping corridors\" to help a shift towards zero-emissions vessels are also due to be unveiled.\nAnother 14 states which are responsible for more than 40% of global aviation emissions have committed to a new decarbonisation target.\nBut the UK's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said travel, including flying, should be \"guilt-free\" and said the government did not see aviation as \"the ultimate evil\".\nHe told the Daily Telegraph that changes to how we live our lives should not mean \"the inability to go and visit you friends and family and do business\".\nAttendees at COP26, including the prime minister, have faced criticism for using planes for short journeys to and from the conference."

      "text": "People going to cinemas and theatres in Wales will be required to show a Covid pass after the Welsh government won a vote in the Senedd.\nCurrently, visitors to nightclubs and large events have to show they are fully vaccinated, have tested negative for Covid or have recently had the virus to enter.\nFrom Monday, it will be extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls.\nLabour ministers won the vote after Plaid Cymru backed the plans.\nAnyone aged over 16 in Wales can get an NHS Covid pass if they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the previous 48 hours.\nThe new law passed with 39 Members of the Senedd voting for and 15 against, with the Welsh Conservatives and Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds opposed.\nOn Tuesday night, Big Brother Watch, a civil liberties campaign, said it was starting legal proceedings against the Welsh government, calling the scheme \"authoritarian, invasive and unevidenced\".\nBut Labour said the Covid pass was popular and Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the extension was designed to keep cinemas and theatres open over the winter months.\nHundreds of protesters gathered on the Senedd steps in Cardiff Bay on Tuesday, amid concerns the passes unreasonably restrict personal freedom.\nThe vote was in contrast to October when ministers won the first Covid pass decision by a single vote when one Conservative MS was unable to log on to Zoom to vote remotely.\nAt the time the Welsh government - which holds exactly half of the 60 seats in the Senedd - had faced defeat with the whole opposition, including Plaid, against the plans.\nThe planned extension had divided opinion among those working in cinemas and theatres.\nCardiff Bay's Wales Millennium Centre said it welcomed any moves that would ensure the safety of its audiences and allow it to remain open, particularly before Christmas.\nSteve Reynolds, director of Picturedrome Cinemas, which runs Maxime cinema in Blackwood, said he felt cinemas and theatres were being \"singled out\".\nHe worried about the impact it could have on the trade: \"Cinemas won't survive if they have a dramatic fall in business\".\nPublic Health Wales gives the latest seven day average Covid case rate as 527.7 per 100,000 people.\nBut Ms Morgan told a Senedd debate the case rate was still \"very high\" and has been increasing in some areas.\n\"Our aim is to avoid having to close sectors or reintroduce restrictions,\" she said, claiming \"the vast majority of the Welsh public are with us\".\nConservative constitutional spokesman Darren Millar said there were \"many ethical and equality issues with Covid passes\", repeating concerns that results from lateral flow devices are self-declared.\n\"You can swab your dog and put its result in that system and still get your vaccine passport to be able to attend any event, nightclub, cinema theatre or anywhere else, it is ridiculous.\"\nPlaid health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth indicated last week the party was likely to back the extension, but its stance was not confirmed until Tuesday lunchtime.\nHe said: \"Plaid Cymru has made it clear throughout this pandemic that we'll support evidence-based actions that can help limit transmission and keep the people of Wales safe.\n\"After examining the evidence, including that provided by the Welsh government, we are willing to support extending the passes to help mitigate the transmission of Covid.\"\nWelsh Liberal Democrat leader Ms Dodds said her opposition was \"foremost\" about \"the lack of evidence\". \nShe told the Senedd she had still not received any evidence that the passes \"work to reduce transmission or to improve the uptake of the vaccine\".\nThe vote took place as the Labour government continues to negotiates a co-operation deal with Plaid in Cardiff Bay. \nThe parties have been discussing working together for months, as Labour lacks an outright majority, but they are not expected to enter a formal coalition.\nNightlife industry group NTIA, which has opposed the Covid pass scheme from the start, said cinemas and theatres would experience \"significant challenges\". \nChief executive Michael Kill added: \"There is a huge concern throughout the hospitality and night time economy sectors that Welsh government will take this even further to encompass more businesses, which without a doubt will cripple the industries involved.\""

      "title": "COP26: Draft deal calls for stronger carbon cutting targets by end of 2022",
      "tags": "Boris Johnson,COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "Countries are being urged to strengthen their carbon-cutting targets by the end of 2022 in a draft agreement published at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit.\nThe document says vulnerable nations must get more help to cope with the deadly impacts of global warming.\nIt also says countries should submit long-term strategies for reaching net-zero by the end of next year. \nCritics have said the draft pact does not go far enough but others welcomed its focus on the 1.5C target.\nThe document, which has been published by the UK COP26 presidency, will have to be negotiated and agreed by countries attending the talks. \nCOP26 president Alok Sharma said he expected \"near final texts\" to be published overnight, adding that the agreement that comes out of the conference would \"set the future for our children and grandchildren\".\nScientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century.\nWith the world off track to meet the goal, the draft document urges countries to \"revisit and strengthen\" the targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans to align them with the Paris Agreement goal of well below 2C or 1.5C by the end of 2022.\nLoss and damage - an issue of key importance to the developing world - has been included in the draft, calling for more support from developed countries and other organisations to address the damage caused by extreme weather and rising seas in vulnerable nations. \nIt also recognises that more finance is needed for developing countries beyond the long-promised $100bn a year by 2020, which will not be delivered until at least 2022.\nBut campaigners say these parts of the text are weak and essentially a \"box ticking exercise\".\nThe document also calls on countries to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - but has no firm dates or targets on this issue.\nIt also asks UN secretary general Antonio Guterres to convene world leaders in 2023 to consider how efforts to reach targets for 2030 are shaping up.\nSome 200 countries are meeting at COP to try to keep the lid on rising temperatures. Today, a document that forms the basis of what they could sign up to in Glasgow has been released by the hosts of the conference, the UK presidency.\nIt sums up everything that has been discussed so far, but is very much a draft.\nThere are bits missing and a number of contentious issues, which could get strengthened or watered down over the next few days.\nThe reference to phasing out fossil fuels will undoubtedly be opposed by some nations. \nAnd countries vulnerable to the most destructive effects of climate change will want assurances that more money is coming their way to help protect their people against rising sea levels, drought and storms.\nAt COP26 nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and getting a consensus among so many countries is never easy.\nCOP veterans expect \"one hell of a fight\" ahead - with all to play for in the next few days.\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature said the call for enhanced 2030 targets and references to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, among other proposals, \"must stick\". \nManuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF Global Lead Climate & Energy said it was essential ministers worked to include \"a clear plan to close the 2030 ambition gap and the timeframe to do this\", adding that the draft text \"must be a floor not a ceiling\". \nBut there have been warnings that there would be opposition to the idea of coming back with new plans next year.\nDavid Waskow, from the World Resources Institute, said: \"The Saudis and Russians have been quite clear on that, others have been less blunt.\"\nHe added many of the other countries pushing back were vulnerable and either did not produce a large percentage of global emissions or had \"very limited resources to develop nationally-determined contributions and then to implement them\".\nThe Alliance of Small Island States, whose members are among the nations least responsible for climate change, said the text needed to be strengthened in \"key areas\" to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable countries, particularly on finance.\nAnd Jennifer Morgan, from Greenpeace International, said the draft deal was \"not a plan to solve the climate crisis\" but an agreement that \"we'll all cross our fingers and hope for the best\".  \nLabour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Prime Minister Boris Johnson needed to \"take charge of a summit that is not on track to deliver\". \n\"We are miles off where we need to be in the halving of emissions required by 2030,\" he said.\n\"It's time the government faced this truth, stopped the greenwash, and put maximum pressure on all parties to step up and agree a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive.\"\nIn a video made on the train up to Glasgow as the UK prime minister returned to COP26, Boris Johnson said all countries had made \"significant progress\" in the last few days but there was \"still a long way to go\".\nNo 10 said that Mr Johnson spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia earlier on Wednesday about the country's climate pledges and the need to make \"progress in negotiations\" taking place in Glasgow.\nSaudi Arabia was among a number of countries asking the UN to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels, according to leaked documents. \nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"They discussed the importance of making progress in negotiations in the final days of COP26, including on finalising the outstanding elements of the Paris rulebook.\n\"The prime minister said all countries needed to come to the table with increased ambition if we are to keep the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C alive.\"\nResearch published at the summit on Tuesday indicated the short-term plans put in place by countries would see a rise of 2.4C.\nWhile about 140 nations have pledged to reach net zero emissions by around the middle of the century, scientists have said their short-term plans for 2030 are not strong enough to limit the rise in temperatures."

      "tags": "Data breaches,Google,iPhones",
      "text": "The UK's Supreme Court has rejected a claim that sought billions of pounds in damages from Google over alleged illegal tracking of millions of iPhones.\nThe judge said the claimant had failed to prove damage had been caused to individuals by the data collection.\nBut he did not rule out the possibility of future mass-action lawsuits if damages could be calculated.\nThe case will have implications for similar mass-action lawsuits.\nIn his judgement, Lord Leggatt said a key issue was that \"the claim has been framed in order to try to bring it as a representative action\" for many people.\n\"The claimant seeks damages... for each individual member of the represented class without attempting to show that any wrongful use was made by Google of personal data relating to that individual or that the individual suffered any material damage or distress as a result of a breach,\" it read.\n\"Without proof of these matters, a claim for damages cannot succeed.\"\nBut he added that the case had a \"real chance of success\" if pursued by the claimant as an individual, instead of as a mass action.\nGoogle said: \"This claim was related to events that took place a decade ago and that we addressed at the time.\n\"People want to know that they are safe and secure online, which is why for years we've focused on building products and infrastructure that respect and protect people's privacy.\"\nThe Google case - brought by Richard Lloyd, former director of consumer rights group Which? - alleged that between 2011 and 2012, Google cookies collected data on health, race, ethnicity, sexuality and finance through Apple's Safari web browser, even when users had chosen a \"do not track\" privacy setting.\nHe sought compensation for 4.4 million affected users. While each individual iPhone owner would have received a small payout, the fine for Google could have run into billions.\nMr Lloyd said: \"We are bitterly disappointed that the Supreme Court has failed to do enough to protect the public from Google and other big tech firms who break the law.\n\"Although the court once gain recognised that our action is the only practical way that millions of British people can get access to fair redress, they've slammed the door shut on this case by ruling that everyone affected must go to court individually\".\nHe called on the government to step in to make it easier for groups of consumers to take action over data breaches.\nJim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, agreed: \"There must be a way for people to seek redress against massive data breaches.\"\nCurrently, the legal fees would mean that it would be \"completely unreasonable\" for individuals to take on the tech giants, he added.\nThe long-running case began in 2017, and had been through the High Court and the Court of Appeal before being escalated to the UK's Supreme Court.\nIf it had succeeded, it could have opened the floodgates to many more mass actions against tech firms for data breaches.\nSuch actions currently need people to opt-in, which can be a lengthy process. \nThe Lloyd v Google case attempted to set a precedent for opt-out cases, meaning one representative could bring action on behalf of millions.\nTikTok is facing a similar case, brought by former Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield, which alleges that the video-sharing app used children's data without informed consent. And Facebook is involved in a lawsuit alleging that users' data was improperly handled.\nEmily Cox, head of media disputes at law firm Stewarts, told the BBC: \"This decision ensures the floodgates remain firmly closed to data privacy class actions in England and Wales, much to the relief of big tech, but it also leaves consumers without a viable route to compensation for breaches of their privacy rights.\"\nNick McAleenan, a partner at JMW Solicitors, said that future cases would need to balance \"the legal rights and interests of ordinary consumers, and those of the large organisations which process all of our personal data\".\nAnd techUK, the UK's trade association for technology firms, said that if the judgement had gone the other way, it would \"have opened the door for speculative and vexatious claims to be made against data controllers\".\n\"We believe it is right that any action must first seek to establish whether damage has been caused,\" it added.\nGoogle has lost a separate appeal over a \u20ac2.4bn fine imposed in 2017 for distorting competition among price comparison websites.\nThe EU's General Court in Luxembourg dismissed Google's legal challenge, and upheld the fine.\nShivaun Raff, chief executive of Foundem, the lead complainant in that case, welcomed the judgement but added: \"It does not undo the considerable consumer and anti-competitive harm caused by more than a decade of Google's insidious search manipulation practices.\""

      "text": "There were 81 deaths involving Covid in Wales, weekly Office for National Statistics figures show.\nThis was 17 more than the previous week, but numbers are lower than deaths seen in the first or second waves.\nIt takes the total number of registered deaths involving Covid in Wales during the pandemic to 8,432 .\nNumbers in hospital with Covid have risen but remain relatively low, while the highest proportion of cases in the community remain among the under-19s.\nThis has been a feature of the last six weeks, with hundreds more cases being picked up following record numbers of routine lateral flow tests, especially in schools, as well as those people feeling the symptoms of Covid.\nThere were 20 deaths in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, including 14 in hospitals and four in care homes, in the week ending 8 October.\nThere were 17 deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area, 15 deaths in Swansea Bay, 14 in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, seven more in Hywel Dda, six in Cardiff and Vale and two deaths in Powys.\nCeredigion, Newport and Pembrokeshire were the only Welsh counties with no Covid deaths registered in the latest week. Swansea had 10 deaths - three of them in care homes - and there were eight deaths in Rhondda Cynon Taf.\nSo-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, were above average for a 12th week in succession. They had been below average for 18 of the previous 24 weeks. There were 130 deaths (22.1%) above the five-year average in the latest week - more than we've seen since February. \nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in a typical year is seen as a reliable measure of the pandemic. \nThe number of deaths from all causes in Wales rose to 717 in the week ending 8 October, with 11.3% mentioning Covid on the death certificate. \nDeaths were also above average in all UK nations for the week.\nWhen looking across the course of the pandemic so far, there have been 57,779 deaths from all causes in Wales, with 8,413 (14.6%) mentioning Covid-19 on death certificates registered up to 8 October. This was 5,857 deaths above the five-year average. \nWhen deaths registered in the following days are counted, there have been a total of 8,432 deaths.\nThis total for deaths is regarded as giving a fuller picture as it deals with all registered deaths in all settings, while Public Health Wales gives a \"rapid\" report of deaths each day, mainly in hospitals, when Covid has been confirmed in a laboratory.\nThis missed out hundreds of deaths in the first wave, including in care homes.\nThere have been 526 deaths so far in the third wave - an average of four deaths a day since the start of June, although this has increased to an average of 10 deaths a day over the past month. This is compared to 25 deaths a day on average over the whole of the second wave.\nThis period included 20 deaths on both 15 and 29 September - the highest daily totals since 21 February.\nThe week to 17 September included the first child from Wales to die involving Covid - a girl under 14 - but we do not know the full circumstances. A boy under the age of 14 also died in the week up to 1 October.\nThis is now the key indicator and so far, during the third wave hospital numbers have remained relatively low, although they have been rising in recent days.\nThere were 520 hospital patients with confirmed Covid on Monday - the highest daily figure since the start of March. These include 112 in Cardiff and Vale. There are also 108 in beds in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which over the past month has been the hardest-hit area, although this will include some with hospital-acquired infections.\nThe trend is now upwards, from 449 patients a week ago and 14% up on two weeks ago. But at this point in the second wave, it was three times higher.\nIncluding suspected Covid and recovering patients, the number across Wales stands at 716, according to Digital Health and Care Wales. That's 8.4% of all patients in hospital.\nThese include 52 in critical care or on ventilation with Covid. On Sunday, there were 55, the biggest number since late February - but at the peak in January there were 150 and 164 at the first wave peak.\nCovid admissions are at an average of 39 a day - slightly up on a week ago (35) - and they have been within a similar range for nearly a month. The average is currently 3.5% of all hospital admissions. It was three times the average Covid admissions at the same point in the second wave.\nBed occupancy is currently at a weekly average of 89.7% - the highest it's been during the pandemic, reflecting hospitals being busy with other patients and trying to cut into waiting lists.\nThe age profile is important to look at - 48% are under-30s and 41% are under-19s. The biggest proportion is the mostly school-age young people aged 10 to 19, which represent 31% of all cases and almost 1,000 positive tests a day.\nThis has been a consistent factor since early September, coinciding with schools going back, but also a period when there has been more mixing, more people going back to work settings or going to events.\nMeanwhile, almost 31% of 12 to 15-year-olds have now been given the Covid vaccine, Public Health Wales figures show."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It will become compulsory for frontline NHS staff in England to be fully vaccinated against Covid, the health secretary has confirmed.\nSajid Javid told MPs that he expected to set a deadline for the beginning of April to give 103,000 unvaccinated workers time to get both jabs.\nHe said the move would help protect patients and the NHS as a whole.\nBut concerns have been raised that it could lead some workers to leave, adding to healthcare staffing issues.\nMore than 93% of NHS frontline staff have had their first dose and 90% are fully vaccinated, Javid said. That is higher than the general working-age population, where about 81% have had both doses.\nThe government's decision follows a consultation which considered whether both the Covid and flu jabs should be compulsory.\nMr Javid said the flu vaccine would not be made mandatory. \nThose with a medical reason not to have the Covid jab would be exempt, he said, as would those who do not have face-to-face contact with patients.\nIn a Commons statement, Mr Javid said compulsory vaccination would \"protect patients in the NHS, protect colleagues in the NHS and, of course, protect the NHS itself\". \nHe said the requirement would be enforced 12 weeks after parliamentary approval - likely to be from April. \nNo unvaccinated worker should be \"scapegoated or shamed\", said Mr Javid, and should instead be supported to make \"a positive choice\".\nThursday is the deadline for care home workers in England to get vaccinated.\nEach of the four UK nations makes its own decisions on the issue. \nScotland and Wales have not made any proposals to make Covid jabs compulsory for NHS workers or care home staff, while in Northern Ireland there is to be a public consultation.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents England's NHS trusts, said: \"We understand why people are vaccine-hesitant. We need to win the argument with them rather than beat them around the head.\"\nThe possibility of losing staff was a \"real problem\" as the NHS runs on fine margins and already relies on staff to work extra shifts, he added.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged Mr Javid to proceed with caution - pointing to waiting lists \"close to six million\" and more than 90,000 job vacancies across the NHS.\nThere will be anxiety that chronic understaffing problems could be exacerbated, he said. \"We simply cannot afford to lose thousands of NHS staff overnight.\"\nThe logic behind this move is obvious - the virus presents a real risk to vulnerable people in hospital and the vaccine reduces the chances of infection and transmission.\nSo it's not hard to understand why insisting on jabs for staff who have contact with patients will, in theory, help protect patients.\nBut if it causes more staffing shortages that simply increases risk in another way.\nThere are already more than 90,000 vacancies in the NHS in England. It is a number that has actually fallen during the pandemic after staff put off retiring to help out.\nIf those staff take up their option to retire and mandatory vaccination forces others out, the NHS could find itself severely short of staff come the spring.\nMandatory vaccination comes into force for the care sector this week. Since it was announced, only two-thirds of the unvaccinated have come forward.\nIf a similar trend is seen for the NHS, vacancies would likely balloon to unprecedented levels.\nUnison head of health Sara Gorton said she feared the move might knock staff morale further and prompt workers to leave - or lose their job.\nThe government should consider alternatives like daily testing, she said, and not risk making the same mistake made with mandatory jabs in social care - which she said had led to an unprecedented staffing crisis.\nFrom Thursday, care homes will be required to refuse entry to workers who have not been fully vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption or there is an emergency.\nMr Javid said that since announcing the requirement for care staff, the number of unvaccinated workers in the sector has fallen from 88,000 to 32,000 in the last month.\nDouglas Ferguson, a surgeon at Exeter Hospital, said it was the government's responsibility to protect the population, describing the policy as \"quite sensible\". \n\"I think, to be honest, if people who don't want to be vaccinated feel that an injection, which is very well scientifically researched, is something that they decide they're going to change their entire career for, it seems unwise, I would say.\" \nOverall, Mr Ferguson thought the move was likely to be welcomed by staff.\n\"If all the staff know everybody else is vaccinated - I mean the majority are already anyway - I think it would give further confidence in you doing your job and potentially from those members of staff also.\" \nHe added that he only knew of one colleague who had chosen not to be vaccinated. \nThe latest NHS figures show vaccination rates vary hugely: among hospitals, Dorset County hospital has the highest at 94.6%, while Barts Health NHS Trust has the lowest rate of fully vaccinated staff, at 79.7%.\nAt Southampton General Hospital, frontline workers were told by letter in September they would face redeployment if they did not get vaccinated.\nOne worker, who has been redeployed after refusing to get the vaccine, said it was \"disappointing\" but not unexpected that jabs would be made compulsory for NHS workers.\nShe said she felt it was against her human rights to be forced to take the vaccination and said it should be her decision.\n\"I'm angry,\" she said. \"Probably I will just go and get it, what other options have I got?\"\nUniversity Hospital Southampton Trust, which runs the hospital, said a \"small number\" of staff had been redeployed to jobs away from patients as part of its strategy to prevent infection. \nThey were being offered advice and guidance about the vaccine and their permanent jobs and pay were protected, it said.\nSome countries have already introduced compulsory vaccination - including France, which had to suspend 3,000 unvaccinated healthcare workers in September.\nMore than 45.8 million people in the UK have had two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, meaning 79.8% of people aged over 12 are fully vaccinated, while 87.5% have had a first dose.\nVaccinated people have a lower risk of catching Covid and are less likely to become seriously ill or need to go to hospital, but there is still a chance they can transmit the virus.\nThe number of daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 remains high but Tuesday was the sixth day in a row that the figure came in under 40,000, with 33,559 cases reported. A further 262 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, down from 293 for the same day last week.\nCorrection: This story has been amended to make clear that Barts Health NHS Trust has the lowest vaccine take-up rate among trusts running hospitals in England, and not Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust as previously stated."

I thought Brenda would have been home months ago, every week is precious to me and to the family.\n\"The social workers have said there are no carers. The social workers, the hospital and the nurses have been doing a fantastic job, but there is no communication (with the trust).\"\nHe said it was a \"guessing game\" as to when his wife might return home.\nDue to Covid-19 visiting restrictions, visiting has been limited too.\nMrs Devine has not seen her son, granddaughter or wider family since she was first admitted to hospital.\nMr Devine said the situation was \"soul-destroying... heartbreaking for the whole family\".\n\"When Brenda was here, my mind was full. I enjoyed helping her, if it was the other way around she would do anything for me,\" he said.\n\"The hospital at the minute is not the place for her, and we have a home for her.\"\nIn August, figures from each of Northern Ireland's health trusts showed almost 2,000 people were waiting for care packages, mainly so they could be supported to live in their own homes.\nThe latest figures from the Department of Health show that as of October the number of people waiting for a care package, many of whom are in care homes, has dropped to 1,657.\nThat includes:\nBBC News NI understands that many front-line care staff feel the number waiting on care packages could be much higher.\nBernadine McCrory, operations director of the Alzheimer's Society, said Brenda's situation was not an isolated case.\n\"We have had reports [of shortage of carers] from all of the trusts so this is across all of Northern Ireland,\" Ms McCrory told BBC Radio Foyle.\nShe said cases like Mrs Devine's should be addressed urgently.\n\"While she may be in a hospital ward, she is socially isolated from her family as she can only see her husband and her daughter,\" she said. \n\"We really have got to start thinking of the value of the family carers because they are saving our health service thousands a week, but we aren't getting investment in the system to allow family carers to continue to do this.\" \nThe Department of Health said a range of measures had been taken to try and address the shortage of carers in Northern Ireland.\nThat includes ongoing recruitment drives and the establishment of a social care forum. A publicity campaign promoting social care as a career is also planned.\n\"Whilst these have been successful in recruiting new workers, this has not been in the numbers required to address the increasing demand,\" the spokeswoman said.\nHow care at home will be provided in the longer term, the spokeswoman said, will be shaped by the work of the Reform of Adult Social Care."

She has been released on bail.\nJack Lis died at the scene of Monday's attack at Pentwyn, Penyrheol.\nMeanwhile, a man who tried to pull the dog off Jack said he wished he could have done more to save him.\n\"That will be with me for the rest of my life,\" said Kirk Wiegold.\n\"My thoughts and love are with the young boy, Jack's family, at this sad time.\n\"I wish I could have done more than I did to help the young boy... but there was nothing I could do.\"\nTwo men who volunteered to be spoken to by police in relation to the same offence as the woman were also later released.\nThey were a 34-year-old from Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and a 19-year-old from Caerphilly.\nJack and his friend were alone when the attack happened.\nThe 10-year-old's friend sought the help of Mr Wiegold, who lives several doors down on the same street, but he was unable to stop the dog.\nGwent Police said work was continuing to identify the breed of the dog, which people locally have claimed was a type of American pit bull.\nCaerphilly MP Wayne David said it was a \"terrible, horrible incident which should never have happened\".\nHe said there should be a review of the Dangerous Dogs Act as a \"matter of urgency\".\n\"We need to have in place more protection for members of the public and that requires the legislation to be revisited, but it needs to be done quickly and speedily,\" he added.\n\"What has happened in Caerphilly has to be put in a broader context.

      "tags": "House of Commons,Conservative Party,Keir Starmer,Owen Paterson,UK Parliament",
      "text": "Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Cox has said he did not break parliamentary rules by carrying out paid legal work in his House of Commons office.\nThe ex-attorney general, who has made almost \u00a3900,000 in the last year as a barrister, apparently took part in a virtual meeting there on 14 September.\nMPs cannot use public resources, including parliamentary offices, for \"personal or financial benefit\".\nSir Geoffrey said it was up to voters to decide whether he remains an MP.\nLabour has referred his case for investigation to the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.\nLast month, Conservative MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken rules by lobbying the government on behalf of companies who were paying him - and for using his Commons office for business meetings, which is prohibited.\nHis case has raised questions about the extra work some MPs do on top of their parliamentary jobs.\nMPs are allowed to do extra jobs - for example, as doctors or lawyers, or writing books or giving speeches - but they must declare their additional income along with gifts and donations.\nSir Geoffrey, 61, the MP for Torridge and West Devon since 2005, has continued to practise as a barrister.\nHis work includes advising the British Virgin Islands government inquiry into alleged corruption.\nVideo footage from September - revealed by the Times newspaper on Wednesday - is available online of Sir Geoffrey participating in a virtual hearing for the inquiry from what appears to be his Commons office.\nAt one point he gets up from his chair, returning to it around half an hour later. His absence occurred at about the same time as MPs, including Sir Geoffrey, were voting on the government's health and social care funding reforms.\nAt a later point, he excuses himself for the rest of the hearing, saying: \"Would you forgive me for not being present this afternoon? I'm afraid I have compelling other commitments...\n\"Forgive my absence during some of the morning. I'm afraid the bell went off.\"\nThis appears to be a reference to the division bell, which rings when MPs are summoned to the Commons to vote.\nA statement on behalf of Sir Geoffrey, posted on his website, says: \"He does not believe that he breached the rules but will of course accept the judgement of the Parliamentary Commissioner or of the Committee [on Public Standards] on the matter.\"\n\"Sir Geoffrey regularly works 70-hour weeks and always ensures that his casework on behalf of his constituents is given primary importance and fully carried out.\"\nAnd it adds: \"Sir Geoffrey's view is that it is up to the electors of Torridge and West Devon whether or not they vote for someone who is a senior and distinguished professional in his field and who still practises that profession.\n\"That has been the consistent view of the local Conservative Association and although at every election his political opponents have sought to make a prominent issue of his professional practice, it has so far been the consistent view of the voters of Torridge and West Devon. Sir Geoffrey is very content to abide by their decision.\"\nSir Geoffrey is also under fire for voting from the British Virgin Islands, while working there during the period when MPs were permitted to vote by proxy, or remotely, because of the pandemic.\nIn his statement, he says he consulted the Conservative chief whip \"specifically on this issue and was advised that it was appropriate\".\nTorridge and West Devon Conservative Association chairman John Gray said: \"Geoffrey Cox is a superb constituency MP.\n\"He combines a strong ethos of public service with an astonishing work ethic and valuable legal expertise.\"\nMeanwhile, it has also emerged that Sir Geoffrey - who was sacked from the cabinet last February - spoke at a webinar on Brexit, hosted by Withers, the law firm he was working for, in November 2020.\nHe had been told by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, the watchdog that is meant to police jobs taken on by former ministers, not to offer \"privileged insight\" from his time in government, including on Brexit negotiations, to the law firm.\nDuring his remarks, Sir Geoffrey talked in general terms about his experience preparing for Brexit in cabinet committees.\nA spokesperson for Withers said: \"In all activities in connection with Withers - whether it be at speaking engagements or in his legal advice - Geoffrey Cox QC has not disclosed any privileged information from his time in Government and has been very conscious of the constraints that apply to him.\"\nSir Geoffrey's lengthy statement is a clear attempt to offer a thorough defence of his actions. \nHe makes the point that he's never sought to hide his highly paid work as a barrister and that voters in his constituency have so far not seen it as a problem. \nLocal Tories talk in glowing terms about the \"astonishing work ethic\" of their \"superb\" MP. \nBut Labour won't let this go and have zeroed in on Sir Geoffrey's reported use of his office while undertaking additional paid work. \nOn that he seems to believe he's done nothing wrong. \nInterestingly, he draws into this drama a couple of government figures whose approval he sought along the way. \nThe Conservative chief whip Mark Spencer, who Sir Geoffrey says he consulted about voting by proxy while abroad and was told it was \"appropriate\". \nAnd the Attorney General Suella Braverman whose office advised there was no conflict of interest around his work in the British Virgin Islands. \nThe code of conduct prohibits:\nMPs must also declare:\nDeputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: \"A Conservative MP using a taxpayer funded office in Parliament to work for a tax haven facing allegations of corruption is a slap in the face and an insult to British taxpayers.\n\"The prime minister needs to explain why he has an MP in his parliamentary party that treats Parliament like a co-working space allowing him to get on with all of his other jobs instead of representing his constituents.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has himself earned more than \u00a3100,000 from legal work since he became an MP in 2015, performing some legal work while he was a shadow cabinet member. He stopped in 2019 when he stood to be party leader.\nAsked about MPs working outside Parliament, Sir Keir said Labour wanted consultancies and partnerships ruled out, but that some types of employment, such as doctors working in hospitals, should be allowed.\nHe said the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards should be the person to decide which jobs were allowed, saying: \"I think there has to be a bit of common sense on this, which side of the line cases fall.\""

      "tags": "Companies,Retailing,Halfords,Marks & Spencer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Marks and Spencer reported a surge in profits as its food division helped it bounce back after Covid restrictions.\nBoss Steve Rowe said growth was boosted by pent-up demand after lockdown, but the retailer was also seeing the benefit of its long restructuring.\nPre-tax profits for the six months to October were \u00a3187m - 17.9% up on the period two years ago before Covid hit.\nBut M&S said it was planning for \"significant\" increases in supply chain costs because of worker shortages.\nThe retailer also forecast costs will rise during the rest of the financial year and be \"steeper again\" in 2022-23.\nDuring the six months, food sales increased by 10.4%, while overall sales in clothing and home fell by 1%, but full-price sales rose 17.3%.\nMr Rowe said that \"for the first time we can see that the hard yards of driving long-term change are beginning to be borne out in our performance\".\nDespite the strong results, Mr Rowe said that \"given the history of M&S\", the company wouldn't \"overclaim our progress\".\nOn the back of the firm's half-year results, M&S shares were up 20% on Wednesday morning, despite the warnings over driver and warehouse worker shortages.\nLike many other companies, M&S said lorry driver shortages were posing challenges, but added it had deployed several recruitment projects and incentives to attract new drivers and that it believed its food business was \"comparatively well placed\" to deal with the shortages. \nThe department store added it hoped to drive \"long-term growth and loyalty\" by offering a better service and quality through its food delivery deal with Ocado.\nM&S owns a 50% share of Ocado's retail business, which switched to delivering M&S food in September 2020.\nCommenting on the latest results, Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said M&S's move to raise its full-year profit forecast to about \u00a3500m showed \"how lucrative the food arm of the business has become\".\n\"Marks and Spencer may have been late to the grocery e-commerce party, but arriving with Ocado in arm, it's muscled into a prime spot on the dance floor, and is enjoying the hits\", she said.\n\"It looks like this long suffering high street stalwart has turned a sharp corner, proof that management's transformation strategy is paying off. Rather than a department store which sells food as an extra, Marks is metamorphosing into a grocery powerhouse which sells clothes and homewear as add-ons.\"\nJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, agreed M&S's food business continued to be the company's \"cash cow\", but warned the company would need to hold on to its transformed brand and soften the impact of supply chain issues to if it \"hopes to avoid disappointing investors this festive period\".\nMeanwhile, Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said Marks & Spencer \"was one of many companies where the pandemic forced accelerated change and the results are beginning to bear fruit\".\n\"Perhaps most noticeable is that the slumbering giant which was the clothing and home business is showing signs of renewed life,\" he said.\n\"Previously seen as tired and dowdy, the general offering has been reinvigorated and the signs to date are promising.\"\n\"It's quite nice to be making some money again,\" quipped Archie Norman, the chairman of M&S, on its glossy results presentation video.  \nThis retailer has been through umpteen turnaround plans, but is this latest one, started four years ago, finally starting to yield results? \nThese figures certainly show encouraging signs, with a bounce back in sales from the worst of the pandemic last year. \nThe business has also emerged in better shape. Food is driving sales and profits, but full-price clothing sales are also up 17%, delivering higher profits in this division, too. \nAnd online sales have increased by 60% compared with two years ago. M&S now needs to deliver Christmas amid all the operational challenges this crucial trading period will bring. \nThere are plenty of supply chain issues and cost pressures bearing down on all retailers.  But after years of false dawns, this is a business that now feels confident that it is on the right track. \nElsewhere, Halfords said sales rose by 19.2% compared with two years ago, \"despite the known supply chain disruption\".\nGraham Stapleton, chief executive, said demand for bicycles remained \"good\", adding the company was \"pleased\" with the current availability of children's bicycles and electric bikes in the run-up to Christmas.\nHowever, Mr Stapleton said \"moving anything\" around the world in the past six months had been \"particularly challenging\", with freight costs sometimes as high as 10 times the normal rate.\n\"Even if goods are manufactured and a container is found to ship them to the UK, the recent HGV driver shortage has meant that this final leg of the supply chain has been more costly and unreliable,\" he said."

      "text": "Suspending the Northern Ireland part of the Brexit deal will be the \"only option\" if UK-EU talks fail to resolve problems, Lord Frost has said. \nThe UK's Brexit minister gave an update after almost four weeks of intensive talks to address the standoff.\nBut he said the UK was \"not giving up\" yet and he wished to remain positive.\nThe EU has promised a \"clear response\" if the UK triggers Article 16 - a safeguarding mechanism within the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nThe protocol is a post-Brexit trading arrangement specific to Northern Ireland, but the UK wants changes to the deal it agreed with the EU in 2019.\nThe deal struck two years ago was aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland but critics argue it is disrupting trade and undermining Northern Ireland's position within the UK. \nArticle 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol is a measure which allows either the UK or the EU to take unilateral action if they believe the arrangement is causing serious problems.\nThe UK has been warning since July that it believes the conditions have already been met to trigger Article 16 but is still trying to avoid that outcome through further talks. \nThere is growing speculation that the move could be just weeks away.\nEuropean Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic has finished briefing EU ambassadors on the negotiations.\nSuggestions out of the private meeting are that he did not bring much \"good news\", although hope remained for \"productive\" negotiations.\nOne diplomat told the BBC's Katya Adler the EU was \"preparing for the triggering of Article 16 by the UK\".\n\"There is consensus among EU member states that such an arbitrary and unjustified move by the UK will be met with a clear European response,\" they said.\nAnother diplomat suggested Britain's demands on the protocol remained unrealistic. \n\"The UK wants to eliminate checks altogether and have a system where only goods going through to Ireland are checked, though UK has no idea how we should do that.\" \nSpeaking in the House of Lords on Wednesday, Lord Frost said: \"If the talks do in the end fail, we will of course publish in full our assessment of the EU's proposals and set out why they fall short of a durable settlement, but we will not do so until we have exhausted all the negotiating possibilities.\"\nThere is growing speculation that the UK is planning to use Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the coming weeks.\nThe Irish government says such a move would be \"reckless and irresponsible\", and Maros Sefcovic has warned it could result in \"serious consequences\".\nUltimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods - but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process.\nThe arbitrators would first have to find that the UK is in breach of the protocol.\nThen the UK would have to refuse to remedy that breach, at which point the EU could retaliate under the terms of the wider Brexit deal, the TCA.\nIt could require another arbitration process to rule whether the use of tariffs is proportionate retaliation.\nThere is a potentially faster legal track - known as infringement proceedings - which could lead to the UK being fined.\nRead the full analysis here.\nThe minister argued that triggering Article 16 would be \"wholly consistent\" with the UK's legal obligations even though the EU disputes that position.\nHowever, Lord Frost urged the EU to \"stay calm\" and \"turn away from confrontation\" over the protocol.\n\"If the EU were to choose to react in a disproportionate way, and decide to aggravate the problems in Northern Ireland rather than reduce them, that is of course a matter for them,\" he said.\n\"But at that point we would be entitled to come to our own judgement about how much value we could attach to their commitment to supporting the peace process and the people of Northern Ireland as against protecting their own interests.\"\nLord Frost will meet his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic on Friday for a fourth round of discussions.\nDemocratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he had a \"useful discussion\" with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) M\u00edche\u00e1l Martin.\n\"Dublin is a key influencer in Brussels. They must use that influence to reach a sensible outcome which is sustainable and can command the support of unionists in Northern Ireland,\" he said.\nSpeaking to the in the D\u00e1il (lower house of parliament) on Wednesday, Mr Martin called on the UK government to \"double down on dialogue\" over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\"Discussions are still ongoing,\" he said. \"I would just sound a note of caution that we don't automatically assume that anything is going to be triggered.\n\"We don't want a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy either.\"\nHe also warned that the move would impact Northern Ireland's dual access to European and UK markets provided under the protocol.\nTanaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar said suspending the protocol would be a \"big mistake\" and urged UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to do so.\n\"It's a mistake to think that, by escalating tensions, by withdrawing from any part of it or trying to withdraw from any part of it, that you'll end up with a better deal,\" he said.\n\"You won't.\"\nAlliance MP Stephen Farry said triggering Article 16 had become a \"Sword of Damocles\" over negotiations. \n\"Its [Article 16] use will do nothing to address the issues around the protocol, and will only bring greater instability and uncertainty for Northern Ireland, while sparking wider confrontation with the EU that would only damage the overall UK economy,\" he said.\nIn the US, several senior members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee published a joint statement criticising the UK's position on the protocol standoff as \"dangerous\". \n\"The Good Friday Agreement and broader peace process took patience and time to build, with good faith contributions from the communities in Northern Ireland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and others,\" they said. \n\"In threatening to invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, the United Kingdom threatens to not only destabilize trade relations, but also that hard earned peace. \n\"We call on the UK to abandon this dangerous path, and to commit to implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in full.\""

      "text": "About 37 million people have now had booster Covid vaccine doses across the UK - more than 64% of those eligible.\nThe government is urging everyone who can, to come forward and receive the jab.\nFor most people in the UK, the Covid vaccine is not mandatory.\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has reconfirmed that the government wants all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) to be fully vaccinated by 1 April if they want to to keep their job.\nCare home staff in England must also already be vaccinated (unless exempt).\nMeanwhile a number of employers, including Morrisons, Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water have cut sick pay for unvaccinated workers who are forced to isolate after being exposed to Covid.\nEmployees will receive only the statutory-sick-pay (SSP) minimum (\u00a396.35 per week), unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nAll staff who test positive for the virus will still receive full sick pay, regardless of their vaccination status.\nAcross the UK, Covid passports providing vaccination status or negative test results are required to enter some venues.\nMany foreign countries are restricting entry to vaccinated travellers or imposing restrictions on those who are not. \nIn England boosters are now available to all over-16s three months after their second dose - but appointments can be booked after two months. Some walk-in appointments are also available. \nIn Scotland boosters can be booked online.\nIn Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.\nIn Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. \nEarly studies from UK researchers suggested a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - provides 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).\nMore antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. \nIt makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.\nPfizer has started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.\nModerna will soon begin trials of its own Omicron-specific jab, and AstraZeneca has also started working on a new version of its vaccine.\nAll children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.\nA low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children aged five to 11 who have health conditions putting them at greater risk from catching Covid. Eligible children in this age group are now being invited for vaccination in Scotland\nPrimary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said. \nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also recommended that the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged 12-15 if they:\nIt is not yet clear when children will get these doses.\nAbout 16 and 17-year-olds in England who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago are being invited to have their booster.  \nThey can make an appointment or attend a drop-in clinic, as can eligible children of the same age in Scotland.\nChildren who are not considered to be at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive Covid test before having the vaccine.\nYour booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.\nIf you have recently tested positive for Covid, you should wait four weeks from the date of the test before having your booster.\nYou shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  \nThe vaccines do not infect you with Covid, and cannot cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.\nYou can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.\nIn particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.\nThe most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.\nThey are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.\nThere are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. \nAnd a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.\nYou should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated."

The longest had been a 41 hour rescue, and this operation took more than 53 hours.\nAnother caver, who had been caving with the man, notified police about the incident.\nThe complex Ogof Ffynnon Ddu cave system is about 902ft (275m) at its deepest point.\nIt is the second largest in Wales and one of the deepest in the UK.\nSome of the cave rescuers who helped are internationally renowned, and some have travelled from as far as North Yorkshire.\nSome were also involved in the Thai cave rescue in 2018. \nThe caves were discovered by the South Wales Caving Club in 1946, according to Natural Resources Wales, and contain a number of underground streams and waterfalls.\nThey can only be accessed by cavers with a permit from the caving club.\nThe caving club's website describes Ogof Ffynnon Ddu:\n\"The through trip from the top to the bottom entrance remains a classic in the UK, and its approx 61km [38 miles] of passages provide everything from huge chambers, beautiful formations, to yawning chasms and thundering river passages,\" it said.\n\"The routes through the cave are too numerous to mention.\"\nIt adds: \"Be aware that the mainstream and some other parts of the cave are prone to flooding, and in any event a journey down the mainstream is long and cold and wet, so go prepared.\""

      "tags": "Medical research,Coronavirus lockdown measures,Coronavirus testing,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A major analysis of the spread of Covid within hospitals has shown a massive gulf in ability to contain the virus during the first wave. \nOverall, more than one in 10 people in hospital with Covid actually caught the virus while they were there. \nBut the analysis of 314 UK hospitals showed that ranged from just one in 100 cases caught in hospital, to more than one in four. \nThe researchers said the wide variation needed \"urgent investigation\".\nThe study, by nine UK universities and published in the Lancet, analysed hospital data from two-thirds of Covid patients in the first wave.\nThey estimate between 5,700 and 11,900 people were infected in hospital. \n\"There will be tragedy behind this story, people that came into hospital with one problem, caught Covid and sadly died,\" one of the researchers, Prof Calum Semple, from the University of Liverpool, said.\nThere was a stark difference between general hospitals, which the researchers said could not be explained by the number of patients coming in the door. \n\"Even hospitals with literally thousands of patients coming in there are outstanding examples of infection control,\" Prof Semple said. \n\"There's a number of factors - we know there were challenges around PPE [personal protective (or protection) equipment] at the start.\"\nThe design of some hospitals - such as those with more side rooms - would also affect how easy it was to contain Covid. \nThe availability of testing, which is now used to separate Covid and non-Covid patients, may also have been an issue. \n\"Reliable tests in the emergency department, that come back within the hour, has been a game-changer and has made my life a million times easier,\" critical-care consultant Dr Annemarie Docherty, from the University of Edinburgh, said.\nSpecialist residential hospitals had even bigger challenges with the virus spreading. \nMore than two-thirds of Covid cases in mental-health hospitals were caught there. \nThings are improving, though. \nThe average proportion of cases caught in hospital was 11% in the first wave but now stands at 2-5% despite the emergence of the more infectious Delta variant, first identified in India.\nPart of this will be down to understanding of the virus and how it spreads, such as airborne and asymptomatic transmission, that has emerged since the early days of the pandemic.\nDr Doherty said: \"The underlying reasons for these high rates of transmission in hospitals at the peak of the first wave must be investigated, so that we can improve safety and outcomes for our patients. \n\"Rates are considerably lower a year on, and people should not be deterred from attending hospital if they are unwell.\"\nA spokesman for NHS England said infections were proven to be less common in hospitals than other places. \n\"Hospital infection rates account for less than 1% of all Covid cases since the pandemic began and since asymptomatic tests kits were made available for the first time by the government's test-and-trace programme in November, millions of staff have been tested to help to keep infection rates as low as possible,\" he added.\nFollow James on Twitter."

      "text": "When the organisers of one of the UK's most important international events in years conceived of the COP26 summit, the prime minister himself told colleagues he wanted to create the same kind of buzz as the happy 2012 Olympics summer.\nSo I'm not entirely sure they imagined Boris Johnson would end up, on a stage visible to the world's media, reassuring people that he \"genuinely believes\" the UK is not a corrupt country - moments after exhorting his counterparts to crack on with helping to tackle climate change. \nBut to absolutely no one's surprise, the PM's press conference after his brief return to the Glasgow conference was dominated by questions about the story that's been occupying so many minds in Westminster this week.  \nFour hundred miles wasn't enough to provide political distance for the prime minister from the mess in London SW1.  \nThat's partly because the allegations keep coming. \nOne of his former cabinet colleagues, Sir Geoffrey Cox, was revealed today not just to have been paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for legal work in the past few years, something which was widely known and had been declared publicly. \nBut footage of some of the MP's lucrative work, posted online seems to show him taking part in a session in his Commons office - he even apologises for leaving because the division bell rang.\nIn other words, he had to nip out to go and vote. \nThat took the accusations against him into a different territory, because while MPs are allowed to have second jobs, they are not allowed to use taxpayer-funded resources, or premises, to do so. \nThere's now likely to be an investigation about what he got up to, even though in his first public statement since claims about his sojourn in the Caribbean emerged, he denied breaking the rules.\nNor is there an easy exit from the tangle for the prime minister because unlike his colleagues, he has repeatedly refused to apologise for trying last week to rip up the rules that govern MPs' behaviour and protect another senior MP, Owen Paterson. \nHe was asked repeatedly if he was sorry on Monday, and refused to say so. \nUnshockingly, the same thing happened on Wednesday, which leaves the sore running. \nThe other awkward truth for Downing Street is that even though it's the behaviour of just a few dozen MPs that's being called into question, most of them are Conservatives, which is a fact they cannot avoid. \nAnd as we talked about on Monday, the prime minister's own handling of what's happening and his own attitude to the rules has infuriated many of his own colleagues, and that feeling has not gone. \nLast, by mentioning the allegations of corruption laid at the government's door, Boris Johnson has perhaps reinforced the criticism from the opposition, even if, by international standards, it is important to say the UK is nowhere near the top of the list. \n(According to one measure, by campaign group Transparency International, the UK is just outside the top 10 of the world's least corrupt countries.) \nForty-eight hours ago, Downing Street was hoping that the political explosion around Mr Paterson's case was fading. \nBut there's little sign of that, and if Boris Johnson's trip to Glasgow, was, as some suspected, partly an attempt to distract attention from the sleaze saga, it hasn't worked. \nPS Downing Street may be aware that all is not entirely well.  \nFile this under niche, but interesting to political obsessives. Ben Gascoigne, a long-standing staffer who quit Number 10 not so long ago, is returning as a new deputy chief of staff. \nHe worked with Boris Johnson for years before Number 10, with no particular allegiance to either Vote Leave or the more recent circle in Downing Street, who are often seen as close to Michael Gove or Carrie Johnson. \nHe's one of the few people in Westminster without visible enemies and his return this week is being seen by some as an acknowledgement that there have been gaps in the team in charge. \nIt's not entirely clear what it means for the existing pecking order in the Downing Street machine."

However, over time our participation in the Programme has led some to question whether the BBC can be impartial when reporting on public policy debates where Stonewall is taking an active role. \n\"After careful consideration, we believe it is time to step back from the Diversity Champions Programme and will also no longer participate in Stonewall's Workplace Equality Index. \n\"Being a part of the Diversity Champions Programme has never required the BBC to support the campaigns of Stonewall, nor its policy positions. As a broadcaster, we have our own values and editorial standards - these are clearly set out and published in our Editorial Guidelines. We are also governed by the Royal Charter and the Ofcom Broadcasting Code. Our journalists continue, as ever, to report a full range of perspectives on stories.\n\"Although the BBC will not be renewing its participation in the Diversity Champions Programme, in the future we will continue to work with a range of external organisations, including Stonewall, on relevant projects to support our LGBTQ+ staff.\"\nStonewall said it was \"a shame\" that the BBC had decided not to renew its membership.\n\"We will continue to engage with the BBC on a number of fronts to champion support for LGBTQ+ colleagues and to represent our communities through their reporting,\" a statement said.\nIt added: \"It is shocking that organisations are being pressured into rolling back support for LGBTQ+ employees.\"\nStonewall says more than 900 organisations in the UK have signed up to the Diversity Champions scheme, which aims to promote inclusion in the workplace.\nIt is described by Stonewall as \"the leading employers' programme for ensuring all LGBTQ+ staff are free to be themselves in the workplace\".\nMedia watchdog Ofcom, the Equality Human Rights Commission and the government's Cabinet Office, Equalities Office and Ministry of Justice are among the other bodies to have pulled out.\nThe BBC's decision comes almost two weeks after director general Tim Davie unveiled a new 10-point impartiality plan."

      "text": "A former police officer says he is keeping his promise to his friend and colleague PC Yvonne Fletcher, as a civil trial opens into her murder, which happened nearly 40 years ago.\nPC Fletcher, 25, was killed by shots fired from the Libyan People's Bureau in London on April 17 1984.\nAs she lay dying, fellow officer John Murray promised her he would find those responsible and bring them to justice.\nHe has brought a civil case against Salah Ibrahim Mabrouk, who is in Libya.\nThe allegation is not that Mr Mabrouk fired the actual shots but that he was jointly liable for the events that took place. \nMr Murray told the BBC that he was determined to stand by his commitment to PC Fletcher. \"I am keeping that promise. My job is nearly over. My job was to get someone in a court of law and I think I've done it.\"\nAdding it was a \"wonderful feeling\" to see the case begin. \"It's taken a long, long time to get here\". \nThe murder was described in court as \"state sponsored act of terrorism\" for which \"no one has ever been brought to justice\". \n\"This is a very strange trial,\" Philippa Kaufmann QC, acting for Mr Murray, acknowledged, since Mr Mabrouk is not defending the case and also because the events are more than 37 years old. \nShe said there had been a \"total lack of accountability for the murder\". \nThe shots, the court was told, came from two Sterling sub-machine guns within the embassy and were aimed at protesters against the then-Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi. \nIt heard that PC Fletcher collapsed into fellow officers when she was shot. \nMr Murray carried her to an ambulance and accompanied her to hospital where she died.\nLater Mr Murray was asked to identify her body. In written submissions, the court heard he has since suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\"It was tough,\" he said of the opening day of the court hearing where video of the immediate aftermath was shown. \"There's some things I couldn't look at and some things I couldn't really listen to.\" \nMr Mabrouk had been detained by police earlier on the morning of the shooting. He had been involved in a confrontation as barriers were being put up in advance of the protest. \n\"We have guns here today, there is going to be fighting,\" he was alleged to have told one of the men putting up the barriers, the court heard.\nIn written submissions, the court was told it was \"inconceivable\" that Mr Mabrouk was not at the heart of decision-making over the use of violence and that the \"orchestration\" of the shooting was \"entirely consistent\" with his role at the building.\nThe court was shown pictures taken by a police photographer inside the building showing pistols and ammunition.\nMr Mabrouk was deported after the shooting, but later returned to the UK.\nPolice arrested him in 2015 in connection with the murder. But the case was dropped in 2017 when the Crown Prosecution Service said that evidence could not be admitted for reasons of national security. \nThat has led to today's civil case. Mr Murray, a close friend as well as colleague of PC Fletcher, is only seeking \u00a31 in vindicatory damages.\nMr Mabrouk has since been excluded from the UK and is not represented in court. \nIn a statement to Mr Murray's lawyers he said: \"I cannot apologise for something I didn't do\u2026 I had no role in the sad killing of WPC Fletcher.\" \nMr Murray said it was \"disappointing\" that Mr Mabrouk wasn't present. \"He's been given every opportunity to be here... I would really like to look him in the eye.\"\nThe case continues and is expected to last three days."

      "text": "Poland faced \"many attempts\" to breach the border with Belarus overnight but now has 15,000 troops to repel them, the defence minister has said.\nSeveral thousand migrants have become stranded at the border, at the centre of an escalating international row.\nFor months, the EU, and now Nato and the US, have accused Belarus's authoritarian leader of provoking a renewed migrant crisis in Europe.\nEver-increasing numbers have headed to Belarus's borders with the EU.\nAlexander Lukashenko, who won a largely discredited election last year, denies luring would-be migrants - mostly from the Middle East - to the EU's borders in retaliation for sanctions imposed since he brutally cracked down on protesters and opponents. \nThe situation has come to a head this week with repeated attempts to tear down the razor-wire fence erected on Poland's eastern frontier.\n\"It wasn't a calm night. Indeed, there were many attempts to breach the Polish border,\" Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak told Polish radio. \nPolice spoke of two separate incidents involving groups of about 50 people. Meanwhile, the border guard said in the past day there had been 599 attempts to cross illegally and that nine people, all from the Middle East, had been detained.\nPoland and Belarus have accused each other of violence towards migrants camped near the fence. Those claims are difficult to verify as a BBC team and other journalists have been barred from the area because of a local Polish state of emergency.\nHowever, the defence ministry in Warsaw tweeted a video alleging that a Belarusian soldier fired a shot to intimidate the migrants camped near the fence. \nOvernight temperatures at the border have fallen below freezing and some of the people stranded there have warned they are running out of food and water. \nAid workers complain that Poland's state of emergency means they are unable to enter the affected area: \"For us it is heart-breaking. We are here, near the border and we cannot enter the zone and help people. We can only help those who manage to cross the border and make it out of the restricted area,\" Ania Chmielewska told the BBC.\nThe defence minister said earlier attempts had focused on the area around a major border crossing at Kuznica but latest efforts are more spread out. Border breaches have involved the use of bolt cutters and tree trunks, as Polish guards try to fend them off. \nMany of the migrants are young men but there are also women and children, mostly from the Middle East and Asia. \nThe European Commission says Mr Lukashenko enticed migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an \"inhuman, gangster-style approach\" and it has listed some 20 countries from which migrants have flown into Minsk, mainly on tourist visas.\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Wednesday that the EU would not be blackmailed. He said the bloc would work to extend sanctions on Belarus: \"We will sanction all those who participate in the targeted smuggling of migrants.\" \nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called on the EU on Wednesday to block flights from the Middle East to Belarus.\nThe capital, Minsk, has regular flights from destinations across the Middle East, including Istanbul, Dubai, Damascus and Baghdad. Belarus state carrier Belavia has daily flights from Istanbul and also serves Beirut and Dubai. \nIn August, the EU asked Iraqi authorities to suspend all flights from Baghdad to Belarus, but it appears to have been just a temporary measure. \nInformation from FlightRadar24, which monitors flights in real time, shows a scheduled flight to Minsk due to arrive from Baghdad on Thursday. And there are other indirect routes migrants could use if they wanted to reach Belarus.\nThe Polish leader earlier accused Russia's President Putin as well as Belarus of trying to destabilise the European Union - which the two countries are not part of - by allowing migrants to travel through Belarus and enter the bloc.\nRussia has in turn blamed the EU. Mr Putin's spokesman rejected the Polish prime minister's accusation, saying that \"this is nothing other than further attempts to actually strangle Belarus\".\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel phoned Mr Putin on Wednesday, asking him to press Belarus to stop the \"instrumentalisation of migrants\", her spokesman said.\nBelarus Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei, on a visit to Moscow, said he was looking for mutual support from Russia and blamed the EU for provoking the crisis. In an apparent gesture to Belarus, Russia said it was sending two bomber planes to patrol its neighbour's airspace.\nDozens of Polish police vehicles race to the village of Kuznica where up to 4,000 migrants are effectively trapped. \nThe area remains out of bounds for media and, crucially, aid agencies - much to their despair. \nOne man we contacted, an Iraqi Kurd, told us they'd endured another night in freezing conditions and asked us in exasperation what sort of life this was.\nWhen I then asked what they were all doing for food, he said the Belarusians were providing supplies. But other migrants have also told us the Belarus security forces are also giving out wire-cutters to help break through the fence in places where Poland's numerous guards are thin on the ground.\nPoland has been accused of pushing migrants back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. \n\"Nobody is letting us get in anywhere, Belarus or Poland,\" said 33-year-old Shwan Kurd, who described arriving in Belarus at the start of November.\n\"There's no way to escape,\" he said. \"Poland won't let us in. We are so hungry. There's no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women, and families.\"\nAre you in the area? Have you been affected by what's been happening?

      "text": "A convicted paedophile who left a runaway teenager to die on a bus will serve at least four years in jail. \nDerek McNeill, 52, failed to get medical attention for Blake Ross, 13, on a bus in Edinburgh in February 2017 as he became increasingly ill from Type 1 diabetes.\nIn June he was found guilty of cruelty to a child. \nAt the High Court in Livingston he was sentenced to an order for lifelong restriction. \nHe must serve four years in prison before being considered for parole, and he will remain under the supervision of a criminal justice social worker for the rest of his life. \nSentencing McNeill, Lord Weir paid tribute to the \"admirable efforts\" of the Lothian Buses staff and the emergency services in helping Blake. \nHe said their actions stood in \"depressingly marked contrast to the neglect and abuse\" McNeill subjected the child to over the last two days of his life. \nThe High Court in Edinburgh earlier heard that McNeill had not told anyone Blake was in his Edinburgh flat while police and members of his family searched for him.\nThe teenager was in the care of a council-run close support unit - he left without his medication on Saturday 11 February, 2017.\nMcNeill, a complete stranger, approached him late at night as he walked through the city's Wester Hailes area.\nThat chance meeting led to Blake spending two nights in the older man's filthy home. \nThe youngster's health deteriorated over the course of the weekend. On Monday 13 February, McNeill put him on a bus, paid his fare and left him to his fate. \nBlake travelled on two buses and was seen slumping down at a bus stop.\nA bus driver raised the alarm but despite desperate attempts to save his life, the teenager died in Edinburgh's Sick Kids Hospital.\nLord Weir said it was clear McNeill was a \"very high risk of causing sexual harm to children\".\n\"The nature and circumstances of the crime you were found to have committed, coupled with your record, the many risk factors identified, and the lack of any discernible protective factors, are such as to satisfy me that there is a likelihood that, if at liberty, you will seriously endanger the lives, or the physical or psychological well-being, of members of the public at large,\" he added.

      "tags": "Nigeria,China,Russia,COP26,Iran,Brazil,Climate change,Environment,India,Saudi Arabia,United States,Australia",
      "text": "It's the end of week one at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, and world leaders have already made some big commitments.\nMore than 40 countries have promised to phase out coal by 2050, and another 100 leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. \nThe US and EU, meanwhile, announced that they would partner up to cut methane emissions.\nBBC reporters across the globe - from Shanghai to Sao Paulo - explain how the summit and the climate pledges are going down in their countries.\nChinese social media has not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26, writes Stephen McDonell in Beijing.\nThe response in China's state-controlled media to the climate summit has been fairly muted. It's not that ordinary people in China don't know that the conference is taking place, but the coverage of it has definitely been downplayed.\nPerhaps Xi Jinping choosing not to attend the gathering was a key factor. To report on it might draw attention to the fact that, unlike other major nations, nobody represented China at leader level.\nAlso, China's media is of the Communist Party and for the Communist Party. Coverage of anything involving Mr Xi, who is the General Secretary of the Party, is tightly controlled. Media outlets here would not ignore such a meeting - to which Mr Xi sent a message in lieu of an appearance - unless they had been ordered to.\nOf course the conference has, at various points, been referred to. Nationalist stirrers - like those featured in the Global Times - have criticised US President Joe Biden, particularly after he singled out his Chinese counterpart for not showing up.\nBut Chinese social media have not been flooded with criticism of the West at COP26 - it's all been fairly subdued.\nPerhaps, for climate scientists wanting to build a sense of urgency and momentum out of this summit, ignoring what's happening there may be worse than attacking it.\nIt's all about domestic politics, writes Laura Trevelyan in New York\nPresident Biden was determined to use COP26 to showcase American leadership on climate on the world stage - but, as MSNBC opinion columnist Hayes Brown noted, first of all, he had to apologise.\nSince President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, that \"put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,' he acknowledged on the summit's first day. \nThe US has a see-saw approach to global climate agreements depending on which party has the presidency. So Americans know that whatever is agreed in Glasgow could be reversed by a Republican president in 2025.\nThe conservative-leaning Wall St Journal pointed out that President Biden tried to paint Russia and China as \"isolated holdouts\" to a global consensus on reducing emissions but efforts by the US and its allies failed to get Moscow and Beijing to budge.\nAt home it's the position of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial vote when it comes to getting a $500bn climate plan through Congress, that's getting attention.\nMr Manchin is from a coal producing state, West Virginia, and when he said he had lingering concerns about the spending package, headlines declared: \"Biden's climate pledge risks being undermined by holdout senator.\"\nThere is no sense of a climate emergency in Russia, writes Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.\nGo compare. \nA British newspaper headline this week - Queen's plea to save our 'fragile' planet.\nRussia's most popular (pro-Kremlin) daily - Should we really be scared of global warming?\nIt concluded we shouldn't, claiming there are \"positive consequences of global warming\" (especially for Russia): lower heating bills, more accessible shipping routes.\nThere's no sense here of a climate emergency. \nNot that the Kremlin denies there's a problem. It points out that the climate in Russia is warming 2.5 times faster than the world average. \nIt sent a big delegation to Glasgow. No president, though. Vladimir Putin appeared by video screen only. \nStill, Russia promises to be carbon neutral by 2060. It signed the Glasgow declaration on forests and land use, pledging an end to deforestation by 2030.\nBut it wouldn't sign up to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Russia is a fossil fuel superpower and wants a \"smooth\" (longer) transition to greener energy.\n\"Everybody wants Russia to do more to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible,\" Vasily Yablokov of Greenpeace Russia tells me. \n\"I'm happy Russia now accepts climate change is happening, but I see no high ambition from our country. It looks like the Russian government's from another planet.\" \nIndia's 2070 net zero pledge has won Narendra Modi applause in a growing nation balancing economic and environmental needs, writes Rajini Vaidyanathan in Delhi.\nAlthough India has been a big talking point among policy makers in the weeks leading up to the COP summit, COP hasn't been such a big topic for India's masses.\nBut on Monday, when Prime Minister Modi announced that the country would commit to net zero by 2070, many who weren't paying much attention to goings on in Glasgow finally took note. \nMr Modi's address was broadcast on prime time here, and while some around the world are frustrated India is signing up to meet these goals two decades later than the global 2050 target, here the pledges were seen as pragmatic in a growing country which needs to balance both economic and environmental needs. \nThey were also viewed by many as a reminder that the PM won't succumb to pressure when the West has long reaped the benefits of growth while polluting. As Mr Modi reminded the summit, \"India, which is 17% of the world population, is responsible for less than 5% of emissions\" - a line that many here applauded. \nThe First Post news website called the 2070 pledge a \"bold decision... without capitulating to the uncalled for bullying by the West\". And climate experts here say India's four shorter-term goals - to scale up renewables and reduce carbon emissions by 2030 - are also significant.\nAustralia's part in the Cop26 summit is overshadowed by politics writes Shaimaa Khalil in Sydney.\nPart of Scott Morrison's job at Cop26 was to explain to the world how he was going to deliver on net zero by 2050 without phasing out coal. But the prime minister's trip to Glasgow was overshadowed by a row with French President Emmanuel Macron - and not about the climate, about submarines.  \nOn Sunday in Glasgow, Mr Macron accused Mr Morrison of lying to him about a $37bn deal with France which collapsed under controversial circumstances. Mr Morrison replied by saying his nation would not accept \"sledging\" or \"slurs\". \nAnd so this past week, rather than discussing the pressing climate debate and what Australia had achieved at COP26, most of the commentary here has been about Mr Morrison's character and whether the row will affect his standing domestically.\n\"Slipperiness is Scott Morrison's defining characteristic,\" wrote journalist Hugh Riminton in the Guardian. \"And it was never more on show than this week as he sold \"the Australian Way\" on climate to a sceptical crowd in Glasgow, while openly being branded a liar by France.\"\nAustralia did make a few climate headlines in Glasgow. Along with China, Russia, India and Iran, it snubbed the international pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and refused to sign up to phasing out coal-fired power and stop investing in new coal plants at home and abroad.  \nThe verdict from Australia's ABC News? A \"terribly messy week\" for the prime minister.\nThe climate conference in Scotland feels a long way from the reality of most Brazilians, writes Katy Watson in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nMuch is made of Brazil's contribution to climate change internationally because of its immense rainforest. But with all that President Jair Bolsonaro says and does - and the fact he didn't even attend COP26 - it feels a bit different over here. \nYes, the Amazon is in the same country, but it's a long way from big cities like S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio, and probably feels just as distant as a climate conference in Scotland. \nIt's not that Brazilians don't care.\n\"People do want to participate and they have lots to contribute,\" says Silvia Cervellini, co-founder of Delibera, a Brazilian organisation helping people get involved in politics.\nBut since the pandemic, there's been a rise in poverty and the political and economic crisis is casting a shadow over Brazil. People have more immediate concerns. \"What we need to do is enable people to make the connection with daily life,\" Ms Cervellini says. \nAnd that's something that dressmaker Izildete Maria de Sousa Botelho agrees with. The 67-year-old from Minas Gerais state was selected to be part of the Global Citizen Assembly for COP.\n\"If we are cutting down trees, we need to rethink what we eat,\" she says. \"We outsource the responsibility to authorities and politicians and forget that it's individual actions, it's the lack of ecological awareness that we need to work on that is causing all of this.\"\nMany in Iran believe that it is unfair to expect the country to make any climate commitments while the sanctions remain, writes BBC Persian Service correspondent Siavash Ardalan.\nIran is among the top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases and suffers extensively from the effects of global warming. The country has seen one its worst droughts in decades this year, resulting in severe water shortages and electricity blackouts.\nUS sanctions and unsustainable domestic policies have only exacerbated such problems.\nOne member of Iran's delegation to COP26 has said that if the sanctions were lifted, \"there would be no obstacle for us to reduce our emissions\".\nHowever, conservatives affiliated to President Ebrahim Raisi's government have put out statements that range from climate change denial to assertions COP26 is seeking to deprive Iran of its oil and gas.\nAlthough the summit has been largely ignored by Iranian media, such critical views have made their way to some pro-government conservative outlets.\nA few reform-minded newspapers have meanwhile echoed the dire warnings from UN officials and climate scientists while avoiding any critique of the government's low-key approach to COP26. \nPublic opinion is divided. Many believe that it is unfair to expect any commitments from Iran while the sanctions remain in place. Others argue that climate change has only served to downplay government incompetence. \nCOP26 is not front page news in Nigeria, writes Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja.\nNigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has promised zero emissions by 2060.\nThe big media houses have sent reporters to Glasgow but it is not front page news in Nigeria. \nOn Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari said no-one in Nigeria needed \"persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,\" pointing to desertification, floods and erosion in the country as \"enough evidence\".\nBut he wants access to climate finance - some of the $100bn annually available to developing economies - and foreign investment in Nigeria's gas sector to help the country wean itself off its major revenue earner, oil.\nThe president struck the right notes for those in Glasgow but back home people, in homes powered by gasoline generators imported from China, live in a different reality.\nNo-one here has experienced a stable power supply in their lifetime and if it takes burning coal to achieve that, few will reject it for the sake of the climate.\nClimate activists, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, have long sounded the alarm about the impact of oil drilling and gas flaring but there is little sign of any action from the government and the international oil firms.\nEven as Saudi Arabia seeks to achieve net zero by 2060, the country is boosting its oil production, writes Middle East Business Correspondent Sameer Hashmi.\nFor a long time, the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon emissions. \nThen last month, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had set a goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060. \nBut, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that objective, they are boosting their oil production capacity to cater for global demand.\nThe country's top officials have repeatedly said tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by \"demonising\" hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes the world needs both fossil fuels as well as renewables.\nMost officials I spoke to there supported the crown prince's goal and his efforts to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries. The response by environmental activists though was more muted."

He's returning to COP26 in Glasgow as the climate summit nears the end and will meet with ministers and negotiators to find out what progress has been made and where gaps remain. \"There's still much to do,\" says Mr Johnson, however \"negotiating teams are doing the hard yards in these final days of COP26 to turn promises into action on climate change\".

In Cape Town it's three years since the South African city edged dangerously towards what was described as \"Day Zero\" - the moment when some four million inhabitants would be left without water when drought turned all the local reservoirs into dustbowls. Now to protect those reservoirs tens of thousands of trees are being chopped down on the mountains surrounding them. Read more here.\nThere's a new movement \"exploding right now, and it makes sense,\" says Lou Palmer-Masterton, the owner of three vegan restaurants. She's referring to carbon labelling on menus and food packaging, which show the impact a product has had on the environment with a carbon dioxide - CO2 - emissions score. Given a growing number of companies are using the label, should it be added to all products? We've investigated.\nShe spends much of her day at a socially-distanced desk existing on a diet of carbon-counted sarnies and Irn-Bru in the Press Centre.

      "text": "MPs who are not available to help constituents and represent them in Parliament are \"not doing the job\", Downing Street has said.\nIt comes after Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Cox was found to have been working remotely from the Caribbean.\nThe former attorney general has earned over \u00a3700,000 doing legal work in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) on top of his MPs' salary.\nBoris Johnson's spokesman said MPs should be \"visible\" to constituents. \n\"The prime minister is clear that MPs' jobs must be to serve the constituents they represent in their interest in Parliament,\" the PM's spokesman said.\nHe added that MPs should be \"visible in their constituencies and available to help constituents with their constituency matters\".\n\"If they're not doing that, they're not doing their job and will rightly be judged on that by their constituents.\"\nLabour is calling for an investigation into Sir Geoffrey's activities, saying he \"took advantage\" of Covid restrictions to work remotely from the Caribbean.\nThe BBC has contacted Sir Geoffrey for a comment.\nSince he was sacked as a minster last February, the Torridge and West Devon MP has spent very little time in the House of Commons chamber.\nHe made at least two trips to the British Virgin Islands, where he has been advising a BVI government inquiry into alleged corruption. \nCovid rules meant the Conservative Party's whips office could cast votes on his behalf - as all parties did for their MPs while restrictions were in place.\nThere is no suggestion Sir Geoffrey has broken the rules - the legal work he did was declared in the register of MPs' interests. \nBut, in the wake of controversy over ex-Tory MP Owen Paterson being found to have broken lobbying rules when working as a consultant, it raises fresh questions about MPs' second jobs.\nDowning Street has faced torrid headlines for days now. \nWhat started as a story over one MP - Owen Paterson - morphed into one about the government's approach to standards.\nNow, the balance of MPs' work in and out of Parliament is being questioned.\nThere is no suggestion that Geoffrey Cox has broken any rules. Indeed, many MPs have second jobs.\nBut the extent to which he has focused on his legal work - and the fact he appears to have spent a number of weeks in the Caribbean - leaves question marks over whether he has got the balance right.\nNumber 10 haven't explicitly criticised him - but the inference in the comments of a spokesman for the PM were clear: MPs should prioritise their work in Parliament and make that work visible to their constituents.\nThe BBC has established that Sir Geoffrey was in the BVI in April and June this year on at least two separate trips, to work on a corruption investigation into the government of the Overseas Territory, which was launched by the UK Foreign Office in January. \nThe duration of the trips is not known but the Daily Mail, which first reported the story, said he had been there for nearly a month, between April and May.\nA BVI government press release on 26 April, announcing his arrival, said: \"Sir Geoffrey Cox QC, who is currently in quarantine, intends to hold a series of meetings with government ministers in the next few weeks.\"\nSir Geoffrey has not commented on the reports, but broadcasters at his constituency home have been told he is abroad.\nIn a letter to Boris Johnson, Labour Party chair Anneliese Dodds said: \"The people of Torridge and West Devon must be wondering if Geoffrey Cox is a Caribbean-based barrister or a Conservative MP.\" \nThe Liberal Democrats said the public would be \"gobsmacked\" by the reports into Sir Geoffrey's activities.\nBut the deputy chair of the MP's local Conservative Association, Debbie Flint, told the BBC the group \"fully supports our MP\"."

      "text": "Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has \"tied the knot\" with her partner during an Islamic ceremony in Birmingham.\nShe and Asser Malik took part in a nikkah ceremony, where bride and groom consent to be married.\nThe 24-year-old activist said it was \"a precious day\" in her life.\nThe Pakistani women's rights activist found refuge in the West Midlands after being shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012.\n\"Asser and I tied the knot to be partners for life,\" she tweeted on Tuesday, sharing how they had taken part in a \"small nikkah ceremony with family\". \n\"We are excited to walk together for the journey ahead,\" she added.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, her new husband tweeted a picture of the couple and said in Malala he had found a \"beautiful and kind partner\" and he was \"so excited to spend the rest of our life together\". \nMalala, now 24, was 15 when she was targeted by the Taliban in Pakistan for speaking up for the right of girls to be educated.\nShe survived the assault, in which a militant boarded her school bus in north-western Swat valley and opened fire, wounding two of her school friends as well as Malala.\nAfter recovering from her near-fatal injuries, she and her family relocated to Birmingham, which she later called \"a second home\". Aged 17, she became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. She went on to study at Oxford University, and has become a leading human rights campaigner.\nSince graduating, Malala has called for better support for Afghan refugees, signed a contract with Apple TV+ to produce documentaries and appeared on the cover of British Vogue, all while continuing her work to improve girls' access to education.\nAsser Malik is closely associated with cricket and is the High Performance General Manager of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).\nA graduate of Lahore's renowned Aitchison College and then Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), he was also associated with the Pakistan Super League franchise Multan Sultans before joining the PCB, for which he prepared the player development program. \nWhile it is not clear how long the couple have known each other, there are pictures of them cheering on Pakistan at Birmingham's Edgbaston Cricket Ground posted on Mr Malik's Instagram account in June 2019.\nOn its own, a nikkah is not legally recognised under English law and it is unclear whether the couple had a separate civil ceremony.\nMalala has previously voiced her misgivings around marriage.\nIn an interview with Vogue in July, she said: \"I still don't understand why people have to get married.\"\n\"If you want to have a person in your life, why do you have to sign marriage papers, why can't it just be a partnership?\" she continued. \n\"My mum is like\u2026 'Don't you dare say anything like that! You have to get married, marriage is beautiful'.\"\nThe news of the ceremony was liked tens of thousands of times by fans online, with thousands wishing the couple well.\nAmong those to offer their congratulations on Twitter were Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Jemima Goldsmith and MP Sajid Javid.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

      "title": "Belarus migrants: Poland PM blames Russia's Putin for migrant crisis",
      "tags": "Belarus,Russia,European Union,Poland,Migration",
      "text": "Poland's Prime Minister has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being behind a migrant crisis at Belarus's border with Poland.\nMateusz Morawiecki said that Belarus's authoritarian leader, a close ally of Mr Putin, is orchestrating the crisis, but \"it has its mastermind in Moscow\".\nAt least 2,000 migrants are stuck at the border in freezing conditions.\nBelarus's leader Alexander Lukashenko denies claims it is sending people over the border in revenge for EU sanctions.\nVideo footage shows crowds of people on the Belarusian side of a barbed-wire border fence with Poland. Some try to force their way through using bolt cutters, tree trunks and group force, while Polish guards fend them off with what appears to be tear gas.\nMany of the migrants are young men but there are also women and children, mostly from the Middle East and Asia. They are camping in tents just inside Belarus, trapped between Polish guards on one side, and Belarusian guards on the other.\nOvernight temperatures at the border have slumped below zero and several people have already died in recent weeks. \nSpeaking on Tuesday at an emergency parliamentary session after visiting troops on the border, Mr Morawiecki said: \"This attack which Lukashenko is conducting has its mastermind in Moscow, the mastermind is President Putin.\"\nHe accused the Russian and Belarusian leaders of trying to destabilise the European Union - which the two countries are not part of - by allowing migrants to travel through Belarus and enter the bloc.\nMr Morawiecki described the situation as \"a new type of war in which people are used as human shields\", and said Poland was dealing with a \"stage play\" which is designed to create chaos in the EU. \nHe added that it was the first time in 30 years that Poland's border security had been so \"brutally attacked\". \nPoland has deployed extra troops to the border, and warned of a possible \"armed\" escalation, fearing that Belarus might try to provoke an incident.\nPoland, Lithuania and Latvia, which are all part of the EU, have seen a surge in the number of people trying to enter their countries illegally from Belarus in recent months. On Tuesday, Lithuania declared a state of emergency on its border with Belarus, which will come into effect at midnight.\nPoland has seen the most arrivals, especially around its major border crossing at Kuznica.\nPoland has been accused of pushing migrants back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. Journalists and aid agencies have been banned from accessing the area.\n\"Nobody is letting us get in anywhere, Belarus or Poland,\" 33-year-old Shwan Kurd from Iraq told the BBC by video-call.\nHe described how he had arrived in Belarus's capital, Minsk, from Baghdad at the start of November, and was now in a make-shift camp metres from Poland's barbed-wire fence.\n\"There's no way to escape,\" he said. \"Poland won't let us in. Every night they fly helicopters. They don't let us sleep. We are so hungry. There's no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women, and families.\"\nThe EU, Nato and the US all accuse Belarus of coordinating the surge of migrants. The European Commission has accused Mr Lukashenko of luring migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an \"inhuman, gangster-style approach\".\nBrussels says his actions are a retaliation against EU sanctions, which were imposed after his widely discredited re-election and subsequent crackdown on mass protests.\nActivists say the migrants are being used as pawns in a political game between Belarus and its EU neighbours. \nLithuania has also moved troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible influx of migrants. Its government said declaring a state of emergency was a precautionary response.\nAbout two dozen migrants who were detained in Lithuania after illegally crossing over from Belarus were suspected of having links to terrorist organisations, Lithuania's vice interior minister Kestutis Lancinskas told the BBC.\nMost of them presented fake IDs when they were stopped and background checks are still ongoing, Mr Lancinskas said. He could not comment on which terrorist organisations may have links with the migrants, nor when they were detained.\n\"There is always a certain level of risk when there's a large number of people crossing the border,\" Mr Lancinskas said.\n\"All member states have a level of terrorism threat. Our intelligence services are doing their best to prevent those kinds of activities.\"\nIn an interview with the Belarusian state news agency, Mr Lukashenko said he wanted to avoid any military escalation on the border which could draw Russia into a conflict.\nHe said he was \"not a madman\" and knew what was at stake, but remained defiant, saying \"we will not kneel down\".\nThe Belarus defence ministry has accused Warsaw of violating agreements by moving thousands of troops to the border. \nBelarus insists migrants are arriving there legally and that it is merely acting \"as a hospitable country\".\nRussia has praised its ally's \"responsible\" handling of the border row and said it is watching the situation closely.\nAre you in the area?

      "title": "Recruitment firm wrongly claimed furlough as staff worked, ex-employees say",
      "tags": "Job Retention Scheme,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "A recruitment company wrongly claimed furlough money from the government while its staff were still working, ex-employees have told the BBC.\nSecret recordings obtained by File on 4 and The Times newspaper appear to show managers at Brewster Partners telling staff how to avoid detection while they continued to work.\nThousands of companies are thought to have misused the government's furlough scheme - introduced to support businesses during the pandemic.\nBrewster Partners denies wrongdoing.\nThe company, based in Yorkshire, said it will refer itself to HMRC for investigation following the BBC's programme. \nIn a video call with staff, Lisa Brewster, the company's managing partner at the time, tells colleagues she has been advised they should delete posts from the LinkedIn social networking site which refer to working from home.\nFurlough was introduced in March 2020 after Covid-19 forced large parts of the UK economy to close. Officially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it saw the government pay towards the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of \u00a32,500.\nKey to the scheme was that people must not work for their company while furloughed. \n\"So, what he [the company's chief executive] said is, if you can delete them, delete them,\" she tells staff in a Zoom conversation.\n\"If it looks wrong to delete it, don't. We're going to use the excuse that we've got a few people... in control of everyone's LinkedIn, still posting stuff if we get into trouble.\"\nShe then appears to encourage staff to continue working as normal.\n\"Technically, you are not supposed to be working\", she says. \"However, if you choose to work, we can't stop you. Yeah? Does that make sense? So, technically, yes, you're furloughed. You can choose to work, though, which I'm presuming nearly everybody here will be doing...\"\nListen to BBC File on 4's full investigation into furlough fraud here.\nThe BBC showed the secret recordings to employment lawyer Beverley Sunderland. She said: \"It is quite clear that what they are doing is instructing their employees to pretend that - if it comes to it - somebody else has been using their LinkedIn. \n\"They are just creating a false impression to enable them to be able to claim a grant from the government,\" she said.\nThe company's chief executive, Nigel Brewster, is heard telling anxious employees not to worry because he has \"a cunning plan\".\nThe secret recordings come alongside allegations from six former employees, all of whom spoke to BBC File on 4 on condition of anonymity.  \nOne said: \"It didn't feel like I could refuse to work while on furlough\u2026 I just wasn't allowed to question it, and I continued on miserably.\"\nThe government's furlough scheme, officially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), was designed to protect jobs during the Covid pandemic by paying 80% of wages - up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month.\nIt was introduced in April last year, towards the beginning of the UK's first lockdown. The rules said furloughed employees were not allowed to carry out any work for their employer in order to qualify for the help.\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have received around 30,000 calls to their fraud hotline about possible abuses of the scheme.\nLast week, HMRC released new figures estimating that \"error and fraud\" made up 8.7% of the total amount it paid out through the scheme, equating to approximately \u00a36bn.  \nBrewster Partners is just one of many thousands of companies accused of wrongful claims.\nThe allegations have attracted particular attention because the company's non-executive chairman is Sir Nigel Knowles, a lawyer and former CEO of the world's largest business law firm, DLA Piper, as well as a council member of the charity, the Prince's Trust. There is no suggestion he knew anything about alleged breaches of rules. \nIn a statement to the BBC, the company said they \"categorically deny any wrongdoing\", and had already commissioned an independent review which found that \"the company's receipt of [furlough] funds appears lawful and within the rules of the scheme despite comments in Zoom calls by managers\".\nHowever, after exchanging emails with the BBC, the company said: \"Despite the conclusion of the independent report, given questions still persist as to whether Brewster Partners misused the furlough scheme, the company's board has agreed that the business should proactively contact HMRC and invite them to conduct their own investigation.\""

      "tags": "Live music,Celebrity,Music festivals,Hip-hop,Texas,Houston,Music",
      "text": "A student who attended the Astroworld concert in Texas at which eight people died, has now been declared brain dead.\nEight people aged between 14 and 27 were killed in a crush during the show last weekend, and hundreds more were injured, including a nine year old boy who is in a coma.\nAnd now doctors say a 22-year-old woman who has been in hospital since the concert, is showing no signs of brain activity.\nThe news comes after a Houston fire chief claimed Rapper Travis Scott should have halted the show more quickly.\nSamuel Pe\u00f1a told NBC: \"Everybody at that event had a responsibility.....From the artist on down.\"\nThe artist said he was \"devastated\" by the incident and was working to help victims' families. \nHis partner, the businesswoman and media personality Kylie Jenner, said they only learned there were fatalities after the event. \nA lawyer for the nine-year-old fighting for his life after he was trampled at the event has also spoken. \n\"This young child and his family will face life-altering trauma from this day forward, a reality that nobody expects when they buy concert tickets,\" a lawyer for the family said in a statement on Tuesday.\nPolice said the victims were crushed in a surge of fans near the stage at around 21:30 local time.\nScott continued to perform for almost 40 minutes longer, eventually ending the set about 15 to 20 minutes ahead of the advertised time.\nIn footage from the concert, he can be seen interrupting his performance to ask for help for a fan who had passed out. But in another video, he asks: \"Who asked you to stop? Y'all know what y'all came to do.\"\n\"At one point there was an ambulance that was trying to make its way through the crowd. The artist has command of that crowd,\" Mr Pe\u00f1a, the chief of the Houston Fire Department, told NBC's Today show.\n\"The artist, if he notices something that's going on, he can certainly pause that performance, turn on the lights and say: 'Hey, we're not going to continue until this thing is resolved',\" he added.\nIn an Instagram video following the event, Scott said he was devastated about what had happened and was \"sending prayers to the ones that were lost\". \n\"My fans really mean the world to me,\" he said. \"Any time I could make out anything that's going on, I just stopped the show and helped them get the help they need... I could just never imagine the severity of the situation.\"\nScott, one of the biggest names in rap music, launched Astroworld with concert promoters Live Nation in 2018. \nOn Monday, lawsuits were filed including allegations that Scott and surprise performer Drake incited the crowd at Friday's event, and that Live Nation failed to provide adequate safety measures. \nPolice have launched an investigation, including looking into separate reports that somebody in the audience was injecting people with drugs. \nSeveral concertgoers had to be revived with anti-drug overdose medicine, including a security officer who police said appeared to have an injection mark in his neck."

      "tags": "Scottish government,John Swinney,Hospitality industry,Vaccine passports,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "People may be able to show a negative lateral flow test result in place of a vaccine passport in the future, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said. \nHe said there was a \"stronger case\" for allowing people to use test results to gain entry to venues if the scheme was widened. \nThe Scottish government is considering the move amid fears of a surge in Covid-19 cases over winter.\nCritics have said there is no evidence base for expanding the passport scheme. \nPeople over the age of 18 currently need to show proof of vaccination in order to enter nightclubs and large events such as football matches and concerts.\nMr Swinney said this could now be expanded to more hospitality and leisure venues with any changes set to be confirmed at the next review of the restrictions on 16 November.\nOther countries with vaccine certification schemes, such as Wales, allow people to show proof of a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours as an alternative to showing a certificate.\nAsked on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland if this testing alternative would be introduced, Mr Swinney said: \"We didn't do it in the first place because the purpose of applying the vaccination certification scheme was to drive up vaccine certification levels. \n\"If we're going to apply this in a more widespread level then there is a stronger case for using a negative later flow device test to gain entry.\"\nPeople who take lateral flow test are asked to register their results online but there is no way of checking an accurate result has been entered. \nThe deputy first minister insisted that no decisions have yet been taken, arguing instead that ministers are simply being open that changes to the passport scheme is a possibility.\nAsked which parts of hospitality and leisure it could be applied to, Mr Swinney said: \"We've not made any decisions.\n\"The reason we've not made any decisions is that government has got to be satisfied any decisions it takes are proportionate in the context of the state of the pandemic - that is the legal test we are obliged to follow.\" \nScotland's vaccine passport scheme was introduced at the start of October and applies to nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event where more than 10,000 people are present.\nThe controversial vaccine passport scheme had no shortage of critics when it was introduced in October including an unsuccessful legal challenge mounted by the hospitality industry.\nJohn Swinney says its \"core purpose\" was to drive up vaccine uptake, which he argues has been achieved if you look at the jump in vaccination rates among the younger people who are most likely to go to bars and clubs.\nHe said that in September, 53% of 18 to 29-year-olds were vaccinated and by 1 November that had risen to 68%.\nNow the Scottish government is considering expanding the scheme in a move tied to concerns about a surge in Covid cases over the winter months.\nThe idea has set off alarm bells in parts of the hospitality industry which feels it has been disproportionately affected by the government's Covid-tackling public health measures.\nIt has also raised questions about how an expansion of the certification scheme would work.\nIn Wales, its Covid passes are used for entry into nightclubs and this is to be extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls from 15 November. \nTheir NHS Covid pass shows your vaccination status but also if you have tested negative for Coronavirus in the last 48 hours via a lateral flow test where a person has reported the results. \nAnyone caught using a fake Covid pass or lateral flow test result faces a fine of up to \u00a360. \nThe introduction of lateral flow tests would \"would alleviate some of the problem but it will not solve everything\" says the Scottish Hospitality Group. \nAnd the move to start using lateral flow tests would also likely win opposition party support in Holyrood. \nOpposition politicians have criticised the Scottish government for considering expanding the scheme which they say will be of \"significant concern\" to businesses. \nStephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents some of the country's bars, restaurants and clubs, said: \"We expect the Scottish government to work constructively, intensively, and with proper consultation with our industry should there be an extension of vaccine passports to all indoor hospitality venues. \n\"We would hope that this would include discussion of appropriate government support for additional staffing and costs, with many businesses in the hospitality sector currently struggling to cope with the financial burden of the pandemic as well as an acute recruitment crisis.\""

      "text": "A US judge has ruled a congressional committee investigating the Capitol riot can access some of ex-President Donald Trump's White House records. \nMr Trump had sought to invoke executive privilege, under which presidential documents can be kept secret. \nThe inquiry is trying to find out if Mr Trump had prior knowledge of the riot.\nTrump supporters stormed the Capitol building on 6 January as Congress was certifying President Joe Biden's election victory.\nMr Trump has refused to acknowledge losing the election last year, claiming - without evidence - that it had been rigged.  \nThe inquiry is being conducted by a committee set up by the House of Representatives which is dominated by President Biden's Democrats.\nThe panel wants to see a trove of phone records, visitor logs and other White House documents that could shed some light on the events leading up to the attack on Congress. \nIt has issued summonses to several Trump aides to testify before the lawmakers.\nMr Trump - a Republican - had argued his White House communications were protected and as such should not be released.\nBut US District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled that the National Archives, the federal agency that holds the records, should comply with the panel's request. \nIn a 39-page ruling, Judge Chutkan said that Congress had the right to see the documents, particularly as the current president had agreed. \nMr Trump \"does not acknowledge the deference owed to the incumbent president's judgment. His position that he may override the express will of the executive branch appears to be premised on the notion that his executive power 'exists in perpetuity,'\" the judge wrote. \"But presidents are not kings, and plaintiff is not president.\"\nAs a former president, Mr Trump enjoyed the right to executive privilege, she added, but the incumbent president \"is best situated to protect executive branch interests\".\nHowever, it is unlikely the records will be accessible in the near future.\nThe legal battle is likely to wind up at the Supreme Court.\nA spokesman for Mr Trump, said the case was likely to be appealed. \nTaylor Budowich said Mr Trump was committed to defending the right of US presidents to assert executive privilege and \"will be seeing this process through\".\nBut Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who is chairman of the committee, called the lawsuit \"little more than an attempt to delay and obstruct our investigation.\"\nSixteen of Mr Trump's closest aides have been subpoenaed in the past two days.\nThey include Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, Stephen Miller, who was Mr Trump's senior adviser, Bill Stepien, campaign manager, Mark Meadows, former White House chief of staff, and Michael Flynn, former national security adviser.\nBennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the House committee, said in a statement he wanted to know every detail about what happened on 6 January, and in the days leading up to it.\nThe committee expects the witnesses to \"comply fully\", he added. \nThe panel has already subpoenaed Dan Scavino, former deputy chief of staff, and Steve Bannon, a former Trump strategist.\nMr Bannon refused to comply with the subpoena and was charged with contempt of Congress.\nFollowing the Capitol riot, Mr Trump was impeached by the lower house of Congress, but cleared by the then Republican-dominated upper house, the Senate, of inciting an insurrection. \nMore than 670 people have been arrested for the invasion of the Capitol complex."

However, a funding shortfall from Congress meant this wasn't possible, according to a rationale published by Nasa at the time of the contract announcement.\nMr Nelson partially blamed the landing mission's delay on the lawsuit.\n\"Returning to the Moon as quickly and safely as possible is an agency priority. However, with the recent lawsuit and other factors, the first human landing under Artemis is likely no earlier than 2025,\" he said.\nHowever, commentators had been saying since last year that the lander cash problem alone made the 2024 date untenable.\nMr Bezos' firm Blue Origin had partnered with three other aerospace companies to vie for the prestigious lander contract.\nThe judgment last week means that a version of SpaceX's Starship - currently undergoing testing at a site in southern Texas - will be the vehicle used to carry people down to the lunar surface on that mission.\nThe first mission under the Artemis programme is set to fly in February next year. Nasa will launch the Orion spacecraft on the powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rocket without people aboard.\nDuring this mission, Orion will fly around the Moon on a voyage lasting three weeks in order to test its systems.\nThe first flight with astronauts - Artemis-2 - will now follow in 2024, Mr Nelson said. It will also fly around the Moon.\nArtemis-3 will be the first mission to return to the surface of the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. It is set to land at the lunar south pole, which is thought to hold vast stores of water-ice in craters that never see sunlight.\nThe ice in these craters could be used to make rocket fuel on the Moon, bringing down the cost of lunar exploration because it would not need to be shipped from Earth.\nThe programme will also see the first person of colour land on the Moon, though it is unclear whether this will happen during Artemis-3 or a later mission.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "text": "The University of Oxford has been asked to speak to its Jewish students after it accepted a donation from the family of Oswald Mosley, who led the British Union of Fascists in the 1930s.\nThe Union of Jewish Students (UJS) said the Oxford Jewish Society had heard nothing, and added that the news had been \"distressing\" for students. \nEducation Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said students were owed an explanation.\nThe university said it had \"rigorous guidelines\" for accepting funds.\nThe university was given \u00a36m by the Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust, which was set up by the late former motorsport boss Max Mosley and named after his late son Alexander, a St Peter's College graduate.\nA Daily Telegraph report said Mr Mosley created the trust \"to house the fortune he inherited\" from his father, Oswald Mosley.\nTwo of the university's colleges - St Peter's and Lady Margaret Hall - also accepted cash from the Mosley family trust totalling more than \u00a36.3m, the report added.\nAmanda Sefton, UJS head of campaigns, told the BBC: \"A good first step would be for the university to reach out to the Jewish Society to start a conversation.\n\"The news has been distressing for Jewish students, and the absence of any communication and consultation is inconsiderate and inappropriate.\"\nShe said \"initial steps must be taken to  build the relationship between the Oxford Jewish students and the university\" - and that the university and relevant colleges should reflect on \"the impact these donations will have on its Jewish students and the wider student body\".\nMs Sefton said UJS was working with those Jewish societies \"to ensure that Jewish student voices are listened to, and that this doesn't have a long-standing impact on their overall student experience\".\nHer comments come after Mr Zahawi said the university must \"consult and explain the decision-making process that took place for them to have landed on this donation\".\nHe added that universities should consider the \"ethical implications\" of donations, and the views of students and the wider community, and said he expected them \"to be quite capable of dealing with these issues in an appropriate and sensitive way.\"\nMr Zahawi spoke while visiting the Auschwitz death camp, before this week's 83rd anniversary of Kristallnacht, when violent attacks were carried out on Jewish communities throughout Germany and Austria.\n\"Let me be very clear. Anti-Semitism is not simply a historic debate, it is a present danger and a scourge that exists, sadly, on our campuses,\" he said.\nHe urged universities to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism.\nThe University of Oxford said: \"The university is aware of its position within, and responsibility to, the wider community in which we operate, and has robust and rigorous guidelines regarding the acceptance of donations and research funding.\"\nIt added that its donors \"have no say in setting the research and teaching programmes of the posts or infrastructure they fund, nor do they have any access to the results of research, other than publicly available material\".\nLady Margaret Hall said the donation \"enabled a cohort of students from very diverse and low-income backgrounds to attend Oxford\".\nIt said the trust knew that these students came from \"diverse and under-represented backgrounds and was pleased to support the scheme and its aims\".\nThe Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust said \"none of the funds received or distributed by the trust were the proceeds of fascism\".\n\"The Trust abhors racism in all its forms including the thuggery and violence of Oswald Mosley's fascist movement.\n\"We sincerely hope that the funds we donate can continue to make a positive difference.\"\nThe BBC has contacted St Peter's College for comment."

      "title": "Climate change: What do scientists want from COP26 this week?",
      "tags": "COP26,Climate change",
      "text": "As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase. \nThe conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week.\nThe scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful.\nGovernments must agree to \"cut emissions by half in the next 10 years\", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London.\nThe Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. \nAnd many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. \n\"The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,\" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. \nMore than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050. One of the world's largest emitters, India, says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later.\nThe scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. \"We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,\" says Prof Siegert. \"If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward.\" \nThe scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. \nLast week at COP, there were announcements on cuts to coal and methane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough. \n\"There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology\" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne.\nAnd Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets.\nHaving plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. \"It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'.\" \n\"The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrently trying to open a new oil field at the moment,\" she added. \"The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible.\"  \nOne proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. \nHowever, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. \nAn alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. \nBy making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. \n\"A carbon tax needs to happen,\" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. \"We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour.\"\nThere is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. \nMs Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. \nMany people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. \n\"They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure.\"\nThe developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. \nThe US is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important.\nDr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. \nFor example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. \n\"I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods.\"\nThere is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. \n\"I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,\" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed to a major UN report on climate change, published this year.   \n\"Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one.\" She added: \"This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.\""

      "tags": "China,COP26,Climate change,John Kerry",
      "text": "China and the US have agreed to boost climate co-operation over the next decade, in a surprise announcement at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nThe world's two biggest CO2 emitters pledged to act in a joint declaration.\nIt says both sides will \"recall their firm commitment to work together\" to achieve the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nThey called for stepped-up efforts to close the \"significant gap\" that remains to achieve that target.\nScientists say that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C will help humanity avoid the worst climate impacts. This is compared to pre-industrial temperatures.\nAt Paris in 2015, world leaders pledged to try to keep the world from warming by more than between 1.5C to 2C through sweeping emissions cuts. \nChina's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua told reporters that on climate change \"there is more agreement between China and US than divergence\".\nUS President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to hold a virtual meeting as early as next week. The two countries are seen as global rivals on a number of issues.\nIn Wednesday's rare joint declaration, there were steps agreed on a range of issues including methane emissions, the transition to clean energy, and de-carbonisation.\nBut China refused to join an agreement earlier this week to limit methane - a harmful greenhouse gas. The agreement was signed by nearly 100 other countries. China has instead pledged to develop a \"national plan\" to address methane. \nMr Xie was followed by John Kerry, the US climate envoy, who said the US and China \"have no shortage of differences, but on climate, co-operation is the only way to get this job done\".\n\"Every step matters right now and we have a long journey ahead of us,\" he said.\nPerhaps the most important clue as to the significance of this statement is in the last bit of the title - a joint declaration on enhancing climate action in the 2020s.\nIf the world wants to keep the 1.5C temperature threshold in sight, then the steps taken to limit carbon emissions in the next nine years are absolutely critical.\nWhile China has been reluctant to tackle its domestic coal emissions in the short term, this statement is a recognition of the urgency of action.\nSo the joint steps agreed - on methane, forests and technology transfer - are important symbolically and also potentially in emissions terms.\nThe agreement is also a recognition by both sides that there is a massive gap between the efforts of countries to limit emissions to date, and what science says is necessary for a safer world.\nClosing that gap means a strong agreement here in Glasgow.\nThe optics and timing of this statement, regardless of the contents, certainly give that a boost.\nGreenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan welcomed the declaration between China and the US, but warned that both countries needed to show greater commitment to reaching climate goals. \n\"Ultimately their statement falls short of the call by the climate vulnerable countries demanding that nations come back to the table every year with greater ambition until the 1.5C gap is closed\", she said. \nEU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said it was \"really encouraging\" to see China and the US working together. \"It shows also that the US and China know this subject transcends other issues. And it certainly helps us here at COP to come to an agreement\", he added. \nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the announcement was \"an important step in the right direction.\" \nCOP26 is the biggest climate change conference since landmark talks in Paris in 2015. Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, by 2030.\nIn other developments at the COP26 climate summit today:\nLast week, US President Joe Biden criticised Chinese President Xi Jinping for not turning up to the summit in person. \n\"The fact that China is trying to assert, understandably, a new role in the world as a world leader - not showing up, come on,\" Mr Biden said, adding that Xi Jinping's absence was a \"big mistake\".\nChina is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, followed by the US. In September Mr Xi announced that China will aim for carbon neutrality by 2060, with a plan to hit peak emissions before 2030. The US is aiming for net-zero by 2050. \nRead more about the COP26 summit here\nSimple guide to climate change\nWhat will climate change look like for you?\nWill the UK meet its climate targets?\nHow extreme weather is linked to climate change"

      "tags": "Germany,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "One of Germany's top virologists has warned that a further 100,000 people will die from Covid if nothing's done to halt an aggressive fourth wave. \nCase numbers have soared and Germany on Wednesday registered its highest rate of infection since the pandemic began, with almost 40,000 cases in a day. \n\"We have to act right now,\" said Christian Drosten, who described a real emergency situation.\nDoctors in the intensive care Covid ward at Leipzig University Hospital warn this fourth wave could be the worst yet. \nOne patient here, a woman in her 20s, has just given birth. Her baby is fine, but staff say they don't know whether she'll survive. \nThis state of Saxony has the highest seven-day infection rate in Germany at 459 cases per 100,000 people. The national rate is 232.\nIt also has the lowest take-up of vaccine: 57% of the population here have been vaccinated. \nThere are 18 patients on the Covid ward. Just four were vaccinated. \n\"It's very difficult to get staff motivated to treat patients now in this fourth wave,\" says Prof Sebastian Stehr, who heads the department. \"A large part of the population still underestimates the problem.\"\nBy now, Prof Sehr says, most people will know someone who's had Covid and should, therefore, be aware of the risk of infection. \"Nevertheless,\" he adds, \"we are still seeing so many patients who are not vaccinated.\"\nGermany's health minister has publicly blamed those people for the soaring cases, describing the current situation as a \"pandemic of the unvaccinated\".\nAt the start of this week, Saxony banned unvaccinated people from bars, restaurants, public events and sport and leisure facilities. At least several other states are expected to follow suit. \nGermany's anti-vaxxers are furious. Several thousand protested last weekend in Leipzig. \n\"This is discrimination, and we want to express vehemently that we do not accept this in our society,\" said Leif Hansen, who represents anti-vax \"Bewegung Leipzig\" (Leipzig Movement). He doesn't trust the companies that made the vaccine or the authorities who approved it. \n\"They say the vaccination is ok, that I should give it to my children? Never!\" he told me. \"I have a feeling that it should never go into my body, and I will fight all I can to prevent it coming into my body.\"\nSixteen million Germans over the age of 12 have not been fully vaccinated. The German government has admitted it's unlikely to persuade many of those people now, and politicians worry that social divisions might deepen. \nWhat many fear is another lockdown. Nadine Herzog's bar in Leipzig barely survived the last one. She deftly prepares cocktails as she tells us that even before the authorities required it she and her co-owner banned unvaccinated drinkers. \n\"My business is dying. My dreams came true and now they suffer from people who don't do logical things to prevent others from getting ill or dying and I'm so angry,\" she told the BBC.\nA long queue formed outside a vaccine centre in the city earlier in the week. Evidence, perhaps, that some have changed their minds. But Germany is also now rolling out booster jabs amid concerns about waning protection in those who have been vaccinated. \nOn the intensive care Covid unit they fear the damage is done. Operations have already been cancelled, procedures postponed to make way for Covid patients. \nDoctors here told us that nearly half of the people who end up here will die. \nFor Germany, which invented one of the world's first Covid vaccines, that is a source of great shame.

      "text": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Thursday.\nImproved vaccines could be made possible by a greater understanding of how people naturally resist Covid infection, even when they are clearly exposed to the virus. A team at University College London (UCL) said some people had a degree of Covid immunity before the pandemic began. This most likely came from the body learning how to fight viruses related to Covid-19. Being able to upgrade vaccines to simulate this protection could make them more effective, the team said. \nGerman virologist Christian Drosten has warned that a further 100,000 people will die from Covid-19 if nothing is done to halt a fourth wave spreading across the country. On Wednesday, Germany registered almost 40,000 daily cases, the highest since the pandemic began. \"We have to act right now,\" said Mr Drosten, describing the situation as an emergency. The latest statistics for the UK for 10 November showed 39,329 tested positive. \nThere was little support for new parents and babies during last year's lockdown, but a report this month has warned families' needs are still not being met. The Parent Infant Foundation said \"many babies are invisible\". Leanne Howlett had her baby five months before March 2020 and \"dipped to rock bottom\" with nurseries closed and home visits from the perinatal mental health team dropping away. \"All those missed activities, photos, all those firsts,\" she says.\"My baby's first word was mask.\" \nMarks and Spencer reported a surge in profits as food sales - which have increased 10.4% in six months - helped it bounce back after Covid restrictions. CEO Steve Rowe said it was a combination of post-lockdown demand and internal restructuring. Despite this, M&S said it is planning for \"significant\" increases in supply chain costs because of ongoing worker shortages.\nA memorial dedicated to those who died with Covid-19, and unsung pandemic workers will be unveiled later this month in Barnsley. Members of the public can see the \u00a3210,000 bronze sculpture titled \"Reverence\" from 22 November - key workers and bereaved families will be present at an opening ceremony on the day. The line \"Barnsley's fierce love will hold you forever in its heart\" is to be etched on a plinth in front of the work, made by sculptor Graham Ibbeson.\nGet a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\nRead up about booster jabs and vaccine rules.\nFind further information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?\nIn some cases, your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Sincere condolences to his family. RIP.\"\nDr Se\u00e1n Farren, chair of the John and Pat Hume Foundation, said Mr Currie \"was a true giant of civil rights and constitutional politics\".\n\"He was a courageous leader who dedicated his political life to non-violent peaceful change.

      "text": "A majority of workers in Northern Ireland would like to work from home even after pandemic restrictions are fully lifted, a survey has suggested.\nYouGov surveyed 1,000 local workers online during August, weighted to give a representative sample of adults in work.\nIt was carried out for the Chartered Institute of Personnel & Development.\nThe survey suggests that of those working fully from home, only 3% wanted to return to their office full time.\nIt asked employees: \"Once social distancing measures and other Covid-19-related restrictions are fully relaxed, how often, if at all, would you like to work from home?\"\nAlmost a third of employees (32%) said their job could not be done from home.\nJust over 40% said they would like to work partly from home, 16% favoured working fully from home and 8% said they would not want to work from home at all.\nOf those working partly from home, more than 80% said they wanted to continue that arrangement.\nAmong those working fully from home, there was an even split between those who wanted to continue with that and those who wanted to do some of their work in the office.\nThe survey also found wide variation in home working by occupation, management level, salary or social grade.\nIt suggests that while 80% of board-level managers worked fully or partly from home, this number falls to 41% of those without any management responsibility.\nThe Chartered Institute of Personnel & Development (CIPD) said \"the differences by salary are even starker\" with 69% of people earning up to \u00a320,000 never working from home compared to just 12% of people earning \u00a340,000 and above.\nThe organisation added that \"this underlines the importance of other forms of flexible working (for example, flexi-time, compressed hours, job-sharing) to be made available by employers\"."

      "text": "Cocktail sales have soared in comparison with traditional ales as more young people venture out post-lockdown, says Wetherspoons.\nIn the 15 weeks to 7 November, sales of drinks such as mojitos and cosmopolitans were up 45% on the year before, along with vodka and rum.\nDraught products have suffered, however, with sales of ale down by 30%.\nThe pub chain's chairman said that its older customers had been visiting less frequently.\nUnder coronavirus-related restrictions, the Wetherspoons chain saw its pubs shut for 19 weeks.\nTim Martin, founder and chairman of Wetherspoons, said that some customers had been \"understandably cautious\" as lockdown measures eased.\n\"Improvement in trade will therefore depend, to some extent, on the outlook for the Covid-19 virus,\" he added.\nHe also said that he hoped booster vaccinations and better weather in the spring would improve sales.\nOverall, like-for-like sales - which strip out the effect of new pubs opening - were 8.9% lower for the first 15 weeks of the financial year than the record sales it saw in 2019.\nBar sales dipped by 9.6%, with the chain saying that its Lloyds pubs, which offer music, had performed a bit better at weekends, \"probably reflecting a higher percentage of younger customers\".\nLaura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that a \"permanent\" shift in favour of younger pubgoers could be bad news.\nThe more cautious attitude seen among older customers \"should wane as the pandemic comes under control, but there's no telling how long that will take\", she said.\nFood volumes also appear to have been affected by some customers working from home, Wetherspoons added. Breakfasts were down by 22%, for example. Coffee was also a less popular item on the menu.\nTrade in airports was still continuing to suffer, it said.\nThe firm recently reported a record annual loss of \u00a3154.7m as sales fell sharply in the year to 25 July.\nCertain city centres such as Liverpool, Newcastle, Oxford and Chester had seen pubgoers return more recently, it said on Wednesday. In central London, though, sales are still down by 17.4%.\nAs Covid curbs have eased, the firm has been looking to fill vacancies for pub staff and managers and make the most of the economic recovery.\nIt acknowledged that the hospitality industry had been affected by labour shortages.\n\"Wetherspoon had some isolated difficulties in staycation areas in the summer and during the 'pingdemic'\", it said.\nBut it said that overall, there had been a reasonable number of applications.\nThe number of employees has increased from 36,987 when pubs reopened in April to 42,240.\nLike many hospitality firms, it has also been hit by supply chain issues such as driver shortages, which have been exacerbated by both the pandemic and Brexit.\nIn September, Wetherspoons said some of its pubs had run out of some beer brands, including Heineken and Carling, because brewers had been affected by the shortage of HGV drivers.\nOn Wednesday, it admitted that it had seen \"some problems from time to time\", but shortages had only affected a \"minority of products\".\nProblems have eased in recent weeks, according to the pub chain, although the key festive trading period is still yet to come."

We love you so much our sweet, sweet boy.\"\nPolice have not yet been able to confirm the breed of the dog which has been described as \"large and powerful\".\nGwent Police said the animal belonged to the occupant of the house where Jack was killed.\nA neighbour said someone had gone running to intervene and wrestle the dog off at the house in Pentwyn, Penyrheol.\nJack was a pupil at Cwm Ifor Primary School in Caerphilly, whose head teacher, Gareth Rees, said the whole school community \"has been rocked by the tragic events of the past 24 hours\".\nOfficers were called to the house at 15:55 GMT on Monday following reports of a dog attack. \nCh Supt Mark Hobrough, of Gwent Police, confirmed the attack \"did not happen in the house owned by Jack's family, but inside another property on a nearby street\". \nHe said the dog had been acting \"extremely aggressively\".\nThe force is waiting for an expert witness to formally identify the traits of the dog.\nCh Supt Hobrough said it was \"no doubt dangerous, hazardous and harrowing\" for both the officers attending and the local community. \nPeople at the scene used a distraction technique to get Jack out at \"the first available opportunity\", he said.\nPeople have started to leave flowers at the house where the attack happened - \"RIP Little One\" is one of the messages.\nMany have described the panic and chaos of the scenes yesterday as police arrived on the scene.\nThose officers remain outside the house today, with forensic officers now in and out gathering evidence.\nThe house is in the middle of a large housing estate, family homes with kids' toys in the gardens of many of the houses. \nToday, the shock and sadness in the community is clear - a murky and wet day in Caerphilly mirrors the mood of many. \nParamedics were also called to the scene, where Jack was pronounced dead.\n\"My condolences and thoughts are with Jack's family, friends, school friends and everyone affected by this within the community,\" Ch Supt Hobrough added.\n\"Officers are continuing to make further inquiries at this time and will remain at the scene as the investigation progresses.\"\nNeighbours described being alerted to \"screaming\" in the street on Monday afternoon. \nResident Lorraine Irvine said: \"The kids - they were hysterical. \n\"And within minutes I've never seen so many police cars in my life.\"\nNeighbour Tracey Lawrence said: \"The little boy that lives there ran over to a neighbour saying the dog was attacking his friend and the neighbour couldn't help and couldn't save the boy.\"\nAnother resident, Ricky Willis, said: \"The first I heard of it my neighbour knocked on my door, it's a big shock.\n\"I've lived on this road for 46 years and I've never seen anything like this happen.\"\nOne neighbour, who asked not to be named, described the scene as \"chaos\".\nWhile another said: \"I feel sick to my stomach thinking about what happened to that boy.\"\nHead teacher Mr Rees described Jack as a \"bright and caring pupil who was popular amongst his peers and the teaching staff\".\n\"Our thoughts are very much with his family at this difficult time and we now need time and space to heal together as a school community.\"\nHe said support was being made available for pupils and staff over the coming days \"as we come to terms with this devastating news\".\nCouncillor Steven Skivens, who represents the Penyrheol ward on Caerphilly council, described it as \"an absolutely devastating incident with the loss of such a young life\".\nHe said Jack's family would need time to grieve and \"will need space to get over this incident, if that's possible\".\nSpeaking at First Minister's Questions, Mark Drakeford said: \"You can just imagine the impact this will have on those very young children who know him and who would have, in some cases, very sadly witnessed those awful events.\"\n\"Members here will be thinking about Jack and his family,\" he said, in response to a question by Hefin David, the Member of the Senedd for Caerphilly.\n\"I'm sure that everyone in this chamber would wish to send their condolences and best thoughts to the family and the community of Penyrheol who undoubtedly will rally round in these circumstances,\" said Mr David.

      "tags": "India coronavirus lockdown,Department of Health & Social Care,Social care,Care homes,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children,Sajid Javid",
      "text": "Some care home bosses fear losing 8% of their staff, due to rules insisting they must be double jabbed against Covid-19 or lose their jobs.\nFrom Thursday in England, staff who are neither double vaccinated nor exempt cannot enter a care home.  \nThe warning suggests some care homes could lose large numbers of staff, worsening an existing staffing crisis.\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid says the rule was announced several months ago, and would make care homes safer.  \nThe figure, from the National Care Forum (NCF) is based on research conducted early in November with not-for-profit member organisations running 300 services, supporting 11,000 people and employing 14,000 staff. \nThese providers say 3.5% of their staff have already left because of the vaccination mandate, with 4.4% more who could yet leave, including those who are seeking medical exemption or have self-certified. \nSelf-certification of a medical exemption to being vaccinated allows care staff to continue in their jobs until 24 December. \nAfter that, they must get a formal medical exemption, and employers are worried that some will not succeed. \nRecent reports have suggested there is already an exodus among England's 1.54 million care workers, across the entire sector, from residential homes to providers of care in clients' own homes. \n\"The true cost of implementing this policy has been very high,\" says NCF chief executive Vic Rayner. \n\"It has absorbed a huge amount of time and energy of staff, which could have been better devoted to recruitment and the wellbeing of existing staff,\" she added.\n\"They have instead had to focus on working through dismissal procedures.\"\nDaniela Bell is one of those care workers who have decided against vaccination. \nHer last shift at the care home near Winchester where she has worked for more than three years, ended on Wednesday morning. \"Heartbreaking,\" she says.  \nShe herself was off work with Covid for six weeks earlier this year, and believes antibodies from the infection will protect her.\nShe says she does not know enough about what the vaccine contains, and is concerned about side-effects. \n\"I am not an anti-vaxxer and have had every vaccine until this one.\"\nDaniela is supported by the lobby group Christian Concern, whose chief executive Andrea Williams believes: \"This is an issue of personal autonomy and freedom of conscience...\n\"If this legislation causes the care home sector to collapse over winter, it will bring far more suffering than it prevents.\"  \nAt Hill House Nursing Home near Croydon, owner Pat Robshaw says all but three of her staff have been vaccinated. \nThese three are self-certifying and can work until 24 December. \n\"After that period... we may have to say goodbye to them.\"\nMs Robshaw is concerned that finding replacements for them could be \"exceptionally difficult\". \nShe believes making the vaccines compulsory has backfired. \n\"I think as people have felt forced into having it, this has also made people U-turn and not want to have it and make their voice heard.\"\nAlice Rogers and Francisca Gamalopes are healthcare assistants at Hill House and despite their initial fears, were eventually vaccinated. \nFrancisca says to begin with, she was scared by social media claims that taking the vaccine could mean you \"won't have kids in the future or because we are young, problems, health problems will come\". \nAlice says she read similar social media warnings and \"wasn't ready to take it\". \nHowever, she too eventually went ahead with both doses and is now pregnant, despite earlier worries about the vaccine's effect on her fertility: \"I got pregnant after having my double dose vaccines.\"\nShe says deciding to take it was \"not really about keeping my job...I took it to get safe and my residents as well.\"\nPaul Najsarek, chief executive of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers, is confident that \"the large majority of care homes will absolutely get through this successfully with support from their local authority.\"\nHe says the latest information suggests more than 90% of care staff are now double vaccinated, with almost 95% having had one jab. \nHe says \"a small number of care homes\" in areas where vaccine uptake has been lower could struggle, and some will have to limit the number of new residents they take in. \n\"But overall this has been well managed and the sector will come through it.\"\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Javid said: \"Whilst this is challenging for the sector... it is something that is manageable by the sector\".\nMr Javid warned that without the policy, thousands of care workers were \"more likely than otherwise to be infected with this virus because it is still out there\" and could infect \"people that are so vulnerable it could be fatal and I think that cannot be accepted\"."

      "text": "Some snacks sold as weaning or infant foods contain alarming amounts of sugar which could encourage a sweet tooth from an early age, according to health campaigners. \nAction on Sugar analysed 73 baby and toddler products on sale in UK shops. \nHeinz Farley's Mini Rusks Original, for example, contain the equivalent of two teaspoons of sugar per serving. \nOrganix Banana Soft Oaty Bars, which are sweetened with apple juice concentrate, contain similar.\nKiddylicious Banana Crispy Tiddlers contain more than 50% sugar - 59g for every 100g of the product. \nOverall, 27 of the products tested would qualify for a \"red\" or \"high\" sugar on the front-of-pack traffic light food labelling system. \nOnly six met the criteria for a \"green\" or \"low\" label for sugars. \nAnd 36 of the products claimed - on the packet - that their sweet snacks were suitable for babies under the age of 12 months, even though sugar-sweetened food and drink should be avoided in this age group. \nEven if the sugar comes from added fruit juice, it is not good for babies and toddlers, says Action on Sugar.\nDr Kawther Hashem, Campaign Lead at Action on Sugar, and Research Fellow at Queen Mary University of London, said it was \"ludicrous\" that certain food companies were being allowed to promote high-sugar sweet snacks to parents with very young children, despite them being aware that babies and toddlers shouldn't be having any free sugars. \nShe said: \"Babies can have a preference for sweet foods, due to milk being ever so slightly sweet, but liking sugary foods is something they only learn by eating sugary foods. \n\"Some companies choose to encourage this preference further by providing lots of very sweet products from an early age. What we need is companies to make products with minimal amount of sugars, so young children can grow up enjoying less sweet foods.\"\nRegularly consuming too much sugar at any age can cause health problems, including tooth decay and weight gain. \nBridget Benelam from the British Nutrition Foundation said offering less sweet vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach, early on in weaning may help children learn to accept these flavours. \nNutritionist Holly Gabriel, from Action on Sugar, called for government regulation: \"The Government must release their long-awaited commercial baby food and drink guidelines, and make them mandatory to hold all companies to the same standard. \n\"The Government must also investigate the best way of labelling foods for babies and toddlers to provide better and more honest packaging for parents.\"\nHeinz said: \"Sugar reduction is a key focus for Heinz for Baby and we are looking into ways to improve the products we make. Alongside the original rusks, Farley's offer a range of reduced-sugar rusks with 30% less sugar. \n\"The level of added sugars in these recipes is kept to a minimum consistent with the need to provide a texture which dissolves easily to avoid the risk of choking. Farley's Rusks are very different from typical biscuits, containing very little fat and no added salt.\" \nOrganix said: \"The majority of the sugar content within Organix Soft Oaty Bars comes from dried fruit which contains naturally occurring sugars, rather than the fruit juice concentrate which is used to hold all the ingredients together and to give a suitable texture for a child.\n\"Organix believes in using natural ingredients such as dried fruit which has the nutritional benefits of fibre, vitamins and minerals rather than using artificial sweeteners or table sugar. Fruit juice concentrate can also be used to provide flavour, and we clearly label the front of our packs to be transparent to parents.  This is part of our No Junk Promise.\n\"As a brand we are constantly looking at natural ways to reduce sugar and are excited to share new news on this in 2022.\""

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex has apologised to a court for making a misleading statement in her privacy case against the Mail on Sunday's publishers.\nThe Appeal Court heard she had asked an aide to pass on information to the authors of a biography - despite having earlier said she \"did not contribute\".\nMeghan said she had forgotten the events and had not intended to mislead.\nAssociated Newspapers is trying to overturn a ruling after it published a letter from the duchess to her father.\nMeghan, 40, won her privacy case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday earlier this year, when the High Court found its publication of the letter was unlawful.\nAssociated Newspapers' legal team are now seeking to overturn this judgement at the Court of Appeal, disputing that this was simply a private and personal letter - and have argued that it was crafted with the \"possibility of public consumption\" in mind.\nA spokesman for the Sussexes had previously said the couple \"did not contribute\" to the Finding Freedom biography, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand.\nBut in new evidence heard on Wednesday, Jason Knauf, the couple's former communications secretary, said the book was \"discussed on a routine basis\" and \"discussed directly with the duchess multiple times in person and over email\".\nHe also discussed planning a meeting with the authors to provide background information and said Meghan had given him briefing points to share with them, including information on how she had \"very minimal contact\" with her half-siblings during her childhood.\nTwo of the arguments put forward by Meghan's lawyers in her battle with the Mail on Sunday would appear to have been compromised by these latest revelations. \nShe has always claimed that she did not co-operate with the authors of the book Finding Freedom, but she has now remembered that she provided \"briefing notes\" to one of her key aides who she knew was in touch with the book's authors.\nThe second strand of her case that would appear to have been undermined is her assertion that she had an \"expectation of privacy\" when she sent her handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle, which was partially published by the Mail on Sunday.\nIt has now emerged in previously unpublished texts that she accepted the possibility the letter might be leaked.\nShe had used language, she said in one text to her head of communications, that \"would pull at the heartstrings\".\nIt will now be for the Court of Appeal to decide whether to stand by or overturn the original finding that was in favour of the duchess.\nIn the second day of the appeal hearing, lawyers for Associated Newspapers had also challenged the extent to which the letter from Meghan to her father - at the centre of the case it is trying to overturn - was \"private\".\nThey quoted an exchange of text messages between the duchess and Mr Knauf in which Meghan said: \"Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked, so I have been meticulous in my word choice.\"\nMr Knauf's evidence to the court also included emails with the Duke of Sussex, discussing the proposed meeting with the authors and the need to conceal any involvement by Prince Harry and Meghan.\nThe former aide said Prince Harry replied: \"I totally agree that we have to be able to say we didn't have anything to do with it.\n\"Equally, you giving the right context and background to them would help get some truths out there.\"\nIn a witness statement to the court the duchess said she accepted that her aide did provide information to the authors of the book with her knowledge but she said the \"extent of the information he shared is unknown to me\".\n\"When I approved the passage... I did not have the benefit of seeing these emails and I apologise to the court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time,\" she said.\n\"I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court.\"\nThe duchess added that she would have been \"more than happy\" to refer to the exchanges with Mr Knauf if she had been aware of them at the time, but said they were \"a far cry from the very detailed personal information that the defendant alleges that I wanted or permitted to put into the public domain\".\nAnother reason the duchess gave for not discovering the emails between her and Mr Knauf sooner was that the disclosure stage of the litigation had not yet been reached, and in October last year her lawyers applied to adjourn the trial date as she was pregnant.\nShe said she was advised to avoid stress after a recent miscarriage, which came shortly after Associated Newspapers Limited indicated it wished to reveal the identities of her five friends who gave an interview to the US magazine People, in which they referred to her relationship with her father.\nMeghan said: \"I was in the first trimester of my third pregnancy at the time, having suffered a miscarriage a few months prior, and was feeling very unwell.\n\"My doctor advised me to avoid stress, particularly given the recent miscarriage days after the defendant threatened to break the confidentiality of the original 'sources' for the People magazine article, which resulted in my having to make an urgent application for an anonymity order.\n\"This was granted... but I found the process extremely stressful, and it took its toll physically and emotionally.\n\"I have at all times wanted to protect the privacy of those friends, while the defendant was, it seemed to me, doing everything it could to make this litigation as intrusive as possible.\" "

It is just not going to happen.\"\nSaint Luke's is a newer music venue and bar around the corner from the Barrowland. It has quickly cemented itself in the hearts of Glaswegian music lovers. It had hoped to enjoy a COP26 boost but people have been avoiding the city.\nOwner Michael thinks it has been a missed opportunity.\n\"Messaging has told people to stay away from the city but I think that's a mistake. I think they should have been embracing the event and the visitors. People make Glasgow but nobody is in Glasgow to make it.\"\nHe thinks a lot of Glaswegians have felt a bit detached from what is going on at the COP26 conference.\n\"We had a fringe festival called Beyond The Green over the weekend to do with sustainability and building products. But we put everything on ourselves. I think they have missed a trick in not getting everybody else in the city involved.\"\nReeta Fashions is another Barras institution, outfitting the brides of Glasgow for the past 70 years. \nOwner Sheran is proud her city has been hosting COP26 and took her 10-year-old daughter to the climate rally last weekend. \n\"She knows all about climate change, they have been learning about it at school and I think it's important for her to understand. I think it's really positive for the city.\n\"Although the big motorcades were a bit uncomfortable to see, because that doesn't really represent climate change.\"\nSheran is aware of the damage the fashion industry does to the environment and is happy to see her industry changing.\n\"A lot of our suppliers are changing the way the fabrics are being made, to make them more environmentally friendly, which is great to see.\"\nDenise dishes out \"rolls and sausage and banter\" in the east end of the city. The only thing she has noticed about COP26 being in town is that the city and even the Barras has been quiet, even at the weekend when it's usually the busiest time.\n\"For my kids and their kids I worry about climate change,\" she says. \"It upsets me to see billionaires going into space when there's so much more that can be done to make things better on this planet.\n\"I know this is down to all of us so I am a big recycler. I buy all the different recycling bags from the council to make sure we recycle properly.\"\nUnbeknown to the locals, some COP26 activity is merely metres away from them. Around the corner from Dengy's, in the Pipe Factory venue,  a session is exploring how to get more women into the COP negotiations.\nGeorgia Elliot-Smith is a former UNESCO special junior envoy for youth and the environment. She is part of a a group called She Changes Climate that is trying to see at least 50% representation of women at the top table of climate negotiations - 90% at the moment are male.\nShe said: \"We've had 25 previous COPs and yet carbon emissions are still increasing - we feel we need a different mentality, a different perspective, some diversity to come up with different solutions because what we have been doing isn't working.\n\"We wanted to be real and part of the community and to bring people into a different Glasgow - to bring women from all over the world together to see what we can do.\" "

      "title": "The extraordinary story of how 300 volunteers rescued a stranded caver",
      "tags": "Brecon Beacons",
      "text": "One of the UK's longest cave rescue operations has ended safely after 300 volunteers came together from across the country to put their caving expertise to the test. \n\"I was lying in the passageway at one point, and to the right of me there was a Yorkshire accent. To the left there was a Somerset accent, and opposite me an Irish accent,\" says one rescuer - reflecting on the diversity of those who travelled to the Brecon Beacons for the critical mission.\nSteve Thomas of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team is describing just one of the incredible moments in the 54-hour-long operation to bring an injured caver to safety. \nThere are 16 cave rescue teams across England, Wales and Scotland - and each one usually operates alone. But, \"very occasionally you get a situation like this\", says Mr Thomas.\n\"It's a question of all hands to the pump - all the other teams rally round to work on a mutual problem.\"\nTen teams came together, each travelling up to 200 miles, taking time off work, and spending more than two days crawling through the freezing water of the fearsome Ogof Ffynnon Ddu cave system - spurred on by banter and little treats stored in their helmets.\nOgof Ffynnon Ddu, which translates as Cave of the Black Spring, is not for novices - and permits are needed to visit it.\nIt is one of the deepest cave systems in the UK, with its lowest passageways 274m (901ft) below the surface.\nAccording to the South Wales Caving Club, its size and very technical nature make it \"challenging even for experienced cavers\".\nThe entire route from the system's top to bottom entrances is described as a \"classic\" - during which cavers will see everything from \"huge chambers, beautiful formations, to yawning chasms and thundering river passages\".\nThe stranded man - who has been named as George Linnane from Bristol, and described as an \"experienced, fit caver\" - entered with his caving partner via the Cwm Dwr entrance on Saturday afternoon. They got about a mile into the 43.5-mile (70km) underground network when he fell and was unable to move.\nIt later transpired Mr Linnane had suffered tibia, fibula, jaw and chest injuries.\nIt was \"an unfortunate, chance accident\", says one rescuer, Peter Francis. \"A matter of putting his foot in the wrong place\".\nSteve Thomas says accidents happen to even the most competent cavers. \"A boulder can stay in place for 10,000 years and one day it will just move and that's just the way it goes.\"\nThe caving partner raised the alarm and Steve Thomas's team quickly found him. He was assessed medically and his injuries were found to be serious but not life-threatening. \nBut the challenge facing cave teams was how to bring him out safely - through the underground system's labyrinthine passages. Jobs were allocated to rescuers - such as getting medical supplies and specialist equipment down to him.\nA UK-wide call for help was then issued. South Gloucestershire Cave Rescue Group was first to join the efforts, but then the number of rescue teams converging on south Wales snowballed.\n\"This was a completely voluntary operation, nobody gets paid... and the co-operation between the teams and the standard to which everybody worked was absolutely 100%,\" says Mr Thomas.  \nThe underground scene was \"a real tangle of passages on multiple levels\" says Bill Whitehouse of the Derbyshire Cave Rescue Organisation.\n\"Moving through a section of passage for an uninjured, fit caver can be a challenge - squeezing through things, climbing on things, wading through water and so on - but it can be done.\n\"But when people are immobilised they have to be put on a stretcher and brought out by a team of 10 or so people.\n\"Imagine everyone trying to manoeuvre the stretcher through holes only big enough for one person to go through. It's a very slow process - 10 to 20 times longer than normal.\"\nSteve Thomas agrees. There were plenty of natural obstacles to navigate, he says.\n\"Caves are natural things, they have no footpaths. They are geological wonders but full of boulders, potholes and waterfalls. Each one has to be negotiated in its own way.\" \nBy about 04:00 on Sunday they had managed to get the man to a bigger passage and the operation was becoming technically easier, but Mr Thomas says the conditions still made for exhausting work.   \n\"It can be tough, especially when there's a delay and you've got to wait. We were all soaked through to the skin and there's always a draught in caves so there's a chill factor and it doesn't take long to sap you.\"\nKeeping team spirits up was crucial, he says, and \"banter\" played an important role. \n\"Just supporting each other. It's a very friendly environment that we create.\"\nThey also all carried sweets and chocolate in their helmets. \nBut conditions were brutal nevertheless. An electrically-heated \"over suit\", which the rescuers had carried down for Mr Linnane, ended up being used by a volunteer who was communicating with the surface and was getting cold.\nCommunication between the rescuers and those above ground was possible through a system called \"Cave Link\" which allows messages to be transmitted through rock via the water particles in the limestone  - a system rescue leader Paul Taylor described as \"absolutely revolutionary in this incident\".\nBy Monday morning, more than 36 hours after Mr Linnane became trapped, Julian Carter - who works for National Museum Wales - was joking how they \"should all be in work now\". He spent two shifts co-ordinating efforts in the caves. \nMeanwhile in Maesteg, north of Bridgend, the involvement of employees at architecture firm Thomas and Associates meant the company could not even open on Monday morning.\n\"We will be away today, we are assisting with a cave rescue in Powys. Let's bring him home. Have a great day, we will be back tomorrow,\" it posted. \nTravelling hundreds of miles across the UK is a relatively short distance, however, compared with flying to Thailand to help with a rescue there. That is what some involved in the operation did in 2018, after 12 young footballers and their coach had become trapped deep inside a cave underneath a mountain in Chiang Rai province.\nOn that occasion it took two weeks to free them all. \nIn the Brecon Beacons - as in Thailand - complicated rescue attempts rely on trust and teamwork. They can't be done with just a handful of people. \nAllan Berry, chairman of Derbyshire Cave Rescue, led a team of 18 to the Brecon Beacons. \"It's a 3D maze down there,\" he says - with teams having to swap regularly because of the sheer physical effort. The distance in a straight line may not be huge, but the terrain is extremely difficult. \n\"Through squeezes and up waterfalls - and sometimes you have to bring the stretcher up vertically using ropes. Sometimes you are lying down and letting the stretcher slide over you or using your knees to let the stretcher go across.\"\nBy midday on Monday, the injured man was being moved towards the entrance and was talking to his rescuers.\nIt was, by now, the longest cave rescue ever undertaken in Wales according to those leading it, eclipsing the previous record that ran to 41 hours.\nSome were predicting it could take another 10 hours to get him out, with one saying: \"He's lucky to be with us. He's in a bad way.\"\nHowever, by 16:30, with the drizzly and misty conditions turning to dark, rescuer Peter Francis sounded more optimistic.\n\"It's a matter of time before we get him out. He's warm, he's stable. The doctor with him is monitoring him the whole time and we're not worried about him getting hypothermia.\"\nRescuers had been attempting to keep the man fed and warm as well as dealing with basics, such as removing bodily fluids, as they neared the surface. \nRescuers had been unable to get him out of the Cwm Dwr entrance on a stretcher, so the operation involved getting him up to another one of the three exits, delaying the process. \nBy Monday evening, 70 volunteers were underground, in addition to specialist medics, before Mr Linnane was finally brought up at about 20:00.\nFoggy and wet conditions in the Brecon Beacons meant an air ambulance helicopter was unable to land, and he was taken to hospital by Land Rover.\nWhile rescuers described him as doing \"remarkably well\", equally remarkable was how cavers from around the UK pulled together in their community's hour of need.\n\"People were making food for the rescuers, organising teams to work in relay, calling up other volunteers, providing babysitting for those who brought their kids to the club because they were needed to help, but had no babysitter,\" said Marieke Vink, who praised the rescuers.\n\"From everywhere, volunteers arrived at the club, ready to put their own life on the line to rescue a fellow caver.\""

      "text": "A Japanese train driver is suing his employer after he was docked 56 yen ($0.49; \u00a30.36) in wages for causing a brief delay to the country's famously punctual rail system. \nTrain company JR West fined the man after a work mix-up in June 2020 caused a one-minute delay to operations. \nIt argued that no labour had been performed during the stoppage. \nThe employee is seeking 2.2 million yen ($19,407; \u00a314,347) in damages for mental anguish caused by the ordeal. \nAccording to the Japanese news site, Soranews24, the unnamed man was scheduled to pilot an empty train to Okayama station in the south of the country, but arrived at the wrong platform while waiting to take over from the previous driver. \nBy the time he realised his mistake and had rushed to the correct platform, the transfer between the two drivers had been delayed by two minutes, leading to a one-minute delay in the train's departure and a one-minute delay in warehousing the train at the depot. \nJR West initially docked the man 85 yen ($0.75; \u00a30.55), but later agreed to reduce the fine to 56 yen after the driver took the case to the Okayama Labour Standards Inspection Office. \nHowever, the employee refused to accept the reduction and has argued that the delay caused no actual disruption to the timetables or passengers as the train was empty during the incident.\nBut the company says it applied the \"no work, no pay principle\", as it would for an employee's late arrival or an unexplained absence.\nThe driver took his case to the Okayama District Court in March, where he is now seeking damages. \nJapan's rail system is known for its reliability. In 2017 a rail company issued an apology after one of its trains left a station 20 seconds early. \nAnd if a train delayed by more than five minutes, passengers are issued with a certificate they can use as an excuse for being late.

      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "Despite pledges made at the climate summit COP26, the world is still nowhere near its goals on limiting global temperature rise, a new analysis shows.\nIt calculates that the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations committed to.\nCOP26 \"has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap\", according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT).\nThe Glasgow summit is seen as crucial for curbing climate change.\nBut the prediction contrasts with optimism at the UN meeting last week, following a series of big announcements that included a vow to stop deforestation.\nCOP26 is expected to finish this week.\nThe projection comes as the UK's Met Office warns that a billion people could be affected by fatal heat and humidity if the global average temperature rises by 2C above pre-industrial levels.\nThe report by Climate Action Tracker looks at promises made by governments before and during COP26. \nIt concludes that, in 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet will still be twice as high as necessary for keeping temperature rise below 1.5C degree.\nScientists say that limiting warming to 1.5C will prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change from happening.\nThe COP summit held in Paris in 2015 laid out a plan for avoiding dangerous climate change which included \"pursuing efforts\" to keep warming under 1.5C.\nBut when governments' actual policies - rather than pledges - are analysed, the world's projected warming is 2.7C by 2100, suggests Climate Action Tracker. The Tracker is backed by a number of organisations including the prestigious Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.\n\"This new calculation is like a telescope trained on an asteroid heading for Earth. It's a devastating report that in any sane world would cause governments in Glasgow to immediately set aside their differences and work with uncompromising vigour for a deal to save our common future,\" said Greenpeace International's executive director Jennifer Morgan.\nHowever, the world's outlook has improved since the Paris climate summit in 2015 when Climate Action Tracker estimated the policies put the planet on track to warm by 3.6C.\nClimate Action Tracker blames \"stalled momentum\" from governments for limited progress towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\nIt says new promises by the US and China to reach net zero have slightly improved its forecasting on temperature rises. But it concludes that the quality of most government's plans to limit climate change is very low.\nReaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, planting trees - which remove CO2 from the atmosphere.\nMore than 140 governments have promised to reach net zero, covering 90% of global emissions.\nBut Climate Action Tracker says only a handful have plans in place to reach the goal. It analysed the policies of 40 countries and concluded that only a small number are rated \"acceptable\", covering a fraction of the world's emissions.\n\"If they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,\" said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind the Tracker.\nThe main driver of the gap between promises and projections is continued coal and gas production, the organisation concludes.\nWith one sharp jab, this Climate Action Tracker report has punctured the balloon of optimism that's been swelling since the start of this conference. \nFor days now, a number of observers, including the formerly conservative International Energy Agency, have been pushing a narrative that the new net zero goals from countries like India plus the long list of announcements made here in Glasgow had pushed the prospective temperature rise this century down to 1.8C.\nThat seemed like huge progress from the 2.7C that the UN Environment Programme had announced at the start of the conference. \nSo how has the confusion come about?\nThe problem comes from the inclusion of long-term pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050. \nMore than 140 countries, covering 90% of global emissions have announced a mid-century-ish carbon neutrality target - China's is 2060, India's 2070.\nAccording to the CAT, these goals are giving \"false hope\". \nBased on what countries have put on the table for 2030, the world is set to warm by 2.4C by 2100. That picture gets a bit better if you include the US's and China's long-term targets, which reduces the temperature to 2.1C.\nIf every country implemented their long-term net zeroes, then 1.8C could indeed be possible.\nBut the reality is that, without a serious plan for 2030, most of these longer-term goals will not be realised.\nThat's why the real focus for the negotiators here must be on the actions that countries take over the next nine years. \nAny deal agreed here will need to have a strong and credible pathway for the next decade. Otherwise Glasgow will be judged a failure. \nThe summit is still negotiating a deal that all 197 countries will agree on. But a series of side deals were announced last week:"

      "text": "Afghanistan's ex-finance minister has blamed the government's fall on corrupt officials who invented \"ghost soldiers\" and took payments from the Taliban.\nKhalid Payenda told the BBC that most of the 300,000 troops and police on the government's books did not exist.\nHe said phantom personnel were added to official lists so that generals could pocket their wages.\nThe Taliban rapidly seized control of Afghanistan in August, as US forces withdrew after 20 years in the country. \nMr Payenda, who resigned and left Afghanistan as the Islamist group advanced, said records showing that security forces greatly outnumbered the Taliban were incorrect.\n\"The way the accountability was done, you would ask the chief in that province how many people you have and based on that you could calculate salaries and ration expenses and they would always be inflated,\" he told Ed Butler, presenter of the BBC's Business Daily programme.\nThe former minister said the numbers may have been inflated by more than six times, and included \"desertions [and] martyrs who were never accounted for because some of the commanders would keep their bank cards\" and withdraw their salaries, he alleged. \nThere have long been questions over Afghan troop numbers. \nA 2016 report by the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) claimed that \"neither the United States nor its Afghan allies know how many Afghan soldiers and police actually exist, how many are in fact available for duty, or, by extension, the true nature of their operational capabilities\".\nIn a more recent report, Sigar expressed \"serious concerns about the corrosive effects of corruption... and the questionable accuracy of data on the actual strength of the force\".\nMr Payenda said that troops who did exist were often not paid on time, while there were leaders of government-backed militias who were \"double-dipping\" - taking their government wage, and then also accepting payments from the Taliban to give up without a fight. \n\"The whole feeling was, we cannot change this. This is how the parliament works, this is how the governors work. Everybody would say the stream is murky from the very top, meaning the very top is involved in this,\" he said.\nHe said he did not think former President Ashraf Ghani was \"financially corrupt\". Responding to accusations of corruption within the finance ministry, Mr Payenda said: \"I agree with that to a certain extent but in these issues, absolutely not.\" \nHe added that the West was \"part of\" some of the failures in Afghanistan, and described the US and Nato's involvement in the country as \"a great opportunity lost\".

      "text": "People going to cinemas and theatres in Wales will be required to show a Covid pass after the Welsh government won a vote in the Senedd.\nCurrently, visitors to nightclubs and large events have to show they are fully vaccinated, have tested negative for Covid or have recently had the virus to enter.\nFrom Monday, it will be extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls.\nLabour ministers won the vote after Plaid Cymru backed the plans.\nAnyone aged over 16 in Wales can get an NHS Covid pass if they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the previous 48 hours.\nThe new law passed with 39 Members of the Senedd voting for and 15 against, with the Welsh Conservatives and Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds opposed.\nOn Tuesday night, Big Brother Watch, a civil liberties campaign, said it was starting legal proceedings against the Welsh government, calling the scheme \"authoritarian, invasive and unevidenced\".\nBut Labour said the Covid pass was popular and Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the extension was designed to keep cinemas and theatres open over the winter months.\nHundreds of protesters gathered on the Senedd steps in Cardiff Bay on Tuesday, amid concerns the passes unreasonably restrict personal freedom.\nThe vote was in contrast to October when ministers won the first Covid pass decision by a single vote when one Conservative MS was unable to log on to Zoom to vote remotely.\nAt the time the Welsh government - which holds exactly half of the 60 seats in the Senedd - had faced defeat with the whole opposition, including Plaid, against the plans.\nThe planned extension had divided opinion among those working in cinemas and theatres.\nCardiff Bay's Wales Millennium Centre said it welcomed any moves that would ensure the safety of its audiences and allow it to remain open, particularly before Christmas.\nSteve Reynolds, director of Picturedrome Cinemas, which runs Maxime cinema in Blackwood, said he felt cinemas and theatres were being \"singled out\".\nHe worried about the impact it could have on the trade: \"Cinemas won't survive if they have a dramatic fall in business\".\nPublic Health Wales gives the latest seven day average Covid case rate as 527.7 per 100,000 people.\nBut Ms Morgan told a Senedd debate the case rate was still \"very high\" and has been increasing in some areas.\n\"Our aim is to avoid having to close sectors or reintroduce restrictions,\" she said, claiming \"the vast majority of the Welsh public are with us\".\nConservative constitutional spokesman Darren Millar said there were \"many ethical and equality issues with Covid passes\", repeating concerns that results from lateral flow devices are self-declared.\n\"You can swab your dog and put its result in that system and still get your vaccine passport to be able to attend any event, nightclub, cinema theatre or anywhere else, it is ridiculous.\"\nPlaid health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth indicated last week the party was likely to back the extension, but its stance was not confirmed until Tuesday lunchtime.\nHe said: \"Plaid Cymru has made it clear throughout this pandemic that we'll support evidence-based actions that can help limit transmission and keep the people of Wales safe.\n\"After examining the evidence, including that provided by the Welsh government, we are willing to support extending the passes to help mitigate the transmission of Covid.\"\nWelsh Liberal Democrat leader Ms Dodds said her opposition was \"foremost\" about \"the lack of evidence\". \nShe told the Senedd she had still not received any evidence that the passes \"work to reduce transmission or to improve the uptake of the vaccine\".\nThe vote took place as the Labour government continues to negotiates a co-operation deal with Plaid in Cardiff Bay. \nThe parties have been discussing working together for months, as Labour lacks an outright majority, but they are not expected to enter a formal coalition.\nNightlife industry group NTIA, which has opposed the Covid pass scheme from the start, said cinemas and theatres would experience \"significant challenges\". \nChief executive Michael Kill added: \"There is a huge concern throughout the hospitality and night time economy sectors that Welsh government will take this even further to encompass more businesses, which without a doubt will cripple the industries involved.\""

      "tags": "COP26,Paris climate agreement,Climate change",
      "text": "A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\nEmissions\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \"climate catastrophe\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \nCoal\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \nDeveloping countries\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \"start of a breakthrough\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \nFossil fuel subsidies\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \"clean\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \"well below\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\nCOP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\nTop image from Getty Images.

      "text": "Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has accused Belarus of committing \"terrorism\" over its role in an escalating border row between the two countries.\n\"It's clear that what we are confronted with here is a demonstration of state terrorism,\" he told a news conference. \nThousands of migrants are stuck at the border in freezing weather, attempting to enter EU member Poland. \nThe EU has also accused Belarus's leader of provoking the crisis. \nBut Alexander Lukashenko, who won a largely discredited election last year, denies claims Belarus is sending people over the border in revenge for EU sanctions.\nThe migrants - mostly from the Middle East - are mainly young men but there are also women and children. They are camping in tents just inside Belarus, trapped between Polish guards on one side, and Belarusian guards on the other.\nThe situation has come to a head this week with repeated attempts to tear down the razor-wire fence erected on Poland's eastern frontier. \nMr Morawiecki's latest comments came at a news conference in Warsaw with European Council President Charles Michel. He said he believed the crisis was a result of Mr Lukashenko's \"quiet revenge\" for Poland's support of the Belarusian opposition. \nMr Michel said he had come to Warsaw to show the EU's solidarity with Poland. He said the use of men, women and children as tools to achieve political goals was \"shameful and unacceptable\". \n\"Sanctions are on the table. We must now co-ordinate with member states to identify most efficient tools\", he told the conference. \"This hybrid attack against Poland and the EU must stop.\"\nHe said the EU must decide whether to fund fences by member states in the face of such crises, adding it was legally possible. President of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen said that sanctions would be widened against Belarus next week. \nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel phoned Mr Putin on Wednesday, asking him to press Belarus to stop the \"instrumentalisation of migrants\", her spokesman said. \nBut Russia said on Wednesday it was \"irresponsible\" for Poland to blame Russia for the crisis. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the EU should provide financial support to Belarus to deal with migrants. \nUkraine, which shares a border with Belarus, is doubling the number of border guards on its frontier to prevent migrants from entering the country illegally.\nThe UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis on Thursday. \nDozens of Polish police vehicles race to the village of Kuznica where up to 4,000 migrants are effectively trapped on the other side of the border. \nThe area remains out of bounds for media and, crucially, aid agencies - much to their despair. \nOne man we contacted, an Iraqi Kurd, told us they'd endured another night in freezing conditions and asked us in exasperation what sort of life this was.\nWhen I then asked what they were all doing for food, he said the Belarusians were providing supplies. But other migrants have also told us the Belarus security forces are also giving out wire-cutters to help break through the fence in places where Poland's numerous guards are thin on the ground.\nThe European Commission says Belarus enticed migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an \"inhuman, gangster-style approach\" and it has listed some 20 countries from which migrants have flown into Minsk, mainly on tourist visas.\nPoland has been accused of pushing migrants back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. \n\"Nobody is letting us get in anywhere, Belarus or Poland,\" said 33-year-old Shwan Kurd, who described arriving in Belarus at the start of November.\n\"There's no way to escape,\" he said. \"Poland won't let us in. We are so hungry. There's no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women, and families.\"\nAre you in the area? Have you been affected by what's been happening?

      "tags": "Anne-Marie Trevelyan,Owen Paterson,UK Parliament,Lobbying in the United Kingdom",
      "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson is proposing to ban MPs from acting as paid political consultants.\nThe Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer has been calling for this to happen, saying the ban would help end \"dodgy lobbying\". \nThe planned shake up of the rules comes after Owen Paterson was found to have broken lobbying rules - which led to the issue of MPs' second jobs coming under scrutiny.  \nQuestions have been raised about the Conservative MP and former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox who earned around \u00a3900,000 last year through his work as a lawyer. \nYes, as long as they are not a minister.\nMore than 200 MPs have received earnings in the last year on top of their \u00a381,932 annual salary. The extra earnings range from \u00a350 a year to almost \u00a31m.\nMPs must publicly declare any additional income, along with gifts, donations and shareholdings over 15%.\nThose who leave government must consult the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments about any jobs they want to take up in the two years after leaving their post. They are banned from lobbying the government for two years.\nAll MPs are \"strictly forbidden\" from getting paid \"in return for advocating a particular matter\" in Parliament.\nHaving MPs with second professions has previously been seen as a good thing.\nIn 1995, the standards committee said that not having them would \"not serve the best interests of democracy\". It argued that Parliament needed \"a wide range of current experience which can contribute to its expertise\".\nThe current debate is mainly regarding MPs who earn money as consultants or advisers. Less controversial second jobs range from doctors and nurses, to referees and musicians.\nThe following MPs have registered income from consultancy work on the Register of Members' Financial Interests in the last year. There is no suggestion that any of the MPs listed below have broken any rules.\nMost of the MPs who have second jobs are not consultants.\nSome of the highest earners in the House of Commons are lawyers. \nSir Geoffrey Cox, who was attorney general during the height of the Brexit negotiations, has registered almost \u00a3900,000 in the last year for around 1,000 hours of legal work. \nThis included travelling to the British Virgin Islands (BVI) to advise on a corruption inquiry. He was there for a number of weeks, meaning he was carrying out his work as an MP - including voting - from the Caribbean.\nSir Geoffrey has been referred by Labour to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards for apparently taking part in a virtual meeting for a client while in his Commons office. \nThe Conservative MP has denied breaching the rules.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is also a barrister, has made more than \u00a3100,000 for legal work, writing and making speeches since becoming an MP in 2015. There is no suggestion he has done anything against the rules, and Sir Keir says all the work was carried out before he became leader last year.\nA number of MPs are also employed as doctors and nurses. Some have continued to work on the NHS front line during the pandemic."

      "tags": "Coronavirus vaccines,NHS,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "It will become compulsory for frontline NHS staff in England to be fully vaccinated against Covid, the health secretary has confirmed.\nSajid Javid told MPs that he expected to set a deadline for the beginning of April to give 103,000 unvaccinated workers time to get both jabs.\nHe said the move would help protect patients and the NHS as a whole.\nBut concerns have been raised that it could lead some workers to leave, adding to healthcare staffing issues.\nMore than 93% of NHS frontline staff have had their first dose and 90% are fully vaccinated, Javid said. That is higher than the general working-age population, where about 81% have had both doses.\nThe government's decision follows a consultation which considered whether both the Covid and flu jabs should be compulsory.\nMr Javid said the flu vaccine would not be made mandatory. \nThose with a medical reason not to have the Covid jab would be exempt, he said, as would those who do not have face-to-face contact with patients.\nIn a Commons statement, Mr Javid said compulsory vaccination would \"protect patients in the NHS, protect colleagues in the NHS and, of course, protect the NHS itself\". \nHe said the requirement would be enforced 12 weeks after parliamentary approval - likely to be from April. \nNo unvaccinated worker should be \"scapegoated or shamed\", said Mr Javid, and should instead be supported to make \"a positive choice\".\nThursday is the deadline for care home workers in England to get vaccinated.\nEach of the four UK nations makes its own decisions on the issue. \nScotland and Wales have not made any proposals to make Covid jabs compulsory for NHS workers or care home staff, while in Northern Ireland there is to be a public consultation.\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents England's NHS trusts, said: \"We understand why people are vaccine-hesitant. We need to win the argument with them rather than beat them around the head.\"\nThe possibility of losing staff was a \"real problem\" as the NHS runs on fine margins and already relies on staff to work extra shifts, he added.\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged Mr Javid to proceed with caution - pointing to waiting lists \"close to six million\" and more than 90,000 job vacancies across the NHS.\nThere will be anxiety that chronic understaffing problems could be exacerbated, he said. \"We simply cannot afford to lose thousands of NHS staff overnight.\"\nThe logic behind this move is obvious - the virus presents a real risk to vulnerable people in hospital and the vaccine reduces the chances of infection and transmission.\nSo it's not hard to understand why insisting on jabs for staff who have contact with patients will, in theory, help protect patients.\nBut if it causes more staffing shortages that simply increases risk in another way.\nThere are already more than 90,000 vacancies in the NHS in England. It is a number that has actually fallen during the pandemic after staff put off retiring to help out.\nIf those staff take up their option to retire and mandatory vaccination forces others out, the NHS could find itself severely short of staff come the spring.\nMandatory vaccination comes into force for the care sector this week. Since it was announced, only two-thirds of the unvaccinated have come forward.\nIf a similar trend is seen for the NHS, vacancies would likely balloon to unprecedented levels.\nUnison head of health Sara Gorton said she feared the move might knock staff morale further and prompt workers to leave - or lose their job.\nThe government should consider alternatives like daily testing, she said, and not risk making the same mistake made with mandatory jabs in social care - which she said had led to an unprecedented staffing crisis.\nFrom Thursday, care homes will be required to refuse entry to workers who have not been fully vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption or there is an emergency.\nMr Javid said that since announcing the requirement for care staff, the number of unvaccinated workers in the sector has fallen from 88,000 to 32,000 in the last month.\nDouglas Ferguson, a surgeon at Exeter Hospital, said it was the government's responsibility to protect the population, describing the policy as \"quite sensible\". \n\"I think, to be honest, if people who don't want to be vaccinated feel that an injection, which is very well scientifically researched, is something that they decide they're going to change their entire career for, it seems unwise, I would say.\" \nOverall, Mr Ferguson thought the move was likely to be welcomed by staff.\n\"If all the staff know everybody else is vaccinated - I mean the majority are already anyway - I think it would give further confidence in you doing your job and potentially from those members of staff also.\" \nHe added that he only knew of one colleague who had chosen not to be vaccinated. \nThe latest NHS figures show vaccination rates vary hugely: among hospitals, Dorset County hospital has the highest at 94.6%, while Barts Health NHS Trust has the lowest rate of fully vaccinated staff, at 79.7%.\nAt Southampton General Hospital, frontline workers were told by letter in September they would face redeployment if they did not get vaccinated.\nOne worker, who has been redeployed after refusing to get the vaccine, said it was \"disappointing\" but not unexpected that jabs would be made compulsory for NHS workers.\nShe said she felt it was against her human rights to be forced to take the vaccination and said it should be her decision.\n\"I'm angry,\" she said. \"Probably I will just go and get it, what other options have I got?\"\nUniversity Hospital Southampton Trust, which runs the hospital, said a \"small number\" of staff had been redeployed to jobs away from patients as part of its strategy to prevent infection. \nThey were being offered advice and guidance about the vaccine and their permanent jobs and pay were protected, it said.\nSome countries have already introduced compulsory vaccination - including France, which had to suspend 3,000 unvaccinated healthcare workers in September.\nMore than 45.8 million people in the UK have had two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, meaning 79.8% of people aged over 12 are fully vaccinated, while 87.5% have had a first dose.\nVaccinated people have a lower risk of catching Covid and are less likely to become seriously ill or need to go to hospital, but there is still a chance they can transmit the virus.\nThe number of daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 remains high but Tuesday was the sixth day in a row that the figure came in under 40,000, with 33,559 cases reported. A further 262 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, down from 293 for the same day last week.\nCorrection: This story has been amended to make clear that Barts Health NHS Trust has the lowest vaccine take-up rate among trusts running hospitals in England, and not Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust as previously stated."

      "text": "Boeing has reached an agreement with the families of the 157 people who died in the Ethiopia 737 Max crash in 2019.\nThe plane maker accepts liability for their deaths, according to court documents in Chicago.\nIn return, families of the victims will not seek punitive damages from the company.\nLawyers for the victims' families said Boeing would still be held \"fully accountable\", welcoming the agreement as a significant milestone.\nBoeing shares fell 1% to $218.50 on the news. \nThe agreement opens the way for families outside the US, in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya, to claim compensation through the US courts, rather than in their home countries, which might be more difficult and result in lower payments.\nMark Pegram in the UK, whose son Sam was one of the victims, said: \"The main positive for us is that Boeing is admitting liability, and not diverting blame onto Ethiopian Airlines or the pilots... we wanted them to hold their hands up.\"\nSam's mother Debbie told the BBC: \"All we are looking to do with any compensation is set up a charity in Sam's name. It's what we want to do and it's what Sam would have wanted us to do.\"\nAt the time of the crash, the 737 Max was Boeing's best-selling plane. \nBut two fatal accidents within five months - the Ethiopia Airlines flight out of Addis Ababa and before that a Lion Air jet that came down into the sea off Indonesia - signalled there were serious faults with the aircraft.\nThe planes were grounded for 20 months, while investigations took place, but have since been allowed to return to operations after the firm made significant changes to their software and training.\nWords are important and in this agreement Boeing accepts responsibility for the crash of ET302 - a disaster which claimed the lives of 157 people from 35 different countries. \nThe world may have moved on and the 737 Max may be flying again, but for many of the families of those who died, the grief and sense of loss remains very raw indeed. \nIn the period since the two accidents involving the 737 Max, Boeing has faced criticism for appearing to deflect blame elsewhere, for example by questioning the abilities of the pilots. \nSo that admission of liability really does matter.  \nFor Boeing, the agreement provides some protection, by removing the possibility of relatives seeking potentially very high punitive damages and by making it unlikely current or former executives will be called to testify in court.\nAlongside the settlement reached in a lawsuit bought by shareholders last week - who had been suing the company over unsafe business practices - it removes much of the legal jeopardy the aerospace giant had been facing. \nBut the company has made a significant concession. It has agreed that all compensation claims can be made under US law, which provides for much higher levels of compensation than would apply in many other countries. \nThe agreement reached in Chicago, Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, opens the way for compensation claims to be made. \nWhile it does not stipulate any specific level of compensation for the victims' families, the agreement will limit the scale and scope of any further procedures.\nLegal experts say it makes the prospect of current or former Boeing executives testifying in court much less likely.\n\"Boeing is committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss,\" the plane maker said in a statement.\n\"By accepting responsibility, Boeing's agreement with the families allows the parties to focus their efforts on determining the appropriate compensation for each family.\"\nLawyers for the victims released a statement saying that under the agreement, Boeing admitted \"that the 737 Max had an unsafe condition, and that it will not attempt to blame anyone else\" for the crash.\n\"This is a significant milestone for the families in their pursuit of justice against Boeing, as it will ensure they are all treated equitably and eligible to recover full damages under Illinois law, while creating a pathway for them to proceed to a final resolution, whether through settlements or trial,\" the lawyers said.\nIn January, Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice, including $2.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 Max crashes, including the Lion Air crash in October 2018."

And it's not matched by action.\"\nAs one participant explained it, the first week of COP26 was all sugar rush, the second will be about sobering up and getting down to business. \nNext week will see ministers fly in from around the world to tackle the tricky issues that negotiators themselves can't resolve. \nThese will encompass a range of technical issues relating to the Paris agreement that have been outstanding for a number of years, including the rules on how carbon markets work, on the need for transparent reporting, and for common time frames on emission cutting plans. \nSome progress has been reported, but there are still wide gaps between the parties across these questions.\nAs deadlines loom, negotiators are getting nervous.\n\"It is tense right now, people are having to take tough decisions, as they should,\" said Archie Young, the UK's lead negotiator in the talks. \n\"I think it is really important that we recognise the hard work that goes into the importance of some of that technical work.\"\nThere will also be detailed and tough discussions around finance, around the question of adaptation, and loss and damage. \nThere is likely to be a real standoff over the question of how cash for climate change is spent. \nDespite repeated calls from developing countries for a larger share of the finance to be used to help them to adapt to higher temperatures, the focus according to observers is still on using the money to help them cut emissions. \nThe cold reality is that investors are more willing to put their money into renewable energy projects where a profit can be made than they are to spend it on sea walls or other adaptive measures that do not guarantee a return.\n\"Rich countries publicly claim they care about adaptation but inside the talks most of the money goes on emission reductions and they undermine efforts to prioritise the adaptation needs of vulnerable nations,\" said Mohamed Adow, from the Power Shift Africa organisation, an observer at these talks. \nThe failure of the richer nations to fulfil their promise of $100bn by 2020 has undoubtedly damaged trust, there is work underway to put in place a new, more substantial payment from 2025. \nWhile the new figure is unlikely to be agreed here, the prospect of a very significant increase could go some way towards ensuring that finance doesn't derail these talks completely.\nFor the UK though the really big question is how to construct a final document that will be agreed collectively by the conference that will keep the 1.5C temperature threshold within reach. \nUK negotiators are taking soundings on what's termed a \"cover decision\", a package of measures that will try to close the gap between what the world's commitments add up to and the 1.5C bar. \nThe key element of that package will be an attempt to get countries to update and improve their carbon cutting plans more regularly than every five years as is presently the case. \nThe most vulnerable want an annual update. There's also a push for countries to come back with new plans in two years time.\nThere is likely to be strong opposition from larger, developing economies. But there is a belief that steps will be agreed.\n\"You clearly want some processes agreed here that give us hope that countries are going to come back and sharpen their pencils and put more ambition on the table,\" said Alden Meyer, a long time participant in climate talks from the E3G think tank.\n\"I think if we get the atmospherics, right and the UK uses the ministers well, by the end of next week, we can get substantial movement.\"\n\"It will offer some hope that over the next couple of years, we can start to really close that gap.\"\nMatt McGrath has been covering climate change for the past 15 years, reporting from 10 COPs along the way.

      "text": "Boris Johnson has hit back at sleaze allegations, insisting the UK is not \"remotely a corrupt country\".\nThe prime minister said MPs faced \"tough\" scrutiny - and those who broke the rules should be punished.\nHe was speaking to the world's media at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\nIt comes amid controversy over Conservative MPs with second jobs - and an investigation into Sir Geoffrey Cox doing paid outside work in his House of Commons office.\nThis, as well as paid lobbying - attempting to influence government policy in return for money - is banned under MPs' rules.\nAsked if he had a message to voters concerned by headlines about the return of Tory sleaze, Mr Johnson said: \"I genuinely believe that the UK is not remotely a corrupt country and I genuinely think that our institutions are not corrupt.\n\"We have a very, very tough system of parliamentary democracy and scrutiny, not least by the media.\n\"I think what you have got is cases where, sadly, MPs have broken the rules in the past, may be guilty of breaking the rules today. What I want to see is them facing appropriate sanctions.\"\nBut he added that MPs had been allowed to do other jobs, such as lawyers and doctors, for \"hundreds of years\", and \"on the whole\" this had strengthened British democracy by giving them \"some experience of the world\".\nAn awkward truth for Downing Street is that even though it's the behaviour of just a few dozen MPs that's being called into question, most of them are Conservatives, which is a fact they cannot avoid.\nThe prime minister's own handling of what's happening and his own attitude to the rules has infuriated many of his own colleagues, and that feeling has not gone.\nBy mentioning the allegations of corruption laid at the government's door, Boris Johnson has perhaps reinforced the criticism from the opposition, even if, by international standards, it is important to say the UK is nowhere near the top of the list.\nRead more from Laura \nSir Geoffrey, 61, the MP for Torridge and West Devon since 2005, is facing questions after video footage emerged of him carrying out paid legal work from what appears to be his Commons office.\nThe former attorney-general, who continues to practise as a barrister alongside being an MP, was participating in a virtual hearing for an inquiry into alleged corruption in the British Virgin Islands.\nMPs are allowed to have second jobs but their code of conduct says they cannot use public resources, including parliamentary offices, for \"personal or financial benefit\". Sir Geoffrey denies any wrongdoing.\nLast month, Tory MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken rules by lobbying the government on behalf of companies who were paying him - and for using his Commons office for business meetings, which is prohibited. He resigned from Parliament last week.\nMr Paterson has denied breaking the Commons lobbying rules, and says an investigation into his conduct by Parliament's standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, was conducted unfairly.\nLast week the government blocked a proposal to suspend him for 30 days, instead suggesting that the whole system for investigating MPs should be reviewed. \nBut ministers U-turned the next day, amid a furious backlash from opposition MPs and some Tories.\nOn Wednesday, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said the controversy had been a \"dark day\" for Parliament - and urged MPs from different parties to help \"move Parliament to a better place\". \nMr Johnson has been repeatedly asked if he will apologise for his botched attempt to rewrite the rules last week, but has declined to do so.\nOn Wednesday, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said his failure to say sorry \"proves that he doesn't care about tackling the corruption that has engulfed Downing Street, his government and the Conservative Party\".\n\"Instead of taking responsibility, the prime minister is taking the mickey out of the British people and won't clean up his mess.\"\nMr Johnson has himself been found to have broken MPs' standards rules on several occasions. \nIn 2019, he was judged to have failed to declare a financial interest in a Somerset property in time. \nIt followed a similar finding in 2018, when he was ordered to apologise over the late declaration of \u00a352,000 in book royalty payments. \nThe code of conduct prohibits:\nMPs must also declare:"

      "text": "The first Nasa mission since 1972 to put humans on the Moon's surface has been pushed back by one year to 2025.\nFew observers expected Nasa to make the previous 2024 date, because of a funding shortfall and a lawsuit over the landing vehicle.\nBut the space agency's chief Bill Nelson confirmed the delay in a press conference on Tuesday.\nUnder its Artemis programme, Nasa will send the first woman and the 13th man to the lunar surface.\nA US federal judge recently upheld a decision by the agency to award the contract to build a lunar landing vehicle for this mission to Elon Musk's company SpaceX.\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos had contested the decision, in part because he said the contract was supposed to have been awarded to more than one bidder. However, a funding shortfall from Congress meant this wasn't possible, according to a rationale published by Nasa at the time of the contract announcement.\nMr Nelson partially blamed the landing mission's delay on the lawsuit.\n\"Returning to the Moon as quickly and safely as possible is an agency priority. However, with the recent lawsuit and other factors, the first human landing under Artemis is likely no earlier than 2025,\" he said.\nHowever, commentators had been saying since last year that the lander cash problem alone made the 2024 date untenable.\nMr Bezos' firm Blue Origin had partnered with three other aerospace companies to vie for the prestigious lander contract.\nThe judgment last week means that a version of SpaceX's Starship - currently undergoing testing at a site in southern Texas - will be the vehicle used to carry people down to the lunar surface on that mission.\nThe first mission under the Artemis programme is set to fly in February next year. Nasa will launch the Orion spacecraft on the powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rocket without people aboard.\nDuring this mission, Orion will fly around the Moon on a voyage lasting three weeks in order to test its systems.\nThe first flight with astronauts - Artemis-2 - will now follow in 2024, Mr Nelson said. It will also fly around the Moon.\nArtemis-3 will be the first mission to return to the surface of the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. It is set to land at the lunar south pole, which is thought to hold vast stores of water-ice in craters that never see sunlight.\nThe ice in these craters could be used to make rocket fuel on the Moon, bringing down the cost of lunar exploration because it would not need to be shipped from Earth.\nThe programme will also see the first person of colour land on the Moon, though it is unclear whether this will happen during Artemis-3 or a later mission.\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "text": "Cocktail sales have soared in comparison with traditional ales as more young people venture out post-lockdown, says Wetherspoons.\nIn the 15 weeks to 7 November, sales of drinks such as mojitos and cosmopolitans were up 45% on the year before, along with vodka and rum.\nDraught products have suffered, however, with sales of ale down by 30%.\nThe pub chain's chairman said that its older customers had been visiting less frequently.\nUnder coronavirus-related restrictions, the Wetherspoons chain saw its pubs shut for 19 weeks.\nTim Martin, founder and chairman of Wetherspoons, said that some customers had been \"understandably cautious\" as lockdown measures eased.\n\"Improvement in trade will therefore depend, to some extent, on the outlook for the Covid-19 virus,\" he added.\nHe also said that he hoped booster vaccinations and better weather in the spring would improve sales.\nOverall, like-for-like sales - which strip out the effect of new pubs opening - were 8.9% lower for the first 15 weeks of the financial year than the record sales it saw in 2019.\nBar sales dipped by 9.6%, with the chain saying that its Lloyds pubs, which offer music, had performed a bit better at weekends, \"probably reflecting a higher percentage of younger customers\".\nLaura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that a \"permanent\" shift in favour of younger pubgoers could be bad news.\nThe more cautious attitude seen among older customers \"should wane as the pandemic comes under control, but there's no telling how long that will take\", she said.\nFood volumes also appear to have been affected by some customers working from home, Wetherspoons added. Breakfasts were down by 22%, for example. Coffee was also a less popular item on the menu.\nTrade in airports was still continuing to suffer, it said.\nThe firm recently reported a record annual loss of \u00a3154.7m as sales fell sharply in the year to 25 July.\nCertain city centres such as Liverpool, Newcastle, Oxford and Chester had seen pubgoers return more recently, it said on Wednesday. In central London, though, sales are still down by 17.4%.\nAs Covid curbs have eased, the firm has been looking to fill vacancies for pub staff and managers and make the most of the economic recovery.\nIt acknowledged that the hospitality industry had been affected by labour shortages.\n\"Wetherspoon had some isolated difficulties in staycation areas in the summer and during the 'pingdemic'\", it said.\nBut it said that overall, there had been a reasonable number of applications.\nThe number of employees has increased from 36,987 when pubs reopened in April to 42,240.\nLike many hospitality firms, it has also been hit by supply chain issues such as driver shortages, which have been exacerbated by both the pandemic and Brexit.\nIn September, Wetherspoons said some of its pubs had run out of some beer brands, including Heineken and Carling, because brewers had been affected by the shortage of HGV drivers.\nOn Wednesday, it admitted that it had seen \"some problems from time to time\", but shortages had only affected a \"minority of products\".\nProblems have eased in recent weeks, according to the pub chain, although the key festive trading period is still yet to come."

      "tags": "Medical research,Vaccination,James Gallagher,Coronavirus pandemic,Immune system",
      "text": "Understanding how some people naturally resist Covid infection, despite clearly being exposed to the virus, could lead to better vaccines, say researchers. \nA team at University College London said some people had a degree of Covid-immunity before the pandemic started.\nThis likely came from the body learning how to fight viruses that are related to the one which has swept the world. \nUpgrading vaccines to copy this protection, could make the jabs even more effective, the team said. \nThe scientists were closely monitoring hospital staff during the first wave of the pandemic - including by taking regular blood samples. \nDespite being in a high-risk environment, not everyone in the study came down with Covid. The results, published in the journal Nature, showed some people just managed to avoid the virus.\nBut around one-in-10 had signs of being exposed, but never had symptoms, never tested positive and never developed Covid-fighting antibodies in their blood. \nPart of their immune system was able to get on top of the virus before it managed to take hold - what's known as an \"abortive infection\".\nBlood samples showed these people already had (as in before the pandemic) protective T-cells, which recognise and kill cells infected with Covid. \nDr Leo Swadling, one of the researchers, said their immune systems were already \"poised\" to fight the new disease. \nThese T-cells were able to spot a different part of the virus than the bit most of the current vaccines train the immune system to find. \nVaccines are largely aimed at the spike protein, which covers the outer surface of the Covid virus. However, these rare T-cells were able to look inside the virus and find the proteins that are necessary for it to replicate. \n\"The healthcare workers that were able to control the virus before it was detectable were more likely to have these T-cells that recognise the internal machinery before the start of the pandemic,\" Dr Swadling added. \nThese internal proteins are very similar in all related species of coronavirus, including the ones that are widespread and cause common cold symptoms. \nIt means targeting these proteins with a vaccine could give some protection against all coronaviruses and new Covid variants. \nThe team said the current vaccines were doing an excellent job of preventing people from becoming severely ill, but were not as good at stopping them catching Covid.\nProf Mala Maini told me: \"I think we could all see that they could do better.\n\"What we're hoping, by including these T-cells, is that they might be able to protect against infection as well as disease, and we hope they would be better at recognising new variants that arise.\"\nWhile nearly everyone will have caught these common cold coronaviruses, not everyone will have developed the right kind of protective T-cells. It may be that healthcare workers are more regularly exposed to the viruses through their work and that is why some of them had protection. \nDr Alexander Edwards, from the University of Reading, said: \"Insights from this study could be critical in the design of a different type of vaccine. \n\"Hopefully this study will lead to further advances in vaccine development, as we need all the types of vaccine we can get.\"\nFollow James on Twitter"

      "tags": "Companies,Retailing,Halfords,Marks & Spencer,Coronavirus pandemic",
      "text": "Marks and Spencer reported a surge in profits as its food division helped it bounce back after Covid restrictions.\nBoss Steve Rowe said growth was boosted by pent-up demand after lockdown, but the retailer was also seeing the benefit of its long restructuring.\nPre-tax profits for the six months to October were \u00a3187m - 17.9% up on the period two years ago before Covid hit.\nBut M&S said it was planning for \"significant\" increases in supply chain costs because of worker shortages.\nThe retailer also forecast costs will rise during the rest of the financial year and be \"steeper again\" in 2022-23.\nDuring the six months, food sales increased by 10.4%, while overall sales in clothing and home fell by 1%, but full-price sales rose 17.3%.\nMr Rowe said that \"for the first time we can see that the hard yards of driving long-term change are beginning to be borne out in our performance\".\nDespite the strong results, Mr Rowe said that \"given the history of M&S\", the company wouldn't \"overclaim our progress\".\nOn the back of the firm's half-year results, M&S shares were up 20% on Wednesday morning, despite the warnings over driver and warehouse worker shortages.\nLike many other companies, M&S said lorry driver shortages were posing challenges, but added it had deployed several recruitment projects and incentives to attract new drivers and that it believed its food business was \"comparatively well placed\" to deal with the shortages. \nThe department store added it hoped to drive \"long-term growth and loyalty\" by offering a better service and quality through its food delivery deal with Ocado.\nM&S owns a 50% share of Ocado's retail business, which switched to delivering M&S food in September 2020.\nCommenting on the latest results, Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said M&S's move to raise its full-year profit forecast to about \u00a3500m showed \"how lucrative the food arm of the business has become\".\n\"Marks and Spencer may have been late to the grocery e-commerce party, but arriving with Ocado in arm, it's muscled into a prime spot on the dance floor, and is enjoying the hits\", she said.\n\"It looks like this long suffering high street stalwart has turned a sharp corner, proof that management's transformation strategy is paying off. Rather than a department store which sells food as an extra, Marks is metamorphosing into a grocery powerhouse which sells clothes and homewear as add-ons.\"\nJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, agreed M&S's food business continued to be the company's \"cash cow\", but warned the company would need to hold on to its transformed brand and soften the impact of supply chain issues to if it \"hopes to avoid disappointing investors this festive period\".\nMeanwhile, Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said Marks & Spencer \"was one of many companies where the pandemic forced accelerated change and the results are beginning to bear fruit\".\n\"Perhaps most noticeable is that the slumbering giant which was the clothing and home business is showing signs of renewed life,\" he said.\n\"Previously seen as tired and dowdy, the general offering has been reinvigorated and the signs to date are promising.\"\n\"It's quite nice to be making some money again,\" quipped Archie Norman, the chairman of M&S, on its glossy results presentation video.  \nThis retailer has been through umpteen turnaround plans, but is this latest one, started four years ago, finally starting to yield results? \nThese figures certainly show encouraging signs, with a bounce back in sales from the worst of the pandemic last year. \nThe business has also emerged in better shape. Food is driving sales and profits, but full-price clothing sales are also up 17%, delivering higher profits in this division, too. \nAnd online sales have increased by 60% compared with two years ago. M&S now needs to deliver Christmas amid all the operational challenges this crucial trading period will bring. \nThere are plenty of supply chain issues and cost pressures bearing down on all retailers.  But after years of false dawns, this is a business that now feels confident that it is on the right track. \nElsewhere, Halfords said sales rose by 19.2% compared with two years ago, \"despite the known supply chain disruption\".\nGraham Stapleton, chief executive, said demand for bicycles remained \"good\", adding the company was \"pleased\" with the current availability of children's bicycles and electric bikes in the run-up to Christmas.\nHowever, Mr Stapleton said \"moving anything\" around the world in the past six months had been \"particularly challenging\", with freight costs sometimes as high as 10 times the normal rate.\n\"Even if goods are manufactured and a container is found to ship them to the UK, the recent HGV driver shortage has meant that this final leg of the supply chain has been more costly and unreliable,\" he said."
